PREFACE


Anthropology and the Humanitieson verbal grounds one might suppose
them coextensive yet in practice they divide the domain of human
culture between them The types of human culture are in fact
reducible to two a simpler and a more complex or as we are wont to
say valuing our own achievements I doubt not rightly a lower and a
higher By established convention Anthropology occupies itself solely
with culture of the simpler or lower kind The Humanities on the other
handthose humanizing studies that for us at all events have their
parent source in the literatures of Greece and Romeconcentrate on
whatever is most constitutive and characteristic of the higher life of
society

What then of phenomena of transition Are they to be suffered to
form a nomansland a buffertract left purposely undeveloped
lest forsooth the associates of barbarism should fall foul of the
friends of civilization Plainly in the cause of science a pacific
penetration must be tolerated nay encouraged from both sides at
once Anthropology must cast forwards the Humanities cast back And
there is not the slightest reason unless prejudice be accounted
reason why conflict should arise between the interests thus led to
intermingle

Indeed how can there be conflict when as in the case of each
contributor to the present volume the two interests in question
Anthropology on this side and Classical Archaeology and Scholarship
on that are the joint concern of one and the same man Dr Evans
both is a leading authority on prehistoric Europe and likewise by
restoring the Minoan age to the light of day has set Greek history
in a new and juster perspective Dr Lang is an anthropologist of
renown and no one even amongst his peers has enriched the science
with so many original and fertile hypotheses nevertheless he has found
time and for how much else has he found time as well not only to
translate Homer but also to vindicate his very existence Professor
Murray can turn his rare faculty of sympathetic insight now to the
reinterpretation of the music of Euripides and now to the analysis of
the elemental forces that combine and crystallize in the Greek epic
Principal Jevons is famous for his brilliant suggestions in regard
to the early history of religion but he has also laboured in the
cause of European archaeology and his edition of Plutarchs Romane
Questions is very precious to the student of classical antiquities
Professor Myres whilst he teaches Greek language and literature as the
modern man would have them taught and is a learned archaeologist to
boot yet can have no greater title to our respect than that of many
devoted helpers he did the most to organize an effective school of
Anthropology in the University of Oxford Finally Mr Warde Fowler
living embodiment as he is in the eyes of all his friends of the
Humaner Letters both is the historian of the GraecoRoman citystate
and can wield the comparative method so as to extort human meaning from
ancient Romes stately but somewhat soulless rites Unless then
dual personality of some dissociated and morbid type is to be
attributed to these distinguished men they can scarcely fail being
anthropologists and humanists at once to carry on nicely concerted
operations from both sides of their subject just as the clever
engineer can set to work on his tunnel from both sides of the mountain

It is but fair to add however that in the present case the first move
has been made from the anthropological side The six lectures composing
this volume were delivered during the Michaelmas Term of  at the
instance of the Committee for Anthropology which from the outset of
its career has kept steadily in view the need of inducing classical
scholars to study the lower culture as it bears upon the higher
Anthropology to be sure must often divert its attention to lines of
development branching off in many a direction from the track of advance
that leads past Athens and Rome For us however and consequently
for our science the latter remains the central and decisive path of
social evolution In short the general orientation of Anthropology it
would seem must always be towards the dawn of what Lecky so happily
describes as the European epoch of the human mind

Lastly a word may be said in explanation of the title chosen
Anthropology and the Classics is exactly suited to express that
conjunction of interests of which mention has already been madethe
conjunction so perfectly exemplified by the lifework of each
contributor to the volume But some myopic critic might contend that
however well fitted to indicate the scope of the work as a whole the
title hardly applies to this or that essay taken by itself It surely
matters little if this be so yet is it so Dr Evanss lecture is
introductory To gather impetus for our imaginative leap into the
classical period we start it is true from the caveman but have
already crossed the threshold in arriving at the Cretan Homer Hesiod
Herodotusthe claims of these to rank as classics are not likely to
be assailed There remain the Roman subjects magic and lustration In
what sense are they classical Now to use the language of biology
whereas Greek literature is congenital Roman literature is in large
part acquired Therefore it includes no songs before sunrise for
it the father of history cannot be born again Spirit no less than
form is an importation In particular the magicoreligious beliefs
of Latium have lost their hold on the imitator of Greece and the
Orient Yet primal nature will out and the Romans moreover were a
pious people who loved to dwell on their origines To appreciate the
greatest of Latin classics Virgilto glance no further afieldone
must at least have gained the right to greet him as fellowantiquary
For the rest these essays profess to be no more than vindemiatio
prima a first gleaning When the harvest has been fully gathered in
it will then be time to say in regard to the classics both of Greece
and of Rome how far the old lives on in the new how far what the
student in his haste is apt to label survival stands for a force
still tugging at the heartstrings of even the most sophisticated and
lordly heir of the ages

LECTURE I

THE EUROPEAN DIFFUSION OF PICTOGRAPHY
AND ITS BEARINGS ON THE ORIGIN OF SCRIPT


The idea formerly prevalent among classical scholars that before
the introduction of the Phoenician alphabet there was no developed
system of written communication in Ancient Greece has now fairly
broken down In itself such an assumption shows not only a curious lack
of imagination but a deliberate shutting of the eyes on the evidence
supplied by primitive races all over the world

Was it possible in view of these analogies to believe that a form of
early culture which reached the stage revealed to us by Schliemanns
discoveries at Mycenae was from the point of view of written
communication below that of the Red Indians To myself at least it
was clear that the apparent lacuna in our knowledge must eventually
be supplied It was with this instinctive assurance that I approached
the field of Cretan investigation and the results of the discoveries
in the source and seminary of the Mycenaean culture of Greece have now
placed the matter beyond the range of controversy The clay archives
found in the Palace of Knossos and elsewhere have proved that the
prehistoric Cretan had already a thousand years before the appearance
of the first written record of Classical Greece passed through every
stage in the evolution of a highly developed system of script

There is evidence of a simple pictographic stage and a
conventionalized hieroglyphic system growing out of it And there is
evidence in them of the evolution out of these earlier elements of a
singularly advanced type of linear script of which two interrelated
forms are known

A detailed account of these fully equipped forms of writing that thus
arose in the Minoan world will be given elsewhere For the moment I
would rather have you regard these firstfruits of literary produce in
European soil in their relation to the tree of very ancient growth and
of spreading roots and branches that thus in the fullness of time put
them forth I refer to the primitive picture and signwriting that was
diffused throughout the European area and the bordering Mediterranean
region from immemorial antiquity

In attempting a general survey of the various provincesif we may
use the wordin which the remains of this ancient pictography are
distributed it is necessary in the first instance to direct attention
to one so remote in time and circumstances that it may almost be
legitimately regarded as belonging to an older world

I refer to the remarkable evidence of the employment of pictographic
figures and signs and even of some so worn by use that they can
only be described as alphabetiform among the wallpaintings and
engravings of the Reindeer Periodto use the term in its widest
general signification

The whole cycle of designs by the cavedwellers of the late
Palaeolithic periods may to a very large extent be described as
picturewriting in the more general sense of the word The drawings
and carvings of reindeer and bisons or more dangerous animals such as
the mammoth the cave bear and lion doubtless commemorated personal
experiences In one case at any rate the naked man stalking an
aurochs engraved on a reindeer horn we have an actual record of the
chase

Illustration FIG  Stalking Aurochs

But over and above this more elaborate kind of picture story the mass
of new materialsdue in a principal degree to the patient researches
of Messieurs Cartailhac Capitan the Abb Breuil and the late M
Piettehave thrown quite a new light on the development of pictography
among the late Palaeolithic peoples Such a series of polychrome
wallpaintings as have been discovered in the great Cave of Altamira
near Santander in Spainparalleled by those found in the Grotte
de Marsoulas and elsewhere on the French side of the Pyrenees with
their brilliant colouring and chiaroscuro present this primaeval art
under quite new aspects Moreover the superposition of one painting or
engraving over another on the walls of the caverns has supplied fresh
and valuable evidence as to the succession of the various phases
of this parietal art We have to deal with almost inexhaustible
palimpsests

What is of special interest however in the present connexion is
that side by side with the larger or more complete representations
there appear in the lowest layer of these rock palimpsests
abbreviated figures and linear signs which already at times present a
truly alphabetiform character

Here we have the evidence of a gradual advance from simpler to more
elaborate forms On the other hand the converse process the
gradual degeneration of more pictorial forms into their shorthand
linearized equivalents can often be traced in the series of these
representations The Abb Breuil for instance has recently published
a series of tables showing the progressive degeneration and stylization
of the heads of horses goats deer and oxen Without subscribing
to his views in all their details it is evident that this derivative
series as a whole can be clearly made out The abbreviation of the
oxheads in Fig  is fairly clear up to No  though whether the
further procession is to be traced in the spiraliform signs that follow
may be more open to doubt It is worth noting that a curious parallel
to these very ancient examples of the degeneration of the oxs head
is to be found among the Cretan and Cypriote signs of the Minoan and
Mycenaean Age

Illustration FIG 

But the course followed by evolution of figured representations during
the Reindeer Period leads to another result which also has parallels
in the history of later art but which does not seem to be so generally
recognized The degeneration illustrated by Fig  of more or less
complete figures into mere linear reminiscences is very familiar
to us It is well illustrated for instance in the relation of the
demotic and hieratic Egyptian signs to the hieroglyphic But what is
sometimes forgotten is that the simple linear forms are sometimes the
older and that even as I think can be shown in the case of some of
the Egyptian hieroglyphs the linearization of the pictorial form was
merely a going back to what had really been the original form of the
figure I have also been struck with the same phenomenon in tracing
the genesis of some of the hieroglyphic characters of Minoan Crete We
have only to look at the rude attempts of children to depict objects to
see that simple linear forms of what may perhaps be called the slate
pencil style precedes the more elaborate stage of drawing Art begins
with skeletons and it is only a gradual proficiency that clothes them
with flesh and blood

Illustration FIG 

So it seems to have been with the Reindeer men It has already been
noticed that the stratigraphy of the paintings and engravings on the
Cairoan walls as investigated by the Abb Breuil shows that those of
the earliest phase were line sketches of the simplest kind They
are just such as a child might draw They seem often to have been left
incomplete from mere laziness just so much of the figure being given
as to enable its identification No  for instance in the table
given in Fig  is a mere outline of the front of a mammoths head
even the tusks and eye being omitted No  shows only a little more
of a bisons head The eye at the beginning of the table seems to be
human and may be the ideograph of the individual who drew it Besides
these recognizable sketches there are other linear representations of
the slightest kind but which there can be little doubt conveyed a
definite meaning to those who drew them Of these a certain number
moreover are purely alphabetiform in character There is an X an L a
T upside down and they have learned to dot their is

It is strange indeed that in the very infancy of its art mankind
should have produced the elemental figures which the most perfected
alphabetic systems have simply repeated The elements of advanced
writing were indeed there but the time had not yet come when their
real value could be recognized It has only been after the lapse of
whole aeons of time through the gradual decay and conventionalization
of a much more elaborate pictography that civilized mankind reverted
to these beggarly elements and literature was born Yet it is
well to remember that the preexistence of this old family of linear
figures and their survival or rebirth the world over as simple
signs and marks were always thus at hand to exercise a formative
influence There may well have been a tendency for the decayed elements
of pictographic or hieroglyphic writing to assimilate themselves with
such standard linear types

It is certain that groups of singularly alphabetiform figures appear at
times associated with the handiwork of the Reindeer Period A good
example of such a group is seen on the flank of a bison painted in red
and black on a wall of the Marsoulas Cave Fig  Another curious
group shows examples of the constantly recurring pectiform or
combshaped figure Others have been taken to represent the roof of
some kind of hut The only human sign is an open hand which may be
regarded as identical with the prototype of the Phoenician kaph the
palus signour k In its pictographic form it is found among the
Cretan hieroglyphs and a linearized version identical with kaph
recurs among the Minoan linear characters

In Fig  are collected some specimens of signs or symbolic figures
from the Cave of Castillo on the Spanish side of the Pyrenees showing
amongst others the hand and some figures which may represent hats
A remarkable group of three alphabetiform signs occurs on a fragment
of reindeerhorn discovered by M Piette in the Cave of Gourdan
One of these shows a great resemblance to an A or Aleph A harpoon of
reindeerhorn again from La Madeleine shows a group of eight
linear signs among which we may detect however several repetitions

In the face of these and similar examples are we to conclude with the
late M Piette that there was a regular alphabetic script during the
Pleistocene period which in turn had been preceded by a hieroglyphic
system


Illustration FIG 

Illustration FIG 

The artistic achievements of the men of the Reindeer Period attained
such a high level that even such a conclusion could hardly excite
surprise In their portrayal of animal formsin their power of seizing
the characteristic attitude of the creature representedthey show
themselves on a level with those later Minoan artists of prehistoric
Crete and Greece who produced such masterpieces as the wild goat and
kids or the bullhunt on the Vaphio Cups We now know that the Minoan
race had also a highly developed form of linear script Might not their
remote predecessors on European soil have evolved the same

Illustration FIG 

That they had sufficient intellectual capacity to evolve a system of
writing can hardly be doubted There were no doubt some inferior
elements among the population of the Reindeer Period It is possible
that certain low cranial types of the Neanderthal class may have
survived till late Pleistocene times and the stratified remains for
instance of the Grotte des Enfants at Grimaldi near Mentone show
that its occupation by scions of a fine protoEuropean raceakin
to the men of CroMagnonalternated during a certain time with
occupation by a race of negroid intruders presenting characteristics as
low as those of the Australian black men But the prevailing type
of skull associated with the interments in the Mentone Cavesthose
of men with upright jaw and finely cut nosestruck no less competent
an observer than Sir E Ray Lankester as exhibiting a perfection of
development and a cranial capacity worthy to be compared with those of
civilized Europeans of the present day

We must however still remember that whatever the intellectual
capacity of these archaic people they did not possess that heirloom
of the Ages the accumulated experience of the later races of mankind
Art indeed seems to have come to them by nature and they had other
germs of civilizationan incipient cult of the dead some taste
for personal ornament They were possessed of a variety of arms and
implements of stone and bone and other materials They could kindle
fire and even mitigate the darkness of their subterranean vaults with
primitive stone lamps They seem to have been skilful trappers and
had even learned to bridle the horse Yet many of the most simple
acquirements of primitive culture were still unknown to them They knew
neither the potters nor the weavers nor the husbandmans craft They
went mothernaked and their principal dwellings were the caves and
dens of the earth

This is emphatically not a people to be credited with an advanced form
of script It seems more probable that the groups of linear signs that
occur should rather be regarded as mnemonic symbols and the mere
isolated characters perhaps as individual marks Some it may be had
acquired a magical value A mnemonic series may be paralleled by the
wellknown example of a mnemonic song of an Ojibway medicineman in
which every sign suggests a whole order of ideas

It is noteworthy that among the more abbreviated representations
from the hands of the men of the Reindeer Period the human figure
is little brought into play though the eye and hand do occur In
general moreover we see little of the reaction of gesture language on
their pictorial records In a scene from the walls of the Cave of Les
Combarelles however a male figure is depicted with a hand raised
and the other held straight outevidently representing some expressive
utterance of gesture language Fig 

Another good instance of a gesture occurs among the strange anthropoid
figures with animal profiles which nevertheless Messieurs
Cartailhac and Breuil consider to represent human subjects masked or
travestied On the roof of the hall of the Altamira Cave is one of
these quasihuman subjects with the arms raised with open palms in
front of its head an attitude on which its discoverers justly remark
It is impossible to overlook the analogy of this gesture with that
which throughout all antiquity and amongst nearly all peoples indicates
supplication or prayer As a sign of adoration it has given rise to
the Egyptian hieroglyphic Ka

Illustration FIG 

Had the men of the Reindeer Period a fully developed speech in addition
to this gesture language That they had the elements of such of
course stands to reason Mere animal cries and what may be called
voice signs might have carried them far nor would it be possible to
say at what point the transition from such primitive methods of oral
communication to what might legitimately be called articulate speech
was overpassed

But there are at least some weighty reasons for doubting whether this
higher stage was really attained by Palaeolithic man In North America
which like other parts of that continent seems to have received
its first human settlers at a comparatively late geological date a
considerable amount of physical conformity is perceptible among the
Red Indian tribes But we are confronted by the significant fact that
this racial unity is nevertheless compatible with the existence of a
multiplicity of native tongues It has been observed that the number
of known stocks or families of Indian languages in the United States
amounts to over three score differing among themselves as radically
as each differs from Hebrew Chinese or English In each of these
linguistic families again there are severalsometimes as many as
twentyseparate languages which differ again from each other as much
as do the various divisions of the Aryan group

But if the original forefathers of these tribes had brought with them a
fully developed articulate speech is it conceivable that the languages
of their descendants should be so radically different This phenomenon
moreover is thrown into further relief by the fact that when we turn
to the signs and gestures current among the Red Indian tribes we find a
large common element

It may be that the very deficiencies in articulate speech which we may
justly assume to have existed during the Reindeer Period gave a spur to
other means of personal intercommunication Not only would the infancy
of speech promote the use of gestures but it may have powerfully
contributed towards diffusing the practice of making pictorial
records The possibility therefore does not seem to be excluded
that men drew before they talked

Nothing in itself is more baseless than the idea that oral language
is necessary for the expression of abstract ideas The case of
deafmutes who without the aid of speech can give expression to the
most complicated ideas affords an example of this in the midst of a
civilized society The study of gesturelanguage enables us to see how
easy and natural is the process by which the expression of abstract
ideas grows out of the imitation of concrete objects Take the very
word to grow An Indian expresses the notion of a tree by holding
the right hand before his body back forwards with the fingers spread
outthe fingers as it were representing branches and his wrist the
trunk to show that it is high he pushes it slightly upwards For grass
he holds his hand with the fingers upwards in the sense of blades near
the ground In order to express the general idea to grow he begins as
in the sign for grass but instead of keeping his hand near the ground
pushes it upward in an uninterrupted manner So too to express
falsehood he places his index and second fingers so that they separate
in front of his mouth in order to indicate a double tongue For truth
he places his index finger only in front to show if we may use the
expression that he is singletongued

Root elements of gesture language which as a means of communication
preceded the development of articulate language as opposed to
mere emotional cries seem themselves to be almost universal And
picturewritingthe sister mode of expressionhas also as we see
from the example of the American Continent even in some of its more
conventional developments an immeasurably wider currency than the
comparatively recent growths of oral communication In China amongst
a great variety of mutually unintelligible languages and dialects the
ideographic characters which are really conventionalized pictures and
independent of oral equivalents supply to a great extent the place
both of gesture and spoken language The Red Indian world as we have
seen is a Babel of disconnected languages but the old signlanguage
is the same and the picturelanguage of one tribe is generally
intelligible to another

The great uniformity of simple gestures in all countries of the world
is thus a cause predisposing to a considerable amount of uniformity
among the pictorial signs into which this element enters If we take
for instance that pathetic monument of picture writing the wellknown
rockpainting of the Tule River in California we see a series of
human figures with outstretched hands signifying in the American
gesturelanguage Nothing here Two outstretched arms by
themselves appear in the sense of negation among the conventionalized
Maya pictographs of Yucatan and the sign reappears in the
same abbreviated form and with the same meaning among Egyptian
hieroglyphs So too the ideograph of a child or sonan infant
sucking its thumbis found alike in ancient Egypt China and North
America

Gesture language in fact is constantly reacting on the pictographic
method of expression and may be said to supply it with moods and
tenses even without the aid of words

It must nevertheless be borne in mind that simple pictography
whether or not aided by gesture language is one thing The evolution
of a regular script is quite another matter

Illustration FIG 

A conventionalized system of writing can only be thought of in
connexion with a highly developed articulate speech And this was
certainly the achievement of a later world than that of these old
Palaeolithic hunters The physical condition now changes The
characteristic fauna of the Reindeer Period disappears and with it
the remarkable race to whom were due the first known products of high
art The close of the Pleistocene Age and the beginning of the New Era
is marked in France by a curious deposit in the Cave of Mas dAzil on
the left bank of the Arize in which its explorer M Piette found
a number of flat oblong pebbles marked with red stripes and simple
figures by means of peroxide of iron M Piette has endeavoured
to trace in some of these a definite system of numeration by means
of lines and circles and even particular signs for a thousand ten
thousand and a million That some of these represent simple numerical
markings is possible but beyond this point it is impossible to follow
M Piette Among the other markings are several sometimes repeated
on the same pebble of curiously alphabetiform aspect Among these
are signs resembling our E F and L a Gothic M the Greek Theta
Gamma Epsilon Xi and Sigma the Phoenician Cheth and some
terms that occur in the Minoan and Cypriote series

The occurrence of this series of geometrical marks must be regarded as
another proof of how early such alphabetic prototypes originated The
Mas dAzil series has no particular connexion with the linear signs
associated with the handiwork of the Reindeer Period Their meaning is
obscure Some may be degraded pictographs often perhaps of animals
or their parts with a traditional meaning attached to them Some may
be of purely individual and arbitrary invention The numbers on the
pebbles have suggested the view that they may have served for games
On the other hand it is by no means improbable that the figures had a
magic value and Mr A B Cook has called attention to the parallel
presented by the Australian deposits of pebbles called Churingas
connected with the departed spirits of a tribe and having designs of
a totemic character It is certain that the people who produced these
coloured pebbles were in a rude state of barbarism far below the gifted
race who had preceded them in the same sheltering cavern Few will
probably be able to follow M Piette in discerning in these rudely
executed marks actual lettersat any rate with a syllabic valueand
the true ancestors of the Greek and Phoenician alphabets or in
regarding the Cave of Mas dAzil as one vast school where the scholars
learnt to read to reckon to write and to know the religious symbols
of the solar god

The deposit of Mas dAzil containing the coloured pebbles belongs
already to the modern world the fauna associated with it all belonging
to existing species inhabiting the temperate regions The rude culture
then exhibited heralds the beginning of the Neolithic Period This
later Stone Age is not characterized by any of the artistic genius
displayed by the men of the Reindeer Period Figured representations
are now rare The caves moreover which preserved the earlier records
were now used more for sepulture than habitation Yet the analogy of
all primitive races at the present day shows that it would be a mistake
to suppose that though the act may have been rude the practice of
picturewriting was not still universally in vogue throughout the
European area We have to bear in mind how many of such records are
consigned to perishable materialssuch as bark or hides or in the
case of tattooing the human body itself

During the later prehistoric times and notably during the Early Metal
Age many abiding records in the shape of rocksculptures paintings
and engravings and at times graffiti on pottery are found diffused
throughout the whole of our Continent and the adjoining Mediterranean
area and in outlying regions such as Lapland the practice of
picturewriting can be traced down to modern times

Though a large amount of isolated materials exists on this subject
the evidence so far as I am aware has never been put together in
a systematic manner Yet it seems possible that by means of a due
coordination of the materials and the application of the comparative
method the European area may eventually be divided into distinct zones
or provinces each characterized by its certain typical pictographic
feature Primitive lines of intercommunication may with great
probability be made out and evidences of early racial extension come
to light by this method of investigation

Illustration FIG 

It is interesting to observe that it is in the extreme north of Europe
where the conditions most approach those of the Reindeer Period
that purely pictographic methods have remained the longest The Lapp
troll drums used as a means of divination by the native shamans
show a variety of linear figures and symbols which had a traditional
interpretation Thus in the simple example given in Fig  taken from
Scheffers Lapponia we see in the upper compartment according
to the interpretation preserved by Scheffer four Lapp gods with rayed
heads one of them identified with the Norsk Thor above which are the
crescent moon twelve stars indicated by crossed lines and seven
flying birdsresembling the simplification of the same figures seen in
the Cretan linear script

On another base are three more sacred figures with rayed heads
signifying Christ and two apostles taken into the Lapp Pantheon at a
somewhat lower level The centre of this compartment is occupied by the
sun and about the field are depicted a reindeer wolf bear ox fox
squirrel and snake To the right are three wavy lines representing a
lake and exactly reproducing the Egyptian hieroglyph of water

Fig  shows a more elaborate example of which the interpretation
has not been supplied The variation of gesture displayed somewhat
rudely it is true by the various figures on this drum illustrates
the intimate and everrecurring connexion between pictography and
gesturelanguage

These Lapp troll drums must have been generally in use till the end
of the seventeenth century It was not indeed till the middle
of the succeeding century that Christianity took a real hold on
the population That there has been a considerable survival of
surreptitious heathenism among the Lapps I myself was able to
ascertain during two journeys undertaken with that object through
Finnish and Russian Lapland in  and again in  It was
specially interesting to observe that some of the traditional figures
seen on the old troll drums are still engraved on the reindeerhorn
spoons of that region

Illustration FIG 

Illustration FIG 

The troll drums of the Lapps find their analogy in those of the
kindred Samojed tribes to the East which present figures of the
same class But the pictographs on these will be found to fit on
to the rockcarvings or petroglyphs of Siberia first described by
Strahlenberg of which a specimen is given in Fig  Similar rock
carvings may be traced through a vast FinnoUgrian or Mongolian region
to the borders of China and the Chinese characters themselves must
have arisen from a branch of the same great Northern family

This FinnoTataric province of primitive pictography touches the
Atlantic in Northern Norway In the south of the Scandinavian
Peninsula we have numerous examples of picturewriting in the shape of
carving mainly belonging to the Bronze Age either on rocks or on
the slabs of sepulchral barrows Of the latter class are the wellknown
examples from the Cairn of Kivik on the east coast of Scania and the
rockcarvings extend through Southern Norway and Denmark The most
remarkable of all are probably those of Bohuslan of which an example
in which ships figure largely is shown in Fig

In our own islands there is also evidence during the Bronze Age of
the practice of engraving signs and pictographic figures on rocks and
the slabs of sepulchral cists and chambers Those found in England
and Scotland consist for the most part of mere geometrical figures
such as concentric circles with connecting lines the more elaborate
figures found in the Fife Caves for example certainly belonging to
the Late Celtic Period But in Ireland then raised by its abundant
output of gold to the position of a Western Eldorado the field of
primitive pictography is richer The slabs of the chambered tumuli
of SleivenaCalligha present groups of elaborate figures but a
special interest attaches to those discernible in the great chambered
barrow of New Grange As was pointed out by Mr Coffey one of the
principal figures here carved represents in a degraded form a ship with
its crew analogous to those so constantly repeated in the Scandinavian
group Fig  This coincidence becomes the more suggestive when we
recall the existence of a whole series of finds showing a connexion
between Ireland and Denmark and its neighbourlands during the
Bronze Age

These parallels extend to Brittany The rocks and sepulchral slabs of
the old Armoric region also present as is well known a considerable
pictographic material dating from Neolithic and Early Metal Ages
Among recently discovered remains of this class may be mentioned a
group of curious inscribed rocks near SaintAubin in Vende the
carvings on which seem to show some analogy with the menhirs of the
Aveyron the dolmens of the Gard and the caves of the Marne On
these besides conventionalized linear figures of men and animals
occur a variety of unexplained signs some of them of a remarkably
alphabetiform character

It is among the sculptured slabs of the Morbihan dolmens that we find
the immediate pendant to the ship signs of Ireland and Scandinavia
On slabs of the chambered barrow of Mann Lud near Locmariaker
there appearsbeside stone axes hafted and unhafted and other
figureswhat is evidently the same ship sign as that of New Grange in
various stages of degeneration finally resulting in simple crescents
with recurved ends Fig  It is true that the associations of
these Breton dolmens end with the close of the Neolithic period but
the archaeological evidence shows that this was overlapped by the Early
Metal Age of Ireland

Illustration FIG 

South of the Pyrenees similar records of primitive pictography
largely associated again in this case with the builders of dolmens
and chambered barrows extend through a large part of the Iberian
Peninsula Some stir was recently made by the reported discovery of
characters on the slabs and content of certain Portuguese dolmens
of TrazosMontes which were supposed to constitute a kind of
alphabet or syllabary The accounts of these discoveries however
lack scientific precision and though many of the characters found
are certainly of alphabetiform type there can be no doubt that
these together with the rude zoomorphic figures with which they are
associated belong to a much simpler stage of graphic expression

Illustration FIG 

In the south of Spain the chain of evidence is continued by the
Written Stones of Andalusia The signs here are often painted in red
in a rude manner on the slabs of megalithic structures such as the
Piedra Escrita near Fuencaliente Figs   The signs include
a variety of men and animals symbols of the heavenly bodies trees
arms and implements and other objects Amongst some curious analogies
that they present with the contemporary pictographs of Northern and
NorthWestern Europe may be noticed certain figures that resemble
linear degenerations of the Ship and Crew sign see Fig 

The Andalusian pictographs find their continuation beyond the straits
in another widely diffused group of Written Stones the Hadjrat
Mektoubat of the Arabs extending through Algeria and Morocco into
the Saharan region and along the Atlantic littoral to the Canaries

To return to the European shores of the Mediterranean a remarkable
group of prehistoric rockcarvings already known in mediaeval times as
the Maraviglie or Marivels is found near the Col di Tenda in the
Maritime Alpsin the neighbourhood that is of a very old line of
communication between Provence and the Po Valley The earliest known
groups of these figures lay at an elevation of between  and 
feet about the Laghi delle Maraviglie in the heart of Monte Bego
More recently a still more extensive series has been discovered by
Mr Clarence Bicknell cut like the others in the glaciated schist
rocks and at a similar lofty elevation in the neighbouring Val di
Fontanalba I have myself visited a more outlying group at Orco
Feglino in the Finalese only a few miles from the Ligurian coast

These figures of which examples are given in Figs  and 
represent oxen often engaged in ploughing and men in various
positions sometimes brandishing weapons and apparently signalling and
a variety of arms implements and other objects Among the weapons
the halberds and daggers are characteristic of the earlier part of the
Bronze Age and it is noteworthy that the sword which characterized
the later phase of that culture is entirely absent The figures of
the oxen ploughing are depicted as if seen from abovea circumstance
explained by the way in which these rock terraces look down on the
cultivated lands below Many of these oxen are conventionalized to
such an extent that they have rather the appearance of rude figures of
scorpions or beetles with tails

The same figures are often repeated in the schist slopes and we
have not here such connected groups as we see for instance on the
sculptured slabs of Scandinavia The picturesigns of the Maraviglie
had perhaps a votive intention It seems to me that some of the figures
may represent packs and that merchants as well as warriors and tillers
of the soil took part in their representations

The records of primitive pictography extend to the Vosges and Jura
and reappear east of the Adriatic In a fiord of the Bocche di
Cattaro not far from the site of Rhisinium the capital of the old
Illyrian kingdom my own explorations were rewarded by the discovery
of a curious group of painted signs on a rockface above a sacred
grotto and in a somewhat inaccessible position They consisted
mainly of animals and varieties of the swastika sign That they
were of preChristian date may be regarded as certain but a fuller
investigation of them at my own hands was cut short by force majeure

Up to the present the old pictography of the lands between the Adriatic
and the Black Sea and the lower Danubian basin is best illustrated
by the linear incised figures found on the primitive pottery of that
region The best collection of such signs is due to the researches of
Frulein Torma at Broos in Transylvania In view of the ethnic and
archaeological connexions which are shown to have existed between the
lower Danubian regions and the western part of Asia it is specially
interesting to note the analogies that these Transylvanian graffiti
present with those noted by Schliemann on the whorls and pottery of
Hissarlik Fig  Both groups moreover belong approximately
to the same epoch marked by the transition from the Neolithic to the
Early Metal Age

Illustration FIG 

Illustration FIG 

That many of these signs are linearistic degenerations of animal and
other figures is clear and such figures may be reasonably considered
to have an ideographic sense But from this to investing the marks on a
primitive whorl or pot with a definite phonetic value and proceeding
to read them off by the aid of the Cypriote syllabary of the Greek
language as it existed some two thousand years later can only be
described as a far cry Linearized signs of altogether alphabetic
appearance belong as already shown to the very beginnings of human
culture In the case of the whorls moreover many of the linear
figures are really repetitions of similar marks due to the decay of
a border patterna phenomenon already paralleled by some of the
engraved groups of the Reindeer Period A recurring decorative fragment
of this kind somewhat resembles according to the progressive stages
of its decadence the Cypriote go ti or rea circumstance
productive of readings by eminent scholars containing vain
repetitions of go go ti ti and re re

If we turn to Crete the source of the developed prePhoenician scripts
of Greece and the Aegean world we find evidence of the same primitive
stratum of linearized pictography But the true hieroglyphic script in
which the phonetic element is apparently already present in addition
to the ideographic displays other features which lie beyond the scope
of our present theme In the advanced linear scripts which grow out
of this and which certainly have a largely phonetic basis we mark a
regularity of arrangement and a definite setting forth of wordgroups
altogether different from the phenomena presented by the elemental
figures of primitive pictography The Phoenician and later Greek
alphabet carries us a step further

But the conventionalized pictography of Crete if it does not give us
the actual source of the later Phoenician letters at least supplies
the best illustration of the elements out of which it was evolved
And it will be seen from what has been already said that the more
primitive field of pictography out of which this conventionalized
Cretan system arose is itself only a branch of a widely diffused
European family of picturewriting of which the records can be traced
from Lapland to the Straits of Gibraltar and from the Atlantic to the
Aegean and which finds again its continuation on the African and the
Asiatic side

There seems to be a kind of hazy notion that though an elaborate system
of pictography may have been current among the American Indians for
example the alphabet or for that matter the Cretan script came
to Greece as a kind of gift of the gods and was taken over by a
population that had no graphic means of communication It is true that
the earlier records of such owing to their having been largely on
perishable materials such as bark or hides may in many cases be
irrecoverable But we may be sure that they existed throughout the
Aegean lands as elsewhere Nay it was because they not only existed
but had already reached a comparatively advanced stage that the
acceptation of such a highly developed system of writing as that of
the Phoenician alphabet was rendered possible Even the forms of the
letters must themselves have been largely familiar since as we have
seen the use of the linearized signs of the purest alphabetiform
character goes back to what in many respects must be regarded as
another world and to a time it may be when articulate language was
itself but imperfectly developed

LECTURE II

HOMER AND ANTHROPOLOGY


In B Rs Elizabethan translation of the two first books of Herodotus
a marginal note to a startling statement about Egyptian manners begs
us to Observe ye Beastly Devices of ye Heathen Though Anthropology
as its name indicates takes all that is human for its province it
certainly pays most attention to Ye Devicesbeastly or notof the
savage or barbarian and to their survival in civilized societies
ancient and modern Now as far as these primaeval devices go Homer
has wonderfully little to tell us Though he is by far the most ancient
Greek author extant it is in all the literature which follows after
him that we find most survivals of the barbarian and the savage
Even in the few fragments of the socalled Cyclic poets 
BC and in the sketches of the plots of the Cyclic poems
which have reached us there are survivals of barbaric customsfor
example of human sacrifice and the belief in phantasms of the dead
even when the dead have been properly burned and buriedwhich do not
appear in the Iliad and the Odyssey The tragedians the lyric
poets and the rest all allude to vices which Homer never mentionsto
amours of the gods in bestial forms in all probability a survival
of Totemism in myth to a revolting rite of sanguinary purification
from the guilt of homicide and to many other distressing vestiges of
savagery and barbarism in the society of ancient Greece We do not find
these things in the Iliad and the Odyssey

It is not easily conceivable that Homer was ignorant of any of these
things probably they existed in certain strata of society in his age
But he ignores them They are not to be mentioned to his audience
No incest or cannibalism in Iliad and Odyssey is reported
concerning Atreus line though later poets do not hesitate to
use the traditional materials from the fossiliferous strata of myth
wherein these survivals were plentiful Pindar knew tales of divine
cannibalism but merely referred to them as unworthy of his verse
Homer must have been familiar with the savage cosmogonic legends
almost identical with those of the Maori of New Zealand which Hesiod
does not scruple to state openly but about such things Homer is silent

Here I must explain that though to Homer early historic Greece
attributed the great body of ancient epic poetry I am speaking only
of the Iliad and Odyssey I wish I could keep clear of the complex
Homeric Question but this is hardly possible Everybody knows that
since the appearance of Wolfs famous Prolegomena to the Iliad at
the end of the eighteenth century the world has been of opposite
opinions as to the origin of the Iliad and Odyssey Poets and
almost all who read the poems as other literature is read for human
pleasure hold that at least the mass of these epics is by one hand
and of course is of one age On the other side the immense majority
of scholars and special students who have written on the subject
maintain with endless differences in points of detail that the
Iliad and Odyssey had their beginning in a brief early kernel
and are now a mosaic of added lays and interpolations contributed
by many hands in many places through at least four changeful
centuries of various cultures How the poems came to have what even
Wolf recognized as their unus color the harmony of their picture
of institutions customs rites costume and belief is variously
explained By some critics the harmony is denied They try to pick out
proofs of many various stages in institutions customs beliefs arms
and armour and so forth As a rule these critics however scholarly
have not been and are not comparative students of early literature
of anthropology archaeology and mythology Their microscopic research
finds but few and minute variations from the normal in such things as
burial brideprice houses armour and so forth If they studied
other early poetic literaturesay the Icelandic sagas and the oldest
Irish romancesthey would learn that minute variations in such matters
of life occur in every stage of civilization that every house every
funeral every detail of marriage laws and other laws is not precisely
on the pattern of every other and that mythology and ideas about the
future life are especially various and even selfcontradictory at any
given period For these reasons I agree with Wolf that harmony unus
color prevails in the Iliad and Odyssey which must therefore be
the product of one age

But to this some adverse critics reply that harmony indeed there may
be but that it results first from the influence of traditioneach
new poet adhered to the old formulae without conscious effortand
next that the later poets deliberately and learnedly archaized
consciously studied the descriptions and maintained the tone of their
predecessors while at the same time they as deliberately introduced
the novelties of their own time This is their logic Their double
theory is untenablefirst because it is selfcontradictory next
because in all known early art and literature the poet or painter
treating ancient themes dresses the past in the costume of the present
with which he is familiar To archaize is a very modern effort in art
as all early literature and every large picturegallery prove As for
unconscious adherence to tradition it leads to the repetition of epic
formulae and standing epithets but later poets and uncritical ages
when they describe a more ancient life always copy the life of their
own time We see too that late learned poets who archaizedApollonius
Rhodius Virgil even Quintus Smyrnaeuswhile they do their best to
imitate Homer cannot keep up the unus color but betray themselves
in a myriad details for example Virgil arms his Greeks and Trojans
with iron weapons and Apollonius introduces the ritual purification of
blood with blood ignored by Homer

Even in the Cyclic poems of which only a few fragments and prose
synopses remain Helbig and Monro and every reader find what Helbig
calls data absolutely opposed to the conventional style of the Epics
of the Iliad and Odyssey We find heroworship human sacrifice
gods making love in bestial forms conspicuous ghosts of men duly
burned and so on Now if we believe with Mr Verrall that Homer
so called was a nebulous mass of old poetry reduced into distinct
bodies such as Iliad Odyssey Cypria Aethiopis Little
Iliad Nostoi and so on for educational purposes by learned
Athenians about  BC or if we suppose with others
that the Ionians for educational purposes Bowdlerized Iliad and
Odyssey at an earlier date we ask Why were Iliad and Odyssey
expurgated why were many devices of the heathen cut out of them by
educationists who permitted these things to remain in the Cyclic
poems Was it because the Iliad and Odyssey alone were cut out
of the mass and selected for public recitation If so why was the
selection made and the expurgation done in these two cases only And
do we know that the Cyclics were not recited If so why not What
was the use of them Again why was Hesiod not Bowdlerized Hesiod
certainly entered into public knowledge no less than Homer Finally if
the taste of the seventh and sixth centuries were so pure and austere
why were the poets of the seventh and sixth centuries so rich in
matters which the Iliad and Odyssey omit In no Greek literature
of any age do we find the clean austerity of Homer for example as
regards sins against nature the permanent blot on the civilization of
historic Greece The theory of educational expurgation in the eighth to
the sixth centuries is impossible on all sides The Cyclics and Hesiod
were generally known yet were not expurgated into harmony with the
Homeric tone the contemporary poets of these educational ages did not
conform to the Homeric tone Moreover there is no record evidence
with Mr Verralls pardon for all this editing by educationists There
is no inscription bearing witness to itthat and that alone would
be recordthere is only a late and shifting tradition that about
the time between the ages of Solon and the Pisistratidae something
indefinite was done at Athens for Homer For how much of Homer For
all old epic poetry or only for the Iliad and Odyssey If for them
alone why for them alone

I am thus constrained to suppose that the Iliad and the Odyssey on
the whole are the fruit of a single age a peculiar age an age prior
to the earliest period of Greek life as historically known to us If it
be not so if these epics are mosaics of life in four or five centuries
of change compiled for purposes of education by learned Athenians
it seems that they are worthless to the anthropologist and to the
historical student of manners and institutions If the poems contain
scores of archaized passages in which the poets deliberately neglect
the life which they know while at the same time in other passages they
deliberately innovate then the poems are of no anthropological value
The statements of the critics are selfcontradictory which I still
think proves them to be illogical and in speaking of Homer I shall
treat him as a witness to a genuine stage of society in prehistoric
Greece and Asia

As to date the poems quite undeniably are derived from that late
stage of Mycenaean or Minoan civilization which has been revealed by
the excavations of Mr Arthur Evans in Crete and Dr Schliemann at
Mycenae and of many other explorers of Homeric sites The decoration
of the palaces of Alcinous and Menelaus the art of the goldsmith the
use of chariots in war the shape and size of the huge Homeric shield
the cuirass zoster and mitr of the warriors the weapons
of bronze described in Homer all correspond with objects discovered
or delineated in works of art of the late Minoan period in Greece and
Crete But Homeric customs of all sorts also vary much from the facts
of the Minoan archaeologist The monuments of the late Minoan Age
reveal modes of burial wholly unlike the Homeric practice of cremation
and interment of the bones in lofty tumuli or barrows They prove the
existence of sacrifice to the dead which Homer ignores They display
fashions of costume quite alien to the Homeric world They yield none
of the iron tools of peaceful purpose with which Homer is perfectly
familiar They furnish abundance of stone arrowheads which are never
mentioned in the Epics

The conclusion suggested is that Homer knew a people living on the
ancient Minoan sites and retaining much of the Minoan art much of
the military material but advanced into a peculiar form of the Early
Bronze Age clad in quite a new fashion practising another form of
burial entertaining other beliefs about death and the dead but still
retaining the flowing locks often represented in pictures of men in
Minoan art

The use of body armour too is in the Iliad and Odyssey universal
in regular war from the rarity of delineation thereof in Minoan art
this appears to be another innovation Homer is quite conscious that
he is singing of events gathered from legends of a time long before
his day a time with which he is in touch which has bequeathed much
to his age but which we see is in some respects less advanced
than and in many ways different from his own He attributes to the
old legendary heroes however the institutions with which he
is familiarinstitutions that are not those of any known period
of historic Greece They are no figments of fancy They closely
correspond as far as form of government is concerned with the
early feudalism described in the oldest Irish epical romances and
in the French chansons de geste of the eleventh to the thirteenth
century AD We find an Over Lord like the Celtic Ardrigh or the
Bretwalda in early England ruling over Princes Ri with an
acknowledged sway limited by unwritten conventions He holds as Mr
Freeman says of the Bretwalda an acknowledged though probably not
very well defined supremacy His rule is hereditary the sceptre is
handed down through the male line Zeus has given him the sceptre and
he confessedly rules like Charlemagne even in the later chansons de
geste by right divine He has the Zeusgiven sceptre and he has the
 a knowledge of a recognized body of principles and customs
which had grown up in practice Iliad ix 

The origin of the Over Lord as of all kingship may be traced
to a combination of sagacity courage and experience in war in
an individual and to his consequent acquirement of property and
influence plus the survival of the prestige of the medicine man to
whom the ruling supernormal Being of the tribe is supposed to speak
A very low example is the Dieri medicine man inspired by Kutchi an
elevated example is the Homeric Minos who converses with Zeus Even
the dream of Agamemnon is worthy of respect says Nestor because
he has seen it who boasts himself to be the best of the Achaeans
another mans dream might be disregarded Iliad ii  However
Agamemnon does not lay stress on such communications Calchas is the
regular interpreter of omens and the will of the gods A divinity doth
hedge Agamemnon though Achilles half draws his sword against him He
has the right to summon the whole host and to exact fines for absence
he has the lions share of all spoils of war he is war leader but
always consults his peers the paladins of Charlemagne From him much
that is not easily tolerable is endured but if he goes too far in his
arrogance a prince or peer has the recognized right like Achilles to
throw up his allegiance By due gifts of atonement of which the rules
are ceremonially minute Iliad xix  the Over Lord may place
himself within his right again and he who refuses the atonement is
recognized to be in his wrong The whole passage about the minutiae of
atonement in Iliad xix delays the action and is censured by critics
as late But it cannot be late it could only have been composed for
a noble audience keenly interested in the customary laws under which
they lived laws unknown to historic Greece We are accustomed to
similar prolixity and minuteness about points of law in the Icelandic
sagas

It has been said that Homer an Asiatic poet of the ninth century
BC lived imaginatively in say the thirteenth century BC as Mr
William Morris imaginatively lived in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries AD But Morris came after Sir Walter Scott who introduced
the imaginative archaeological reconstruction of past ages by poets and
artists Shakespeare did not live in any age but his own His Hamlet
fights with the Elizabethan long rapier not with short sword and axe
Homer too lives in his own subMinoan age and in that alone

The poets of this age of loose feudalism are always partial to the
princes rather than to the Over Lord The Irish romance writers much
prefer the chivalrous Diarmaid or Oscar to Fionn the Over Lord and
the later writers of chansons de geste in France utterly degrade
Charlemagne in favour of his paladins

Greek Irish or French the poets have a professional motive there
are many courts of princes wherein they may sing but only one court
of the Over Lord In this partisanship Homer is relatively moderate
his Agamemnon is perhaps the most subtle of all his portraits
unsympathetic as is the Over Lord his Zeusgiven supremacy always
wins for him respect The whole picture of Over Lord and princes is a
genuine historical document a thing of a single age of culture far
behind the condition of the Ionian colonists The princes themselves
owe their position to birth wealth and courage Except Aias and
Odysseus chiefs of rocky isles all own abundance of chariots They
are surrounded by a class of gentry the Irish Flaith who are also
fighters from chariots and stand out above the nameless members of the
host It is they Iliad ix  who promise to Meleager a demesne
out of the common land I conceive that such a  or demesne was
much more than a  or lot he was a very poor man who had no
lot Odyssey xi  Probably the gentry or  had their
gift of a  or demesne ratified in the popular assembly which
I think did no more than ratify their decisions

The gentry held rich fields very remote from any town Iliad
xxiii  Society was feudal or chivalrous not democratic It is
true as Mr Ridgeway says J H S vi  that we do not hear
of land in the lists of a mans possessions but of livestock gold
iron and chariots and arms On the other hand the gentry certainly
held rich fields remote from the cities

We have no clear light on Homeric landtenure but land was held by
individuals in firm possession if not in property a prince like
Menelaus has whole cities to give away If a prince lent stock to the
owner of a lot and if the owner became bankrupt the lot legally or
illegally would glide into the possession of the prince

The people were free like the lotless man who employs
labourerstheir situation is not clearand like the
artisanssmiths carpenters workers in goldand the slaves men and
women were captives in war or persons kidnapped by piratesthough
they may have been of high rank at home like the swineherd Eumaeus In
war it was open to a man to kill a prisoner or to set him at ransom as
in the Middle Ages The various crafts had their regular professors
though it pleased Odysseus to be a master of all of them from
ploughing to shipbuilding

It was a very tolerable state of society slaves were well treated
women of course held a position high above what was theirs in
historic Greece True they were usually purchased with a brideprice
but the lofty level of their morality infinitely above that of Europe
in the age of chivalry suggests that men allowed a free choice to
their daughters

No woman sells herself there is not a harlot in Homer common as they
are in the earliest records of Israel No doubt they existed but the
poet eschews mention of them Here as everywhere the austerity of
his tone though he is not a Puritan makes him far from an exhaustive
authority on manners and customs To him as Mr Gissing well observes
the stability of the home typified by the wedding bed of Odysseus
made fast to a pillar of a living tree is very sacred In camp and
in wanderings the men live as they will at home as we learn from
the cases of Laertes and the father of Phoenix a good man keeps no
mistress and the wife soon gives a worse man cause to rue his laxity
All this is very unlike the morals of historic Greece The brideprice
is indeed a barbaric survival but the purity of the morals of the
married women proves that it was modified in practice by the benignity
of fathers to wellloved daughters The highest tender was not
necessarily accepted We hear of no amours of maids and bachelors the
girls do not sleep like the young men and like fair Margaret of the
ballad of Clerk Saunders in bowers in the court but in rooms of the
upper story where only a god can come unnoticed Nausicaa is most
careful not to compromise herself by being seen in the company of a
stranger

Naturally in a society that carries arms always the tone of courtesy
where deliberate insult is not intended is very high and rude speech
like that of Euryalus to Odysseus in Phaeacia is atoned for with
an apology and the gift of a sword Except the Over Lord no man is
habitually rude

As to warfare as in the Tain Bo Cualgne the Irish romance based
on the manners of the late Celtic period  BC to  AD the
gentry fight from chariots dismounting at will while the host
with spears or with slings bows and arrows follows or exercises
its artillery from the flanks Except when the rain of arrows does
execution we hear next to nothing of the plebeian infantry The age
of hoplites was as remote as the age of cavalry and the phalanxes
are only mentioned when they are broken The chariot age is familiar
in Assyrian Egyptian and Minoan art as among the Britons and
Caledonians who fought with Rome The chariot was extremely light a
man could lift a chariot and carry it away Iliad x  Probably
the chariot came into use for war as Mr Ridgeway supposes in an
age when a pony was unequal to the weight of a man in armour the
Highlanders with their Celtic ponies used chariots in Roman times
never did they acquire a breed of horses fit for chargers hence
they lost the battle of Harlaw To judge by Homers description of
horses the chariot survived the cause of its origin steeds were
tall and strong enough for cavalry purposes but human conservatism
retained the chariot A speech of Nestor in Iliad Book iv 
shows that Homer knew by tradition the Egyptian custom of charging
in serried squadrons of chariotry while in his own day the lords of
chariots usually fought dismounted and in the loosest order or no
order Nestor naturally prefers the old way no late poet could have
made this interpolation for in the Greek age of cavalry he could
have known nothing of chariotry tactics The Egyptian chariotry used
the bow while their adversaries the Khita charioteers fought with
spears in loose order as in Homerand had the worst of the fight

The Homeric retention of the huge bodycovering shield familiar in
Minoan art was more or less of a survival of a time when archery was
allimportant The shield as among the Iroquois and in mediaeval
Europe was suspended by a belt The same shields among the Red
Indians and in the Middle Ages eleventh and twelfth centuries were
so to speak umbrellas against a rain of arrows as the bow became
more and more despised the historic Greeks adopted the round parrying
buckler good against spear and swordstrokes The body armour as far
as greaves are concerned was an advance on Minoan practice In Minoan
art the warriors are usually naked under the huge shields happily one
or two seals found in Crete and a pair of greaves in Cyprus prove
that greaves cuirass zoster and mitr the mailed kirtle of
Homer were not unknown even before the earliest age at which one could
venture to place the Epic see Note

The use of the metals in war is peculiar but not unexampled Weapons
are when the metal is specified always of bronze save one arrowhead
of primitive form Iliad iv  and a unique iron mace Iliad
vii  Implements including knives which were not used in war
were of iron as a rule of bronze occasionally The only battleaxe
mentioned is of bronze Iliad xiii  axes as implements are
usually of iron so are the implements of the ploughman and shepherd
No man in Homer is said to be smitten with the iron it is always
with the bronze but trees are felled with the iron Iliad iv


Odysseus shoots through the iron that is through the open work of
the iron axeheads which were tools This curious overlap of bronze
and iron the iron being used for implements before it is used for
weapons has no analogy as far as I am aware in Central and Northern
Europe But Mr Macalister has found it perfectly exemplified in
Palestine in certain strata of the great mound of Gezer Here all
weapons are of bronze all tools of iron Palestine Exploration Fund
 p 

This state of affairsobviously caused by military distrust of iron
while illmanufactured when bronze was admirably temperedis proved
by Mr Macalister to have been an actual stage in culture about
the borders of the Grecian sea We find no archaeological evidence
for this state of things in tombs of the period of overlap of bronze
and iron in Greek soil But then we have never excavated a tumulus
of the kind described by Homer and if we did the tumulus which
necessarily attracts graverobbers is likely to have been plundered
This is unlucky we have only the poets evidence in Greece for the
uses of bronze and iron as they existed in Palestine But I think it
improbable that the poet invented this rare stage of culture Again if
we believe with most critics that late poets introduced the iron it
is to me inconceivable that they could abstain in rigorous archaism
or unconscious adherence to tradition from occasionally making a
warrior smite with the iron or from occasional mention of an iron
sword or ironheaded spear while they did not archaize or follow
tradition when they spoke of iron knives axes tools and so on

In tradition of the bronze age the tools no less than the weapons
must have been of bronze Why then did late archaizing poets make
them of iron while they never made the weapons of anything but bronze

The great objection to my opinion is Odyssey xvi  xix  the
repeated line in which occurs the proverbial saying iron of himself
draws a man to him Here iron is synonymous with weapon the weapons
in the hall of Odysseus are to be removed on the pretence that iron
draws a mans hands and may draw those of the intoxicated wooers in
their cups

I am opposed to regarding a line as late merely because it
contradicts ones theory The critics have no such scruples they
excise capriciously But this line not only contradicts my theory it
contradicts the uniform unbroken tenor of both epics It is a saying
of the Iron Age when iron has become a synonym for weapon as
in Thucydides and Shakespeare But everywhere else in the epics the
metallic synonym for weapon is bronze The metallic synonym for
tool is iron Men are smitten with the bronze trees are felled
with the iron

I think that in these circumstances it is not inconsistent to doubt
the lines antiquity If we accept it we must suppose that one
solitary late minstrel out of hundreds on the separatist theory let
the cat out of the bag and enabled us to be sure that an indefinite
amount of the epics was composed in the fullblown Age of Iron though
all the other later poets firmly kept the secret by invariably giving
to the heroes weapons of bronze Mr Ridgeway is against me He writes
The Homeric warrior  has regularly as we have seen spear and
sword of iron He may see it so but Homer saw it otherwise and never
gives a warrior an iron sword or spear Early Age of Greece vol i

No early poet perhaps no poet can avoid in religion and myth
barbaric and savage survivals owing to the nature of the legendary
materials on which his works are based Nobody we may almost say
invents a plot all borrow from the huge store of worldwide primaeval
Mrchen or folktales In the Odyssey Marmion and Ivanhoe
the plot rests on the return of the husband or lover from unknown
wanderings unrecognized except in Ivanhoe and the Odyssey by
the faithful swineherd This is a plot of Mrchen all over the
world Gerland and recently Mr Crooke and others have studied the
Mrchen embedded in Homer One such story is that of the Shifty Lad
in Dasents Tales from the Norse and the Shifty Lad is only a human
representative of the shifty beast Brer Rabbit or another who is so
common in savage folklore Now Homer in the character of Odysseus
merely combines the Returned Husband with the Shifty Lad It would
not be hard to show that Odysseus is really the hero of the Iliad
as well as of the Odyssey the man whom the poet admires most and
he is the real stormer of the city of Ilios He is the type of
sagacious resolute indomitable courage the thoroughly wellbalanced
man the most tenacious in war But in the Odyssey the nature of
the original Mrchen as in the encounter with the Cyclops and the
necessity for preserving his disguise when he returns to Ithaca
compel the poet to make Odysseus foolhardy and an ingenious liar
The sentiment of Homers audience and of Homer is with Achilles when
he says that he hates a lie like the gates of hell But the given
material does not permit Odysseus to cherish this chivalrous disdain
of falsehood and Athene the most ethical of the Olympians applauds
his craft The materials of legend also yield the cruelty of Achilles
like a hero of the Irish epic the Tain Bo Cualgne he drags a dead
man behind his chariot and with evil in his heart he slays twelve
Trojan prisoners with the bronze at the funeral of Patroclus This is
not to the poets mind a case of human sacrifice nor does Achilles
intend the souls of the men to be thralls of Patroclus

Homer regards Achilles as slaying the captives merely to glut his fury
with revenge anger for thy slaying Iliad xxiii  This is the
explanation which he gives to himself of an incident which he finds
in his traditional materials probably a memory of human sacrifice
Historic Greece was familiar enough with such ritual but it is a
marvel of evil to Homer he clearly fails to understand it He is most
embarrassed by his materials in matters of religion Unlike Hesiod he
does not love to speak of what the gods did in the morning of time
things derived from a remote past of savage mythology the incest the
amours in animal form the cannibalism the outrage of Cronos on his
father the swallowing of Zeus But he cannot get rid of the ancient
mythological element in the Olympians Though the Zeus of Eumaeus is
ethical just benignant a truly religious conception though Homer
has almost a bitter sense of the dependence of men on the gods though
all men yearn after the gods the Olympians as they appear in the
story are the freakish beings of myth capricious partisans amorous
above all undignified Only among the gods has married life its sad if
humorous aspect as in the bickerings of Zeus and Hera only among the
gods is adultery a joke Among men it is the direst outrage of sanctity
of the home So alien to Homer is the mythology which he inherits that
he finds it easiest to treat the gods humorously save where they guard
the sacredness of the oath Iliad iii  and are protectors of
strangers suppliants and of the poor The mythological survivals are
to Homer inevitable but distasteful As to a belief in a future life
in Homer there is a prevailing idea but it is mixed with the other
ideas which however contradictory always exist in this mysterious
matter The prevailing idea is that the dead if they receive their due
rites of fire and interment abide powerless for good or evil in a
shadowy sheol in the House of Hades If they do not get their dues
of fire they wander disconsolate and may become a cause of wrath to
men may appear to them in dreams or in

                  the margin grey
    Twixt the souls night and day

In the House of Hades is neither reward nor punishment if we take
Odyssey xi  for a late interpolation but mere lack of
vigour and of the sun Only the prophet Tiresias like Samuel in
Sheol keeps his wits and his faculty of precognition

Yet in the scene of the Oaths Iliad iii  certain powers
are appealed to which beneath the earth punish men outworn I do
not think this a late interpolation because the formula of the
sacrifices connected with the oath is likely to be very ancient to be
preHomeric and to reflect an old belief no longer popular In these
matters all contradictory notions may coexist as when the hymn of the
Euahlayi tribe of New South Wales prays Baiame to admit the soul of
Erin into his paradise Bullimah while the myth says that Erin is now
incarnate in a little bird Many of the lowest savages believe in a
future of rewards and punishments but the doctrine of the efficacy of
fire has all but driven this faith out of Homers ken

Cremation is the great crux of Homeric anthropology cremation
and the consequent absence of ghostfeeding and of heroworship
Archaeology shows that these practices went on unbroken in Greece
and archaeology cannot show us a single example of the Homeric barrow
and method of interment Yet the method is a genuine historic method
in Northern Europe of the Age of Bronze Homer did not invent it he
mentions no other mode of disposing of the dead but we have never
found its traces in Greece The shaft graves and tholos graves of
late Minoan times have left no vestige of tradition in the Epics
and the cremation and barrow are equally absent from the view of the
archaeologist I cannot venture on any guess at an explanation We are
precluded from supposing that cremation arose in the wanderings after
the Dorian invasion for the purpose of concealing the remains of the
dead from desecration by alien foes The shaft grave might conceal
them the tumulus and pillar above only advertise their whereabouts to
the ruthless foe

It is plain that on many points Homer with his austere taste is
not a very rich source for the anthropologist in search of savage
survivals In Homer no human beings work magic a witch like a
harlot is not to be found in the Epics Both are familiar in the
Old Testament There is a secondsighted man but his was a natural
faculty Homer never alludes to the humbler necessities of our animal
nature unlike Shakespeare he never makes old Nestor cough and spit
when roused as in the Doloneia by a night alarm Nobody coughs in
Homer He sings for an audience that has lived down the ape though
the tiger has not wholly died He knows nothing of our instruments of
torture rack and boot and thumbscrews which in Scotland outlasted
the seventeenth century Historic Greece was not very successful in
expelling the beast from human nature The poets of historical Greece
were never so successful as Homer I infer that the Iliad and the
Odyssey are prehistoric the flowers of a brief age of Achaean
civilization an age when the society of princes and ladies had a
taste extraordinarily pure and noble The poems were framed for an
aristocratic not for a popular audience though I am perfectly ready
to grant that the popular audience to which our best ballad minstrels
sang also desired a tone of singular purity in the serious romantic
lays It is the nature of the highest objective art whether in epic or
ballad to be clean the Muses are maidens

LECTURE III

ANTHROPOLOGY IN THE GREEK EPIC TRADITION OUTSIDE HOMER


In the remains of the earliest Greek poetry we are met by a
striking contrast As Mr Lang has told us Homer presents to the
anthropologist the spectacle of a society which will have nothing to
do with anthropology By Homer of course Mr Lang means the Iliad
and the Odyssey and we may add to those poems a stream of heroic
tradition which runs more or less clearly through most of our later
literature and whose spirit is what we call classic Homeric or
Olympian

But there is also in the earliest epic tradition another stratum
of which this Olympian character does not hold A stratum full of
the remains and at times even betraying the actuality of those
beastly devices of the heathen which are dear to the heart of
us anthropologistsif a mere Greek scholar may venture to class
himself among even amateur anthropologists ceremonies of magic and
purification beastworship stoneworship ghosts and anthropomorphic
gods traces of the peculiar powers of women both as good medicine
and as titular heads of the family and especially a most pervading and
almost ubiquitous memory of Human Sacrifice

This stratum is represented by Hesiod and the Rejected EpicsI mean
those products of the primitive sagapoetry which were not selected for
recitation at the Panathenaea or the unknown Ionian archetype of the
Panathenaea and which consequently fell into neglectby the Orphic
literature by a large element in tragedy most richly perhaps by the
antiquarian traditions preserved in Pausanias and in the hostile
comments of certain Christian writers such as Clement and Eusebius

Now the first thing for the historian to observe about this nonHomeric
stratum is this that nonHomeric is by no means the same thing as
postHomeric We used to be taught that it was We used to be taught
that Homer was practically speaking primitive that we started
from a pure epic atmosphere and then passed into an age of romantic
degradation The extant remains of the nonHomeric poems frequently
show in their form and sometimes even in their content definite
signs of presupposing the Iliad just as the Iliad here and there
shows signs of presupposing them and it is not until recently that
we have been able to understand properly the nature and the method of
composition of an ancient Traditional Book I will not go into that
point in detail here Even supposing that the Cypria as a poem
could definitely be called later than the Iliad it is enough to
say that a later literary whole may often contain an older kernel or
a more primitive mass of material and in the case of the nonHomeric
sagapoems it is fairly clear that they do so

Two arguments will suffice First the argument from analogy Few
anthropologists with the knowledge now at our command will regard the
high austere knightly atmosphere of the Iliad as primitive
when compared with that of Hesiod In the second place a great
proportion of our anthropological material is already to be found in
prehistoric Crete The aniconic worship the stones the beasts the
pillars and the ouranian birds the great mother goddess of Anatolia
the human sacrifices and the royal and divine bull I speak under
correction from those who know the Cretan finds better than I but to
me it seems that there are many bridges visible from Crete to Hesiod or
Eumelus or even Pausanias but the gulf between Crete and Homer seems
in certain places to have no bridge

Thus the later literary whole contains the more primitive modes of
thought the earlier religion

Now this fact in itself though it may be stated in different ways is
not much disputed among scholars But the explanations of the fact are
various That which seems to me much the most probable is the theory
of Expurgation As Mr Lang seems not quite to have understood what I
tried to say about this in my Rise of the Greek Epic I will restate
it in this way We know that the great mass of sagapoetry began to be
left on one side and neglected from about the eighth century on and we
find to judge from our fragments that it remained in its semisavage
state Two poems on the contrary were selected at some early time for
public recitation at the solemn fouryearly meeting of all Ionians
and afterwards of all Athenians The poems were demonstrably still in
a fluid condition and the intellect of Greece was focussed upon them
This process lasted on through the period of that great movement which
raised the shores of the Aegean from a land of semisavages to the
Hellas of Thales of Aeschylus and of Euripides And we find
naturally that amid all the colour of an ideal past in which these
two epics like all other epics have steeped their story there has
been a gradual but drastic rejection of all the uglier and uncleaner
elements That is a very broad statement it omits both the evidence
and the additional causes and qualifications But it serves to explain
why I treat the nonHomeric sagas as representing more faithfully the
primitive preHellenic habits of thought the mere slough out of which
Hellas rose

Now to one lecturing on Anthropology in Homer the difficulty is to
find enough material In the case of the early saga outside Homer the
difficulty is only what to choose and where to stop

One might begin by discussing the remnants of primitive secret
societies The remains are fairly rich Mr Webster in his instructive
book has traced the normal genesis of these bodies which exercise
such an enormous influence over savage life The first stage he takes
to be the ordinary system of ordeals and puberty rites through which
all males of the tribe have to pass before they can be admitted as full
men The ordeals of the Arunta and of the various Red Indian tribes
are familiar to most of us These ceremonies are often involved in a
good deal both of mystery and of charlatanry The youths initiated
for instance sometimes are supposed to die and be born again The
process is secret The women of the tribe are kept carefully away The
neighbourhood is filled with the warning sound of the Rhombos or
Bullroarerthat whirring of immortal things which Hesiod perhaps
means when he speaks of the air resounding   
The next stage begins when this initiation ceremony ceases to be
compulsory This sometimes depends on the separation of the War Chief
from the medicineman or the elders For of course the initiation
ceremonies are specially the department of the last named In the
third stage we find a fullflown Secret Society The initiated form a
definite body and work together for the maintenance of such conduct as
is pleasing to the gods and themselves

Take the case of Dukduk a powerful society in the Bismarck
Archipelago northeast of New Guinea I will not dwell on its power
nor on the advantages which accrue to its worshippers But I cite from
Mr Webster an eyewitnesss account of an epiphany of Dukduk

Dukduk arrives about six times a year and always on the day of the new
moon His arrival is announced a month beforehand by the Old Menthe
Gerontes During that month great quantities of food are made ready for
Dukduk and are taken care of by the Old Men his votaries The day
before the epiphany all women disappear from sight It is death to them
to look on the divine being Before daybreak all the males of the tribe
assemble on the beach most of the young men looking frightened At
the first streak of dawn singing and drumbeating is heard out at sea
and as soon as there is enough light five or six canoes are seen at a
distance lashed together and with a platform built over them On this
platform are two Dukduks dancing and uttering shrill cries They are
got up like gigantic cassowaries some ten feet high surmounted by a
grotesque human mask At least says Mr Romilly the witness whom I
cite the body looks much like the body of the cassowary but the head
is like nothing but the head of a Dukduk The canoes make the beach
The natives fall back in apprehension for if Dukduk is touched he
frequently tomahawks the offender on the spot They proceed through the
settlement always dancing and screaming to the secret house which
has been prepared for them in the bush They stay about a fortnight
They beat people a good deal and exact money from suitable sources
especially plundering the women if any one has shown disrespect of
any sort to any member of the Dukduk society not to speak of Dukduk
himself the punishment is swift and terrible

Now Dukduk like Egbo and MumboJumbo is an antifeminist whereas
Dionysus was essentially worshipped by women There are several West
African parallels to this The Bundu of the Mendi country is a very
powerful womans society But otherwise is not the whole of this
story curiously reminiscent of the Dionysus myths as they occur for
instance in the early Corinthian epos attributed to Eumelos In his
native Thrace very possibly everybody was initiated to Dionysus but
in Greece his worshippers form a special society Dionysus arrives in
a ship from unknown seas when he moves inland this ship is set bodily
upon a wagon He makes his epiphany at various places claiming
worship for himself and honours for his worshippers In the regular
propagandist legend that comes down to us Lycurgus perished for wrongs
done to the Bacchic society and the god himself He sought to stay the
women possessed of god and the Bacchic fire He smote or drove into
the sea Dionysus himself and his Nurses The same with Pentheus In
the actual ritual we can have little doubt a man personated Dionysus
exactly as a man personates the Dukduk or Egbo or MumboJumbo And
presumably in just the same way the uninitiated as Mungo Park says
were so ignorant or at least were obliged to pretend to be so as to
take the figure on the ship for a divine being

The Mysteries are all intimately connected with Secret Societies The
Demeter mystery has an epiphany in it it has the arrival of Demeter
at Eleusis it has the Rhombos or Bullroarer and the exclusion of the
uninitiated And a sign perhaps of declining influence in this actual
world it professes like many of these societies to do wonderful
things in the next

There are to my mind traces in prehistoric Greece of another kind of
secret society resembling the Human Leopards or Human Lions of West
Africa I must refer here to the long expected book of my friend Mr
Penmorlan Maine on Werewolves But to give the mere outlines of the
subject the members of these societies are apt to turn at certain
seasons into leopards or lions and then kill human beings in a
leopardlike or lionlike way Their object is partly to obtain human
fat for medicine partly to remove or discourage their enemies Sir
H H Johnston tells of a series of murders committed by an old
man who concealed himself in long grass and leaped out on solitary
travellers He killed them and then mutilated the bodies He confessed
the murders freely but explained that he at times turned into a
lion and had to act as such The leopard societies have special
threepronged forks or gloves with knives at the end to imitate the
wound of a leopards claw And I have seen a long club ending in
claws like a wild beasts which I suspect had the same purpose My
fatherinlaw bought it in Khartoum from a negro from the south who
professed not to know what it was He said it was a fantasiaas no
doubt it was

To take a particular instance the mode of initiation in the Sherbro
leopard society strongly recalls certain preHellenic myths The
society chooses some stranger and asks him to a dinner at which human
flesh is secretly mixed among the other food At the end of the meal
they reveal to him what he has eaten and in proof I think show him
the hands and sometimes the head of the murdered human being He has
shared the leopard feast and is now a leopard

Was it not exactly like this that Atreus kept the hands and feet of the
murdered children apart hidden with a cloth and at the end of the
feast removed the cloth to show Thyestes what he had eaten Lykaon too
though his name can scarcely be derived from  turned into a wolf
because he had sacrificed a child on the altar of Zeus Lykaios As
he himself can scarcely be different from Zeus Lykaios this must
originally have implied some cannibal act And you will remember that
ever afterwards in the ritual of Zeus Lykaios legend said that one
piece of human flesh was mixed up with the rest of the sacrificial
meat and the man who unknowingly tasted that bit was doomed to turn
into a wolf

There are the burning questions of totems and of matriarchy there is
Earthmagic there is Purification there is Fetichism there are many
other marks of the Religions of the Lower Culture to be found in the
ancient preHellenic myths But I must turn to the special point which
I wish to illustrate in the remainder of this lecture

I wish to deal with a most familiar part of the subject the Divine
King or as I prefer to call him the MedicineKing and then to apply
the results which we reach to the most obvious remnant of nonHomeric
poetry that has come down to us the Theogony of Hesiod

We all know about this medicineking If we like we can call him
divine On his force and his manawhat Hesiod I venture to suggest
calls his    depends the welfare of his people in the
way of rain and thunderstorms of abundance of game of crops of
success in war He also affects floods earthquake and pestilence If
he suffers in any way if his mana is weakened his whole people
suffers and is weakened too Consequently he is encouraged and kept
strong as long as possible if he shows any weakness he must be got
rid of and a better man found to take his place There seem to be three
main methods Either he is set aside periodically at the end of five
years or nine years or the like or he is quietly deposed when he
shows signs of age like Peleus Oineus Aison in the legends or
and this is our main subject today when some one else shows superior
mana by killing him At present my mana is supreme I am king
my will carries itself out But if your mana your Kratos and Bia
conquer mine then you are king If you can also get my mana into
you so much the better For  and  are tricky things and may
desert any one of us or according to Hesiod any except Zeus No
house of Zeus is without them no seat of Zeus there is no going forth
of the god where they do not follow him and they sit for ever beside
the Thunderer Already in Hesiod these mana qualities have
become half anthropomorphic much more so of course in Aeschylus
Prometheus

Now in anthropology we are always making fresh efforts at the
imaginative understanding of men far removed from us and naturally
therefore we are always slightly correcting and modifying our
conceptions I want here to suggest that with regard to this Divine
King the ordinary classical conception is slightly wrong We speak of
deification and this deification always remains rather a puzzle for
us It may be all very well for the mysterious Minos but when applied
to Julius Caesar or to Hadrian in the full light and plain prose of
history it seems such an absurd and gratuitous blasphemy I think
the mistake lies in applying our highly abstract conception God
a conception rarefied and ennobled during many centuries by the
philosophic and religious thought of the highest of mankind to a
stratum of human ideas to which it does not belong In one of the
presidential addresses delivered to the recent Congress of Religions
Mr Hartland dwelt on a significant fact with regard to this idea of
God viz that whenever this word is used our best witnesses tend to
contradict one another Among the most competent observers of the
Arunta tribes for instance some hold that they had no conception of a
God others that they were constantly thinking about God Much may be
said about this but one thing I think emerges with some clearness
that this idea of a god far away in the skyI do not say merely a god
who is without body parts or passions but even a god who is very
remote and is a cause behind the regular phenomena of the worldthis
idea is one which practically does not enter their minds at all or
if by an effort they can reach and accept it it has little working
value and is soon forgotten For most primitive races I suspect the
medicinechief the  with his immense mana is Theos and
equally the Theos is the medicinechief The rainmaker the bringer of
game the possessor of the power to make dead and to make alivethere
he is the visible doer of all those things which later races have
delegated to higher and more shadowy beings walking palpably before
you with his medicine and perhaps his pipe his grand manner his fits
and his terrific dress

The Basileus the possessor of great mana wants people to obey him
and by willpower by force of character aided by impressive ritual
he makes them In the same way he makes rain he says so vehemently
It shall rain that it cannot help itself It does This lies at the
back of what we somewhat erroneously call mimetic magic For the real
rainmaker does not imitate rain he just makes it One must bear in
mind always the extreme sensitiveness of savages to suggestionto
hocuspocus to bullying to paroxysms of rage When KyknosAres
who presumably belonged to this class of Basileus was waiting for
Heracles to attack him in his temenos he did not simply make
suitable arrangements and stay on guard no  he raged
round working up his mana and inspiring all the terror possible
Think of the scolding priests of the Middle Ages Think even of the
Bull Ausculta Fili Think of the rages that are characteristic of
ancient prophets such as Tiresias just as they are of modern yogis
and Maroccan saints

In the first place then on sociological grounds I think we should
not conceive this primitive king as a man deified but rather as a
predeistic medicineman possessed of those powers which more cultured
ages have relegated to the gods In the second place though I know
that etymological arguments are often like broken reeds and pierce
the hand of him who leans thereon I cannot but remember that Curtius
derived  from the root thes which appears in 
  perhaps  the Latin festus and feriae
and which has the special connotation of spell or magic prayer
Professor Conway who prefers another derivation Lith dvse spirit
breath MHG getwas ghost see Brugmann Gr Gr sv writes
to me that the fatal objection to the thes derivation is that 
could not mean God it could only mean prayer or one who prays
Now except that the word suggests spell rather than prayer that
is exactly what I want it to mean If the word  was originally
neuter it meant magic or medicine like  If masculine it was
the medicineman or magicmannot very far from 

The process of thought if I may oversimplify it a little seems to be
like this First the Theos or Rainmaker on earth makes his rain Then
it is found that he does not always or unconditionally make the rain
and you reach the hypothesis that a greater rainmaker lives far away
on some remote mountain or perhaps in the sky That is the true Theos
The Theos on earth only knows his ways belongs to him partly controls
him sometimes indeed he can only humbly pray to him The socalled
Theos on earth in fact is not Theos at all Here comes one of the
strongest antitheses between Homeric and nonHomeric between the
reformed Olympian religion and the old savage stuff from which it was
made Homer drew clear the line between mortal and immortal between
God in Olympus and man here And most early Greek poetry rings with the
antithesis         
By the fifth century the time was long past when gods and mortal men
strove in Mkn and the gods had carried the day Yet even Sophocles
makes his Thebans go with prayer and supplication to a Basileus to stop
the plague and it seems significant that he makes the priest explain

          
        
          
         OT  ff

The suppliant comes to him not exactly as a God but as the first of
men and as holding some special intercourse with the 

A great collection of these medicinekings especially of rain and
thundermakers is to be found in Mr A B Cooks very remarkable
articles on Zeus Jupiter and the Oak published in the Classical
Review for  and again in his European Sky God in Folk Lore
xv pp  I will run briefly through a few of them

The clearest of all is Salmoneus His nature was explained I believe
partly by M Salomon Reinach and partly by Miss Jane Harrison He
declared that he was Zeus says Apollodorus i   and depriving
Zeus of his sacrifices bade men offer them to himself He attached to
a chariot leather thongs with bronze caldrons and trailing them after
him said he was thundering he tossed blazing torches into the air and
said he was lighteningSo he was at least he was doing his best
Mr Cook shows that he had also some justification for saying that he
was Zeus For he was an Olympian victor and thereby became Basileus
or Zeus of Olympia and had the thundermaking as part of his official
duties

Almost exactly similar is Remulus Silvius Remulus  imitator
fulminis as Ovid calls him In contempt of the gods he contrived
mock thunderbolts and noises like thunder wherewith he thought to
frighten men as though he were a god But a storm fraught with rain
and lightning falling upon his house and the lake near which it
stood swelling in an unusual manner he was drowned with his whole
family As with Salmoneus amid his mock thunderstorms came the
real thunderstorm and slew him

More modest and more in accord with later beliefs was Numa No impiety
was to be found in his thundermaking Picus and Faunus taught Numa
many things including a charm for thunder and lightning composed
of onions hair and pilchards which is used to this day You may
remember the story told by Livy Ovid and others how Numa cheated
Jupiter of his human sacrifice He conjured Jupiter by a spell to come
to him and reveal a charm for thunder The god came but was angry at
being brought and meant to have blood I want heads  Of onions
said Numa I want human  Hairs said Numa I want living 
Pilchards put in the pious king and Jupiter gave the matter up

Minos in much the same way had the power to thunder but only had it by
means of a prayer to his father Zeus

Now observe that most of these early Roman heroes appear both as men
and as gods The explanation is I think that when the celestial
gods were introduced the old Theoi or Basiles had to be either
condemned like Mezentius Remulus Silvius Salmoneus or else deified
Numa and Romulus suggest themselves at once Aeneas too while engaged
in battle with Turnus or some say Mezentius vanished and became
Jupiter Indiges Latinus vanished while fighting Mezentius and became
Jupiter Latiaris In later times there were numbers of these Humani
Ioves It is one of the most important social facts to remember about
antiquity that the spread of education was very difficult and slow
and in consequence it was almost impossible for a whole nation at once
ever to rise entirely above that primitive state of superstition which
Preuss describes by the pleasant word Urdummheit

Julius Caesar was worshipped as Jupiter with M Antonius for his
Flamen Dialis Caligula was worshipped as Optimus Maximus and also as
Jupiter Latiaris it was perhaps in this capacity that he put to death
his rival the Rex Nemorensis at Nemi Domitian is constantly referred
to as Jupiter in the poets Coins are found inscribed  
and HADRIANO IOVI OLYMPIO

We have further the somewhat mysterious statement of Macrobius Sat
iii   that the souls of consecrated men were called by the
Greeks Znes and the express and frequently repeated statement of
Tzetzes that the ancients called all their kings Zeus and their queens
goddesses        

I will not dwell on ZeusAgamemnon or on ZeusMinos nor on the number
of priests of Zeus at Corycus who bear the name Zs But I will just
draw attention to one fact Two classes of people who are not kings
and I believe two only are found bearing the title of Zeus They are
prophetslike ZeusAmphiaraos and ZeusTrophonios and doctorslike
the celebrated Menekrates who called himself Zeus and his various
attendants by other divine names That is to say the old conception of
medicinechief has split up into those three channels king prophet
and doctor and to all three the name of Zeus occasionally belongs It
was for a medical miracle at Lystra that Barnabas was hailed as Zeus
and Paul as Hermes Acts xiv 

Now as has been observed before now the history of these Humani
Ioves is written in blood and that for two special reasons First
it is by blood that they come to the throne and by blood that they
leave it Secondly they are always appealed to in times of great
strait or danger when strong medicine is wanted And the strongest
and most favourite medicine in such cases is human blood of one sort
or another The main object of the Leopard Societies is said to be
the wish to obtain human fat as medicine The same motive leads to
murders in Australia

We should perhaps add a third cause for the stain of blood which lies
so deep on these primitive medicinekings I mean the mere wish to
inspire terror and obedience and to keep off as long as possible that
inevitable successor who filled their days with dread Kyknos Phorbas
Oinomaos Kerkyon Amykos Philomeleides Sinis and Procrustes all
those ogres of Greek myth who race or wrestle with all comers and
having defeated them hang their heads on trees or tear their bodies
asunder or fling them to wild beasts or the like have their parallel
in many an African king whose hut is ringed by heads stuck
on poles

Now I wish to apply these conceptions as I said to the most
obvious piece of Greek Epic poetry outside Homer and illustrate
anthropologically the main legend of the Theogony You will remember
the outlines of the story The first possessor of the kingly
office is Ouranos He is afraid of his children
and hides or imprisons them At last his son Kronos conquers and
mutilates him and he passes out of sight Kronos becomes king and is
equally afraid of his children he swallows them one after another
eventually Zeus conquers and binds him Zeus now reigns but Zeus
took the precaution of swallowing Metis when Metis was about to give
birth to Athena

I omit details for the moment I refrain also from discussing the Maori
parallel first pointed out I believe in Mr Langs Custom and
Myth This series of conflicts has been explained as referring to a
change of religion an early Pelasgian worship being ousted by that of
the incoming Achaeans There may be that in it but such an explanation
obviously does not explain the whole series of swallowings There were
not three certainly not four different religions in question

Analysing the story I find in it the following elements

First the medicineking or Theos is afraid of his successor In this
case the possible successors are represented as his children That
may be a mere piece of convenience in storytelling it may be the
influence of a time when kingship was hereditary

In all three cases the motive assigned by Hesiod seems to be the fear
of a successor The motive of Ouranos indeed is not very clearly
stated He began by hiding his children in the earth because they were
the most dangerous of sons  They were hated of their father
and he rejoiced in the evil work

Kronos arose and conquered him the exact meaning of the mutilation I
leave aside Kronos proceeded to swallow his children intending that
none other of the proud sons of Ouranos should have kings rank among
the immortals for he had heard from Gaia and Ouranos that he was
destined to be vanquished by his son  ff Here the motive is
clearly given

As for Zeus and his strange act in swallowing Metis when she was about
to give birth to Athena two quite distinct motives are attributed to
him First that which we have met with before He was determined that
none but himself should have the kings rank   over the
immortals He had heard an oracle that Metis was destined to give birth
toone expects the motive of the Marriage of Thetisa child who
should be mightier than his father But it is not quite so simple for
Athena was the child of Metis and she was obviously not mightier than
Zeus The oracle takes the curious form that Metis is to bear first
Athena and secondly a child who shall be mightier than his father
Zeus seems to have swallowed her rather prematurely But he had a
second motive also He swallowed Metis that the goddess being inside
him should tell him of good and evil The name  of course means
Counsel or Wisdom

Leaving this last detail aside for the present I suggest that the
main motive in this strange story of the swallowing or hiding of the
successive possible pretenders to the crown is the dread which each
king naturally felt of him who was coming after But this still leaves
much unexplained the second main element which I find is the worship
of sacred flints or thunderstones

When Kronos set about swallowing Zeus you will remember Gaia put a
big stone in swaddling clothes and gave it to great Kronos And he put
it inside his belly     Then in the passing
of the yearswhatever that exactly meansbeguiled by the counsels
of Gaia great crookedhearted Kronos spewed up his brood again being
conquered by the craft and force of his son Two reasons there
belonging probably to different storiesin one he was overcome by the
craft of Gaia in the other by the mana of his son And the first
thing he vomited up was the stone which he had swallowed last Then
straightway Zeus set loose his fathers brothers the Titanes They
were grateful and gave him three gifts thunder and thunderbolt and
lightning formerly vast Earth had hidden them away and it is by them
that Zeus rules over mortals and immortals

That is to say Zeus in this story is a thundergod The thunder
or lightning is his mana And not only a thundergod he is a
thunderstone The identity has been of course disguised in our
present version of the myth It is muddled like everything else in
Hesiod But it shows through When Kronos sets about swallowing
Zeus it is the stone he swallows And it is only when by the counsels
of Earth Cronos vomits up the stone that Zeus can take any action
and that action takes the form of thunder and lightning the special
property of a thunderstone In the word thunderstone or 
the ancients seem to have mixed and perhaps confused two ideas that
of a meteorite which seemed to be the actual bolt which fell in the
thunder and that of an ordinary flint nephrite jade or the like
which has its mysterious fire inside it The fire is the soul or
indwelling mana of the flint

A careful reading of Hesiods story will I think convince most
anthropologists that Zeus is the stone And as a matter of fact it
is not uncommon for both Zeus and Jupiter to appear as stones In the
temple of Jupiter Feretrius the oldest temple of Jupiter in Rome
founded by Romulus there was a sacred flint which was called Jupiter
Lapisit was not Jovis Lapis It was used for killing the victim
in solemn treaties It must have been one of those thunderstones
resembling axes of which Pliny speaks what we should call neolithic
axeheads There seems to have been more than one Jupiter Lapis for
in  BC the Senate sent several such with the fetiales
to Africa I need not dwell on other cases the Zeus Kapptas at
Gythum apparently a bigger stone as Orestes could sit upon it the
Zeus Kasios or Keraunios at Seleuca the stone of Zeus Sthenios on
the road from Trozn to Hermione or the thunderstone on Mount Ida in
Crete with which Pythagoras was purified by the Idaean Dactyls the
attendants of Zeus They are all in De Vissers book

The best known of these stones is perhaps that which was believed to
benot to belong to but actually to bethe Mother of the Gods Livy
xxix II tells of the embassy sent from Rome to Attalus to
fetch the Great Mother and how the king took the legates to Pessins
in Phrygia and handed over to them the sacred stone which the natives
affirmed to be the Mother of the Gods Arnobius describes its
appearance a stone not large which could be carried in a mans hand
without noticeable weight in colour black and furvus in shape more
or less round with projecting corners which is now to be seen in
the mouth of the image of the Great Mother Superstitious Rome was
ready to accept and to worship the Mother in the form of a stone but
commonsense Rome did at least demand that the Great Mother should have
a decently anthropomorphic image and the stone was then placed in the
images mouth

So far then we are clear But there remain some difficult questions
Why was the stone in Hesiod wrapped in swaddling clothes I do not
understand this But the ritual practice is well attested Pausanias
tells how this Kronos stone was anointed and wrapped in wool A coin
in Macdonalds Hunter Catalogue ii   represents the Great
Mother stone covered with a goatskin This may be merely because of
the hagos or taboo just as the omphalos on vases is commonly covered
with an  and Semitic betyls are wrapped in cloths The actual
body of a god would be dangerous to touch but it looks as if there
was some special connexion between stones and infants The Orphic poem
called Lithica is of course full of magic stones which might be
cited here But take one in especial the Live Siderite This stone
has to be prayed to like a god it has also to be washed daily for ten
days and nursed and wrapped in clean robes like a baby At the end of
that time it will reward its benefactor by uttering the scream of a
young baby when hungry then the poet remarks the great thing is not
to drop it

In some Mexican dances Preuss tells us the souls of infants come
through the air in the likeness of five stones Among the Kaitish
and the Arunta there are stones inhabited by infant souls which are
induced in one way or another to come out of the stones and be born
And we all remember the stones flung by Deucalion and Pyrrha and the
race of man which isor is notsprung     

But again why were the stones swallowed What does all this swallowing
mean Zeus of course swallowed Metis in order to have her mana inside
him That is sensible enough Do medicine men or Theoi ever actually
swallow smooth stones in order to get the firepower or other magic
inside them In Mexico the devils which are sucked out of the body in
curing diseases are usually in the form of stones For instance in
the ceremony of the Huichol tribe where the gods are healed of their
weariness by the DawnStar Kaiumari sucking stones and the like out
of them The same practice is common among Australian blacks

Mr Marett refers me to a still better case Among the Yuin of New
South Wales the word joa which is almost like mana and is used to
denote the immaterial force in sacred animals is actually the name of
certain stones like these They are commonly quartzcrystals or bits
of glass but also we hear of Kunambrun a black stone apparently
lydianite A black stone probably means thunder The medicine man often
carries these stones in his mouth and when he sends out a curse or
a blessing he projects them out of himself into his victim like the
wind that is invisibly and impalpably

The actual swallowing seems strange unless it was a mere fraud But I
used to know an Australian blackfellowI never thought of asking his
tribewho used to put stones in his mouth and give or sell them to the
boys of the neighbourhood as bearing a charm in consequence They were
sure to hit what they were aimed at unless the aim was very bad I
suppose he put a lot of his mana into them One of the ways in which
a Papuan chief causes death according to the report of Dr Bellamy
in the White Book for  is to send to a man a present of a smooth
stone The man recognizes the meaning of the stone and wastes away
Dr Bellamy cured some by the application of strong smelling salts
which drove away the devils Presumably the chief had put his mana on
the stone in some very strong way

Lastly there is another element in this story which calls for
explanation from better anthropologists than myself I mean the
constant reference to hiding or concealment Ouranos  hid
all his children in a secret place of the Earth this gave pain to
Earth and she groaned being squeezed by them Earth again  took
Zeus and hid him in a cave Kronos put the stone inside himsurely
a form of hiding The Titans were hidden away by Kronos
 till Zeus brought them again to light Lastly and most important
Zeus hid away fire from man   

This last case is pretty clear Zeus had the fire hidden away in the
heart of the flint or in the veins of Earth Prometheus or Pramanthas
the FireStick introduced the more open visible fire But the other
cases seem different In them it is always a king or a wouldbe king a
deposed Theos or a conquered aspirant who is made to disappear We are
reminded of Aeneas and Latinus who vanished in battles of Romulus and
Numa who vanished in thunderstorms

In one case we find that the hiding was in a monstrous cave and a
cave in Crete too We know from other sources something about the
kind of hiding which took place in that particular cave At the end of
the fatal nine years if we are to believe the authors quoted by me
in the Rise of the Greek Epic p  and much more completely by
Mr A B Cook in the articles mentioned above the divine king Minos
in his mask as a god went up into the Idaean cave to converse with
Zeus Doubtless the divine mask covered his head A masked Minos went
in and a masked Minos came out but one strongly suspects that it was
not the same man beneath the mask My friend Mr Gordon an education
officer in Lower Nigeria informs me that there is there a great oracle
or ordeal in a cave called the Long Juju It decides cases between
litigants or persons who have some dispute And the method is that
both go up into the cave and only one returns The other presumably
the guilty one has vanished he is hidden 

All through this preHellenic realm of saga and halfhistory we find
ourselves in contact with these godkings or medicinechiefs these
 or if I am right Theoi And we cannot but wonder whether we
have not here the explanation of Herodotus famous statement about the
origins of Greek Religion Herod ii  The Pelasgians he tells us
did not originally know the names of the Olympian gods they brought
offerings and prayed to the Theoi It was only at a later time that
they sent to Dodona to ask if they should worship those definite gods
with special names and attributes and Olympian Houses which had
come into Greece but were still in some sense foreign And the oracle
said Yes I am quite aware that the passage may be differently
interpreted and I do not suggest that Herodotus knew all that lay
behind his words when he spoke of the nameless Theoi of the Pelasgians
in contrast to the Olympians of Homer and Hesiod But I do suspect that
the contrast between these medicinechiefs and the Homeric gods is one
of the cardinal differences between Hellenic and preHellenic religion
and further that some reminiscence of this difference has shaped the
tradition which Herodotus repeats Clearer evidence will no doubt be
forthcoming from some betterequipped anthropologist

 According to the White Book of Papua for  containing the
governors report to the Federal Government the only murder of a white
man committed during last year was due to a wish for this medicine
A native called Hariki had built a new house and wished to make it
strong and paint it with a mixture of redclay and coconutoil For
this purpose it seems special medicine was necessary and in order to
have it as strong as possible Hariki determined to get it from a white
man He obtained it by killing a marketgardener called Weaver with
whom he was on quite friendly terms Indeed when the medicine had been
obtained Hariki and his friends proceeded under the guidance of one
of the party who was skilled in charms to bring Weaver back to life
They began at the feet and succeeded so they said in reviving all
the lower part of the body but there was a great wound in the chest
which they could not pass So at last they hid the corpse away and
arranged that it should seem to have been eaten by alligators

 Phorbas being the strongest of the Phlegyai was chosen their
king He lived under an oak wrestled with all comers and hung their
heads on the oak Kerkyon et quercus of Eleusis did much the
same So did Oinomaos His daughters suitors had to challenge him to a
chariot race he hung up the heads of those whom he defeated Pelops
having defeated him slew him and took the kingdom Apparently the
daughters hand carried the kingdom with it as the daughter of Zeus in

The others killed their rivals in various ways

his weapon also  ff where he crushes Typhoeus who would have

 Thus in our present version of the Theogony Zeus is not
swallowed at all only the stone is swallowed And when it reappears
Zeus sets it to be a sign at Pytho Comment is hardly needed No one
supposes that we have the stories of the Theogony in their original

LECTURE IV

GRAECOITALIAN MAGIC


The Greek words for magic and magician  and  are
admittedly of Persian origin and in all probability did not find
their way into Greece before the Persian War that is before about
 BC It was therefore an obvious inference which was drawn in
 by O Hirschfeld de incantationibus et devinctionibus amatoriis
apud Graecos Romanosque that as the name magic was not known in
Greece before the Persian Wars neither was the thing The inference is
indeed obvious but it is not necessarily correct magic is practised
by tribes who have not developed any general term for magic It is
therefore conceivable at least that the Greeks and Italians also
before  BC practised magical rites even though they then had no
word for magic in general The question is one of facts and not merely
of words What do we know of the facts before  BC Unfortunately
according to M Mauss in his article on magic in Daremberg and
Saglios Dictionnaire des Antiquits Grecques et Romaines we are in
almost complete ignorance of the primitive and original forms of magic
in Italy and Greece In view then of our almost complete ignorance
it may perhaps be allowable to start from a hypothesisthe hypothesis
that the primitive and original forms of magic amongst the Greeks and
Romans were much the same as they are amongst the undeveloped peoples
who possess them at the present day and like the Greeks and Romans of
the earliest times have no general term for magic

Amongst the tribes of Central Australia the person who employs magic
to cause sickness or death to his enemy does not omit to use what the
natives call singing This singing is conducted in a low voice
Frazer Golden Bough i  and the sort of thing the magician
in muttered tones hisses out is May your heart be rent asunder or
May your head and throat be split open Spencer and Gillen Native
Tribes  ff Northern Tribes  ff

In the Torres Straits the sorcerer points a spear in the direction of
his victim and sings similarly Into body go go Into hands go
go Into head go go Cambridge Expedition to Torres Straits vi
  The singing assists Mr Haddon says ib p  in
furthering the injury he wishes to inflict Now was singing of
this magical nature a sort of rhythmical muttering in a low voice
known to the Greeks and Romans In the first place we have the Latin
words incantare incantator incantamentum all implying a
singing which is magical in its intention and effectsincantation
or enchantment Next we have carmen which means not only song in
general but singing in the magical sense in Tibullus i  
Ovid Met vii    xiv       Fasti
iv   Horace Ep v  xvii    Sat i  
 Virgil Ecl viii  Aen iv  Juvenal Sat vi
 Pliny Nat Hist xxviii   Tacitus Annals iv 
and in other passages for which I may refer to Adam Abt Die Apologie
des Apuleius  and L Fahz De Poetarum Romanorum Doctrina
Magica   In Greek we have the same magical singing expressed
by the words    in Euripides Bacchae 
Hippolytus   Phoenissae  Sosiphanes Fr 
Aristophanes Amphiaraus Fr  Anaxandrides Fr  
Antiphanes Fr   Xenophon Mem iii    Lucian
and Heliodorus and other passages to be found in Abt ib p 

It may however be objected that all these quotations are of course
later than  BC and therefore prove nothing as to the primitive
and original forms of magic in Italy and Greece Indeed in the
Bacchae for instance and in Plato Rep ii  A the magic
referred to may reasonably be regarded as exotic and not native to
Greece But fortunately we find the word  in the magical
sense in Homer Od xix  which takes this group of words
in this sense far back beyond  BC The Homeric use of the word
in this sense however will not avail against any one who chooses
to maintainthough it is impossible to prove and difficult to
believethat the Greeks originally knew no magic and borrowed it
in Homeric or preHomeric times from some neighbouring people And
though the fact that the Twelve Tables ordained punishment for the
man qui malum carmen incantassit in all reasonable probability
indicates that singing in the evil sense was a practice already at
the time rooted in Italy and not newly imported from abroad still in
this case as in the case of the Homeric  the objection may
be madethough it cannot be supported by anything approaching proof
or even probabilitythat the Italians as well as the Romans alone
amongst early peoples were incapable of developing the belief for
themselves As against this objection we can only fall back on the
evidence of comparative philology And that evidence is particularly
interesting because as interpreted by O Schrader Reallexikon der
Indogermanischen Altertumskunde ii  it shows that amongst
the IndoEuropean peoples much the most common expression for doing
magic is singing The presumption that singing of the magical kind
goes back to IndoEuropean times is as strong as any that linguistic
evidence can produce For the Slavonian Lithuanian and Teutonic words
I will refer to Schraders Reallexikon ii  Of the Greek and
Latin words I may mention  and  which are connected
with  speak  and  with  howling fascinum
and fascinare with fari

If then we may with some plausibility illustrate the carmen the
incantatio and the  of the Greeks and the Romans with the
singing of the Torres Straits and Central Australia the question
arises What exactly is it that the magician sings In the Torres
Straits it apparently is the spear which is sung for the words used
are Into body go go and Messrs Spencer and Gillen say that in
Central Australia also it is the stick or the bone which is sung
But when we examine the words of the singing or charm as given by
Messrs Spencer and Gillen we find that they do not refer to the
stick or the bone which is used in the magical rite but to the person
against whom the rite is directed May your heart be rent asunder may
your head and throat be split open The inference therefore seems
to be that it is the victim that the singing or spell is originally
directed against and only later that the stick or bone itself comes
to be bewitched just as money which is valuable for what it will
purchase comes to be regarded by the miser as an end in itself

If this is so it opens up another possibility of interest which I must
be content merely to suggest for consideration and investigation It
is that the earliest form of singing or spell may be connected with
cursing Some forms of cursing or imprecation invoke the assistance of
the gods but not all and it may be that those are the earliest which
operate directly and without reference to gods Caliban invokes no gods
when he cries

    All the infections that the sun sucks up
    From bogs fens flats on Prosper fall and make him
    By inchmeal a disease

or

                  a southwest blow on ye
    And blister you all oer

And generally speaking we may say that what makes cursing terrible
and appalling to the ears on which it falls is not any reference to
the gods that it may containfor such references maybe absentbut
the fear or horror the man inspires If he inspires none his curses
go unregarded If they do terrify it is because they are felt to have
some power Precisely the same difference and for precisely the same
reason obtains in the case of witchcraft and magic Some who practise
it are feared others are not and the reason is that some are believed
to have the power to do the mischief and others not But if witchcraft
and cursing are both terrible because of the fear they inspire and
the power they imply and if so far they resemble each other or even
possibly have a common psychological origin they soon begin to follow
different lines of evolution The essence of cursing is that it
is open and loud and except when taken up into religion is not
ceremonialized or formalized whereas the essence of magic is that
it is secret in what it does and its singing is a repeated or
rhythmical muttering in a low voice The mere words May your heart
be rent asunder may be a curse or a spell and in either case if
they are feared power is attributed to the person who utters them
Psychologically it is probable that belief in the power is due to the
fear that is felt But when the belief has been established that a
certain person possesses the power then the belief in the power in its
turn engenders fear

The belief is that the magician or witch has the power to do things
In Macbeth the first witch says

    But in a sieve Ill thither sail
    And like a rat without a tail
    Ill do Ill do and Ill do

In the Romance languages there is a series of words for magic and
witchcraft going back to the Latin facio all expressing this idea
of Ill do and Ill do and implying that the witch has the power
to dothe Middle Latin factura Italian fattura Old French
faiture c And in the IndoEuropean languages there are several
sets of words for magic and witchcraft all expressing this same idea
and indicating that it goes back to the earliest IndoEuropean times
One set running through Sanskrit Lithuanian and Old Slavonic implies
as the Sanskrit kty shows that magic is action or doing
The Old Norse grningar sorceries or witchcraft literally means
doing and in Old Slavonic the word for magic potvor is derived
from a verb meaning to do As illustrating the belief that the witch
has power I may refer to Canidias words in the Epodes xvii 

                          et polo
    deripere Lunam vocibus possim meis
    possim crematos excitare mortuos

or to Medeas in Ovid Met vii 

                            iubeoque
    et mugire solum manesque exire sepulcris

and Rem Am 

    tumulo prodire iubebitur umbra

Still more clearly does Plato in the Laws  A testify to
the belief in the power of the witch or magician those who dare to do
injury by  or singing are encouraged to do so by the belief
that they have the power to do so   and their
victims are thoroughly convinced that they are injured because those
who practise on them have the power to bewitch them   
    

To sum up then thus far a magician is a person feared and having
power which power he exercises in secret muttering in a low voice
May your heart be rent asunder or your head be split open and so
on And this muttering is the carmen the incantatio the 
the  and the  of the Greeks and Romans the singing of
the Australian black fellows That this magical singing continued
down to late classical and postclassical times to be a whispering or
a murmuring in a low voice is easily shown A lex Cornelia condemned
those qui susurris magicis homines occiderunt Just Inst iv 
 In Ovid we have carmen magico demurmurat ore Met xiv
 and placavit precibusque et murmure longo ib vii  in
Tibullus i   iam tenet infernas magico stridore catervas
where stridor  murmur as in Sil Ital viii  in Apuleius
Metamorph i  magico susurramine amnes  reverti and de
Magia c  et carminibus murmurata and in Aristaenetus Ep
ii       
  and in the Greek magical papyri  
and  have the same meaning and use Wessely Pap CXXI


I have next to note that in Australia and the Torres Straits the
magician not only mutters words but points in the direction of his
victim with a stick bone or spear This gesture seems to be as
essential to the desired effect as the singing itself The fact seems
to be that the pointing of the stick is a piece of gesturelanguage
conveying the same idea as the words that are sung in both the power
of the magician goes forth and strikes the victim rending his heart
or splitting his head The question then arises whether we have in
GraecoItalian magic anything that corresponds to this pointing as
it is termed in Australia and to the stick thus pointed at the person
to be bewitched or enchanted I can only suggest that the 
or virga with which in the Odyssey x   c Circe
works witchcraft or Hermes both in the Iliad xxiv  and the
Odyssey v  entrances men or Athene transforms Ulysses xvi
 may possibly be a literary version or survival of the primitive
pointingstick become a magic wand A wand is a common part of a
magicians outfit

The blow or thrust which the magician executes with his pointingstick
or staff is supposed to inflict the injury on his victim and nothing
more may be required or done But usually the magician is not content
merely to point his stick in the direction of his victim To make
sure that the blow reaches the head or the heart he makes a rough
image of his victim out of clay or wax or wood and stabs that in the
appropriate place In doing so the savage confusesand even civilized
man does not yet always satisfactorily discriminate betweenthe
categories of likeness and identity The blow which the magician
intends to inflict and the thrust which he actually deals with his
pointingstick are like and are meant to be identical and are
believed to be so and if he has power they prove to be identical
The image also is to the mind of the believer not merely like but
in some manner identical with the victim who suffers and is consumed
like as and to the same degree as the image and at the very same
moment The Ojibway Indian believes that wherever the needle pierces
or the arrow strikes the image his foe will the same instant be seized
with a sharp pain in the corresponding part of his body Frazer G
B i  I need not quote instances from Australia or Africa to
corroborate this but as indicating that the practice goes back to
IndoEuropean times I may refer to the Rigveda iii  and the
AtharvaVeda i   and for a Latin parallel to the Indian image
pierced by a needle I need only refer to Ovid Heroides vi

    et miserum tenuis in iecur urget acus

For the Greek use of waxen images I may refer to Plato who in the
Laws  B speaks of the alarm felt by men   
     and for other instances to O
Kehr Quaest Mag Spec  f In Theocritus the wax which is spoken
of  is not indeed described as an image but it doubtless was
and the mention of it may serve as an excuse for remarking that though
the details into which magic is worked out by different peoples vary
considerably and though the applications which different peoples make
of it are far from uniform still amongst all peoples there are two
matters with which magic always without exception dealsLove and
Death Thus far it is with the latter that I have dealt I now for the
moment turn to the former and I propose to indicate briefly that the
magical methods of procuring Love are precisely the same as those for
procuring Death The power which is used for the one end is equally
potent for the other

For Deathmagic as we have seen it is essential that the person
working magic should believe that he has the power and that others
also should believe him to have it and all that is necessary is that
the magician should put forth the power that he possesses and this he
does by means of words and gesturelanguage So too in Lovemagic in
the Torres Straits the essential thing is that the young man should
anoint himself on the temples with a paste made from certain plants
and think as intently as possible about the girl Expedition to
Torres Straits vi  saying to himself You come you come you
come for Mr Haddon tells us the power of words and the projection
of the will were greatly believed in by the natives  and when a
young man performed the foregoing operations at a dance or any meeting
at which women would be present the girl could not resist but was
bound to go with him  In Rome there was the same belief in the
power of words Virgil in Eclogue viii imitates Theocritus but
deviates in details and one such deviation shows the Romans belief in
the power of words of the carmen Whereas Theocritus says

            

Virgil says

    Ducite ab urbe domum mea carmina ducite Daphnin

So too the power of the spell is attested by Propertius iv  

    O utinam magicae nossem cantamina Musae

and Ovid Her vi 

    Nec facie meritisve placet sed carmina novit

and Seneca Herc Oet 

    Flectemus illum carmina invenient iter

and Lucan vi 

    Carmine Thessalidum dura in praecordia fluxit
    Non fatis addictus amor

and Tibullus i  

    Quid queror heu misero carmen nocuisse quid herbas

In the next place as Deathmagic was considered to gain in efficiency
if the magician did not merely point with his stick in the direction
of his foe but made an image and wounded it so Lovemagic used a
waxen image and by melting it consumed with love the person imaged

                            Haec ut cera liquescit
    Uno eodemque igni sic nostro Daphnis amore
                               Ecl viii 

And in Horace the waxen image is thrown into the
flames and consumed

                    imagine cerea
    Largior arserit ignis
                            Sat i  

Where sickness and deaths following on sickness are ascribed to the
action of some malevolent person possessing and exercising mysterious
power that is to say are explained as being due to magic the
assumption evidently made is that death from sickness is an occurrence
which would not take place in the ordinary course of nature and which
therefore must be due to some person who has the power and the art to
disturb the ordinary course of nature This conception of magic is of
course not confined to the lower stages of culture we find it in the
definition of the magician given by Quintilian cuius ars est ire
contra naturam Declamationes x sub fin The cure for sickness
naturally presents itself as consisting in counteracting the power of
the person who produced it Some one must be procured who possesses
power equally great or greater and he employs his power in the same
way as the person who produced the sickness but to the opposite end
The author of the sickness sings his victim that is rhythmically
mutters in a low voice May your heart be rent asunder c and as
Mr Haddon tells us of the Torres Straits natives thinks as intently
as possible  or projects his will Now amongst the
IndoEuropean peoples the person who cured the sickness proceeded in
exactly the same way he too had a carmen an  with which to
sing his patient According to the AtharvaVeda iv  he sang

    Let marrow join to marrow and let limb to limb be joined
    Grow flesh that erst had pined away and now grow every bone also
    Marrow now unite with marrow and let hide on hide increase

And the wellknown Merseburg charm employs much the same formulae Let
bone to bone and blood to blood and limb to limb be joined Probably
Catos charm or carmen auxiliaregood for luxatis membriswas of
this kind Pliny Nat Hist xxviii  In the Avesta healing
by singing has a special word for its designationmrbaaza In
the Odyssey xix  the  by which the flow of blood from
Odysseuss wound was stayed was a singing of the same kind Amongst
the Romans Pliny says Hist Nat xxviii  carmina quaedam
exstant contra grandines contraque morborum genera And the Greek word
 bears double evidence to the same effect its etymological
connexion with Lithuanian words meaning to sing in this sense shows
that it was originally an  a charm or a countercharm and it
is used throughout Greek literature to connote both bane and antidote

           
                                 Od iv 

The Latin mederi medicus medicina like the corresponding term
vimaay in the Avesta go back to a root meaning wisdomthe
wisdom of the wise woman The name Medea belongs to the same stock
and means wise woman and the wisdom presumably consisted originally
in the knowledge of the charms or carmina contra morborum genera
and simples just as the  or  may have got his name from 
and the fact that he dealt in drugs which might according as they were
used be either the bane or the antidote That in Greece the 
originally effected his cures by means of spells soothing spells is
indicated by Pindar Pyth iii  who is doubtless reproducing the
popular belief when he says that Chiron loosed and rescued his patients
from divers pangs

                       
           
    

In all ages suggestion has operated for good in medical treatment
but it operates only so far as the patient believes that his healer
has power and exercises that power to do him good The medicineman
in early times exercises that power either by gestures which indicate
that power is going from him or by the words with which he banishes or
overcomes the sickness And in either case he effects his faithhealing
in exactly the same way as the evilminded possessor of magical power
causes sickness and death by word and gesture by singing and
pointing

To the mind of the believer in magic the image of a man is not merely
like him but is in a mysterious way identical with him so that blows
dealt on the image are felt by the man and the man and his image are
as closely related to one another as is the exterior of a curve to the
interior and so to the mind of the believer in magic the relation
of a mans name to the man himself is equally intimate and close
Hence by way of precaution the name of a man is often kept a profound
secret The same secrecy too may be observed about the name of a god
or of a city It would not be surprising therefore if the name of a
man were put by the magician to the same use as his image for the name
is if anything even more intimately identified with the man than any
likeness of him can be and as a matter of fact the secrecy which is
often observed about the name of a man or a god is observed because
control of the name is assumed and believed to involve control over the
person If therefore the image of a man can be used for malevolent
purposes by a magician so too may his name The savages objection
to being photographed as is well known is due to the feeling that
with his likeness he himself passes into the power of the possessor I
need hardly point out that pictorial signs and writing and runes are
regarded at first by those who do not understand them as mysterious
and magical as   The written name of a person is as
intimately bound up with the persons identity as his likeness or a
waxen image of him The name may therefore be used by the magician for
the same purposes and in the same way as the image If the magician
can as the aborigines of Victoria do draw on the ground a rude
likeness of the victim Frazer G B i  if in Eastern Java
an enemy may be killed by means of a likeness of him drawn on a piece
of paper which is then incensed or buried in the ground ib  it
is obvious that his name which is identical with him may be treated
in the same way and with the same result It may be written down and
stabbed or incensed or buried in the ground and the desired result
will be produced Now just as the Ojibway Indian pierces the image of
his enemy with a needle so the Greek or the Roman wrote down the name
of his enemy drove a nail into it and then buried it in the ground
This proceeding was called  or defixio Nailed him was
doubtless the comforting reflection which accompanied the final blow of
the hammer That it was the name which was nailed just as the image
was pierced by the needle is not a matter of inference one of the
tablets of this kind which have come down to us C I A Appendix
continens defixionum tabellas  expressly says line  
 And to leave no room for doubting that to nail the name of the
enemy was to nail the enemy himself just as piercing his image with
a needle was to pierce the enemy himself the inscription says 
   I nail his name that is himself The identity
of name and person is thus expressly proclaimed and it is precisely
parallel to the identity of the person and his image or likeness
which we find to be assumed wherever magic is found to exist

Perhaps I should remark in passing that other things besides a persons
name or image may be nailed or defixed His footprints may be and
are thus treated both by savages and by European peasants In the same
way we learn from Pliny Nat Hist xxviii  the epilepsy which
had attacked a man might be nailed down and the patient cured by
driving an iron nail into the spot touched by the head of the patient
when he fell clavum ferreum defigere in quo locum primum caput
fixerit corruens morbo comitiali absolutorium eius mali dicitur And
there can be little doubt that this kind of defixion goes back to
very early Italian times for from of old when a pestilence raged
a consul might drive a nail into the wall of the Celia Iovis and so
the pestilence was stayed Perhaps the clavus trabalis which was an
attribute of dira Necessitas Horace Odes i   iii  
belongs to the same range of ideas cf Kuhnerts article on Defixio
in Paulys RealEncyclopdie

Here too I should perhaps say that as the defixionum tabellae have
nails driven through them there can be little doubt that the verb
 and the substantives  and  must be used in
the sense of hammering a nail in or fastening with a nail as Pindar
uses the simple verb  in   Pyth iv  and are not
used in this connexion to mean simply tying up So too in D T
A      is shown by the convertible expression
    to mean pierce or nail and not tie up

As then the Ojibway Indian or the Australian black fellow or the
native of the Torres Straits does his magic without calling in any
god to his assistance so too the Greek could nail his man without
applying to the gods and we have ample inscriptional evidence that he
did so Nearly onethird of the Attic tablets contain merely proper
names with a nail driven into them and about onethird more contain
the statement  or  without any reference to gods of
any sort or kind The Latin tablets of the same kind which like the
Attic tablets are of lead and have nails driven through them also
frequently contain merely proper names and nothing more Of this kind
evidently were those mentioned by Tacitus Ann ii  carmina et
devotiones et nomen Germanici plumbeis tabulis insculptum It is true
that the tablets which have been discovered have mostly been found in
tombs But if we were to seek to found on this fact an argument that
the tabletswhere they mention no godswere addressed to the dead
we should have first to show that such tablets were never deposited
elsewhere than in tombs As a matter of fact a magical papyrus CXXI
vs  gives instructions as to where a tablet of this kind should be
deposited viz            
We see therefore a plain reason why most of the tablets that have been
preserved have been found in tombs many possibly most were thrown
into rivers or the sea or disused wells   
Pap Anast  as in Scotland the clay figure of your enemy is or
was placed in a burn Albany Review iii  p  and therefore
have not been preserved to us

They have been rarely discovered by us for the simple reason that the
person who hid them away was particularly anxious that they should not
be discovered It was important that the person defixed should not
know by whom or in what way he had been defixed for if he knew
he might undo the spell and retaliate on its worker The tablet was
concealedoften enough in tombs for graves are avoidedfor the same
reason that the authors of these tablets often take care not to put
their own names to them viz in order that the spell might not be
frustrated But though we cannot attach any great importance to the
fact that most of our tablets have been found in tombs still it is
true that many of the Attic tablets and perhaps most of the Latin
tablets contain a direct and explicit appeal to the gods Hence it
is possible to maintain and indeed it is usually maintained as by
Wuensch in the Corpus Inscriptionum Atticarum that in all cases
these tablets are addressed to the gods and that where no gods are
mentioned we must yet suppose that the gods or some gods were prayed
to fulfil the evil wishes of the person who wrote the name of his
victim and pierced it with the nail The alternative which I venture
to suggest is that originally the defixio or  was purely
magical that later an appeal to the gods was added to the original
spell and last of all the magical element was overpowered by the
religious or the religious by the magical In order to decide between
these two alternative explanations what we have to do is to inquire
who it is that is supposed by the writer of a tablet of this kind to
nail or defix or pierce the person who is to suffer Is it the writer
of the tablet or is it a god If it is the writer the proceeding is
magical in its nature if a god it is religious in its nature From
this point of view we may go so far as to concede that the absence of
any mention of the gods on the tablet does not of itself suffice to
prove that no thought of them was present in the mind of the writer of
the tablet The decisive question is Who does the nailing or defixing
Has the writer the power to do it or must he get a god to do it The
question is perfectly simple and the answer is perfectly plain in
many or most of the Attic tablets it is the writer who has the power
and he exercises it He says     
    and he exercises his power with no more
reference to the gods and no more thought of them than the Australian
magician when he points his stick or the German peasant girl when
she sticht um Mitternacht in eine unter Beschwrungen angezndete
Kerze einige Nadeln und spricht ich stech das Licht ich stech das
Licht ich stech das Herz das ich liebe Schnwerth Aus der
Oberpfalz Sitten und Sagen i p 

On the other hand are the tablets in which the writer does not profess
to defix his adversary and does not claim to be able to defix him
but prays to a god to do it and uses an imperative  
      xxiii

In such tablets the modus operandi is no longer magical it is wholly
religious the power to punish lies wholly with the gods and they are
called upon to exercise it And we are able to trace the process by
which the one kind of tablet passed into the other or by which the
one kind came to supersede the other The first step in the process
is illustrated by tablets in which the writer begins by announcing in
the traditional magical style I nail or bind my enemies but goes
onin order to make assurance doubly sureto add an appeal to a god
or gods Thus in  he says       
One of these inscriptions  can be dated back to the fourth century
BC When Hermes is thus adjured he is nearly always decorated
with the epithet  as in      
  The epithet is not an idle one as is shown by the fact
that the corresponding verb  is used in these tablets in the
imperative in the same sense as  Thus in  the prayer to
Hermes runs        Hermes
however is not the only deity to whom the epithet is applied and
this imperative addressed In  G is termed   and in 
the prayer is     It so happens that in
the tablets that have come down to us Hermes and G are the only two
deities of whom the epithet  and the verb  are used and
Boeckh was probably right in saying C I G  that the earth and
Hermes were originally and we may add without any reference to magic
at all called  because they kept down the dead and prevented
them from returning Then when the magical practice of nailing down
or binding your living foe developed by an easy transition of ideas
the deities whose business it had originally been to hold down the
dead alone were invoked to hold down and restrain the living also
vocis vis ad  rationem translata videtur ut iam 
 essent ii qui defixos a magis homines detinerent Thus Earth
and Hermes were called in to reinforce the magicians  This
is indeed expressly stated on a leaden tablet discovered in Alexandria
Wuensch p xv         
          
 That the gods are called in to give effect to a magical rite
which has been performed is shown by inscriptions  and  where the
tablet begins by saying that the magical rite has been performed 
         and then goes on to
pray to the god      Here the prayer to
the gods is in effect a postscript to the magical rite So too in
Ovid Fasti ii  a ceremony of this kind which is performed
as part of the worship of the Dea Muta ends up with the declaration
that weviz the old woman who has performed the ritewe hostiles
linguas inimicaque vinximus ora she has used an iron nail and driven
it through the head of a maena But the tendency which manifests
itself in the evolution of the Attic tablets is for the postscript
to grow in importance and size until the magic dwindles and almost
disappears For instance  does indeed begin by saying formally
  but the whole of the rest of the inscription is a
genuine prayer        While recognizing
however that this is the tendency in the genuine Attic tablets it
is desirable to notice that in the Roman empire generally the magical
element swells until it entirely drives out the religious All kinds
of deity from religions of every sort are indeed invoked in these
later inscriptions both Greek and Latin But they are invoked only
to receive commands from the magician and to do his will in the
Hadrumetan tablet of the third century AD the deity adjured
is just told to go off and fetch Urbanus    
   Wuensch p xvii and the lady who thus addresses
him has the power to order him about because she knowsand bids him
hearken toan       And he is to
lose no time about it the inscription ends    

Thus the history of these defixionum tabellae shows how a ceremony
in its origin purely magical may in the course of its evolution run
out in either of two directions it may either end in what is in effect
a prayer or it may develop into that form of magic in which the
magician undertakes boldly to constrain the gods In the earliest and
purely magical form of defixion the witch or wizard drives a nail
or a needle through the written name of the victim just as he would
through a waxen image of the victim From Ovid Amores iii  
we learn that the witch wrote the victims name on wax and then pierced
it sagave poenicea defixit nomina cera In the Parisian Papyrus
 it is     which is thus treated and in a Latin
defixion the expression is neca illa nomina Fahz de poetarum
Romanorum doctrina magica p  n  Then as the worker of magic
drove nails through the head of the waxen image and is instructed
in the Parisian Papyrus Rhein Mus xlix  ff to say as he
does so     so in the Attic tablets he says
       and drives a nail or nails
through the leaden tablet bearing the words Again as in course of
time the piercing or melting of the waxen image comes to be regarded
not as effective in itself but as merely symbolical of the effect which
is to be produced and the words come to be haec ut cera liquescit
sic nostro Daphnis amore so in the defixionum tabellae e g C
I L viii suppl n  after the gods have been adjured and
the order given      then to make it quite
clear it is explained that the legs and hands and head of the victim
are to be defixed or nailed down in the same way as the feet and
hands and head of this fowl      
            
          This
tablet which was found in Carthage is late and the adjuration is
made in the name of the god of heaven that sits upon the Cherubim 
    What is noticeable in this tablet and some
others of similar date and style is that they contain no allegation
that the person on whose behalf the magic is worked and constraint is
put upon the gods has been wronged On the other hand in the earlier
and Attic tablets especially those which tend in effect to become
prayers the ground of appeal to the gods is some wrong that has been
done Thus  ends with the words      
      Or it may be some injury
that is feared        
then         In Cyprus if what
an adversary might say is feared then the powers invoked are adjured
to muzzle him     and the exorcism is
termed a   or a   It is of
course probable we may even venture to say certain that in these
tablets the appeal to the justice of the gods is essentially religious
in its character And in that case the combination in these tablets
of magic with religion shows that in the minds of some worshippers
of the gods there was no irreconcilable opposition between magic and
religion On the contrary the feeling evidently was that the gods
might properly be invoked to favour and bless a magical rite just as
they might be prayed to assist any other steps of a more ordinary
nature that might be taken Magic is but one way or means of effecting
your end and it is a means which is just as efficacious for a good
end as it is for an evil purpose The magician is a person who has
power which he may use for evil or may use for good He may use his
power to cause sickness or to bring misfortune But he may use it to
avert sickness and to muzzle the mouth of the evildoer He may use it
to make rain and while doing so may pray to the gods for the same
purpose Such a man may have as he is certainly often believed to
have extraordinary personal power and there is no obvious reason why
he should not pray to the gods to exercise that power in accordance
with their will But he can only pray to the gods if there are gods to
whom he can pray On the other hand even where there are such gods
he may preferand if his purpose be such as the gods condemn he
must preferto disregard the gods or if needs be to put constraint
upon them That is to say the extraordinary personal power which
he possesses or is believed to possess is not in itself either
necessarily religious or necessarily irreligious It may become or
come to be regarded as either the one or the other If it is regarded
or rather so far as it is regarded as irreligious it is condemned
Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live is exactly paralleled by the
Athenian law quoted by Demosthenes     
     c Aristogit i  If we start
from this point of view nothing seems more reasonable than to assert a
fundamental opposition between magic and religion On the other hand
if we consider the beneficent use which is made of magic and the fact
that as in the defixion tablets already quoted magic and religion may
and do work harmoniously together the relation between them does not
seem to be fundamentally one of opposition The fact would seem to be
that this extraordinary personal power as it is in itself neither good
nor bad but becomes the one or the other according as it is used for
good ends or for bad so it is in itself neither magical nor religious
but comes to be regarded as religious if used in the service of the
gods and as magic if used otherwise But it is not until gods are
believed in that this power can be used in their service or regarded
as their gift only when belief in the gods has arisen can the person
possessing power be regarded as having derived his power from them or
believe himself so to have derived it It may well be that his power
confirms his belief and strengthens it it may perhaps even be that
his power is the first thing to awaken him to belief in gods and to
the possibility of communing with them in his heart But the belief
that there are superior beings with whom it is possible to commune in
ones heart is not the same thing as the extraordinary personal power
which some men exert over others Such belief and such power may indeed
go together but they do not by any means always go together and
accordingly the power cannot be regarded as the cause of the belief

Again it is not until men come to believe that there are gods who
have the interests of their worshippers at heart that the man who
possesses this power and uses it for evil purposes can be condemned by
the opinion of the community as one who works against the community
and therefore against the god who protects the community In other
words we may say that this extraordinary personal power does not
come to be regarded as magicindeed that magic does not come into
existenceuntil religion has come into existence When exercised
by a man of God it is religious when exerted by any one else
it is magical The magician may use and more often than not does
use his power in a way injurious to other members of the community
and therefore offensive to the god under whose protection they are
From this point of view therefore we may justifiably speak of a
fundamental opposition between magic and religion On the other hand
though the magician ordinarily uses his power to injure people he is
not restricted to this use of it His power may be used to recall an
errant lover as it is by the lady in the Hadrumetan tablet already
quoted or for the recovery of lost or stolen property One of the
defixion tablets is directed to the recovery of    
           I G
S I  another seeks to recover     
  Bechtel  or       
  Bechtel  The magician that is to say may use
his power for innocent and even laudable purposes Hence it is that
magic is not wholly condemned by any community in which it flourishes
and hence it is that we find magic reinforced by religion not only
in the defixionum tabellae as has already been pointed out but
in numerous rites of uncultured peoples and from time to time as
survivals in the religious ceremonies of civilized nations If we
dwell upon this set of facts exclusively we shall be in danger of
inferring not a fundamental opposition but a fundamental identity
between magic and religion Yet as we have seen the opposition is
quite as marked as the similarity and this seems to indicate that the
extraordinary personal power which some men possess or are believed to
possess is fundamentally the same whether it is or whether it is not
exercised in the service of the gods of the community but the spirit
in which it is used when employed in the one way is fundamentally
opposed to that in which it is used in the other Such power may in the
course of evolution come to be regarded or come to manifest itself
either as religious or as magical But in itself and at the start
inasmuch as it may become either hereafter it is at the beginning
neither It is the powerwhether of suggestion or of actual
controlwhich some exceptional men exercise over others




LECTURE V

HERODOTUS AND ANTHROPOLOGY


Earlier lectures of this course have dealt with topics suggested by
the first civilization of the Aegean by the first literature of the
Greeks and by the survival in GraecoRoman culture of traces of a
quite unhellenic barbarism

Today we come to the fifth century and to the work of the man who
stands next after Homer as exponent on a generous scale of his
countrys thought and life Homer has shown us Aegean life in a lull
between the storms of the Age of Wanderings between the Achaean and
the Dorian Migrations Herodotus shows us adolescent Greece the child
of Earth and Planet strangling like Heracles the snakes about its
cradle and rising thence to strike down Giants and Monsters and to
enter into its kingdom This kingdom for him is nothing less than
the   the orbis terrarum a rim of convergent coastlands
encircling the Midland Sea which is Our Sea

But there is this difference between Homer and Herodotus when we see
them from our present point of view Homer and to a great extent the
postHomeric Epic sang of the world in sheer delight of its objective
goodness Their contribution to anthropological science is the picture
which they have given of the world as they saw it and lived in it The
contribution of anthropology to them is an interpretation of that
picture based on comparative study of other worlds than theirs With
Herodotus too what first strikes the eye of the anthropological
reader is the wealth of detail about the manners and customs of Greeks
and their neighbours a collection unrivalled in Greek literature
before the Roman Age in extent and variety and quite unique in its
quality And for Herodotus too the first duty of anthropology is to
interpret his picture of mankind to illustrate by parallel cases
to extract by comparison the genuine observation from the blundered
folktale commentary to fill the blanks in the picture itself with
such fragments of fifthcentury knowledge as have been preserved
in other hands than his To do this adequately would require many
lectures even were his picture of ancient life far more complete than
it is and in the fragmentary state in which Herodotus has transmitted
our share of his knowledge the commentators difficulty is increased
manifold A sketch of a single custom a casual footnote to a footnote
of apparently disjointed matter may well need a monograph to itself I
need only instance for an Oxford public the two Herodotean papers in
last years Anthropological Essays presented to Edward Burnett Tylor

To this extent Herodotus falls into line with Homer as the subject
of lectures like these but in proportion as he is regarded so he
falls for this practical reason wholly beyond their scope But there
is another aspect of Herodotean anthropology which is almost wholly
absent from Homeric and is only partially present even in Hesiodic
Between Homer and Herodotus Greek Reason has come into the world
After Homer Greek literature whether poetry or prose has its
subjective its reflective side Man has become the measure of all
things and things are worth observing and recordingthey become
   or the reverse according as they do or do not
amplify human knowledge already acquired or prompt or guide human
attempts to classify and interpret them In this high meaning of the
word all Greek thought and records are utilitarian relative to an end
in view and this end is ever anthropocentric it is nothing less but
it is also nothing more than the Good Life the Wellbeing of Mankind
On this broad ground preSocratic and Socratic thought are at one
alike Hellenic in spirit because alike utilitarian It is not for
this that I speculate said Thales when he struck oil It was
precisely for this to make philosophy useful that Socrates brought it
from heaven down to earth

So what is proposed in this lecture is to attempt an answer to the
question How far was a science of anthropology in the sense in which
we understand it contemplated as possible in the Great Age of Greece
What were the principles on which it rested How far had Herodotus and
his contemporaries gone in the way of realizing their conceptions of
such a science And what were the causes external to the study itself
which helped or hindered their realization of it

It will be clear I think from the outset that this inquiry has
nothing to do with the question whether this or that observation on
the part of Herodotus was accurately made or not The only way in
which Herodotean error or malignity will concern us at all is if the
sources of an error can be so far exposed as to betray what he
was thinking about when he made it For there are two kinds of
anthropologists as there are two kinds of workers in every department
of knowledge But in a science which is still in so infantile a stage
as ours there is more than common distinctness between them

There is an anthropologist to whom we go for our facts the painful
accurate observer of data the storehouse of infinite detail sometimes

  To him we go for our facts His views may matter
little his great book may be put together upon whatever ephemeral
hypothesis he may choose We learn his doctrine as we master the method
of an index it will guide us more or less securely to the data we
want but it is the document in the footnote that we are looking for
and the compilers voucher express or implicit that in his judgement
this is evidence

And there is an anthropologist to whom we look for our light His
learning may be fragmentary as some men count learning his memory
faulty his inaccuracy beyond dispute his inconsistency the one
consistent thing about him But with shattered and rickety instruments
he attains results heedless of epicycles disrespectful to the
equator he bequeaths his paradoxes to be demonstrated by another
generation of men He may not know or reason perhaps but he has
learnt to see and what he sees he says For he too is a only
in another sensea Walking Tabernacle of the Nine

There have been anthropologists in our own time and before who have
come near to combine both excellences and in none perhaps are they
wholly severed Least of all do we expect to find both wholly present
or wholly absent in one who has in a sense fallen into anthropology
by an accident and created one science while he pursued another art
In the Greek compiler who made this the plan of his researches to
procure that human acts should not be obliterated by time and that
great deeds wrought some by the Greeks some by men of other speech
should not come to lose their fame we cannot but see a man who
meantwith good or ill successto be in the best sense a mine of
information But it is the same Herodotus who put it before him in his
titlepage to discover besides the reason why they fought with one
another and that is why we hail him Father of Anthropology no less
than the Father of History

Either Herodotus knew himself to be hewing out a new avenue of
knowledge a new vista across the world or he knew himself to be
speaking to an audience of men who themselves were  That
is the alternative for those who are moved to deny his originality If
Herodotus was not in advance of his age then his age was abreast of
Herodotus It becomes therefore our first duty to ask what evidence
we possess as to the phase in which the fifth century held in mind the
problems which for us are anthropological Now apart from the
Tragedians and Pindar Herodotus as we know to our discomfiture is
the only preSocratic thinker whose works have been preserved in
bulk and even his as we are well assured are preserved only in
bulk not in their entirety So even the sceptic is driven back upon
the alternative either of arguing from silence and lacunae or of
disproving the originality of Herodotus from his very proficiency in
the subject

But what can we learn of the state of anthropological knowledge in the
days before Herodotus wrote

The task of the anthropologist is in its essence to find an answer to
these principal questionsWhat is Man What kinds of Men are there
and how and by what agencies are they formed and distributed over the
lands as we find them How is human life propagated under parental
sanction maintained by social institutions and made tolerable by
useful arts And what part if any do either  or  or 
play in defining these processes and the general career of Mankind as
an animal species

Problems such as these were bound to present themselves sooner or
later to so reasonable a people as the Greeks There is no doubt that
they were already so familiar in the fourth century as to be almost
obsolete as problems Otherwise we should find more importance
attached to them in the writings of Plato and Aristotle The question
before us now is rather how early did they present themselves what
methods were applied to deal with them and how far had Greek thought
gone towards a solution when Socrates stepped down from his
Cloudbasket and substituted psychology as the proper study of Mankind

To those who are familiar with the early phases of Greek physical
inquiry it is needless to repeat in detail how closely this movement
was bound up in its origin with that great exploratory movement which
littered the shores of the Mediterranean from Tarsus to Tartessus
and from the Tanais to the Nile with Greek factories and settlements
and brought all climates lands and varieties of men within the
scope of one encyclopaedic vision how the compilers of Circuits
of the World had surveyed all shores of their own Sea how the
specialists had treated Air Water and Places if I may antedate
the later catchtitle in accordance with the principles of their
respective sciences and how on the other limit of knowledge Milesian
chronologers and astronomersthe latter with no small glimpses into
the storehouse of Babylonian observationhad begun to make just
such maps of all time human and geological as Milesian cartographers
were making of all the sea and all the rivers Can we doubt that
in a movement of national inquiry of this intensity and scope the
question was raised of the origin the distribution and the modes of
subsistence of Man

Direct evidence of the existence of an Ionian anthropology has evaded
us for the most part Yet earlier still we have the proof that
something of the kind was stirring Hesiod presents us already with
a standard scheme of archaeology in which Ages of Gold Silver and
Bronze succeed each other classified by their respective artefacts
and succeeded first by an Age of Heroesan anomaly partly of Homeric
authority partly genuine tradition of the Sea Raids and the Minoan
dbcleand then by an Age of Iron More than this the observation
that primitive Man was a forestdweller who grew no corn and
subsisted on acorns and beech mast presumes observation and inference
besides which were perhaps obvious enough among men of the Balkan
fringe ancient and modern but at the same time betrays a reasonable
interest and an eye for essentials which are far beyond the average
of archaic or barbarian speculation as to human origins

Some fragments indeed of this preSocratic anthropology have come
down to us directly and wherever they have done so they show the
same curious combination of folklore with mature insight as do the
views about nonhuman nature which are assigned to the same school
The belief for example that human beings originated not by animal
procreation but by the operation of trees and rocks on women passing
by hardly differs in kind from the beliefs imputed to the Arunta and
the Hesiodic belief that the men of Aegina were descended from ants
or men in general from stones dropped by Deucalion and Pyrrha to
totemic beliefs or survivals But the views ascribed to Anaximander
and later to Archelaus both of Miletus show something very far in
advance of mere folklore The lower animals were commonly believed to
have been produced by spontaneous generation the effect of the suns
heat on moist earth slime or sea water Anaximander added the
descriptive generalization based on observations on the shores of
the sea about Miletus and the Maeander silt that these lower forms
began their cycle of existence encysted in prickly integuments and
then at maturity came out upon drier ground and shed their shells
but still went on living for a short while The older belief as we
have seen was that men too originated in this way either directly or
from some invertebrate form like the ants of Aegina But Anaximander
pointed out an obvious difficulty and supplied also a solution of it
Man he said was produced in the first instance from animals of
a different sort and this he argued from the fact that the other
animals soon get their food for themselves and Man alone needs a long
period of nursing for which very reason a creature of this sort could
not possibly have survived Here we must note first that a special
creation of human beings ready made and mature as Hebrew thinkers
conjectured and Greek poets had devised in the case of Pandora was
unthinkable to an Ionian naturalist and merely does not come into
question secondly that a special creation of human beings in infancy
is equally ruled out by the fact of the long helplessness of the human
infant thirdly that the inevitable alternative is accepted without a
hint of hesitation namely that Mankind must have developed from some
other kind of animal which though not human could and did fend for
its young during such an infancy as Mans Only unacquaintance with the
great apes of the tropical world and very imperfect acquaintance even
with imported monkeys can have prevented Anaximander from assigning
to Man his proper place in an evolutionary Order of Primates The
other half of our knowledge of Anaximanders anthropology is even more
instructive It is clear he says that men were first produced
within fishes and nourished like the mud fish 
  and when they were competent to fend for themselves
were thereupon cast on shore or perhaps hatched out and took to
the land Our knowledge of the  is limited but the parallel
passage throws some light on Anaximanders theory The animals came
into existence by a process of evaporation by the sun but man came
into existence in the likeness of another animal namely a fish to
begin with Here the theory is clearly that there was a stage in
the evolution of Man when he ceased to conform to the type even of the
highest of marine animals and it was in the guise of some kind of
fish that he took to the land It is not so clear whether we have here
merely the conjecture that at some stage marine vertebrates took the
crucial step and invaded the dry land or whether also the similitude
of the mudfish is used to report observations which are familiar
enough to embryologists now and in the fifth century were no less
familiar to Hippocrates In any case the views in points of detail
which are reported as characteristic of Anaximander presuppose an
almost Darwinian outlook on the animal kingdom and an understanding
of comparative anatomy which hardly becomes possible again before the
Renaissance

No less striking is the testimony of the fragment of Archelaus one
of the immediate teachers of Socrates to the same evolutionary view
Concerning animals he said that when the earth became warm in the
beginning in its lower part where the hot and the cold were mixed
there came to light the rest of the animals of many dissimilar kinds
but all with the same mode of life maintained of the slime and they
were shortlived But afterwards interbreeding occurred among these
and men were separated off from the rest and they constituted leaders
and customs and arts and cities and so forth And he says reason
is implanted in all animals alike for each uses it according to his
bodily frame one more tardily another more promptly Here again
we have the biological theory of evolution in a most explicit form
with the same distinction as in Anaximander between the shortlived
infusorian almost amorphous fauna of sunwarmed water or slime and
the higher orders of thinking vertebrates among whom Man stands merely
as an exceptionally rational species

After this it is almost needless to note that the physical
anthropology of the Greeks was quite unimpeded by those literary
misconceptions which so long retarded the study of Man in the modern
world Hecataeus indeed had at one time been misled by the shortness
of Greek pedigrees but his Egyptian researches gave him in good time
the larger perspective as even his critic Herodotus admits And
the first reporter of the fact that Egypt is the gift of the Nile
can hardly have failed to see the bearing of this piece of geology
upon the question of the antiquity of Man Herodotus at all events
has no illusions Achelous and other rivers are there to show that
the Nile is no freak of nature time future can be postulated to the
extent of twenty thousand years and time past may be measured on the
same scale for the perfecting of the Niles gift not to mention the
further periods required for the deposit of the shells in the Pyramid
limestone More explicitly still he is prepared to allow indefinite
time for the development and dissemination of human varieties How
the Danubian Sigynnae came to be colonists of the Medes he is not
prepared to say but the thing itself is not in his view impossible
       

It is at this point in our story that we must look at the evidence of
Aeschylus Small as is that portion of his works which has come down to
us it is of high value both as a record of current knowledge and as
an indication of the contemporary phases of theory Already we have the
elements of the later threefold division of the anthropological horizon
corresponding essentially with the tricontinental scheme of the
geographers with which we know from a fragment of Prometheus Solutus
that Aeschylus was acquainted at a stage of its development which the
quotation fixes for us precisely Ethnologically the  are
as followsNorthwards are found the Hyperboreans Eastwards
lie the Indians they are camelriding nomads and live next to the
Aethiopians Southward come the Aethiopians proper with Egypt
the gift of the Nile and Libya The black skin of the Aethiopians
is suntanned Aethiopia embraces everything from the 
    to the    
  where the Sun rests his horses that is
from the southern margin of Asia where the Indians live to the far
SouthWest In front of the Aethiopians lie the Libyans in front of
the Indians the Empire of Persia for there are no Indians in the
Persae and Bactria is the remotest province in front of the
Hyperboreans the Scythians the Abioi of Homer and the Arimaspi all
nomad pastoral peoples

At the margin of ethnological Man sometimes merely unisexual
sometimes misanthrope stand the Amazons in the Supplices they
seem to stand for the North and they lie beyond Caucasus in
the Prometheus beyond that margin there are the oneeyed
breasteyed and dogheaded tribes of Hesiod and of common report

Hesiodic too in its main outlines is the sketch of primitive Man in
the Prometheus with its hint of spontaneous generation and its
fourfold scheme of useful metals

But for Aeschylus the tribes of men are sundered rather by culture than
by race The two women in Atossas dream are like sisters in form and
figure it is by their dress that she knows one of them to be Persian
the other Greek So too the king in the Supplices knows the
Danaid chorus for foreign women by their dress They might be Amazons
for there are no men with them but no they carry no bows Stay
they do carry  that surely is Greek    
  Only in the second place comes language to decide in
a case where dress and accessories are indecisive and only when the
Danaids assure him that they are really Argive and of his own kin are
new doubts raised by their build and complexion and he questions
again whether they are Libyans with the Nile and the  
thrown in for the aesthetic types of Egyptian and GraecoAssyrian
art or Indians or Amazons outlanders that is of the South the
East or the North as we have seen

These preliminary notes have been designed to give such retrospect over
the course of Greek anthropological theory as our fragmentary sources
allow but they have been enough I hope to show where matters stood
in the lifetime of Herodotus and also to some degree what the burning
questionsor some of themwere Now we come to Herodotus himself to
take the elements of his anthropology in similar order and put them
into their respective places

First then Herodotus gives us for the first time a reasoned scheme
of ethnological criteria and it marks at once an advance on that of
Aeschylus and an important modification of it In the famous passage
where the Athenians reject the proposals of Alexander of Macedon
and against immense inducements refuse to desert the Greek cause
they state as their inducement the fourfold bond which holds a nation
together Greece they reply is of one blood and of one speech
and has dwellingplaces of gods in common and sacrifices to them and
habits of similar customs and that is why the Athenians cannot betray
their nation Common descent common language common religion and
common culture these are the four things which make a nation one and
conversely the things which if unconformable hold nations apart To
this analysis modern ethnology has little or nothing to add It might
be said as Professor Flinders Petrie has suggested that identity
of religious beliefs is in the last resort only a peculiarly refined
test of conformity of behaviour between man and man and that community
of culture beyond dumb interchange of artefacts is inconceivable
without community of speech But the mode of propagation both of
language and of religious observance differs so greatly in kind
from that of the transmission of material culture that the forcible
reduction of the four criteria of Herodotus to the two major criteria
of Physique and Culture fails us in practice almost as soon as it
is made So far as Herodotus presents us with an ordered scheme of
anthropological thoughtwith a science of anthropology in facthe is
little if at all behind the best thought of our own day

It is not I think pressing his language too far if we regard him as
stating these four criteria in what he regarded as the order of their
relative importance First for scientific as for political purposes
comes community of descent next community of language then community
of religion and general community of observance in daily life only
at the end of all Contrast with this the method of inquiry in the
Supplices where as we saw dress and equipment come first then
religious observance then language and physique is postponed to all
three That this is not accidental will be seen I think from an
example of the Herodotean anthropology when applied so to speak in
the field to the description of the northern Argippaei where each
successive criterion is introduced by  which is adversative to the
preceding clause Here the physical anthropology is given first
then the language which distinguishes these Argippaei from all other
men and so forms a cross division athwart the criterion of physique
then though they have a language of their own yet till they speak
to you you would not think it for their dress is Scythian but after
all Scythians they cannot be because no Scythian lives on treefruit
He is a pastoral nomad or at best an    Here 
 hold the last and lowest place and the cause of this is
plain for their witness agrees not together

There is a reason for this new emphasis on community of blood and of
language in the anthropology of Herodotus If the Persian War had shown
nothing else it had shown the superior efficiency of an army which was
mutually intelligible over one which might have met not in Kritalla
but in Shinar and even more forcibly it had impressed the belief
that what mattered was not equipment nor language but breed It was
the Persians who could survey and mark a sea channel like a modern
Admiralty and amazed their captive by those unfamiliar drugs and
shieldstraps made of silky linen which we call surgical bandages
but it was their prisoner Pytheus who amazed them by the physique and
the training which brought him through when he was literally mangled
to butchers meat

And there is another reason for this emphasis Right in sight of
Halicarnassus and hardly two hours sail lies the town of Cos and
in its agora today stands the great planetree of Hippocrates and
during the lifetime of Herodotus there was growing up there that latest
and fairest flower of preSocratic knowledge the Coan medical school
with an anatomy a physiology and an anthropology of its own superior
by far to anything which succeeded it until the seventeenth century

In what relation the professional science of Hippocrates stood to
the penumbral knowledge of Herodotus and also to the learning and
speculations of their predecessors may be illustrated from their
respective treatment of the phenomenon of beardlessness in Man

All Mediterranean peoples and all sedentary peoples of the European
mainland agree in this that their adult males have copious hair upon
the face Herodotus and his contemporaries had no means of foreseeing
that this was really the exception rather than the rule among human
varieties that neither the yellow nor the blackskinned races have
this appendage except in a rudimentary degree and in circumstances
which suggest contamination more or less direct with the white men
of the northwestern quadrant of the Old World Only the fact that
the Australians are hairier in face and person even than the whites
saves us from the temptation to adopt into anthropology the popular
superstition that the long beard is correlated with the superior brain
But for Herodotus and the Greek world beards on men were the rule and
beardlessness an abnormality to be explained

Now from Homeric times and before the Nearer East had been startled
by the raids of a warrior people governed and defended by beardless
creatures of wondrous horsemanship and archery their bows in
particular such as no mere man could use inspired moreover with a
fury like the fury of a woman against everything that showed a beard
Beyond the Caucasus they ate their prisoners in Tauris they killed
all men at the bidding of beardless leaders one band of them
penetrated into free Scythia and were actually taken for women among
their Sarmatian descendants men and women hunted and fought side by
side But they were not confined to the transEuxine grassland In Asia
Minor when King Priam was a lad they had occupied the plateau and
were resisting the ThracoPhrygian invasion Further to the SouthEast
another body of them had harried all Assyria in the seventh century
and at Askalon their beardless descendants survived  
     v v The same defect was
observable in one element in the male population of Scythia in the
fifth century Here we detect three stages of discovery First
the beardless people are assumed to be women Next it is discovered
both in Scythia and in Palestine that though beardless and indeed
otherwise hairless they are really men Thirdly the collateral
discovery that some mounted archers were actually women as in
Sarmatia is held to reaffirm the legends of Amazons in spite of
the fact that their Sarmatian descendants were known to belong to a
bisexual society and talked a dialect of Scythian Thus Herodotus
and his predecessors were put after all on a wrong track in their
inquiry why some Scythians are beardless and some are not The test
case is at Askalon where the Scythians who remained were admittedly
beardless and the guess was loosely accepted that all the bearded
ones had escaped the curse and gone away The outstanding fact is the
presence of similar  in Scythia itself and at this point
candid as ever Herodotus throws the outstanding fact into his readers
lap and passes on to other things

At this point we turn to Hippocrates Here we are at once in the full
current of Ionic rationalism The theological explanation of the
phenomena is rejected at the outset For my own part I think these
ailments are from God and all the other ailments too and no one of
them more divine than another or more human either but all alike from
God Each of such things has a process of growth and nothing comes
into being without a process of growth

The ground thus cleared Hippocrates notes four points In the first
place beardlessness and its reputed concomitants were limited to
Scythians of wealth which he explains to be synonymous with hereditary
rank or at least were most common among these Hippocrates it is
true puts this down to their equestrian habit not to a difference
of race Yet it is clear from Herodotus account that the Scythian
aristocracy were the result of a quite recent irruption of a purely
nomad people from beyond the Tanais which had displaced though not
wholly the former population of Scythia Secondly he observes that
the Scythians in general differ wholly in physique from the rest of the
peoples of Europe but he does not on that ground raise the question of
an immigrant origin The reason for this omission however is clear
from his third point that the abnormality in question is such as might
be predicted from a consideration of the climate and mode of life of
any human inhabitants of Scythia After this his fourth point brings
him right up to the brink of discovery though it is not pressed to its
logical conclusion by further research for he is clear both that the
beardlessness could exist without further disabilities and also that
in addition to climate and customs conducive to this bodily habit the
Scythians were naturally inclined to be beardless But the first of
these facts he ascribes not without professional excuse to successful
preventive treatment and the latter was clearly regarded by him as
the incipient effect of climate and the like upon persons who were
congenitally normal It is curious meanwhile that he does not make
use of the crucial instance of the beardless Scythians at Askalon to
test his conclusion that beardlessness and the like are the effect
of climate for the climate of Askalon differs from that of Scythia
in almost every important particular It is permissible however
to suggest that we have here one of the numerous instances in which
important statements are recorded by Herodotus which whether true or
false in themselves failed for some reason to become assimilated by
the learned world of the fourth century

Herodotus however was still anything but satisfied as to the
paramount value of the physical criterion of kinship In the majority
of cases it proved either too much or too little A good instance is
his comparison of the Colchians with the Egyptians Here he bases his
argument for their affinity on their common physical characters dark
skin and woolly hair But this proves too much there are other peoples
with dark skin and woolly hair who are certainly not of Egyptian
origin On the other hand it proves too little for what he proposes
to establish here is not a general community of origin but direct
Egyptian colonization within historic times For this proof he prefers
to rely on the evidence of a ceremonial custom which he regards as
typically African for it is both Egyptian and Aethiopian and as it
happens to be a custom involving mutilation of the person it belongs
as we shall see presently to a class of observances which were
regarded by Greek anthropology as competent to effect real changes of
physique in course of time The merely external evidence of a common
industry such as the linenweaving which he adduces here clearly
stands for Herodotus on a lower plane along with their general
similarity of culture and language

Clearly Herodotus was not quite satisfied as to the value of racial
types in anthropology And there were several reasons for this On
the one hand the Greeks themselves held family tradition to be good
evidence of common descent and as a matter of fact the professional
genealogist had been beforehand with the anthropologist at nearly all
points within the Greekspeaking world Traditions of common descent
in fact were too deeply fixed already in popular belief and involved
too many practical questions such as the rights to real property or
to political privilege to be treated as anything but valid evidence
of kinship Consequently a peoples own account of their origin or
whatever story was accepted as such was held to be evidence of a high
order Such price did Greek science pay for the actual solidarity of
Greek phylic institutions

For example the Sigynnae of the Middle Danube say that they are a
colony of Medes How they have come to be a colony of Medes I for my
part cannot say for certain yet anything might happen if you give it
long enough Herodotus is prepared that is to allow infinite
time to accomplish an almost impossible migration rather than give
up what he accepts as a peoples own account of their origin But
obviously this principle of ethnography was likely to lead to great
difficulties The Sigynnae it is true wore Median dress presumably
trousers of some kind and perhaps a shaped cap with earguards no
less suitable to a Danubian than to a Median winter But what of their
physique In this instance Herodotus gives no details but clearly
if conflict were to occur between the evidence for descent and for
physiqueif that is a people claimed descent from another people of
a different physical typeit might be the difference of physique which
would stand in need of explanation

There was another reason besides why traditions of common descent
should seem to deserve tender treatment even when geographical
probability was against them The whole Eastern Mediterranean was
still but imperfectly recovering itself after one of those periods
of prolonged and intense ethnic stress to which it is exposed by the
permeability of its northern frontier From Thrace to Crete there
were fragmentary patches of Pelasgians Phrygians from Macedon to
Peloponnese far up the Adriatic and in Western Sicily Thracians in
Naxos and Attica and Lydians at Askalon The Ionian merchant like the
Venetian of a later time found everywhere before him the tracks of the
crusading Achaean The Dorian Spartan in Cyprus at Soli and Kerynia
found Kurion already the colony of an earlier Argos at Tarentum he
merely filled a vacant niche in an Achaean almost a Homeric Italy If
things like these could happen within four or five hundred years
        Outside the Greek world it was
the same Where Sesostris had been the Scythian and Kimmerian had
followed leaving their trail at Sinope and Askalon as he in Colchis
Nebuchadnezzar had set the Jews by the waters of Babylon Darius was
but following the rule when he moved Paeonians to Asia Minor and
transplanted Eretrians to Ardericca

There was another reason also why racial type should be held liable
to easy change The Greeks themselves and most of their neighbours
were mongrel peoples for reasons which we have just seen and there
is no doubt that climate and mode of life were actually resulting in
ruthless and rapid elimination of intrusive types wherever these
were intolerant of Mediterranean conditions Now in most of the
states of Ionia the blood of the citizens was mixed beyond hope of
disentanglement even by family tradition for family tradition as
Professor Murray has shown us was for the most part shattered in
the migrations Yet the external conditions were the same for all and
men saw their blonder kinsmen and townsmen fade and cease out of the
land without fully realizing that what needed explanation was not
their failure to survive but their presence in those latitudes at
all The result for ethnology was to encourage a belief that mankind
in itself was a purebred species one and indivisible like any other
natural kind and that the marked variations between white and black
straighthaired and woollyhaired peoples were exclusively the result
of climatic if not human selection

Yet another consideration drove mens thoughts inevitably in the same
connexion One of the best inheritances of Greece from the Minoan
world was an elaborate apparatus of cultivated plants and animals our
evidence from dogs and olivekernels begins I think to justify this
view And in so minutely subdivided a region special breeds of
local origin were bound to result at an early phase of industry and
to be compared and discussed in the markets and on the quays Every
one knew in fact that domesticated animals and plants under human
direction were tolerant of almost infinite and very rapid alteration
and Man himself is the most highly domesticated of all It is no wonder
then that in the fourth century Socrates is represented as arguing
habitually as if Man were a domesticated animal whose breed could be
improved at will and in any direction physical or psychological For
even psychological breeding had long been reduced to an art both with
horses and with dogs

Demonstrable migrations of men therefore and demonstrable mutations
both of men and of animals offered evidence of a kind which it was
difficult to overlook that natural characters were variable and
also that acquired ones could become hereditary It was in fact not
because the Greeks knew so little but because on certain crucial
points they already knew so much that they formed the views they did
as to the instability of human varieties How far these views were
pressed to their conclusions will be seen best I think from a glance
at the teaching of Hippocrates which we may safely take to be near the
highwatermark of fifthcentury thought on immediately preSocratic
lines

A good example of the doctrine of Hippocrates is contained in his
anthropology of the Phasis valley a region which falls sufficiently
within the same limits as the Colchis of Herodotus to be worth
comparing with his description of the Colchians Indeed there is some
reason to believe that for reasons both of geographical theory and of
popular ideas of utility this corner of Hither Asia was attracting
a good deal of learned attention from the physicists of Greece This
is what Hippocrates has to say about the Phasis and its people
That country is marshy and warm and well watered and thickly clothed
with vegetation and there is heavy and violent rainfall there at all
seasons and the habitat of its men is in the marshes and their houses
are of wood and rushes ingeniously erected in the water and they do
but little walking to and from town and market but they sail to and
fro in dugout canoes For there are numerous artificial canals The
waters they drink are warm and stagnant and putrefied by the sun and
replenished by the rains The Phasis itself too is the most stagnant
of all rivers and of the gentlest current And the fruits which grow
there are all unwholesome for they are effeminated he is thinking
of the abundance of fleshy pulpy fruit like the stone fruitsplums
apricots and nectarineswhich were characteristic of this region in
antiquity and flabby by reason of the abundance of water And that is
why they do not ripen fully And much mist envelops the country as a
result of the water For just these reasons the Phasians have their
bodily forms different from those of all other men For in stature they
are tall in breadth they are excessively broad and no joint or vein
is to be seen upon them Their complexion is yellow as if they had
the jaundice Their voice is the deepest of all mens because their
atmosphere is not clear but foggy and moist And for bodily exertion
they are naturally somewhat disinclined

Here we see an unqualified doctrine of the plasticity of human nature
physical and mental under the influence of climate and geographical
environment such as his description of the Scythians has led us to
suspect already An adjacent passage adds the further theoretical
point that even acquired variations of wholly artificial character
may become hereditary in time The case is that of the Macrocephali
whose haunts unfortunately are not specified In the beginning
it was their custom which was chiefly responsible for the length of
their head but now their mode of growth too reinforces their custom
For they regard as best bred those who have the longest head Then
he describes how the heads are remodelled in infancy by massage and
bandaging and proceeds At the beginning the practice itself had the
result that their mode of growth was of this kind But as time went on
it came to be inbred so that their law was no longer compulsory 
       He then explains that
just as baldness and grey eyes and physical deformities are hereditary
for he makes no distinction between natural and acquired varieties
now similarly they do not grow at all as they did before for the
practice has no longer any force through the peoples own neglect of
it

The bearing of this passage and the doctrine which it expounds on
Herodotus account of the Colchi will be obvious at once Clearly if
the proportions of the head can be affected by artificial pressure
reinforced by social selection of the most successfully deformedthat
is to say of the individuals with the softest skulls and if as
Hippocrates clearly thought the colour of the eyes and presence or
absence of hair were characters of the same order of transmissibility
and if further as in the case of the Phasians skincolour and bodily
proportions resulted from climate and occupation then clearly it
mattered comparatively little to Herodotus whether the Colchians were
woollyhaired or not Woolly hair like baldness could be inherited
indeed but it could also be superinduced like macrocephaly by
assiduous curling or as every barber knows by the subtler influence
of atmospheric moisture It is consequently not only because as
suggested above there were other woollyhaired people besides the
Egyptians and Colchians who were in question that Herodotus has
recourse to other evidence than that of physique to prove their
identity it is because for fifthcentury anthropology the evidence
of physique itself did not justify conclusions of appreciably higher
validity than those which resulted from the comparison of industries or
customs

It will be seen from all this that in questions relating to the
evolution of Man Herodotus exhibitsand shares with the whole thought
of his timeprecisely the opposite weakness to that of the pioneers
of modern anthropology His mistakes arise not because he is unable
to allow time enough for evolutionary changes but because he tries to
crowd too great an amplitude of change into the liberal allowance of
time which he is prepared to grant Ten thousand years or even twenty
thousand would be a short allowance in modern geology for even so
active a river as the Nile to fill up the whole Red Sea but it is more
than double the whole length allotted to geological time within the
memory of men still living

It will also be clear how deep was the impression created on the Greek
mind by the minor changes of the seasons and of history The formula of
Heracleitus      had indeed its application to
metaphysic but its origin was in physical science as a generalization
from experience It had its negative interest as an implement of
sceptical destruction But it had also a high positive value for it
formulated the present as transitional from the past to the future
it emphasized the kinetic and physiological aspect of nature and of
science which has ever been of so far higher value in research as in
life than the static and morphological it substituted an analysis of
processes for classification of the qualities of things

Now it is to this phase of scientific theory that we must assign the
first intrusion into scientific terminology of the twin words  and
 in their primitive sense they denote nothing else than precisely
such natural processes in themselves on the one hand and mans
formulation of such processes on the other

It is the more important to keep in mind this fundamental conception
of Greek physical anthropology when we go on to consider either the
treatment of the evidence of language and culture which we find in
Herodotus or the applications of physical classification to the
purposes of logic and metaphysic To take the latter first a doctrine
of the real existence of natural kinds corresponding each as
Hippocrates would put it to a process of growth peculiar to itself
was clearly easier to understand if not to discover and formulate
when the men who were to discuss it were already brought up to regard
the animal world for example as consisting of a comparatively small
number of fundamental types and the infinite variety of individual
and regional forms as the effect of external forces upon them Each
actual example of horse or dog for example was to be regarded on the
one hand as the embodiment of a true equine or canine nature which
reason might hope to detect and isolate but on the other it lay like
the god Glaucus encrusted with accidental qualities the effects of
its exposure to a particular environment Seen in the light of their
preSocratic history as elements in the terminology of a great school
of naturalists the catchwords    and 
gain something I think in significance In particular it becomes
clearer why the word  which continued to be used among the
naturalists for the specific outcome of  upon a member or
members of a  came among the philosophers to supersede the word
 in proportion as the centre of reflective interest shifted from
the objective exponent of a  to the subjective standpoint of the
philosophic observer

For Herodotus meanwhile language and culture can change under stress
of circumstances in just the same way as physique and therefrom
follows the possibility of the transmission of culture Whether any
particular custom was to be regarded as innate in the  of those
who practised it or as their response to the stresses of their
present environment or as the result whether conformable to the
environment or not of intercourse with another variety of Man was a
question to be settled on the merits of each case It was in fact
partly the laxness of interest in such matters which resulted from the
prevalent theory and only partly the admitted incompleteness of the
observations that kept ethnographical speculation in so backward a
state as we find it in Herodotus time Until the belief in stronger
specific characters could be supplemented by some doctrine of cultural
momentum the conception of progress in civilization was hardly
attainable at all This is where the treatment of Hellenic civilization
by Herodotus stands in so marked a contrast with his treatment of the
civilizations of Egypt and Outland Egyptian civilization like Egypt
itself is the gift of the Nile the  of an Indian attains its
 when he has ridden his camels and rescued his gold the men
are black or tall or longlived as the effect of natural causes
and as long as these causes persist so long will there be Indians
or Aethiopians with those qualities Only in Greece is there mastery
of man over nature and that not because nature is less strong but
because Greek man is strong enough to dominate it

This is how it comes about that barriers of language and of culture no
less than barriers of descent are powerless in face of a welldefined
 with a potent  of its own Such a  can add to the
number of individuals which compose it Pelasgians and Lelegians can
become Hellenes For Herodotus as I have explained more in detail
elsewhere the process of conversion of barbarians to the Hellenic
 is not clear the verbs which he employs  
are intransitive the general impression which is conveyed is of a
kind of spontaneous generation and the same language is used when 
 is described as     in the earliest
phase of all For Thucydides on the other handas was natural to
an Athenian who had seen Atticism triumphant in HellasHellenism is
acquired by contact with and imitation of the  of a genuine
Hellene Of course this explanation of Pelasgian conversion only pushes
the problem itself one stage further back but it marks a distinct
advance in analysis beyond the point reached by Herodotus and it
is an advance in precisely the opposite direction to that in which
naturalists like Hippocrates were being led through their greater
insistence on the external factors which were the main subject of
their study Thucydides in fact stands already on the Socratic side of
the line The explanation of the transmissibility of culture is to be
sought for him not in physiology but in psychologynot in spontaneous
or coercive adjustment to inexorable nature but in intercourse with
enlightened minds

Among the many different classes of information which Herodotus
inclines to give about foreign peoples two kinds of data are more
insistently recorded than the others There are the marriage customs
and the principal source of food These will be admitted to be obvious
points to note but there was a special motive in the fifth century
for collecting each of them and the history of thought in the century
which followed allows us to trace this motive forward into a maturer
context

The problem of the status of the sexes in society was not a new one
in fourthcentury Greece As far back indeed as we can trace social
institutions directly at all society in Greece had been constituted on
patriarchal lines But patriarchal institutions had far less undisputed
acceptance in the Greek world than they had for example in Italy
It was not merely that Attic rules of inheritance gave a definite
though at all times secondary status to the mothers kindred or
that in Sparta Thebes and some other states the women enjoyed in
many respects a social equality with the men which has been explained
in more ways than one An Ionian Greek had only to travel down his
own coast as far as Lycia to find men reckoning descent through the
mother or to travel back in imagination to the legendary origins of
his own people to find that their pedigrees went often up not to a
god but to a woman Olympian society was the same The consort of Zeus
held a very different position from that of the wife in a patriarchal
household and on the Asiatic shore at least the gods themselves were
traced back to a Mother not to a Father of them all

Hints too were not wanting as to the recent arrival and unAegean
origin of the patriarchal system which had now prevailed with its
proprietary view of women and no less of the loose hold which this
set of customs had upon the popular belief and opinion In the
opening chapters of his history Herodotus states and allows his
  to criticize freely what might be summarized as a
cherchezlafemme theory of the Eastern Question and the criticism
which he records amounts essentially to the question Does the
position of women in society as we know it justify the attempts which
have been made to explain the great quarrel by incidents such as those
of Io Medea and Helen Now this criticism is not merely Persian
nor even Herodotean the problem whether the Trojan War was really
fought about Helen was at least as old as Stesichorus No sooner did
the wakening mind of Hellas cease merely to believe Homer and begin to
think about him than it struck at once upon this very paradoxHomer
says and insists throughout that all the war was wrought for Helens
sake but do we Greeks ever dream of doing anything of the kind are
our women the least worth fighting about If they run away with a
foreigner do we not as a matter of fact say good riddance and go
about our business How this paradox presented itself to Stesichorus
and to other literary thinkers of early Greece and how Herodotus has
chosen to handle their solution of it is a thricetold tale All that
I am concerned to suggest at present is that at every point where we
can test it opinion in Greece was in flux as to the rightful position
of woman in civilized society

The rapid extension of the field of Greek knowledge of other peoples
customs which resulted from the voyages and settlements of the seventh
century no less than the severe strain which the economic evolution in
that century and the next put upon the very framework of society in
Greek states led inevitably as we know to very reasonable scepticism
as to the naturalness of patriarchal institutions in themselves and
this not only among the Physicists We have hints of it in the Lyric
and explicit discussion in the Drama Is a man nearer akin to his
father or to his mother that is the point on which for Aeschylus the
fate of Orestes turns in the last resort The Apollo of Aeschylus
 though he be is on the side of the angels but his proof
belongs to a phase of observation which while it conforms precisely to
the patriarchal jurisprudence was obsolete already for Hippocrates
The Andromache and the Medea of Euripides mark in due course the
turn of the tide even in Drama and with the feminist plays of
Aristophanes we are in full course for the Republic of Plato the
fine flower on this side of the subject of the conviction which is
really preSocratic that social organization like any other is at
bottom a matter of the adaptation of natural means to ends

Of this controversy Herodotus is no mere spectator It can hardly be a
chance that every one of the strange marriage customs which he mentions
happens to be typical of a widespread type of observance and that the
series of them taken together forms an analysis of such types which
is almost complete between the extremes of promiscuous union with
classificatory relationship on the one hand and normal patriarchal
monogamy on the other

Herodotus is of course not writing a history of Human Marriage or of
Womans Rights it is only as a current topic of controversy that such
matters come into his story at all but when they do I think we can
see that his contribution to them is not quite a casual one that he
is not simply emptying an illfilled notebook on to the margins of
his history but that where he digresses he does so to fill a gap in
current knowledge with materials which if not new are at all events
well authenticated and that these materials have partly been elicited
by his own interest in specific problems which were burning questions
at the moment

The question of social organization and provision for orderly descent
was for Herodotus a matter of pure science But for some of his
contemporaries it was different Archelaus in particular the last
and in some respects the most advanced of the Physicists has the
reputation of having applied physicist methods to politics and morals
         Two points
in the account given of him by Diogenes have usually been put on one
side that he came from Miletus and had sat at the feet of Anaxagoras
beyond whose physics however he failed to advance appreciably
and that Socrates had borrowed from him much of what commonly passed
as Socratic But the two statements go together An Ionian Physicist
who had passed on to philosophize about customs their goodness and
justice was certainly a pendent portrait to that of the Socrates of
the Clouds and of the Memorabilia with his earlier interest which
his enemies never forgot in   and his invincible habit of
treating Man as an animal species about which it was permissible to
argue by the analogy of other rational animals like horses and dogs
Indeed the predominant interest which the next generation took in the
later phases of Socrates the Moralist have obscured perhaps unduly
the significance of these glimpses of his immaturer thought

The same Archelaus is creditedor discreditedwith another saying
characteristic of the Milesian way of looking at MankindJustice
and injustice he said exist not in nature but in custom Here
again the practice of Herodotus is instructive Repeatedly he notes of
distant peoples either that they are the justest of Mankind or that
they have this or that custom which is praiseworthy or the reverse
and even among the highest of civilized beings Custom is King

This is not perhaps the place to enter at length on a discussion of the
Herodotean usage of  or its relation with its correlative 
But it can hardly be passed by without the remark that the varying
use of the word in Herodotusand his uses do vary in detailare all
included in that earlier and characteristically Ionian sense in which
the word is used to denote the formal expression of what actually
happens among the people and in the circumstances which are in
question This is of course a quite immediate and very early sense of
the word it connects itself directly with the primary signification
of a pasture within which a flock may roam unchecked and unharmed
but beyond which it strays at its peril or not at all  has thus
exactly the force of the Roman conception of a provincia except
that where provincia prescribed the limits and the character of
appropriate acts  merely described them In so far then as 
answered originally to our word law it answered exclusively to that
sense of it in which we speak of a law of nature meaning thereby our
more or less accurate formulation in a descriptive way of the actual
course of events of the given type

In this sense obviously there is no contrast or antagonism conceivable
between  and  Let the  of an oak for examplethe
growthprocess of that kind of treebe to put forth branches leaves
and fruit of a specific sort this is no less the  of that oak
the way it normally behaves So too with Man The normal natural
behaviour of the Egyptian is to teach his son a trade this is one of
his  as seen and described by an observer from outside but this
is also what he and his ancestors have done  for generations till
an Egyptian who does otherwise is hardly conceivable We have already
seen in the case of Hippocrates the mode of procedure whereby what
began as a  was conceived as modifying the  by incorporation
in it

What was the outcome of these observations on the family structure
of savages and of the speculations as to their naturalness or the
reverse The answer is given I think when we look into the fourth
century and find Socrates the last of the preSocratics propounding
in the Republic and justifying by chapter and verse in the Laws
the unnaturalness because the uselessness or inexpediency of
patriarchal society as the Greeks knew it From Athenian politics
patriarchal considerations had been eliminated in theory a century
before by that amazing revolutionary Cleisthenes but socially the
father still owned and ruled his children and children paid
divided allegiance to their father and to the state As presented
in the Republic the Socratic argument has little about it that
is anthropological the appeal is to horses and dogs not to
Sarmatians but the actual institutions of the Ideal State the annual
matingfestivals the   by which status is allotted to each
infant after inspection by the governors the whole classificatory
system of relationship are one and all to be found among the curious
 which we know to have been recorded by the anthropologists of
the century before and recorded too with the definite intention of
discovering what their causes were and what were the reasons assigned
for those customs by the people who practised and understood them

It is against such speculations as these of course and in particular
against the Socratic attempt to make Amazons and Nasamonians rise up
in judgement against this generation that Aristotle was moved to
restate in the first section of the Politics the orthodox sociology
of patriarchal Greece That in the middle of the fourth it should
have been possible for a serious person to maintain the paradox
    without instant refutation by the members
of his classroom is a measure of the extent to which the followers
of Socrates though as we have seen not Socrates himself had
broken with the fifthcentury naturalists and perhaps even ceased to
read them But it is a measure also of the extent to which an able
dialectician could make play with words like  and  till it
almost appeared as if any one who had any  to speak of represented
a  from the   No amount of a priori argument
as to the superior strength or intelligence or sheer superiority of
the human male could obliterate the fact that here women ruled there
they fought elsewhere they did the work instead of the man or bar
the reflection that it was the business of an editor of 
 to collect these human institutions too before generalizing
and in general to distinguish    from  

Alongside of the problem of family organization lay the other problem
of the means of subsistence Some men live wholly on the fruit of a
tree others eat corn or milk or monkeys or their elderly relatives
And here again the evidence falls into two classes There are customs
in which the eating appears to us as a ritual act designed by those
who observed or initiated it to secure some ultimately useful end
they frequently belong to the kind of acts which we class together
as Sympathetic Magic There are also customs in respect of food
which to us appear to have only an economic interest or if they have
wider interest at all acquire it from another consideration Current
anthropologyFrench anthropology in particularand our own economic
surroundings combine to bring home to us keenly the thought that the
way in which a people gets its daily bread not to mention the previous
question how it is to get anything to eat at all except perhaps its
own unemployables has a direct and profound influence on its social
structure A late stage of Greek thought on this subject is represented
by the section in the first book of the Politics which classifies the
principal  which are open to mankind and hints though the subject
is not pursued that the Good Life will be pursued with a very different
equipment of customs and institutions according as it is pursued by
the pastoral nomad farming his migratory field or by the miner
or by the merchant seaman A little earlier in thought as well as in
time comes the sketch in the Republic a glimpse of the earlier
Socrates who had dabbled in geography and improved the inventions
of Archelaus The later Socrates wise in his own failures takes his
pupils hurriedly past this avenue of inquiry into the structure of
society the disciples for the credit of the Masters originality
omit all allusion to Archelaus and his work But the Milesian who
began with Physics and went on to show what nowadays we should call
the applicability of biological laws to Man cannot have been
without weight in the political thought of his time and it is again
to Herodotus that we must turn for indications of the extent to which
this inquiry was already being followed in Greece in the generation of
Archelaus and before it

Already in Homer imagination had been caught by the total distinctness
of the mode of life which was followed by the nomads of the North and
a vague connexion had been felt between the purely pastoral existence
and a peculiarly orderly habit of life and behaviour A fragment of
Choerilus whom those who had access to his work felt to stand in some
peculiarly close relation to Herodotus connects these two qualities
explicitly and the same thought recurs twice over in that
storehouse of anthropological learning the Prometheus Solutus of
Aeschylus In the latter passage it would be forcing the literal
sense of the words unduly to insist that the Gabii are to be pictured
as living on wild corn especially as Greek theory was at all other
points unanimous that corn like the olive and the vine came to man by
special providence as something   The Aeschylean picture
clearly is that of the virgin soil of the transEuxine grassland
where the spring vegetation will endure comparison with any merely
Aegean cornland

There is enough in this single example to show that the men of the
early fifth century were already aware of the interdependence of
environment economy and institutions For the generation of Socrates
we have the treatise of Hippocrates already mentioned On Air Water
and Places of which the whole burden is as we have seen that not
only mens social organization but their very physique is the result
of acquired variations initiated by the climate and economic rgime

I hinted a little earlier that there is another reason why Herodotus
should pay close attention to the peculiar food of strange peoples
That different kinds of foodquest should lead to different manners
and institutions was probably even in the fifth century a less
familiar conception than that the personal qualities of the individual
depended directly on the food which he ate This is of course a matter
of elementary knowledge to most savages it is an explicit principle
of the medical doctrine of Hippocrates it has had the profoundest
influence on the vocabulary and ritual of great religions and it
has by no means disappeared from the current thought of mankind it
is still believed by otherwise intelligent people that the morals
of nations may be mended by defining the quality of their food and
the quantity of their drink With this conception in mind we shall
cease to be surprised that Herodotus devotes so much time and care to
describe the preparation of plumcake or kirschwasser or beer Man
might not live by bread alone but if you once were certain that a man
did live on bread and not on monkeys or on lice you knew already a
good deal about the habits and the value of that man

It was probably the circumstance that this magical interpretation was
so commonly attached to foodsupply that prevented Greek observers
such as Herodotus and Hippocrates from pressing home their analysis
of the foodquest as an index of the general economic rgime And the
same ambiguity envelops also unfortunately the next recorded attempt
at such analysis It can hardly be accident that in the sketch of the
  in the Republic the diet of the citizens is
wholly vegetarian and almost wholly cereal And when Glaucon
interrupts and asks what has happened to the meat Socrates wilfully
misunderstands his question and prescribes once more only salt
cheese and vegetable relishesolives and bulbous roots and wild
herbs with figs lentils and beans myrtleberries and forest nuts to
follow Glaucons comment on this is precise and contemptuous If you
had been planning a city of pigs Socrates what other fodder than this
would you have given them And on being pressed for an alternative he
stipulates expressly for the customary food of civilized men and
meat dishes such as people have nowadays It is entirely in keeping
with all this that  recur further on along with tables
chairs and unguents as signs of a corrupted state that hunters and
cooks appear among the ministers of luxury and swineherds last of all
for the pig alone among cattle gives neither milk or cheese but is
useful only for meat diet

Here three distinct lines of argument are inextricably confused In the
first place we have seen already that it was the regular Greek belief
that man began existence as a forest animal living on the hazelnuts
and acorns characteristic of the Balkan and Anatolian regions and only
acquired the knowledge of corn wine and oil by special providence
and at a later time in this sense therefore Socrates is proposing
a return to primitive diet In the second place the diet which he
suggests is the only one possible for people who should try to live a
life independent and at the same time inoffensive But thirdly this
diet is precisely that which a fourthcentury doctor would have been
expected to prescribe for a patient    But
there is enough of common motive in all three considerations to make
it clear that even one of the least anthropological among his pupils
could represent Socrates as starting from a conception of man and
his place in the world which is precisely that of a fifthcentury
physicist

I conclude with a wellknown Herodotean episode in which much true
history has been remodelled clearly in the light of a definite
classification of  and a definite theory of their relative values
and economic interactions In the story of the rise of Peisistratus as
told by Herodotus the motif of the action throughout the first
phase of his career is that of three contrasted  the life of the
shore of the sea and of the men from over the hills In form the
division is geographical but the phrase which is used   
  suggests that it is not a district but a region
which is in question and that what differentiated this region from
the others was this that it lay above corn level Any one who will
go in springtime and look round from the Acropolis upon Attica will
recognize that abrupt change from the emerald green to the purple and
brown which tells where  and cornland end and the goats of the
 begin And I have seen along the base of Taygetus along the
same economic frontier where a track like a coastguards path has been
worn by the police patrols in their attempt not always successful to
prevent  from bursting into  We should note in passing
that the question whether the pastoral highlanders of Attica exhausted
the whole content of the   whether that is the
party of Peisistratus included the mining interests of the district
of Laureion as suggested by Mr Ure is totally distinct from
the question now before us which is simply what the word conveyed
to the mind of Herodotus the Halicarnassian And if this distinction
be granted the suggestion which is after all the conventional one
that the ground of division between the Attic factions was regarded by
Herodotus as an economic one receives much support from the perennial
state of Balkan lands with their oases of corngrowers amid a highland
wilderness of Vlachs

In these circumstances the fact that Peisistratus whatever his
real character may have been is described as the leader of the most
backward section of the population is entirely in agreement with the
rest of the picture For throughout in Herodotus presentation of him
Peisistratus is the man of paradoxes His father before his birth had
accepted the omen of the cauldron spontaneously boiling the son was to
kindle a great fire where there was no lightbut only plenty of fuel
So again Peisistratus unlike the Sibyl at each rejection offers
Athens more The rejected partyleader becomes Athenas man the man of
an united Attica and Athenas man whom Athenas people expelled
rests not till he can offer of his own every corner stone of an
Athenian Empire in its greatest days And so here again there is
stasis between rich and poor between primitive and advanced between
sedentary and nomadso far as nomadism was practicable in Attica and
it is the    as with Perdiccas and with David which
produce in due time the great man It is a miniature of course
this sketch of the sixthcentury Attica as befits its modest part in
the scheme of the Herodotean drama but the handling of it is none the
less significant on that account of the way in which the idea of
conflicting  is allowed to model and interpret the materials

I have tried in brief space to indicate some ways in which our
knowledge of the Greek world fragmentary as it is enables us to
recover some at least of the broad lines of method by which the early
history of Man and the causes of his variations and of his social
states were being investigated in the fifth century and before and
to interpret some of the results which were reached in the light of
the reasoning which led to them and the principles by which they
were interpreted in antiquity We have seen that in some points Greek
anthropology had gone surprisingly far in speculation and in acute
observation too and we have seen it baffled in other directions by
puzzles and mistakes which seem trivial to us And we have seen in the
particular instance of one who was at the same time a great historian
and an alert observer of anthropological fact something of the way in
which preSocratic stages of theory worked out when they were applied
to research in the hands of an ordinary man Above all I have ventured
to suggestwhat I hope it may be for others to carry forwardan
inquiry into the anthropological basis of the political doctrine of
Socrates and so to link him on this side of his thought with that
great body of naturalist work which I would gladly believe that he
came not to destroy but to fulfil

LECTURE VI

LUSTRATIO


The practice which is the subject of this lecture was a comparatively
late growth in the religious history of ancient Italy We commonly
and vaguely translate lustratio by purification lustrare by
purify but in Latin literature there is another sense of the word
which shows well how one particular kind of purification had become
associated with itI mean the sense of a slow ordered movement in
procession This stately processional movement so characteristic of
the old Roman character so characteristic still of the grandeur and
discipline of the Roman Church in Italy impressed itself for ever
on the Latin language in the word lustrare Let me quote a single
beautiful example of it When Aeneas first sees and addresses Dido he
says

    In freta dum fluvii current dum montibus umbrae
    Lustrabunt convexa polus dum sidera pascet
    Semper honos nomenque tuum laudesque manebunt
    Quae me cumque vocant terrae

So long as the cloudshadows move slowly over the hollows on the
hills Long ago when fishing in Wales I watched this procession of
the shadows and ever since then it has been associated in my mind with
the many ancient Italian processions which I have had to study Such is
the magical power of a great poet of nature

But before we go on to examine the nature and meaning of these
processions it is necessary to go much further back in order to get
some idea of the primitive Italian ideas of purification out of
which they were developed We know them only in the farm and the city
of historical times they belong at the earliest to the comparatively
settled and civilized life of the Italian agricultural community and
reached their highest development in the highly organized CityState
But there is much to be saidmuch more than I have time to say
nowabout the ideas to which they owe their origin

There are certain words in Latin bearing the sense of purification
which are older if I am not mistaken than lustrare and lustratio
and which belong I should be inclined to believe to a preanimistic
period to a period that is when the thing to be got rid of by what
we call purification was not so much evil influences in the form of
spirits as some mysterious miasmatic contamination These words are
februum februare februatio from which the name of our second
month the month of purification is derived Februum is a material
object with magical purifying power which the late Romans might call
piamen or purgamen Ovid Fast ii  foll using a word
belonging to the priestly ritual of the fully developed State A number
of such objects were in use at Rome on particular occasions all called
generically by this name februumwater fire sulphur laurel wool
pinetwigs cakes made of certain holy ingredients and at the
Lupercalia strips of the skin of a victim These belong to the region
of magic and are intimately connected with charms and amulets which
were and still are so popular and universal in Italy They belong
to the same category psychologically considered as the bulla of
children the apex of the flamines a pointed twig fixed on the
head or headdress and the galerus the cap of the Flamen Dialis
made of the skin of a white victim which had been sacrificed to
Jupiter These are all survivals from an older stratum of religious
thought than the processional rites which we are going to study they
date from a period when magical processes were the rule and religious
processes the exception

I am not going to let myself be drawn here into the vexed question of
the relation of religion to magictwo words which simply by virtue of
their being words with constantly shifting connotationare very apt
to mislead us But putting aside this controversy it is helpful I
think to suggest that februum and februare belong to an age when
material contamination e g of a corpse or of bloodin other words
of things taboocould be got rid of by magical means lustrare
and lustratio to an age when the thing to be driven and kept away is
spiritual mischiefthe influence of spirits that may be hostileand
when the means used are sacrifices and prayer with processional
movement To draw the line clearly however between a magical period
and a religious period is in Roman history quite impossible as indeed
it is and must be everywhere Magical and quasimagical processes are
taken up into the processes of a period which may be called religious
and survive in an amphibious condition for which it is difficult to
find a name The Flamen Dialis for example was priest of Jupiter
and as such in all his duties was an official of a highly organized
religious system yet he was afflicted with an extraordinary number
of taboosnow familiar to all readers of The Golden Boughwhich
survived from a period long anterior to that of religion in the true
sense of the word The purification of newborn children on the dies
lustricus is an essential part of the religion of the family and the
word lustricus is itself in my view a mark of a period of religion
but the original meaning of the ceremony is probably to be found in
preanimistic ideas So too with the purification of the family after a
funeral where the original horror of a corpse common to all primitive
peoples is still just discernible in the religious ritual of historical
times And as we shall presently see the belief that he who has
shed blood even of an enemy needs purification is still to be found
lurking in the form of one of those acts of lustratio with which we
are about to occupy ourselves

But on the whole it may be said of the Romans as Dr Farnell has said
of our Teutonic ancestors Evolution of Religion p  that
cathartic ritual did not weigh heavily on their consciences Assuredly
it may be so said of the Romans of historical times subjected to the
quieting influences of priestly law and ritual which found infallible
remedies for the conscience of the individual for his fear of evil
powers material or spiritualexpedients to emancipate him from the
bondage of tabooin the religious action of the State as a whole
It may perhaps be guessed that even in an age long before the State
arose the conscience of the Latin was never intensified as regards
purification from bloodshed or other mischance or misdeed The impurity
or holiness of blood as conceived by all primitive peoples has left
no obvious trace in Roman ideas legends or literature it is to be
found but it does not attract our attention as it does in Greece I
believe that the explanation of this lies in the genius of the Roman
for law and in his early and very distinct conception of the State and
of the authority of its officials It may indeed be also due to the
invasion of Latium by a people of advanced culture who had but little
to say to the grosser material ideas of an aboriginal population
but this is still merely speculation into which I cannot enter now
Whatever the cause the religion of the Romans as we know it shows
no horror no fear so long as the worship of the gods is performed
exactly and correctly according to the rules of the State priesthoods
there is no sense of sin or of pollution of taboo irremediably broken
haunting the mind of the individual all is cheerfully serious
regular ordered ritualistic and nowhere can we see this better than
in the public and private lustral processions of the Roman people

A word however in the first place about the original meaning of the
word lustratio Lustrare is a strong form of luere and luere
is explained by Varro as equivalent to solvere De Ling Lat vi
 Lustrum nominatum tempus quinquennale a luendo id est solvendo
quod quinto quoque anno vectigalia et ultro tributa per censores
persolvebantur He is followed by Servius who explains such
expressions as paena commissa luere peccata luere supplicium
luere on the same principle We might therefore be tempted to
think that the rootmeaning of lustrare is to perform a duty or an
obligation and so to rid oneself of itto go through a religious
rite as due to a deity But this would be to misconceive the original
meaning of the word as completely as Varro did when he explained
luere by reference to the payment of taxes We have not yet arrived
at a period in Roman thought when we can speak of a sense of religious
duty it is not a money obligation or a ritualistic one that has to be
got rid of in the earliest ages of the Latin farm or CityState but
those ubiquitous spirits presumably hostile until they are reclaimed
which haunt the life of man in the animistic stage Varro and his
successors do however give us the right clue they see that the
idea lurking in the word is that of purging yourself or getting rid
of something but they understand that something in the light not of
primitive mans intelligence but of the relation of man to man in a
civilized state

If then lustrare originally embodies this sense of ridding
oneself of something we can now go on to examine the oldest forms
of lustratio I will not here go into the further question whether
lues a pest and the shadowy deity Lua Mater who was the consort
or companion in some antique sense of Saturnus are words belonging to
the same group and explicable on the same principle

Now in order to understand clearly how this necessity of getting rid
of hostile spirits came to suggest those solemn processional rites
which we associate with the word lustratio we must fully appreciate
the fact that the earliest settlers in Italy who had any knowledge
of agriculture found it a country of forestclad hills the river
valleys were marshy and unhealthy and the earliest settlements were
in clearings made in the woodland This fact was dimly appreciated by
the Romans themselves and is proved by the archaeological evidence
available today The first thing then to be done was to make a
clearing and this was a most perilous task for when you cut down
trees and dug up the soil how were you to tell what unknown spirits
you might be disturbing and aggravating They might be in the trees and
the plants they might be in the animals whose homes were in the trees
and the ground the rocks and the springs In the later Roman ritual we
can still see traces of this old feeling of peril Cato has preserved
for us the formula used by the farmer in historical times when making
a new clearing the prayer accompanying his sacrifice began with Si
deus si deafor how was he to know the name or sex of the spirit of
the wood he was invading When digging up the soil he had to offer an
expiatory sacrifice and the ancient gild of the Fratres Arvales had to
offer special piacula for the falling of a bough in their grove or
for any injury to a tree in it

And when your clearing was complete and you had settled down with your
own household spirits e g of the hearthfire and the storecupboard
Vesta and Penates or had induced some of the native spirits to
be friendly and serviceable to youthose especially of the land
and the springsthere was yet another difficulty of the greatest
importance viz to keep those wild ones still dwelling in the woodland
around you from encroaching on your clearing or annoying you in your
dwelling That they really could be thus annoying is proved by a
curious bit of folklore of which Varro knew and which has luckily been
preserved by St Augustine a student of Varros works as an example
of Pagan absurdity Civ Dei vi  After the birth of a child
three spirits were invokedIntercidona Pilumnus and Deverrato
prevent Silvanus the later representative of the woodland spirits
generally from coming into the house and making mischief by night
These three spirits as their names show represented the life of
settled agriculture the cutting and pruning of trees Intercidona
the pounding of corn for the daily meal Pilumnus and the raking
and sweeping up of the grain Deverra and Varro says that they were
represented by three men who imitated the action of axe pestle and
broom The real significance of this delightful bit of mummery has
never I think been correctly understood simply because the vital
difference to the earliest settler between the benevolent spirits of
the reclaimed clearing and the hostile spirits of the wild woodland has
never been quite fully appreciated

But this device was one to which you need only have recourse on a
particular occasion the permanent difficulty was to mark off your
cultivated land from the forest and its dangerous spiritual population
in some way by which the latter might be prevented from making itself
unpleasant You must draw a definite line between good spirits and bad
between white spirits and black Here it is that we find the origin of
a practice which lasted all through Roman history passed on into the
ritual of the Church and still survives as at Oxford on Ascension
Day in the beating of parish bounds The boundary of the cultivated
land was marked out in some material way perhaps by stones placed
at intervals like the cippi of the old Roman pomerium from the
woodland lying around it and this boundaryline was made sacred by the
passage round it lustratio at some fixed time of the yearin May
as a rule when the crops were ripening and especially liable to be
attacked by hostile influencesof a procession occupied with sacrifice
and prayer I must dwell for a moment on this procession as it is
described by old Cato but at this point I may just interpolate the
remark that the object of its mysterious influence was the arable land
only and the crops The sheep and cattle were otherwise protected
when after their seclusion within the boundary during the winter they
were driven out in April to pasture beyond it where they would be in
far greater peril from enemies spiritual and other If you wish to see
how this was done read Ovids account of the Parilia in the fourth
book of his Fasti and Dr Frazers illuminating commentary on it
St George and the Parilia in the Revue des tudes Ethnographiques
et Sociologiques for  p  foll

Cato in his treatise on agriculture has left us in the form of
instructions to a real or imaginary bailiff the formula of the
lustratio as it was used in the second century BC It is obviously
applicable in detail rather to the estate of that period than to a farm
of primitive Latium there are for example words which suggest that
it was not necessary in those days to go in procession round the whole
of the boundary as was the case afterwards with the lustratio of the
ager Romanus the form survived accommodated to the great increase
of the land concerned But the two main features of the whole rite
are no doubt identical with those of the earliest form of iti e
the procession of the victims ox sheep and pig the farmers most
valuable property with the sacrificer and his helps in this case the
bailiff and his assistants and secondly the prayer to Mars pater
after libations to Janus and Jupiter asking for his kindly protection
of the whole familia of the farm together with the crops of every
kind and the cattle within the boundaryline Though it is not
explicitly told us we can hardly doubt that originally the procession
followed the boundaryline and thus served to keep it clear in the
memory as well as to preserve everything within it from hostile spirits
outside of it In Catos formula it is disease calamity dearth and
infertility that the farmer seeks to ward offthat is the language
of the second century BC and it is Mars pater who is invoked i
e a great god who has long ago emerged from the crowd of impersonal
spirits but we need not doubt that the primitive farmer used language
of a different kind and addressed the spirits of disease and dearth
themselves of whom one survived into historic timesRobigus the
spirit of mildew In the ritual of the Arval Brethren who perhaps
retained some details more antique than those of Catos instructions
it is a nameless deity the Dea Dia who is the chief object of
petition Acta Fratr Arv p 

At this point it may be well to ask what was the original idea of the
virtue conveyed by going round a piece of land with victims to be
sacrificed at the end of the circuit Such circuitous processions
with or without victims are to be found in all countries perhaps
the instance most familiar to all of us is that round the walls of
Jericho repeated seven timesthe mystic numberin order to destroy
their defensive power But Roman folklore itself preserved in great
abundance by Pliny supplies an example which goes some way I think
to show the original nature of the process Pliny tells us that if
a woman in a certain condition with bare feet and streaming hair
walked round a field it was completely protected against insects
The act of passing round a crop served as a charm to keep off noxious
thingslive insects in historical times noxious spirits if I am
right in the dawn of agriculture The charm lay in the condition of
the woman as Dr Frazer has abundantly shown in The Golden Bough
iii ed  p  foll where he has quoted this passage of
Pliny and others from the Roman writers on agriculture Some power
of a similar kind there must have been also in the victims about to
be slain they were chosen according to rule and under favourable
auspices if we may argue back from the ritual of the city to that of
the farm they were therefore holy and their blood was about to be
shed at one point in the line of circuit We have here indeed passed
beyond the region of magic but we are still in that early stage of
religion when a magical idea is at the bottom of the ceremony though
fast losing itself in ideas more advanced and rational

This religious process the fencing out of hostile spirits by a
boundaryline and the discovery of the proper formulae for preserving
it and all within it may and indeed must have been the work of ages
But once discovered the principle of it could be applied to any land
or other property of man and also to man himself Let us now take some
examples of such extensions of the simple practice of the farm

The farms and homesteads of the early Latins were grouped together
in associations called pagi and these were subjected to the same
process of lustratio as the farms themselves So at least we can hardly
doubt though we have no explicit account of the processional character
of the lustratio pagi When Ovid under date of the Paganalia Jan
 describes the lustratio he writes

    Pagus agat festum pagum lustrate coloni
      Et date paganis annua liba focis

but does not make it clear that he uses lustrare in the sense of
a procession with the suovetaurilia Nor can we be sure that the
beautiful passage in the first Georgic  foll beginning In
primis venerare deos refers to a lustratio pagi though Wissowa
seems to imply it and the lines

    Terque novas circum felix eat hostia fruges
    Omnis quam chorus et socii comitentur ovantes
    Et Cererem clamore vocent in tecta 

give a charming picture of a lustratio of this kind without enabling
us to decide whether he has the farm or the pagus in his mind Let
us go on to the beginnings of the city where we shall find the same
principle and process applied in most striking fashion

Just as it was necessary to keep hostile spirits out of the homestead
and its land so it was necessary to keep them out of the city and its
land The walls of the Italian city were sacred and so was a certain
space outside them called the pomerium This is well illustrated in
the rite used in the foundation of a city even in historical times
as described by Varro Servius and Plutarch it was believed to
be of Etruscan origin like so many other Roman rites but it is now
generally considered to be old Italian in a general sense A white ox
and a white cow were harnessed to a plough of which the share must be
made of bronze and on an auspicious day drew a rectangular furrow
where the walls of the city were to be the earth was turned inwards to
indicate the line of the wall and the furrow represented the future
pomerium When the plough came to the place where there was to be a
gate it was lifted over it and the ploughing resumed beyond it This
meant that though the walls were sacred the gates were profane for
as Plutarch says had the gates been holy scruple would have been
felt about the passage in and out of them of unholy things The result
of this religious process was to keep outside the sacred boundary of
the wall all evil and strange spirits or as we may now say seeing
that we are entering an era of higher civilization strange gods
and inside it there dwelt only those who belonged to the place and its
inhabitants indigetes and whose alliance and protection had become
assured Inside it too and only within its limits could the auspicia
of the city be taken

We might naturally expect that this sacred wall and boundary would have
its holiness and efficacy secured by an annual lustratio of the same
kind as that of the farm and pagus and so it was We know that there
was at Rome a lustral rite called Amburbium which probably took place
at the beginning of the month of purification February but it is
for us unluckily little more than a name Later on in the same month
we find the extraordinary rite of the Lupercalia th in which the
pomerium is so far concerned as that the Luperci or young men who
served as priests on the occasion ran round the ancient boundary of
the Palatine settlement girt with the skins of the victims striking
at all women who came near them with strips cut from these same skins
in order to produce fertility But was this really a lustratio urbis
In my Roman Festivals I treated it as such p  on the ground
that Varro uses the word lustrare in alluding to it I am now however
disposed to think that Varro was here using the word in a general and
not a technical sense and that the object of it was not as in the
rites we have been discussing to keep evil spirits away from the
city as a whole It seems to be a survival of some very primitive
magicoreligious ideas into which I will not enter now Certain it
is that the leading feature of the true lustratio is absent from it
instead of a slow and stately procession of worshippers and victims we
have the wild running of almost naked youths apparently personating or
embodying a deity

Fortunately we can illustrate the real lustratio of a city from a
different source and in this case most luckily a documentary one but
from an Umbrian city instead of a Latin one The town of Gubbio the
modern form of Iguvium still preserves the priestly instructions
drawn up from older sources probably at the beginning of the last
century B C for the lustratio of its citadel the arx ocris
Fisia by a guild of priests called the Fratres Attiedii Here
the ceremony has been developed under priestly influence into a series
of ritualistic acts of the highest exactness and complexity but the
main features of the lustratio stand out quite clearly The procession
goes solemnly round the arx with the victims which are the same
as those of the Latin lustratio at each gate it stops and offers
sacrifice and prayer on behalf of the citadel the city and the whole
people of Iguvium The gates three in number are the scene of the
actual sacrifice and prayer because they are the weak points in the
wall as we have seen and they need to be spiritually strengthened
by annual religious operations though not such as would make them
permanently sacred like the wall itself Doubtless the Fratres Attiedii
would have been unable to explain this as I am explaining it the
sense of a hostile spiritual world outside the sacred boundary had
vanished from the Italian mind when these elaborate liturgical formulae
were drawn up The prayers are cast in language that hardly differs
from those of a Church of today which asks for a blessing on a
community The deities of the city are asked to preserve the name the
magistrates rites men cattle land and cropsa list in which the
name is the only item which carries us clearly back to preChristian
times The ideas and the deities have been developed into a religious
system of considerable complexity but the actual proceedings the
procession and the prayers at the gates still remind us of the rock
whence all this ritual was hewn

I said that human beings might be subjected to the lustral process
en masse as well as land and city Before we return from Iguvium
to Rome I may mention that the Iguvian documents also contain
instructions for the lustratio of the people So far as we can
gather from the Umbrian text the people was brought together in a
particular spot in its military divisions and round them a procession
went three times at the end of each circuit there was sacrifice and
prayer the former not apparently with the usual suovetaurilia and
Mars and two female consorts or representatives of his power were
entreated to confound and frighten certain enemies of the city in
language which reminds me of the prayer in time of war now happily
abandoned which I can remember as a child being read in the days
of the Crimean warabate their pride assuage their malice and
confound their devices Then followed of course a prayer for blessing
on the Iguvini This may conveniently bring us back to Rome for in
the account of the census and lustrum in the Campus Martius given by
Dionysius of Halicarnassus iv  we find the suovetaurilia driven
three times round the assembled host with sacrifice to Mars This was
no doubt really the early form of the census which had a military
meaning and origin

The explanation of this lustration of the host the male population
in arms of a community is not quite the same as that of the rite as
applied to a city yet it takes us back to the same animistic period
and the same class of ideas These armies were likely to have to march
against enemies living far beyond the pale of the ager Romanus and
therefore among spirits with whom the Romans or Iguvians as the case
might be had no peaceful relations and of whose ways and freaks they
were in fact entirely ignorant They must therefore be protected
against such evil influences by some special device and ritual Of this
kind of practice Dr Frazer has collected some examples in Golden
Bough i  foll both from savage tribes and from Greek usage As
we are dealing here with Rome only we may content ourselves with a
parallel from the pen of a Roman historian which as it happens Dr
Frazer has not mentioned Livy tells us that the method in Macedonia
was to march the whole host in spring before a campaign between the
severed limbs of a dog xl  init This only differs from the
Italian plan in method not in principle the object in each case is to
subject the whole army without exception to the salutary influence of
the victim but in Macedonia it is made to pass between the two parts
of a slain victim while in Italy the live victims are made to pass
round the army and afterwards sacrificed That each Roman army was
thus lustrated is almost certain Dict Ant vol ii  in fact
the word lustratio came to mean a review of troops for this reason
without religious signification so at least we are used to take such
expressions as Cicero uses of his army in Cilicia exercitum lustravi
Att v   Even the fleets were subjected to the same process
and in Livy xxix  we have a prayer addressed by Scipio to the
deities of the sea before sailing for Africa which may remind us of
those used during the lustration of the people at Iguvium

Further at this same time in spring before the season of arms
all the appurtenances of the army were purifiedthe horses the
arms and the trumpets So at least we may gather from the fact that
there was a festival in the oldest religious calendar at the end of
February called Equirria and another of the same name on March 
following though the real meaning of the word was lost in later times
this explanation is strongly suggested by the dates and also by the
place i e the Campus Martius If this was flooded it took place
on the Caelian hill The details of the festival which must have
included horse racing are unfortunately lost The Equirria of March
 seems to correspond to a curious rite of which the date is October
 ie after the season of arms on that day there was a twohorse
chariotrace in the Campus Martius and the near horse of the winning
chariot was sacrificed to Mars with peculiar ritual following the
slaughter It is tempting to refer this rite to a lustratio of the
horses after their return from a campaign but here again the details
of a true lustratio are not forthcoming It may have originally been
as Wissowa suggests a cathartic rite purifying the army from the taint
of bloodshed cf G B i  foll the blood of the sacrificed
horse was allowed to drip upon the sacred hearth of the Regia and it
is probable that it was used in the making of certain sacred cakes
mola salsa of great cathartic value But it is remarkable that
this rite was not included in the festivals of the ancient calendar
we know of it only from other sources I am inclined to hazard a guess
that it belonged to a type of ceremony which the earliest pontifical
legislators were unwilling to recognize their efforts as it seems to
me must have been directed to make the worship of the people as pure
and orderly as possible

The old calendar also supplies strong evidence that the arms and the
trumpets of the host were lustrated both before and after a campaign
On March  called Quinquatrus because it was the fifth day after
the Ides the ancilia or shields of the warpriests of Mars were
thus purified and it is a good guess that they stood for the arms of
the fighting men generally For on October  we find the festival
Armilustrium which tells its own tale On that day it seems clear
that both arma and ancilia were lustrated and that the Salii for this
purpose went round the armed host in a place called by the same name as
the rite in or near the Circus maximus Varro LL   cf 
 Again we have March  marked in the calendar as Tubilustrium
and though the old explanations confine these tubae to such as were
used in sacris I believe with Wissowa that included in these were
the trumpets of the host

Lastly we may believe that the army was purified from the taint of
bloodshed after its return from a campaign just as the Hebrew warriors
and their captives were purified before reentering the camp after a
battle Num xxi  I have just now suggested that the sacrifice of
the October horse may have originally had this object But in Roman
pontifical law the idea of the taint of bloodshed is only faintly
discernible as is also the case in the Homeric poems Farnell
Evolution p  and the only distinct trace of it that I can find
in regard to the army is a statement of Festus that the soldiers who
followed the generals car in a triumph wore laurel wreaths ut quasi
purgati a caede humana intrarent urbem Fest  Laurel was a
powerful purgative of such taint

I have now given some brief account of the most remarkable examples of
the characteristic type of lustration in Italy and more especially at
Rome and it only remains for me to sum up in outline what I have been
saying We began with the ideas of purification which were common to
the Italians and other primitive peoples and which have left traces
here and there in the public and private ritual of the Romans but
without showing any great vital force such as might enable them to
develop into matters of religious or ethical importance in Roman life
We then saw how the nature of the Italian peninsula as it was in the
dawn of civilization and the universal belief in a world of spirits
haunting mountain and woodland compelled the early Latin farmer to
draw a welldefined boundary line between the land he had reclaimed and
the forest beyond it within which he and his familia and his friendly
spirits or deities might be at peace and how he sought to render this
boundary impermeable to the hostile spirits outside it by a yearly
ceremony consisting of a procession around it of victims for sacrifice
Then we saw how this same practice was retained in the service of the
State and applied to the foundation of a city to its land to the
circuit of its walls to its people in the form of the men capable of
carrying arms to the horses the arms and the trumpets of this host

In conclusion I must ask the question whether this impressive ritual
of lustratio ever came to have any religious or moral import for the
Roman people Undoubtedly the idea which lay at the root of it the
protection of the city and its inhabitants from hostile spirits or
strange gods disappeared from the Roman mind at an early period among
the governing and better educated classes In one point only so far as
I know can we detect a survival of itnamely in the persistence of
the pontifices in refusing to admit new gods within the sacred circle
of the pomerium they might be taken into the Society of Roman deities
but they must be settled in temples placed outside that boundary
line But as early as the second Punic war this old rule began to be
broken and in  BC even the mystic stone of the Magna Mater of the
Phrygians was brought within the pomerium and settled in the heart of
the city on the Palatine And from that time onwards whatever may have
been the notions about such things of the ignorant Latin population
the old ideas assuredly vanished utterly from the minds of those who
were in charge of the State and its religion

Was there any transmutation of those ideas into religious beliefs which
might help State or individual in the changes and chances of this
mortal life The answer to this question is a most emphatic negative
What spiritual help they needed they sought and obtained in new and
foreign rites their own solemn processions were sights to see and
nothing more Lustratio never really in pagan Italy developed an
ethical meaning as catharsis did to some extent in Greece And the
explanation of this is a simple one at a very early stage the State
overpowered the individual and the State religion obliterated all
the germs of an individual religious conscience Even in the cult of
Jupiter where if anywhere we might look for an ethical significance
this was so we do not pray to Jupiter says Cicero to make us
good but to give us material benefits

But meaningless as they were the stately processions remained and
could be watched with pride by the patriotic Roman all through the
period of the Empire Then the Roman Church with characteristic
adroitness adapted them to its own ritual and gave them a new
meaning and the Catholic priest still leads his flock round the
fields with the prayers of the Litania major in Rogation week not
only beating the bounds as we still do in Oxford on Ascension Day but
begging a blessing on the crops and herds and deprecating the anger of
the Almighty
