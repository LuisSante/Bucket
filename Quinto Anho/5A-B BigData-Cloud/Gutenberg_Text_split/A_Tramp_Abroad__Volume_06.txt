CHAPTER XXXVI

The Fiendish Fun of Alpclimbing


We did not oversleep at St Nicholas The churchbell began to ring at
fourthirty in the morning and from the length of time it continued
to ring I judged that it takes the Swiss sinner a good while to get the
invitation through his head Most churchbells in the world are of poor
quality and have a harsh and rasping sound which upsets the temper and
produces much sin but the St Nicholas bell is a good deal the worst
one that has been contrived yet and is peculiarly maddening in its
operation Still it may have its right and its excuse to exist for the
community is poor and not every citizen can afford a clock perhaps but
there cannot be any excuse for our churchbells at home for there is
no family in America without a clock and consequently there is no fair
pretext for the usual Sunday medley of dreadful sounds that issues from
our steeples There is much more profanity in America on Sunday than in
all in the other six days of the week put together and it is of a more
bitter and malignant character than the weekday profanity too It is
produced by the crackedpot clangor of the cheap churchbells



We build our churches almost without regard to cost we rear an edifice
which is an adornment to the town and we gild it and fresco it and
mortgage it and do everything we can think of to perfect it and then
spoil it all by putting a bell on it which afflicts everybody who hears
it giving some the headache others St Vituss dance and the rest the
blind staggers

An American village at ten oclock on a summer Sunday is the quietest
and peacefulest and holiest thing in nature but it is a pretty
different thing half an hour later Mr Poes poem of the Bells stands
incomplete to this day but it is well enough that it is so for the
public reciter or reader who goes around trying to imitate the sounds
of the various sorts of bells with his voice would find himself up a
stump when he got to the churchbellas Joseph Addison would say The
church is always trying to get other people to reform it might not be
a bad idea to reform itself a little by way of example It is still
clinging to one or two things which were useful once but which are
not useful now neither are they ornamental One is the bellringing
to remind a clockcaked town that it is churchtime and another is the
reading from the pulpit of a tedious list of notices which everybody
who is interested has already read in the newspaper The clergyman even
reads the hymn througha relic of an ancient time when hymnbooks are
scarce and costly but everybody has a hymnbook now and so the public
reading is no longer necessary It is not merely unnecessary it is
generally painful for the average clergyman could not fire into his
congregation with a shotgun and hit a worse reader than himself unless
the weapon scattered shamefully I am not meaning to be flippant and
irreverent I am only meaning to be truthful The average clergyman in
all countries and of all denominations is a very bad reader One would
think he would at least learn how to read the Lords Prayer by and by
but it is not so He races through it as if he thought the quicker
he got it in the sooner it would be answered A person who does not
appreciate the exceeding value of pauses and does not know how to
measure their duration judiciously cannot render the grand simplicity
and dignity of a composition like that effectively

We took a tolerably early breakfast and tramped off toward Zermatt
through the reeking lanes of the village glad to get away from that
bell By and by we had a fine spectacle on our right It was the
walllike butt end of a huge glacier which looked down on us from an
Alpine height which was well up in the blue sky It was an astonishing
amount of ice to be compacted together in one mass We ciphered upon it
and decided that it was not less than several hundred feet from the base
of the wall of solid ice to the top of itHarris believed it was
really twice that We judged that if St Pauls St Peters the Great
Pyramid the Strasburg Cathedral and the Capitol in Washington were
clustered against that wall a man sitting on its upper edge could not
hang his hat on the top of any one of them without reaching down three
or four hundred feeta thing which of course no man could do

To me that mighty glacier was very beautiful I did not imagine that
anybody could find fault with it but I was mistaken Harris had been
snarling for several days He was a rabid Protestant and he was always
saying

In the Protestant cantons you never see such poverty and dirt and
squalor as you do in this Catholic one you never see the lanes and
alleys flowing with foulness you never see such wretched little sties
of houses you never see an inverted tin turnip on top of a church for
a dome and as for a churchbell why you never hear a churchbell at
all

All this morning he had been finding fault straight along First it was
with the mud He said It aint muddy in a Protestant canton when it
rains Then it was with the dogs They dont have those lopeared dogs
in a Protestant canton Then it was with the roads They dont leave
the roads to make themselves in a Protestant canton the people make
themand they make a road that IS a road too Next it was the goats
You never see a goat shedding tears in a Protestant cantona goat
there is one of the cheerfulest objects in nature Next it was the
chamois You never see a Protestant chamois act like one of thesethey
take a bite or two and go but these fellows camp with you and stay
Then it was the guideboards In a Protestant canton you couldnt get
lost if you wanted to but you never see a guideboard in a Catholic
canton Next You never see any flowerboxes in the windows
herenever anything but now and then a cata torpid one but you take
a Protestant canton windows perfectly lovely with flowersand as for
cats theres just acres of them These folks in this canton leave a
road to make itself and then fine you three francs if you trot over
itas if a horse could trot over such a sarcasm of a road Next about
the goiter THEY talk about goiterI havent seen a goiter in this
whole canton that I couldnt put in a hat

He had growled at everything but I judged it would puzzle him to find
anything the matter with this majestic glacier I intimated as much but
he was ready and said with surly discontent You ought to see them in
the Protestant cantons

This irritated me But I concealed the feeling and asked

What is the matter with this one

Matter Why it aint in any kind of condition They never take any
care of a glacier here The moraine has been spilling gravel around it
and got it all dirty

Why man THEY cant help that

THEY Youre right That is they WONT They could if they wanted to
You never see a speck of dirt on a Protestant glacier Look at the Rhone
glacier It is fifteen miles long and seven hundred feet thick If this
was a Protestant glacier you wouldnt see it looking like this I can
tell you

That is nonsense What would they do with it

They would whitewash it They always do

I did not believe a word of this but rather than have trouble I let it
go for it is a waste of breath to argue with a bigot I even doubted if
the Rhone glacier WAS in a Protestant canton but I did not know so I
could not make anything by contradicting a man who would probably put me
down at once with manufactured evidence

About nine miles from St Nicholas we crossed a bridge over the raging
torrent of the Visp and came to a log strip of flimsy fencing which
was pretending to secure people from tumbling over a perpendicular wall
forty feet high and into the river Three children were approaching one
of them a little girl about eight years old was running when pretty
close to us she stumbled and fell and her feet shot under the rail of
the fence and for a moment projected over the stream It gave us a
sharp shock for we thought she was gone sure for the ground slanted
steeply and to save herself seemed a sheer impossibility but she
managed to scramble up and ran by us laughing

We went forward and examined the place and saw the long tracks which her
feet had made in the dirt when they darted over the verge If she had
finished her trip she would have struck some big rocks in the edge of
the water and then the torrent would have snatched her downstream among
the halfcovered boulders and she would have been pounded to pulp in two
minutes We had come exceedingly near witnessing her death



And now Harriss contrary nature and inborn selfishness were strikingly
manifested He has no spirit of selfdenial He began straight off and
continued for an hour to express his gratitude that the child was not
destroyed I never saw such a man That was the kind of person he was
just so HE was gratified he never cared anything about anybody else I
had noticed that trait in him over and over again Often of course it
was mere heedlessness mere want of reflection Doubtless this may have
been the case in most instances but it was not the less hard to bar
on that accountand after all its bottom its groundwork was
selfishness There is no avoiding that conclusion In the instance under
consideration I did think the indecency of running on in that way might
occur to him but no the child was saved and he was glad that was
sufficienthe cared not a straw for MY feelings or my loss of such a
literary plum snatched from my very mouth at the instant it was
ready to drop into it His selfishness was sufficient to place his own
gratification in being spared suffering clear before all concern for
me his friend Apparently he did not once reflect upon the valuable
details which would have fallen like a windfall to me fishing the child
outwitnessing the surprise of the family and the stir the thing would
have made among the peasantsthen a Swiss funeralthen the roadside
monument to be paid for by us and have our names mentioned in it And
we should have gone into Baedeker and been immortal I was silent I was
too much hurt to complain If he could act so and be so heedless and so
frivolous at such a time and actually seem to glory in it after all
I had done for him I would have cut my hand off before I would let him
see that I was wounded



We were approaching Zermatt consequently we were approaching the
renowned Matterhorn A month before this mountain had been only a name
to us but latterly we had been moving through a steadily thickening
double row of pictures of it done in oil water chromo wood steel
copper crayon and photography and so it had at length become a shape
to usand a very distinct decided and familiar one too We were
expecting to recognize that mountain whenever or wherever we should run
across it We were not deceived The monarch was far away when we first
saw him but there was no such thing as mistaking him He has the rare
peculiarity of standing by himself he is peculiarly steep too and is
also most oddly shaped He towers into the sky like a colossal wedge
with the upper third of its blade bent a little to the left The broad
base of this monster wedge is planted upon a grand glacierpaved Alpine
platform whose elevation is ten thousand feet above sealevel as the
wedge itself is some five thousand feet high it follows that its apex
is about fifteen thousand feet above sealevel So the whole bulk of
this stately piece of rock this skycleaving monolith is above the
line of eternal snow Yet while all its giant neighbors have the look of
being built of solid snow from their waists up the Matterhorn stands
black and naked and forbidding the year round or merely powdered or
streaked with white in places for its sides are so steep that the
snow cannot stay there Its strange form its august isolation and its
majestic unkinship with its own kind make itso to speakthe Napoleon
of the mountain world Grand gloomy and peculiar is a phrase which
fits it as aptly as it fitted the great captain

Think of a monument a mile high standing on a pedestal two miles high
This is what the Matterhorn isa monument Its office henceforth for
all time will be to keep watch and ward over the secret restingplace
of the young Lord Douglas who in  was precipitated from the
summit over a precipice four thousand feet high and never seen again
No man ever had such a monument as this before the most imposing of
the worlds other monuments are but atoms compared to it and they will
perish and their places will pass from memory but this will remain

The accident which cost Lord Douglas his life see Chapter xii also
cost the lives of three other men These three fell fourfifths of a
mile and their bodies were afterward found lying side by side upon a
glacier whence they were borne to Zermatt and buried in the churchyard

The remains of Lord Douglas have never been found The secret of his
sepulture like that of Moses must remain a mystery always

A walk from St Nicholas to Zermatt is a wonderful experience Nature
is built on a stupendous plan in that region One marches continually
between walls that are piled into the skies with their upper heights
broken into a confusion of sublime shapes that gleam white and cold
against the background of blue and here and there one sees a big
glacier displaying its grandeurs on the top of a precipice or a
graceful cascade leaping and flashing down the green declivities There
is nothing tame or cheap or trivialit is all magnificent That
short valley is a picturegallery of a notable kind for it contains
no mediocrities from end to end the Creator has hung it with His
masterpieces



We made Zermatt at three in the afternoon nine hours out from
St Nicholas Distance by guidebook twelve miles by pedometer
seventytwo We were in the heart and home of the mountainclimbers
now as all visible things testified The snowpeaks did not hold
themselves aloof in aristocratic reserve they nestled close around
in a friendly sociable way guides with the ropes and axes and other
implements of their fearful calling slung about their persons roosted
in a long line upon a stone wall in front of the hotel and waited for
customers sunburnt climbers in mountaineering costume and followed
by their guides and porters arrived from time to time from breakneck
expeditions among the peaks and glaciers of the High Alps male and
female tourists on mules filed by in a continuous procession
hotelwardbound from wild adventures which would grow in grandeur every
time they were described at the English or American fireside and at
last outgrow the possible itself

We were not dreaming this was not a makebelieve home of the
Alpclimber created by our heated imaginations no for here was Mr
Girdlestone himself the famous Englishman who hunts his way to the most
formidable Alpine summits without a guide I was not equal to imagining
a Girdlestone it was all I could do to even realize him while looking
straight at him at short range I would rather face whole Hyde Parks of
artillery than the ghastly forms of death which he has faced among the
peaks and precipices of the mountains There is probably no pleasure
equal to the pleasure of climbing a dangerous Alp but it is a pleasure
which is confined strictly to people who can find pleasure in it I have
not jumped to this conclusion I have traveled to it per graveltrain
so to speak I have thought the thing all out and am quite sure I am
right A born climbers appetite for climbing is hard to satisfy when
it comes upon him he is like a starving man with a feast before him he
may have other business on hand but it must wait Mr Girdlestone had
had his usual summer holiday in the Alps and had spent it in his usual
way hunting for unique chances to break his neck his vacation was
over and his luggage packed for England but all of a sudden a hunger
had come upon him to climb the tremendous Weisshorn once more for he
had heard of a new and utterly impossible route up it His baggage
was unpacked at once and now he and a friend laden with knapsacks
iceaxes coils of rope and canteens of milk were just setting out
They would spend the night high up among the snows somewhere and
get up at two in the morning and finish the enterprise I had a
strong desire to go with them but forced it downa feat which Mr
Girdlestone with all his fortitude could not do

Even ladies catch the climbing mania and are unable to throw it off
A famous climber of that sex had attempted the Weisshorn a few days
before our arrival and she and her guides had lost their way in a
snowstorm high up among the peaks and glaciers and been forced to
wander around a good while before they could find a way down When this
lady reached the bottom she had been on her feet twentythree hours

Our guides hired on the Gemmi were already at Zermatt when we
reached there So there was nothing to interfere with our getting up an
adventure whenever we should choose the time and the object I resolved
to devote my first evening in Zermatt to studying up the subject of
Alpine climbing by way of preparation

I read several books and here are some of the things I found out Ones
shoes must be strong and heavy and have pointed hobnails in them The
alpenstock must be of the best wood for if it should break loss of
life might be the result One should carry an ax to cut steps in the
ice with on the great heights There must be a ladder for there are
steep bits of rock which can be surmounted with this instrumentor this
utensilbut could not be surmounted without it such an obstruction
has compelled the tourist to waste hours hunting another route when a
ladder would have saved him all trouble One must have from one hundred
and fifty to five hundred feet of strong rope to be used in lowering
the party down steep declivities which are too steep and smooth to
be traversed in any other way One must have a steel hook on another
ropea very useful thing for when one is ascending and comes to a low
bluff which is yet too high for the ladder he swings this rope aloft
like a lasso the hook catches at the top of the bluff and then the
tourist climbs the rope hand over handbeing always particular to try
and forget that if the hook gives way he will never stop falling till
he arrives in some part of Switzerland where they are not expecting him
Another important thingthere must be a rope to tie the whole party
together with so that if one falls from a mountain or down a bottomless
chasm in a glacier the others may brace back on the rope and save him
One must have a silk veil to protect his face from snow sleet hail
and gale and colored goggles to protect his eyes from that dangerous
enemy snowblindness Finally there must be some porters to carry
provisions wine and scientific instruments and also blanket bags for
the party to sleep in



I closed my readings with a fearful adventure which Mr Whymper once had
on the Matterhorn when he was prowling around alone five thousand
feet above the town of Breil He was edging his way gingerly around
the corner of a precipice where the upper edge of a sharp declivity of
iceglazed snow joined it This declivity swept down a couple of hundred
feet into a gully which curved around and ended at a precipice eight
hundred feet high overlooking a glacier His foot slipped and he fell

He says

My knapsack brought my head down first and I pitched into some rocks
about a dozen feet below they caught something and tumbled me off
the edge head over heels into the gully the baton was dashed from my
hands and I whirled downward in a series of bounds each longer than
the last now over ice now into rocks striking my head four or five
times each time with increased force The last bound sent me spinning
through the air in a leap of fifty or sixty feet from one side of the
gully to the other and I struck the rocks luckily with the whole of
my left side They caught my clothes for a moment and I fell back on to
the snow with motion arrested My head fortunately came the right side
up and a few frantic catches brought me to a halt in the neck of the
gully and on the verge of the precipice Baton hat and veil skimmed
by and disappeared and the crash of the rockswhich I had startedas
they fell on to the glacier told how narrow had been the escape from
utter destruction As it was I fell nearly two hundred feet in seven or
eight bounds Ten feet more would have taken me in one gigantic leap of
eight hundred feet on to the glacier below



The situation was sufficiently serious The rocks could not be let go
for a moment and the blood was spurting out of more than twenty cuts
The most serious ones were in the head and I vainly tried to close
them with one hand while holding on with the other It was useless
the blood gushed out in blinding jets at each pulsation At last in a
moment of inspiration I kicked out a big lump of snow and struck it
as plaster on my head The idea was a happy one and the flow of blood
diminished Then scrambling up I got not a moment too soon to
a place of safety and fainted away The sun was setting when
consciousness returned and it was pitchdark before the Great Staircase
was descended but by a combination of luck and care the whole four
thousand seven hundred feet of descent to Breil was accomplished without
a slip or once missing the way

His wounds kept him abed some days Then he got up and climbed that
mountain again That is the way with a true Alpclimber the more fun he
has the more he wants



CHAPTER XXXVII

Our Imposing Column Starts Upward


After I had finished my readings I was no longer myself I was tranced
uplifted intoxicated by the almost incredible perils and adventures
I had been following my authors through and the triumphs I had been
sharing with them I sat silent some time then turned to Harris and
said

My mind is made up

Something in my tone struck him and when he glanced at my eye and
read what was written there his face paled perceptibly He hesitated a
moment then said

Speak

I answered with perfect calmness

I will ascend the Riffelberg

If I had shot my poor friend he could not have fallen from his chair
more suddenly If I had been his father he could not have pleaded harder
to get me to give up my purpose But I turned a deaf ear to all he said
When he perceived at last that nothing could alter my determination he
ceased to urge and for a while the deep silence was broken only by his
sobs I sat in marble resolution with my eyes fixed upon vacancy for
in spirit I was already wrestling with the perils of the mountains and
my friend sat gazing at me in adoring admiration through his tears
At last he threw himself upon me in a loving embrace and exclaimed in
broken tones

Your Harris will never desert you We will die together

I cheered the noble fellow with praises and soon his fears were
forgotten and he was eager for the adventure He wanted to summon the
guides at once and leave at two in the morning as he supposed the
custom was but I explained that nobody was looking at that hour and
that the start in the dark was not usually made from the village but
from the first nights restingplace on the mountain side I said we
would leave the village at  or  PM on the morrow meantime he could
notify the guides and also let the public know of the attempt which we
proposed to make

I went to bed but not to sleep No man can sleep when he is about to
undertake one of these Alpine exploits I tossed feverishly all night
long and was glad enough when I heard the clock strike half past eleven
and knew it was time to get up for dinner I rose jaded and rusty and
went to the noon meal where I found myself the center of interest and
curiosity for the news was already abroad It is not easy to eat calmly
when you are a lion but it is very pleasant nevertheless

As usual at Zermatt when a great ascent is about to be undertaken
everybody native and foreign laid aside his own projects and took up
a good position to observe the start The expedition consisted of 
persons including the mules or  including the cows As follows

It was full four oclock in the afternoon before my cavalcade was
entirely ready At that hour it began to move In point of numbers and
spectacular effect it was the most imposing expedition that had ever
marched from Zermatt



I commanded the chief guide to arrange the men and animals in single
file twelve feet apart and lash them all together on a strong rope He
objected that the first two miles was a dead level with plenty of room
and that the rope was never used except in very dangerous places But
I would not listen to that My reading had taught me that many serious
accidents had happened in the Alps simply from not having the people
tied up soon enough I was not going to add one to the list The guide
then obeyed my order

When the procession stood at ease roped together and ready to move I
never saw a finer sight It was  feet longover half a mile every
man and me was on foot and had on his green veil and his blue goggles
and his white rag around his hat and his coil of rope over one shoulder
and under the other and his iceax in his belt and carried his
alpenstock in his left hand his umbrella closed in his right and his
crutches slung at his back The burdens of the packmules and the horns
of the cows were decked with the Edelweiss and the Alpine rose

I and my agent were the only persons mounted We were in the post of
danger in the extreme rear and tied securely to five guides apiece Our
armorbearers carried our iceaxes alpenstocks and other implements
for us We were mounted upon very small donkeys as a measure of safety
in time of peril we could straighten our legs and stand up and let
the donkey walk from under Still I cannot recommend this sort of
animalat least for excursions of mere pleasurebecause his
ears interrupt the view I and my agent possessed the regulation
mountaineering costumes but concluded to leave them behind Out of
respect for the great numbers of tourists of both sexes who would be
assembled in front of the hotels to see us pass and also out of respect
for the many tourists whom we expected to encounter on our expedition
we decided to make the ascent in evening dress



We watered the caravan at the cold stream which rushes down a trough
near the end of the village and soon afterward left the haunts of
civilization behind us About half past five oclock we arrived at a
bridge which spans the Visp and after throwing over a detachment to see
if it was safe the caravan crossed without accident The way now led
by a gentle ascent carpeted with fresh green grass to the church at
Winkelmatten Without stopping to examine this edifice I executed
a flank movement to the right and crossed the bridge over the
Findelenbach after first testing its strength Here I deployed to the
right again and presently entered an inviting stretch of meadowland
which was unoccupied save by a couple of deserted huts toward the
furthest extremity These meadows offered an excellent campingplace
We pitched our tents supped established a proper grade recorded the
events of the day and then went to bed

We rose at two in the morning and dressed by candlelight It was a
dismal and chilly business A few stars were shining but the general
heavens were overcast and the great shaft of the Matterhorn was draped
in a cable pall of clouds The chief guide advised a delay he said he
feared it was going to rain We waited until nine oclock and then got
away in tolerably clear weather



Our course led up some terrific steeps densely wooded with larches and
cedars and traversed by paths which the rains had guttered and which
were obstructed by loose stones To add to the danger and inconvenience
we were constantly meeting returning tourists on foot and horseback and
as constantly being crowded and battered by ascending tourists who were
in a hurry and wanted to get by

Our troubles thickened About the middle of the afternoon the seventeen
guides called a halt and held a consultation After consulting an hour
they said their first suspicion remained intactthat is to say they
believed they were lost I asked if they did not KNOW it No they said
they COULDNT absolutely know whether they were lost or not because
none of them had ever been in that part of the country before They had
a strong instinct that they were lost but they had no proofsexcept
that they did not know where they were They had met no tourists for
some time and they considered that a suspicious sign

Plainly we were in an ugly fix The guides were naturally unwilling to
go alone and seek a way out of the difficulty so we all went together
For better security we moved slow and cautiously for the forest was
very dense We did not move up the mountain but around it hoping to
strike across the old trail Toward nightfall when we were about tired
out we came up against a rock as big as a cottage This barrier took
all the remaining spirit out of the men and a panic of fear and despair
ensued They moaned and wept and said they should never see their homes
and their dear ones again Then they began to upbraid me for bringing
them upon this fatal expedition Some even muttered threats against me

Clearly it was no time to show weakness So I made a speech in which I
said that other Alpclimbers had been in as perilous a position as this
and yet by courage and perseverance had escaped I promised to stand
by them I promised to rescue them I closed by saying we had plenty
of provisions to maintain us for quite a siegeand did they suppose
Zermatt would allow half a mile of men and mules to mysteriously
disappear during any considerable time right above their noses and
make no inquiries No Zermatt would send out searchingexpeditions and
we should be saved

This speech had a great effect The men pitched the tents with some
little show of cheerfulness and we were snugly under cover when the
night shut down I now reaped the reward of my wisdom in providing one
article which is not mentioned in any book of Alpine adventure but this
I refer to the paregoric But for that beneficent drug would have not
one of those men slept a moment during that fearful night But for that
gentle persuader they must have tossed unsoothed the night through
for the whiskey was for me Yes they would have risen in the morning
unfitted for their heavy task As it was everybody slept but my agent
and meonly we and the barkeepers I would not permit myself to sleep
at such a time I considered myself responsible for all those lives I
meant to be on hand and ready in case of avalanches up there but I did
not know it then

We watched the weather all through that awful night and kept an eye on
the barometer to be prepared for the least change There was not the
slightest change recorded by the instrument during the whole time
Words cannot describe the comfort that that friendly hopeful steadfast
thing was to me in that season of trouble It was a defective barometer
and had no hand but the stationary brass pointer but I did not know
that until afterward If I should be in such a situation again I should
not wish for any barometer but that one



All hands rose at two in the morning and took breakfast and as soon as
it was light we roped ourselves together and went at that rock For some
time we tried the hookrope and other means of scaling it but without
successthat is without perfect success The hook caught once and
Harris started up it hand over hand but the hold broke and if there
had not happened to be a chaplain sitting underneath at the time Harris
would certainly have been crippled As it was it was the chaplain He
took to his crutches and I ordered the hookrope to be laid aside It
was too dangerous an implement where so many people are standing around



We were puzzled for a while then somebody thought of the ladders
One of these was leaned against the rock and the men went up it tied
together in couples Another ladder was sent up for use in descending
At the end of half an hour everybody was over and that rock was
conquered We gave our first grand shout of triumph But the joy was
shortlived for somebody asked how we were going to get the animals
over

This was a serious difficulty in fact it was an impossibility
The courage of the men began to waver immediately once more we were
threatened with a panic But when the danger was most imminent we were
saved in a mysterious way A mule which had attracted attention from the
beginning by its disposition to experiment tried to eat a fivepound
can of nitroglycerin This happened right alongside the rock The
explosion threw us all to the ground and covered us with dirt and
debris it frightened us extremely too for the crash it made was
deafening and the violence of the shock made the ground tremble
However we were grateful for the rock was gone Its place was occupied
by a new cellar about thirty feet across by fifteen feet deep The
explosion was heard as far as Zermatt and an hour and a half afterward
many citizens of that town were knocked down and quite seriously injured
by descending portions of mule meat frozen solid This shows better
than any estimate in figures how high the experimenter went



We had nothing to do now but bridge the cellar and proceed on our way
With a cheer the men went at their work I attended to the engineering
myself I appointed a strong detail to cut down trees with iceaxes and
trim them for piers to support the bridge This was a slow business for
iceaxes are not good to cut wood with I caused my piers to be firmly
set up in ranks in the cellar and upon them I laid six of my fortyfoot
ladders side by side and laid six more on top of them Upon this
bridge I caused a bed of boughs to be spread and on top of the boughs
a bed of earth six inches deep I stretched ropes upon either side to
serve as railings and then my bridge was complete A train of elephants
could have crossed it in safety and comfort By nightfall the caravan
was on the other side and the ladders were taken up

Next morning we went on in good spirits for a while though our way
was slow and difficult by reason of the steep and rocky nature of the
ground and the thickness of the forest but at last a dull despondency
crept into the mens faces and it was apparent that not only they but
even the guides were now convinced that we were lost The fact that we
still met no tourists was a circumstance that was but too significant
Another thing seemed to suggest that we were not only lost but very
badly lost for there must surely be searchingparties on the road
before this time yet we had seen no sign of them

Demoralization was spreading something must be done and done quickly
too Fortunately I am not unfertile in expedients I contrived one
now which commended itself to all for it promised well I took
threequarters of a mile of rope and fastened one end of it around the
waist of a guide and told him to go find the road while the caravan
waited I instructed him to guide himself back by the rope in case of
failure in case of success he was to give the rope a series of violent
jerks whereupon the Expedition would go to him at once He departed
and in two minutes had disappeared among the trees I payed out the rope
myself while everybody watched the crawling thing with eager eyes
The rope crept away quite slowly at times at other times with some
briskness Twice or thrice we seemed to get the signal and a shout was
just ready to break from the mens lips when they perceived it was a
false alarm But at last when over half a mile of rope had slidden
away it stopped gliding and stood absolutely stillone minutetwo
minutesthreewhile we held our breath and watched

Was the guide resting Was he scanning the country from some high point
Was he inquiring of a chance mountaineer Stophad he fainted from
excess of fatigue and anxiety

This thought gave us a shock I was in the very first act of detailing
an Expedition to succor him when the cord was assailed with a series of
such frantic jerks that I could hardly keep hold of it The huzza that
went up then was good to hear Saved saved was the word that rang
out all down the long rank of the caravan



We rose up and started at once We found the route to be good enough
for a while but it began to grow difficult by and by and this feature
steadily increased When we judged we had gone half a mile we momently
expected to see the guide but no he was not visible anywhere neither
was he waiting for the rope was still moving consequently he was
doing the same This argued that he had not found the road yet but
was marching to it with some peasant There was nothing for us to do
but plod alongand this we did At the end of three hours we were
still plodding This was not only mysterious but exasperating And very
fatiguing too for we had tried hard along at first to catch up with
the guide but had only fagged ourselves in vain for although he was
traveling slowly he was yet able to go faster than the hampered caravan
over such ground

At three in the afternoon we were nearly dead with exhaustionand still
the rope was slowly gliding out The murmurs against the guide had been
growing steadily and at last they were become loud and savage A mutiny
ensued The men refused to proceed They declared that we had been
traveling over and over the same ground all day in a kind of circle
They demanded that our end of the rope be made fast to a tree so as to
halt the guide until we could overtake him and kill him This was not an
unreasonable requirement so I gave the order

As soon as the rope was tied the Expedition moved forward with that
alacrity which the thirst for vengeance usually inspires But after a
tiresome march of almost half a mile we came to a hill covered thick
with a crumbly rubbish of stones and so steep that no man of us all
was now in a condition to climb it Every attempt failed and ended in
crippling somebody Within twenty minutes I had five men on crutches



Whenever a climber tried to assist himself by the rope it yielded and
let him tumble backward The frequency of this result suggested an idea
to me I ordered the caravan to bout face and form in marching order I
then made the towrope fast to the rear mule and gave the command

Mark timeby the right flankforwardmarch



The procession began to move to the impressive strains of a
battlechant and I said to myself Now if the rope dont break I
judge THIS will fetch that guide into the camp I watched the rope
gliding down the hill and presently when I was all fixed for triumph
I was confronted by a bitter disappointment there was no guide tied to
the rope it was only a very indignant old black ram The fury of the
baffled Expedition exceeded all bounds They even wanted to wreak their
unreasoning vengeance on this innocent dumb brute But I stood between
them and their prey menaced by a bristling wall of iceaxes and
alpenstocks and proclaimed that there was but one road to this murder
and it was directly over my corpse Even as I spoke I saw that my doom
was sealed except a miracle supervened to divert these madmen from
their fell purpose I see the sickening wall of weapons now I see that
advancing host as I saw it then I see the hate in those cruel eyes I
remember how I drooped my head upon my breast I feel again the
sudden earthquake shock in my rear administered by the very ram I was
sacrificing myself to save I hear once more the typhoon of laughter
that burst from the assaulting column as I clove it from van to rear
like a Sepoy shot from a Rodman gun



I was saved Yes I was saved and by the merciful instinct of
ingratitude which nature had planted in the breast of that treacherous
beast The grace which eloquence had failed to work in those mens
hearts had been wrought by a laugh The ram was set free and my life
was spared

We lived to find out that that guide had deserted us as soon as he had
placed a halfmile between himself and us To avert suspicion he had
judged it best that the line should continue to move so he caught that
ram and at the time that he was sitting on it making the rope fast to
it we were imagining that he was lying in a swoon overcome by fatigue
and distress When he allowed the ram to get up it fell to plunging
around trying to rid itself of the rope and this was the signal which
we had risen up with glad shouts to obey We had followed this ram round
and round in a circle all daya thing which was proven by the discovery
that we had watered the Expedition seven times at one and same spring in
seven hours As expert a woodman as I am I had somehow failed to notice
this until my attention was called to it by a hog This hog was always
wallowing there and as he was the only hog we saw his frequent
repetition together with his unvarying similarity to himself finally
caused me to reflect that he must be the same hog and this led me to
the deduction that this must be the same spring alsowhich indeed it
was

I made a note of this curious thing as showing in a striking manner the
relative difference between glacial action and the action of the hog
It is now a wellestablished fact that glaciers move I consider that
my observations go to show with equal conclusiveness that a hog in a
spring does not move I shall be glad to receive the opinions of other
observers upon this point

To return for an explanatory moment to that guide and then I shall be
done with him After leaving the ram tied to the rope he had wandered
at large a while and then happened to run across a cow Judging that a
cow would naturally know more than a guide he took her by the tail
and the result justified his judgment She nibbled her leisurely way
downhill till it was near milkingtime then she struck for home and
towed him into Zermatt



CHAPTER XXXVIII

I Conquer the Gorner Grat


We went into camp on that wild spot to which that ram had brought us
The men were greatly fatigued Their conviction that we were lost was
forgotten in the cheer of a good supper and before the reaction had a
chance to set in I loaded them up with paregoric and put them to bed

Next morning I was considering in my mind our desperate situation and
trying to think of a remedy when Harris came to me with a Baedeker
map which showed conclusively that the mountain we were on was still in
Switzerlandyes every part of it was in Switzerland So we were not
lost after all This was an immense relief it lifted the weight of two
such mountains from my breast I immediately had the news disseminated
and the map was exhibited The effect was wonderful As soon as the men
saw with their own eyes that they knew where they were and that it
was only the summit that was lost and not themselves they cheered up
instantly and said with one accord let the summit take care of itself

Our distresses being at an end I now determined to rest the men in camp
and give the scientific department of the Expedition a chance First
I made a barometric observation to get our altitude but I could not
perceive that there was any result I knew by my scientific reading
that either thermometers or barometers ought to be boiled to make them
accurate I did not know which it was so I boiled them both There was
still no result so I examined these instruments and discovered that
they possessed radical blemishes the barometer had no hand but the
brass pointer and the ball of the thermometer was stuffed with tinfoil
I might have boiled those things to rags and never found out anything

I hunted up another barometer it was new and perfect I boiled it half
an hour in a pot of bean soup which the cooks were making The result
was unexpected the instrument was not affecting at all but there was
such a strong barometer taste to the soup that the head cook who was
a most conscientious person changed its name in the bill of fare
The dish was so greatly liked by all that I ordered the cook to have
barometer soup every day



It was believed that the barometer might eventually be injured but I
did not care for that I had demonstrated to my satisfaction that it
could not tell how high a mountain was therefore I had no real use for
it Changes in the weather I could take care of without it I did not
wish to know when the weather was going to be good what I wanted to
know was when it was going to be bad and this I could find out from
Harriss corns Harris had had his corns tested and regulated at the
government observatory in Heidelberg and one could depend upon them
with confidence So I transferred the new barometer to the cooking
department to be used for the official mess It was found that even a
pretty fair article of soup could be made from the defective barometer
so I allowed that one to be transferred to the subordinate mess

I next boiled the thermometer and got a most excellent result the
mercury went up to about  degrees Fahrenheit In the opinion of the
other scientists of the Expedition this seemed to indicate that we had
attained the extraordinary altitude of two hundred thousand feet above
sealevel Science places the line of eternal snow at about ten thousand
feet above sealevel There was no snow where we were consequently
it was proven that the eternal snowline ceases somewhere above the
tenthousandfoot level and does not begin any more This was an
interesting fact and one which had not been observed by any observer
before It was as valuable as interesting too since it would open up
the deserted summits of the highest Alps to population and agriculture
It was a proud thing to be where we were yet it caused us a pang
to reflect that but for that ram we might just as well have been two
hundred thousand feet higher

The success of my last experiment induced me to try an experiment with
my photographic apparatus I got it out and boiled one of my cameras
but the thing was a failure it made the wood swell up and burst and I
could not see that the lenses were any better than they were before

I now concluded to boil a guide It might improve him it could not
impair his usefulness But I was not allowed to proceed Guides have
no feeling for science and this one would not consent to be made
uncomfortable in its interest

In the midst of my scientific work one of those needless accidents
happened which are always occurring among the ignorant and thoughtless
A porter shot at a chamois and missed it and crippled the Latinist
This was not a serious matter to me for a Latinists duties are as well
performed on crutches as otherwisebut the fact remained that if the
Latinist had not happened to be in the way a mule would have got that
load That would have been quite another matter for when it comes down
to a question of value there is a palpable difference between a Latinist
and a mule I could not depend on having a Latinist in the right place
every time so to make things safe I ordered that in the future the
chamois must not be hunted within limits of the camp with any other
weapon than the forefinger

My nerves had hardly grown quiet after this affair when they got another
shakeupone which utterly unmanned me for a moment a rumor swept
suddenly through the camp that one of the barkeepers had fallen over a
precipice

However it turned out that it was only a chaplain I had laid in an
extra force of chaplains purposely to be prepared for emergencies
like this but by some unaccountable oversight had come away rather
shorthanded in the matter of barkeepers

On the following morning we moved on well refreshed and in good
spirits I remember this day with peculiar pleasure because it saw
our road restored to us Yes we found our road again and in quite an
extraordinary way We had plodded along some two hours and a half when
we came up against a solid mass of rock about twenty feet high I did
not need to be instructed by a mule this time I was already beginning
to know more than any mule in the Expedition I at once put in a blast
of dynamite and lifted that rock out of the way But to my surprise and
mortification I found that there had been a chalet on top of it

I picked up such members of the family as fell in my vicinity and
subordinates of my corps collected the rest None of these poor people
were injured happily but they were much annoyed I explained to
the head chaleteer just how the thing happened and that I was only
searching for the road and would certainly have given him timely notice
if I had known he was up there I said I had meant no harm and hoped
I had not lowered myself in his estimation by raising him a few rods in
the air I said many other judicious things and finally when I offered
to rebuild his chalet and pay for the breakages and throw in the
cellar he was mollified and satisfied He hadnt any cellar at all
before he would not have as good a view now as formerly but what he
had lost in view he had gained in cellar by exact measurement He said
there wasnt another hole like that in the mountainsand he would have
been right if the late mule had not tried to eat up the nitroglycerin

I put a hundred and sixteen men at work and they rebuilt the chalet
from its own debris in fifteen minutes It was a good deal more
picturesque than it was before too The man said we were now on the
FeilStutz above the Schwegmattinformation which I was glad to get
since it gave us our position to a degree of particularity which we had
not been accustomed to for a day or so We also learned that we were
standing at the foot of the Riffelberg proper and that the initial
chapter of our work was completed



We had a fine view from here of the energetic Visp as it makes its
first plunge into the world from under a huge arch of solid ice worn
through the footwall of the great Gorner Glacier and we could also see
the Furggenbach which is the outlet of the Furggen Glacier

The muleroad to the summit of the Riffelberg passed right in front of
the chalet a circumstance which we almost immediately noticed because
a procession of tourists was filing along it pretty much all the time

Pretty much may not be elegant English but it is high time it was
There is no elegant word or phrase which means just what it meansMT

The chaleteers business consisted in furnishing refreshments to
tourists My blast had interrupted this trade for a few minutes by
breaking all the bottles on the place but I gave the man a lot of
whiskey to sell for Alpine champagne and a lot of vinegar which would
answer for Rhine wine consequently trade was soon as brisk as ever

Leaving the Expedition outside to rest I quartered myself in the
chalet with Harris proposing to correct my journals and scientific
observations before continuing the ascent I had hardly begun my work
when a tall slender vigorous American youth of about twentythree who
was on his way down the mountain entered and came toward me with that
breezy selfcomplacency which is the adolescents idea of the wellbred
ease of the man of the world His hair was short and parted accurately
in the middle and he had all the look of an American person who would
be likely to begin his signature with an initial and spell his middle
name out He introduced himself smiling a smirky smile borrowed from
the courtiers of the stage extended a fairskinned talon and while he
gripped my hand in it he bent his body forward three times at the
hips as the stage courtier does and said in the airiest and most
condescending and patronizing wayI quite remember his exact language

Very glad to make your acquaintance m sure very glad indeed assure
you Ive read all your little efforts and greatly admired them and
when I heard you were here I 

I indicated a chair and he sat down This grandee was the grandson of
an American of considerable note in his day and not wholly forgotten
yeta man who came so near being a great man that he was quite
generally accounted one while he lived



I slowly paced the floor pondering scientific problems and heard this
conversation

GRANDSON First visit to Europe

HARRIS Mine Yes

GS With a soft reminiscent sigh suggestive of bygone joys that may
be tasted in their freshness but once Ah I know what it is to you A
first visitah the romance of it I wish I could feel it again

H Yes I find it exceeds all my dreams It is enchantment I go

GS With a dainty gesture of the hand signifying Spare me your callow
enthusiasms good friend Yes I know I know you go to cathedrals
and exclaim and you drag through leaguelong picturegalleries and
exclaim and you stand here and there and yonder upon historic
ground and continue to exclaim and you are permeated with your first
crude conceptions of Art and are proud and happy Ah yes proud and
happythat expresses it Yesyes enjoy itit is rightit is an
innocent revel

H And you Dont you do these things now

GS I Oh that is VERY good My dear sir when you are as old a
traveler as I am you will not ask such a question as that I visit
the regulation gallery moon around the regulation cathedral do the
worn round of the regulation sights YETExcuse me

H Well what DO you do then

GS Do I flitand flitfor I am ever on the wingbut I avoid the
herd Today I am in Paris tomorrow in Berlin anon in Rome but you
would look for me in vain in the galleries of the Louvre or the common
resorts of the gazers in those other capitals If you would find me you
must look in the unvisited nooks and corners where others never think
of going One day you will find me making myself at home in some obscure
peasants cabin another day you will find me in some forgotten castle
worshiping some little gem or art which the careless eye has overlooked
and which the unexperienced would despise again you will find me as
guest in the inner sanctuaries of palaces while the herd is content to
get a hurried glimpse of the unused chambers by feeing a servant

H You are a GUEST in such places

GS And a welcoming one

H It is surprising How does it come

GS My grandfathers name is a passport to all the courts in Europe I
have only to utter that name and every door is open to me I flit from
court to court at my own free will and pleasure and am always welcome
I am as much at home in the palaces of Europe as you are among your
relatives I know every titled person in Europe I think I have my
pockets full of invitations all the time I am under promise to go to
Italy where I am to be the guest of a succession of the noblest houses
in the land In Berlin my life is a continued round of gaiety in the
imperial palace It is the same wherever I go

H It must be very pleasant But it must make Boston seem a little slow
when you are at home

GS Yes of course it does But I dont go home much Theres no life
therelittle to feed a mans higher nature Bostons very narrow you
know She doesnt know it and you couldnt convince her of itso I say
nothing when Im there wheres the use Yes Boston is very narrow but
she has such a good opinion of herself that she cant see it A man who
has traveled as much as I have and seen as much of the world sees it
plain enough but he cant cure it you know so the best is to leave it
and seek a sphere which is more in harmony with his tastes and culture
I run across there once a year perhaps when I have nothing important
on hand but Im very soon back again I spend my time in Europe

H I see You map out your plans and 

GS No excuse me I dont map out any plans I simply follow the
inclination of the day I am limited by no ties no requirements I
am not bound in any way I am too old a traveler to hamper myself with
deliberate purposes I am simply a traveleran inveterate travelera
man of the world in a wordI can call myself by no other name I do
not say I am going here or I am going thereI say nothing at all I
only act For instance next week you may find me the guest of a grandee
of Spain or you may find me off for Venice or flitting toward Dresden
I shall probably go to Egypt presently friends will say to friends
He is at the Nile cataractsand at that very moment they will be
surprised to learn that Im away off yonder in India somewhere I am
a constant surprise to people They are always saying Yes he was
in Jerusalem when we heard of him last but goodness knows where he is
now

Presently the Grandson rose to leavediscovered he had an appointment
with some Emperor perhaps He did his graces over again gripped me
with one talon at armslength pressed his hat against his stomach
with the other bent his body in the middle three times murmuring

Pleasure m sure great pleasure m sure Wish you much success

Then he removed his gracious presence It is a great and solemn thing to
have a grandfather

I have not purposed to misrepresent this boy in any way for what little
indignation he excited in me soon passed and left nothing behind it but
compassion One cannot keep up a grudge against a vacuum I have tried
to repeat this lads very words if I have failed anywhere I have at
least not failed to reproduce the marrow and meaning of what he said
He and the innocent chatterbox whom I met on the Swiss lake are the most
unique and interesting specimens of Young America I came across
during my foreign tramping I have made honest portraits of them not
caricatures



The Grandson of twentythree referred to himself five or six times as
an old traveler and as many as three times with a serene complacency
which was maddening as a man of the world There was something very
delicious about his leaving Boston to her narrowness unreproved and
uninstructed

I formed the caravan in marching order presently and after riding down
the line to see that it was properly roped together gave the command to
proceed In a little while the road carried us to open grassy land We
were above the troublesome forest now and had an uninterrupted view
straight before us of our summitthe summit of the Riffelberg

We followed the muleroad a zigzag course now to the right now to
the left but always up and always crowded and incommoded by going and
coming files of reckless tourists who were never in a single instance
tied together I was obliged to exert the utmost care and caution for
in many places the road was not two yards wide and often the lower side
of it sloped away in slanting precipices eight and even nine feet deep
I had to encourage the men constantly to keep them from giving way to
their unmanly fears

We might have made the summit before night but for a delay caused by
the loss of an umbrella I was allowing the umbrella to remain lost but
the men murmured and with reason for in this exposed region we stood
in peculiar need of protection against avalanches so I went into camp
and detached a strong party to go after the missing article

The difficulties of the next morning were severe but our courage
was high for our goal was near At noon we conquered the last
impedimentwe stood at last upon the summit and without the loss of a
single man except the mule that ate the glycerin Our great achievement
was achievedthe possibility of the impossible was demonstrated and
Harris and I walked proudly into the great diningroom of the Riffelberg
Hotel and stood our alpenstocks up in the corner

Yes I had made the grand ascent but it was a mistake to do it in
evening dress The plug hats were battered the swallowtails were
fluttering rags mud added no grace the general effect was unpleasant
and even disreputable



There were about seventyfive tourists at the hotelmainly ladies and
little childrenand they gave us an admiring welcome which paid us for
all our privations and sufferings The ascent had been made and the
names and dates now stand recorded on a stone monument there to prove it
to all future tourists

I boiled a thermometer and took an altitude with a most curious result
THE SUMMIT WAS NOT AS HIGH AS THE POINT ON THE MOUNTAINSIDE WHERE I
HAD TAKEN THE FIRST ALTITUDE Suspecting that I had made an important
discovery I prepared to verify it There happened to be a still higher
summit called the Gorner Grat above the hotel and notwithstanding
the fact that it overlooks a glacier from a dizzy height and that the
ascent is difficult and dangerous I resolved to venture up there and
boil a thermometer So I sent a strong party with some borrowed hoes
in charge of two chiefs of service to dig a stairway in the soil all
the way up and this I ascended roped to the guides This breezy height
was the summit properso I accomplished even more than I had originally
purposed to do This foolhardy exploit is recorded on another stone
monument



I boiled my thermometer and sure enough this spot which purported to
be two thousand feet higher than the locality of the hotel turned out
to be nine thousand feet LOWER Thus the fact was clearly demonstrated
that ABOVE A CERTAIN POINT THE HIGHER A POINT SEEMS TO BE THE LOWER
IT ACTUALLY IS Our ascent itself was a great achievement but this
contribution to science was an inconceivably greater matter

Cavilers object that water boils at a lower and lower temperature the
higher and higher you go and hence the apparent anomaly I answer that
I do not base my theory upon what the boiling water does but upon what
a boiled thermometer says You cant go behind the thermometer

I had a magnificent view of Monte Rosa and apparently all the rest of
the Alpine world from that high place All the circling horizon was
piled high with a mighty tumult of snowy crests One might have
imagined he saw before him the tented camps of a beleaguering host of
Brobdingnagians



NOTEI had the very unusual luck to catch one little momentary glimpse
of the Matterhorn wholly unencumbered by clouds I leveled my
photographic apparatus at it without the loss of an instant and should
have got an elegant picture if my donkey had not interfered It was my
purpose to draw this photograph all by myself for my book but was
obliged to put the mountain part of it into the hands of the
professional artist because I found I could not do landscape well

But lonely conspicuous and superb rose that wonderful upright wedge
the Matterhorn Its precipitous sides were powdered over with snow and
the upper half hidden in thick clouds which now and then dissolved to
cobweb films and gave brief glimpses of the imposing tower as through a
veil A little later the Matterhorn took to himself the semblance of
a volcano he was stripped naked to his apexaround this circled
vast wreaths of white cloud which strung slowly out and streamed away
slantwise toward the sun a twentymile stretch of rolling and tumbling
vapor and looking just as if it were pouring out of a crater Later
again one of the mountains sides was clean and clear and another
side densely clothed from base to summit in thick smokelike cloud which
feathered off and flew around the shafts sharp edge like the smoke
around the corners of a burning building The Matterhorn is always
experimenting and always gets up fine effects too In the sunset when
all the lower world is palled in gloom it points toward heaven out of
the pervading blackness like a finger of fire In the sunrisewell
they say it is very fine in the sunrise

Authorities agree that there is no such tremendous layout of snowy
Alpine magnitude grandeur and sublimity to be seen from any other
accessible point as the tourist may see from the summit of the
Riffelberg Therefore let the tourist rope himself up and go there for
I have shown that with nerve caution and judgment the thing can be
done

I wish to add one remark herein parentheses so to speaksuggested
by the word snowy which I have just used We have all seen hills and
mountains and levels with snow on them and so we think we know all the
aspects and effects produced by snow But indeed we do not until we have
seen the Alps Possibly mass and distance add somethingat any rate
something IS added Among other noticeable things there is a dazzling
intense whiteness about the distant Alpine snow when the sun is on it
which one recognizes as peculiar and not familiar to the eye The snow
which one is accustomed to has a tint to itpainters usually give it a
bluish castbut there is no perceptible tint to the distant Alpine snow
when it is trying to look its whitest As to the unimaginable
splendor of it when the sun is blazing down on itwell it simply IS
unimaginable



CHAPTER XXXIX

We Travel by Glacier


A guidebook is a queer thing The reader has just seen what a man who
undertakes the great ascent from Zermatt to the Riffelberg Hotel must
experience Yet Baedeker makes these strange statements concerning this
matter

    Distance hours
    The road cannot be mistaken
    Guide unnecessary
    Distance from Riffelberg Hotel to the Gorner Grat one hour and a half
    Ascent simple and easy Guide unnecessary
    Elevation of Zermatt above sealevel  feet
    Elevation of Riffelberg Hotel above sealevel  feet
    Elevation of the Gorner Grat above sealevel  feet

I have pretty effectually throttled these errors by sending him the
following demonstrated facts

    Distance from Zermatt to Riffelberg Hotel  days
    The road CAN be mistaken If I am the first that did it I want the credit
      of it too
    Guides ARE necessary for none but a native can read those fingerboards
    The estimate of the elevation of the several localities above sealevel
      is pretty correctfor Baedeker He only misses it about a hundred and
      eighty or ninety thousand feet

I found my arnica invaluable My men were suffering excruciatingly from
the friction of sitting down so much During two or three days not
one of them was able to do more than lie down or walk about yet so
effective was the arnica that on the fourth all were able to sit up
I consider that more than to anything else I owe the success of our
great undertaking to arnica and paregoric

My men are being restored to health and strength my main perplexity
now was how to get them down the mountain again I was not willing to
expose the brave fellows to the perils fatigues and hardships of that
fearful route again if it could be helped First I thought of balloons
but of course I had to give that idea up for balloons were
not procurable I thought of several other expedients but upon
consideration discarded them for cause But at last I hit it I was
aware that the movement of glaciers is an established fact for I had
read it in Baedeker so I resolved to take passage for Zermatt on the
great Gorner Glacier

Very good The next thing was how to get down the glacier
comfortablyfor the muleroad to it was long and winding and
wearisome I set my mind at work and soon thought out a plan One looks
straight down upon the vast frozen river called the Gorner Glacier from
the Gorner Grat a sheer precipice twelve hundred feet high We had
one hundred and fiftyfour umbrellasand what is an umbrella but a
parachute

I mentioned this noble idea to Harris with enthusiasm and was about to
order the Expedition to form on the Gorner Grat with their umbrellas
and prepare for flight by platoons each platoon in command of a guide
when Harris stopped me and urged me not to be too hasty He asked me if
this method of descending the Alps had ever been tried before I said
no I had not heard of an instance Then in his opinion it was a
matter of considerable gravity in his opinion it would not be well to
send the whole command over the cliff at once a better way would be to
send down a single individual first and see how he fared

I saw the wisdom in this idea instantly I said as much and thanked
my agent cordially and told him to take his umbrella and try the thing
right away and wave his hat when he got down if he struck in a soft
place and then I would ship the rest right along

Harris was greatly touched with this mark of confidence and said so
in a voice that had a perceptible tremble in it but at the same time he
said he did not feel himself worthy of so conspicuous a favor that it
might cause jealousy in the command for there were plenty who would not
hesitate to say he had used underhanded means to get the appointment
whereas his conscience would bear him witness that he had not sought it
at all nor even in his secret heart desired it

I said these words did him extreme credit but that he must not throw
away the imperishable distinction of being the first man to descend
an Alp per parachute simply to save the feelings of some envious
underlings No I said he MUST accept the appointmentit was no longer
an invitation it was a command

He thanked me with effusion and said that putting the thing in this
form removed every objection He retired and soon returned with his
umbrella his eye flaming with gratitude and his cheeks pallid with joy
Just then the head guide passed along Harriss expression changed to
one of infinite tenderness and he said

That man did me a cruel injury four days ago and I said in my heart
he should live to perceive and confess that the only noble revenge a
man can take upon his enemy is to return good for evil I resign in his
favor Appoint him

I threw my arms around the generous fellow and said

Harris you are the noblest soul that lives You shall not regret this
sublime act neither shall the world fail to know of it You shall have
opportunity far transcending this one too if I liveremember that

I called the head guide to me and appointed him on the spot But the
thing aroused no enthusiasm in him He did not take to the idea at all

He said

Tie myself to an umbrella and jump over the Gorner Grat Excuse me
there are a great many pleasanter roads to the devil than that



Upon a discussion of the subject with him it appeared that he
considered the project distinctly and decidedly dangerous I was not
convinced yet I was not willing to try the experiment in any risky
waythat is in a way that might cripple the strength and efficiency
of the Expedition I was about at my wits end when it occurred to me to
try it on the Latinist

He was called in But he declined on the plea of inexperience
diffidence in public lack of curiosity and I didnt know what all
Another man declined on account of a cold in the head thought he
ought to avoid exposure Another could not jump wellnever COULD jump
welldid not believe he could jump so far without long and patient
practice Another was afraid it was going to rain and his umbrella had
a hole in it Everybody had an excuse The result was what the reader
has by this time guessed the most magnificent idea that was ever
conceived had to be abandoned from sheer lack of a person with
enterprise enough to carry it out Yes I actually had to give that
thing upwhile doubtless I should live to see somebody use it and take
all the credit from me

Well I had to go overlandthere was no other way I marched the
Expedition down the steep and tedious mulepath and took up as good a
position as I could upon the middle of the glacierbecause Baedeker
said the middle part travels the fastest As a measure of economy
however I put some of the heavier baggage on the shoreward parts to go
as slow freight

I waited and waited but the glacier did not move Night was coming on
the darkness began to gatherstill we did not budge It occurred to me
then that there might be a timetable in Baedeker it would be well to
find out the hours of starting I called for the bookit could not be
found Bradshaw would certainly contain a timetable but no Bradshaw
could be found

Very well I must make the best of the situation So I pitched the
tents picketed the animals milked the cows had supper paregoricked
the men established the watch and went to bedwith orders to call me
as soon as we came in sight of Zermatt

I awoke about half past ten next morning and looked around We hadnt
budged a peg At first I could not understand it then it occurred to me
that the old thing must be aground So I cut down some trees and rigged
a spar on the starboard and another on the port side and fooled away
upward of three hours trying to spar her off But it was no use She
was half a mile wide and fifteen or twenty miles long and there was
no telling just whereabouts she WAS aground The men began to show
uneasiness too and presently they came flying to me with ashy faces
saying she had sprung a leak



Nothing but my cool behavior at this critical time saved us from another
panic I ordered them to show me the place They led me to a spot where
a huge boulder lay in a deep pool of clear and brilliant water It did
look like a pretty bad leak but I kept that to myself I made a pump
and set the men to work to pump out the glacier We made a success of
it I perceived then that it was not a leak at all This boulder had
descended from a precipice and stopped on the ice in the middle of the
glacier and the sun had warmed it up every day and consequently it
had melted its way deeper and deeper into the ice until at last it
reposed as we had found it in a deep pool of the clearest and coldest
water

Presently Baedeker was found again and I hunted eagerly for the
timetable There was none The book simply said the glacier was moving
all the time This was satisfactory so I shut up the book and chose a
good position to view the scenery as we passed along I stood there some
time enjoying the trip but at last it occurred to me that we did
not seem to be gaining any on the scenery I said to myself This
confounded old things aground again sureand opened Baedeker to
see if I could run across any remedy for these annoying interruptions
I soon found a sentence which threw a dazzling light upon the matter
It said The Gorner Glacier travels at an average rate of a little less
than an inch a day I have seldom felt so outraged I have seldom had
my confidence so wantonly betrayed I made a small calculation One inch
a day say thirty feet a year estimated distance to Zermatt three and
oneeighteenth miles Time required to go by glacier A LITTLE OVER FIVE
HUNDRED YEARS I said to myself I can WALK it quickerand before I
will patronize such a fraud as this I will do it

When I revealed to Harris the fact that the passenger part of this
glacierthe central partthe lightningexpress part so to speakwas
not due in Zermatt till the summer of  and that the baggage coming
along the slow edge would not arrive until some generations later he
burst out with

That is European management all over An inch a daythink of that
Five hundred years to go a trifle over three miles But I am not a bit
surprised Its a Catholic glacier You can tell by the look of it And
the management

I said no I believed nothing but the extreme end of it was in a
Catholic canton

Well then its a government glacier said Harris Its all the
same Over here the government runs everythingso everythings slow
slow and illmanaged But with us everythings done by private
enterpriseand then there aint much lolling around you can depend
on it I wish Tom Scott could get his hands on this torpid old slab
onceyoud see it take a different gait from this

I said I was sure he would increase the speed if there was trade enough
to justify it

Hed MAKE trade said Harris Thats the difference between
governments and individuals Governments dont care individuals do Tom
Scott would take all the trade in two years Gorner stock would go to
two hundred and inside of two more you would see all the other glaciers
under the hammer for taxes After a reflective pause Harris added A
little less than an inch a day a little less than an INCH mind you
Well Im losing my reverence for glaciers

I was feeling much the same way myself I have traveled by canalboat
oxwagon raft and by the Ephesus and Smyrna railway but when it comes
down to good solid honest slow motion I bet my money on the glacier As
a means of passenger transportation I consider the glacier a failure
but as a vehicle of slow freight I think she fills the bill In the
matter of putting the fine shades on that line of business I judge she
could teach the Germans something

I ordered the men to break camp and prepare for the land journey to
Zermatt At this moment a most interesting find was made a dark object
bedded in the glacial ice was cut out with the iceaxes and it proved
to be a piece of the undressed skin of some animala hair trunk
perhaps but a close inspection disabled the hairtrunk theory and
further discussion and examination exploded it entirelythat is in the
opinion of all the scientists except the one who had advanced it This
one clung to his theory with affectionate fidelity characteristic of
originators of scientific theories and afterward won many of the first
scientists of the age to his view by a very able pamphlet which he
wrote entitled Evidences going to show that the hair trunk in a wild
state belonged to the early glacial period and roamed the wastes of
chaos in the company with the cavebear primeval man and the other
Ooelitics of the Old Silurian family



Each of our scientists had a theory of his own and put forward
an animal of his own as a candidate for the skin I sided with the
geologist of the Expedition in the belief that this patch of skin had
once helped to cover a Siberian elephant in some old forgotten agebut
we divided there the geologist believing that this discovery proved
that Siberia had formerly been located where Switzerland is now whereas
I held the opinion that it merely proved that the primeval Swiss was not
the dull savage he is represented to have been but was a being of high
intellectual development who liked to go to the menagerie

We arrived that evening after many hardships and adventures in some
fields close to the great icearch where the mad Visp boils and surges
out from under the foot of the great Gorner Glacier and here we camped
our perils over and our magnificent undertaking successfully completed
We marched into Zermatt the next day and were received with the
most lavish honors and applause A document signed and sealed by the
authorities was given to me which established and endorsed the fact
that I had made the ascent of the Riffelberg This I wear around my
neck and it will be buried with me when I am no more



CHAPTER XL

Piteous Relics at Chamonix


I am not so ignorant about glacial movement now as I was when I took
passage on the Gorner Glacier I have read up since I am aware that
these vast bodies of ice do not travel at the same rate of speed while
the Gorner Glacier makes less than an inch a day the UnterAar Glacier
makes as much as eight and still other glaciers are said to go twelve
sixteen and even twenty inches a day One writer says that the slowest
glacier travels twentyfive feet a year and the fastest four hundred

What is a glacier It is easy to say it looks like a frozen river which
occupies the bed of a winding gorge or gully between mountains But that
gives no notion of its vastness For it is sometimes six hundred feet
thick and we are not accustomed to rivers six hundred feet deep no
our rivers are six feet twenty feet and sometimes fifty feet deep we
are not quite able to grasp so large a fact as an iceriver six hundred
feet deep

The glaciers surface is not smooth and level but has deep swales and
swelling elevations and sometimes has the look of a tossing sea whose
turbulent billows were frozen hard in the instant of their most violent
motion the glaciers surface is not a flawless mass but is a river
with cracks or crevices some narrow some gaping wide Many a man the
victim of a slip or a misstep has plunged down one of these and met his
death Men have been fished out of them alive but it was when they
did not go to a great depth the cold of the great depths would quickly
stupefy a man whether he was hurt or unhurt These cracks do not go
straight down one can seldom see more than twenty to forty feet down
them consequently men who have disappeared in them have been sought
for in the hope that they had stopped within helping distance whereas
their case in most instances had really been hopeless from the
beginning

In  a party of tourists was descending Mont Blanc and while picking
their way over one of the mighty glaciers of that lofty region roped
together as was proper a young porter disengaged himself from the line
and started across an icebridge which spanned a crevice It broke under
him with a crash and he disappeared The others could not see how deep
he had gone so it might be worthwhile to try and rescue him A brave
young guide named Michel Payot volunteered

Two ropes were made fast to his leather belt and he bore the end of a
third one in his hand to tie to the victim in case he found him He was
lowered into the crevice he descended deeper and deeper between the
clear blue walls of solid ice he approached a bend in the crack and
disappeared under it Down and still down he went into this profound
grave when he had reached a depth of eighty feet he passed under
another bend in the crack and thence descended eighty feet lower as
between perpendicular precipices Arrived at this stage of one hundred
and sixty feet below the surface of the glacier he peered through the
twilight dimness and perceived that the chasm took another turn and
stretched away at a steep slant to unknown deeps for its course was
lost in darkness What a place that was to be inespecially if that
leather belt should break The compression of the belt threatened to
suffocate the intrepid fellow he called to his friends to draw him up
but could not make them hear They still lowered him deeper and deeper
Then he jerked his third cord as vigorously as he could his friends
understood and dragged him out of those icy jaws of death

Then they attached a bottle to a cord and sent it down two hundred feet
but it found no bottom It came up covered with congelationsevidence
enough that even if the poor porter reached the bottom with unbroken
bones a swift death from cold was sure anyway

A glacier is a stupendous everprogressing resistless plow It pushes
ahead of it masses of boulders which are packed together and they
stretch across the gorge right in front of it like a long grave or a
long sharp roof This is called a moraine It also shoves out a moraine
along each side of its course



Imposing as the modern glaciers are they are not so huge as were some
that once existed For instance Mr Whymper says

At some very remote period the Valley of Aosta was occupied by a vast
glacier which flowed down its entire length from Mont Blanc to the
plain of Piedmont remained stationary or nearly so at its mouth
for many centuries and deposited there enormous masses of debris The
length of this glacier exceeded EIGHTY MILES and it drained a basin
twentyfive to thirtyfive miles across bounded by the highest
mountains in the Alps



The great peaks rose several thousand feet above the glaciers and
then as now shattered by sun and frost poured down their showers of
rocks and stones in witness of which there are the immense piles of
angular fragments that constitute the moraines of Ivrea

The moraines around Ivrea are of extraordinary dimensions That which
was on the left bank of the glacier is about THIRTEEN MILES long and
in some places rises to a height of TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY
FEET above the floor of the valley The terminal moraines those which
are pushed in front of the glaciers cover something like twenty square
miles of country At the mouth of the Valley of Aosta the thickness of
the glacier must have been at least TWO THOUSAND feet and its width at
that part FIVE MILES AND A QUARTER



It is not easy to get at a comprehension of a mass of ice like that If
one could cleave off the butt end of such a glacieran oblong block
two or three miles wide by five and a quarter long and two thousand
feet thickhe could completely hide the city of New York under it
and Trinity steeple would only stick up into it relatively as far as a
shinglenail would stick up into the bottom of a Saratoga trunk

The boulders from Mont Blanc upon the plain below Ivrea assure us
that the glacier which transported them existed for a prodigious length
of time Their present distance from the cliffs from which they were
derived is about  feet and if we assume that they traveled at
the rate of  feet per annum their journey must have occupied them no
less than  years In all probability they did not travel so fast



Glaciers are sometimes hurried out of their characteristic snailpace
A marvelous spectacle is presented then Mr Whymper refers to a case
which occurred in Iceland in 

It seems that in the neighborhood of the mountain Kotlugja large
bodies of water formed underneath or within the glaciers either on
account of the interior heat of the earth or from other causes and at
length acquired irresistible power tore the glaciers from their mooring
on the land and swept them over every obstacle into the sea Prodigious
masses of ice were thus borne for a distance of about ten miles over
land in the space of a few hours and their bulk was so enormous that
they covered the sea for seven miles from the shore and remained
aground in six hundred feet of water The denudation of the land was
upon a grand scale All superficial accumulations were swept away and
the bedrock was exposed It was described in graphic language how all
irregularities and depressions were obliterated and a smooth surface of
several miles area laid bare and that this area had the appearance of
having been PLANED BY A PLANE

The account translated from the Icelandic says that the mountainlike
ruins of this majestic glacier so covered the sea that as far as the eye
could reach no open water was discoverable even from the highest peaks
A monster wall or barrier of ice was built across a considerable stretch
of land too by this strange irruption

One can form some idea of the altitude of this barrier of ice when it
is mentioned that from Hofdabrekka farm which lies high up on a fjeld
one could not see Hjorleifshofdi opposite which is a fell six hundred
and forty feet in height but in order to do so had to clamber up a
mountain slope east of Hofdabrekka twelve hundred feet high

These things will help the reader to understand why it is that a man who
keeps company with glaciers comes to feel tolerably insignificant by
and by The Alps and the glaciers together are able to take every bit of
conceit out of a man and reduce his selfimportance to zero if he will
only remain within the influence of their sublime presence long enough
to give it a fair and reasonable chance to do its work

The Alpine glaciers movethat is granted now by everybody But there
was a time when people scoffed at the idea they said you might as well
expect leagues of solid rock to crawl along the ground as expect leagues
of ice to do it But proof after proof was furnished and the finally
the world had to believe

The wise men not only said the glacier moved but they timed its
movement They ciphered out a glaciers gait and then said confidently
that it would travel just so far in so many years There is record of
a striking and curious example of the accuracy which may be attained in
these reckonings

In  the ascent of Mont Blanc was attempted by a Russian and two
Englishmen with seven guides They had reached a prodigious altitude
and were approaching the summit when an avalanche swept several of the
party down a sharp slope of two hundred feet and hurled five of them
all guides into one of the crevices of a glacier The life of one
of the five was saved by a long barometer which was strapped to his
backit bridged the crevice and suspended him until help came The
alpenstock or baton of another saved its owner in a similar way Three
men were lostPierre Balmat Pierre Carrier and Auguste Tairraz They
had been hurled down into the fathomless great deeps of the crevice

Dr Forbes the English geologist had made frequent visits to the Mont
Blanc region and had given much attention to the disputed question of
the movement of glaciers During one of these visits he completed his
estimates of the rate of movement of the glacier which had swallowed
up the three guides and uttered the prediction that the glacier would
deliver up its dead at the foot of the mountain thirtyfive years from
the time of the accident or possibly forty

A dull slow journeya movement imperceptible to any eyebut it was
proceeding nevertheless and without cessation It was a journey
which a rolling stone would make in a few secondsthe lofty point of
departure was visible from the village below in the valley

The prediction cut curiously close to the truth fortyone years after
the catastrophe the remains were cast forth at the foot of the glacier

I find an interesting account of the matter in the HISTOIRE DU MONT
BLANC by Stephen dArve I will condense this account as follows

On the th of August  at the hour of the close of mass a guide
arrived out of breath at the mairie of Chamonix and bearing on his
shoulders a very lugubrious burden It was a sack filled with human
remains which he had gathered from the orifice of a crevice in the
Glacier des Bossons He conjectured that these were remains of the
victims of the catastrophe of  and a minute inquest immediately
instituted by the local authorities soon demonstrated the correctness
of his supposition The contents of the sack were spread upon a long
table and officially inventoried as follows

Portions of three human skulls Several tufts of black and blonde hair
A human jaw furnished with fine white teeth A forearm and hand all
the fingers of the latter intact The flesh was white and fresh
and both the arm and hand preserved a degree of flexibility in the
articulations

The ringfinger had suffered a slight abrasion and the stain of the
blood was still visible and unchanged after fortyone years A left
foot the flesh white and fresh

Along with these fragments were portions of waistcoats hats hobnailed
shoes and other clothing a wing of a pigeon with black feathers a
fragment of an alpenstock a tin lantern and lastly a boiled leg of
mutton the only flesh among all the remains that exhaled an unpleasant
odor The guide said that the mutton had no odor when he took it from
the glacier an hours exposure to the sun had already begun the work of
decomposition upon it

Persons were called for to identify these poor pathetic relics and a
touching scene ensued Two men were still living who had witnessed the
grim catastrophe of nearly half a century beforeMarie Couttet saved
by his baton and Julien Davouassoux saved by the barometer These
aged men entered and approached the table Davouassoux more than eighty
years old contemplated the mournful remains mutely and with a vacant
eye for his intelligence and his memory were torpid with age but
Couttets faculties were still perfect at seventytwo and he exhibited
strong emotion He said

Pierre Balmat was fair he wore a straw hat This bit of skull with
the tuft of blond hair was his this is his hat Pierre Carrier was
very dark this skull was his and this felt hat This is Balmats
hand I remember it so well and the old man bent down and kissed it
reverently then closed his fingers upon it in an affectionate grasp
crying out I could never have dared to believe that before quitting
this world it would be granted me to press once more the hand of one of
those brave comrades the hand of my good friend Balmat



There is something weirdly pathetic about the picture of that
whitehaired veteran greeting with his loving handshake this friend
who had been dead forty years When these hands had met last they were
alike in the softness and freshness of youth now one was brown and
wrinkled and horny with age while the other was still as young and fair
and blemishless as if those forty years had come and gone in a single
moment leaving no mark of their passage Time had gone on in the one
case it had stood still in the other A man who has not seen a friend
for a generation keeps him in mind always as he saw him last and is
somehow surprised and is also shocked to see the aging change the
years have wrought when he sees him again Marie Couttets experience
in finding his friends hand unaltered from the image of it which he
had carried in his memory for forty years is an experience which stands
alone in the history of man perhaps

Couttet identified other relics

This hat belonged to Auguste Tairraz He carried the cage of pigeons
which we proposed to set free upon the summit Here is the wing of one
of those pigeons And here is the fragment of my broken baton it was by
grace of that baton that my life was saved Who could have told me that
I should one day have the satisfaction to look again upon this bit of
wood that supported me above the grave that swallowed up my unfortunate
companions

No portions of the body of Tairraz other than a piece of the skull
had been found A diligent search was made but without result However
another search was instituted a year later and this had better success
Many fragments of clothing which had belonged to the lost guides were
discovered also part of a lantern and a green veil with bloodstains
on it But the interesting feature was this

One of the searchers came suddenly upon a sleeved arm projecting from
a crevice in the icewall with the hand outstretched as if offering
greeting The nails of this white hand were still rosy and the pose
of the extended fingers seemed to express an eloquent welcome to the
longlost light of day

The hand and arm were alone there was no trunk After being removed
from the ice the fleshtints quickly faded out and the rosy nails took
on the alabaster hue of death This was the third RIGHT hand found
therefore all three of the lost men were accounted for beyond cavil or
question

Dr Hamel was the Russian gentleman of the party which made the ascent
at the time of the famous disaster He left Chamonix as soon as he
conveniently could after the descent and as he had shown a chilly
indifference about the calamity and offered neither sympathy nor
assistance to the widows and orphans he carried with him the cordial
execrations of the whole community Four months before the first remains
were found a Chamonix guide named Balmata relative of one of the lost
menwas in London and one day encountered a hale old gentleman in the
British Museum who said

I overheard your name Are you from Chamonix Monsieur Balmat

Yes sir

Havent they found the bodies of my three guides yet I am Dr Hamel

Alas no monsieur

Well youll find them sooner or later

Yes it is the opinion of Dr Forbes and Mr Tyndall that the glacier
will sooner or later restore to us the remains of the unfortunate
victims

Without a doubt without a doubt And it will be a great thing for
Chamonix in the matter of attracting tourists You can get up a museum
with those remains that will draw

This savage idea has not improved the odor of Dr Hamels name in
Chamonix by any means But after all the man was sound on human nature
His idea was conveyed to the public officials of Chamonix and they
gravely discussed it around the official counciltable They were only
prevented from carrying it into execution by the determined opposition
of the friends and descendants of the lost guides who insisted on
giving the remains Christian burial and succeeded in their purpose

A close watch had to be kept upon all the poor remnants and fragments
to prevent embezzlement A few accessory odds and ends were sold Rags
and scraps of the coarse clothing were parted with at the rate equal to
about twenty dollars a yard a piece of a lantern and one or two other
trifles brought nearly their weight in gold and an Englishman offered a
pound sterling for a single breechesbutton



CHAPTER XLI

The Fearful Disaster of 


One of the most memorable of all the Alpine catastrophes was that of
July  on the Matterhornalready slightly referred to a few
pages back The details of it are scarcely known in America To the vast
majority of readers they are not known at all Mr Whympers account is
the only authentic one I will import the chief portion of it into this
book partly because of its intrinsic interest and partly because it
gives such a vivid idea of what the perilous pastime of Alpclimbing
is This was Mr Whympers NINTH attempt during a series of years to
vanquish that steep and stubborn pillar or rock it succeeded the other
eight were failures No man had ever accomplished the ascent before
though the attempts had been numerous

MR WHYMPERS NARRATIVE We started from Zermatt on the th of July at
half past five on a brilliant and perfectly cloudless morning We were
eight in numberCroz guide old Peter Taugwalder guide and his
two sons Lord F Douglas Mr Hadow Rev Mr Hudson and I To insure
steady motion one tourist and one native walked together The youngest
Taugwalder fell to my share The winebags also fell to my lot to carry
and throughout the day after each drink I replenished them secretly
with water so that at the next halt they were found fuller than before
This was considered a good omen and little short of miraculous

On the first day we did not intend to ascend to any great height and we
mounted accordingly very leisurely Before twelve oclock we had found
a good position for the tent at a height of eleven thousand feet We
passed the remaining hours of daylightsome basking in the sunshine
some sketching some collecting Hudson made tea I coffee and at
length we retired each one to his blanket bag

We assembled together before dawn on the th and started directly
it was light enough to move One of the young Taugwalders returned to
Zermatt In a few minutes we turned the rib which had intercepted the
view of the eastern face from our tent platform The whole of this
great slope was now revealed rising for three thousand feet like a huge
natural staircase Some parts were more and others were less easy but
we were not once brought to a halt by any serious impediment for when
an obstruction was met in front it could always be turned to the right
or to the left For the greater part of the way there was no occasion
indeed for the rope and sometimes Hudson led sometimes myself At
sixtwenty we had attained a height of twelve thousand eight hundred
feet and halted for half an hour we then continued the ascent without
a break until ninefiftyfive when we stopped for fifty minutes at a
height of fourteen thousand feet



We had now arrived at the foot of that part which seen from the
Riffelberg seems perpendicular or overhanging We could no longer
continue on the eastern side For a little distance we ascended by snow
upon the ARTEthat is the ridgethen turned over to the right or
northern side The work became difficult and required caution In some
places there was little to hold the general slope of the mountain was
LESS than forty degrees and snow had accumulated in and had filled
up the interstices of the rockface leaving only occasional fragments
projecting here and there These were at times covered with a thin film
of ice It was a place which any fair mountaineer might pass in safety
We bore away nearly horizontally for about four hundred feet then
ascended directly toward the summit for about sixty feet then doubled
back to the ridge which descends toward Zermatt A long stride round
a rather awkward corner brought us to snow once more That last doubt
vanished The Matterhorn was ours Nothing but two hundred feet of easy
snow remained to be surmounted

The higher we rose the more intense became the excitement The slope
eased off at length we could be detached and Croz and I dashed away
ran a neckandneck race which ended in a dead heat At  PM the
world was at our feet and the Matterhorn was conquered



The others arrived Croz now took the tentpole and planted it in the
highest snow Yes we said there is the flagstaff but where is the
flag Here it is he answered pulling off his blouse and fixing it
to the stick It made a poor flag and there was no wind to float
it out yet it was seen all around They saw it at Zermattat the
Riffelin the Val Tournanche 

We remained on the summit for one hour

One crowded hour of glorious life

It passed away too quickly and we began to prepare for the descent

Hudson and I consulted as to the best and safest arrangement of the
party We agreed that it was best for Croz to go first and Hadow
second Hudson who was almost equal to a guide in sureness of foot
wished to be third Lord Douglas was placed next and old Peter the
strongest of the remainder after him I suggested to Hudson that we
should attach a rope to the rocks on our arrival at the difficult bit
and hold it as we descended as an additional protection He approved
the idea but it was not definitely decided that it should be done The
party was being arranged in the above order while I was sketching the
summit and they had finished and were waiting for me to be tied in
line when some one remembered that our names had not been left in a
bottle They requested me to write them down and moved off while it was
being done

A few minutes afterward I tied myself to young Peter ran down after the
others and caught them just as they were commencing the descent of the
difficult part Great care was being taken Only one man was moving at a
time when he was firmly planted the next advanced and so on They had
not however attached the additional rope to rocks and nothing was
said about it The suggestion was not made for my own sake and I am not
sure that it ever occurred to me again For some little distance we two
followed the others detached from them and should have continued so
had not Lord Douglas asked me about  PM to tie on to old Peter as
he feared he said that Taugwalder would not be able to hold his ground
if a slip occurred

A few minutes later a sharpeyed lad ran into the Monte Rosa Hotel at
Zermatt saying that he had seen an avalanche fall from the summit of
the Matterhorn onto the Matterhorn glacier The boy was reproved for
telling idle stories he was right nevertheless and this was what he
saw

Michel Croz had laid aside his ax and in order to give Mr Hadow
greater security was absolutely taking hold of his legs and putting
his feet one by one into their proper positions As far as I know no
one was actually descending I cannot speak with certainty because the
two leading men were partially hidden from my sight by an intervening
mass of rock but it is my belief from the movements of their
shoulders that Croz having done as I said was in the act of turning
round to go down a step or two himself at this moment Mr Hadow
slipped fell against him and knocked him over I heard one startled
exclamation from Croz then saw him and Mr Hadow flying downward
in another moment Hudson was dragged from his steps and Lord Douglas
immediately after him All this was the work of a moment Immediately we
heard Crozs exclamation old Peter and I planted ourselves as firmly as
the rocks would permit the rope was taut between us and the jerk came
on us both as on one man We held but the rope broke midway between
Taugwalder and Lord Francis Douglas For a few seconds we saw our
unfortunate companions sliding downward on their backs and spreading
out their hands endeavoring to save themselves They passed from our
sight uninjured disappeared one by one and fell from the precipice to
precipice onto the Matterhorn glacier below a distance of nearly
four thousand feet in height From the moment the rope broke it was
impossible to help them So perished our comrades



For more than two hours afterward I thought almost every moment that the
next would be my last for the Taugwalders utterly unnerved were not
only incapable of giving assistance but were in such a state that a
slip might have been expected from them at any moment After a time we
were able to do that which should have been done at first and fixed
rope to firm rocks in addition to being tied together These ropes were
cut from time to time and were left behind Even with their assurance
the men were afraid to proceed and several times old Peter turned
with ashy face and faltering limbs and said with terrible emphasis I
CANNOT

About  PM we arrived at the snow upon the ridge descending toward
Zermatt and all peril was over We frequently looked but in vain for
traces of our unfortunate companions we bent over the ridge and cried
to them but no sound returned Convinced at last that they were neither
within sight nor hearing we ceased from our useless efforts and too
cast down for speech silently gathered up our things and the little
effects of those who were lost and then completed the descent Such
is Mr Whympers graphic and thrilling narrative Zermatt gossip
darkly hints that the elder Taugwalder cut the rope when the accident
occurred in order to preserve himself from being dragged into the
abyss but Mr Whymper says that the ends of the rope showed no evidence
of cutting but only of breaking He adds that if Taugwalder had had the
disposition to cut the rope he would not have had time to do it the
accident was so sudden and unexpected

Lord Douglas body has never been found It probably lodged upon some
inaccessible shelf in the face of the mighty precipice Lord Douglas was
a youth of nineteen The three other victims fell nearly four thousand
feet and their bodies lay together upon the glacier when found by
Mr Whymper and the other searchers the next morning Their graves are
beside the little church in Zermatt



CHAPTER XLII

Chillon has a Nice Roomy Dungeon


Switzerland is simply a large humpy solid rock with a thin skin of
grass stretched over it Consequently they do not dig graves they
blast them out with powder and fuse They cannot afford to have large
graveyards the grass skin is too circumscribed and too valuable It is
all required for the support of the living

The graveyard in Zermatt occupies only about oneeighth of an acre
The graves are sunk in the living rock and are very permanent but
occupation of them is only temporary the occupant can only stay till
his grave is needed by a later subject he is removed then for they do
not bury one body on top of another As I understand it a family owns
a grave just as it owns a house A man dies and leaves his house to his
sonand at the same time this dead father succeeds to his own fathers
grave He moves out of the house and into the grave and his predecessor
moves out of the grave and into the cellar of the chapel I saw a black
box lying in the churchyard with skull and crossbones painted on it
and was told that this was used in transferring remains to the cellar

In that cellar the bones and skulls of several hundred of former
citizens were compactly corded up They made a pile eighteen feet long
seven feet high and eight feet wide I was told that in some of the
receptacles of this kind in the Swiss villages the skulls were all
marked and if a man wished to find the skulls of his ancestors for
several generations back he could do it by these marks preserved in
the family records



An English gentleman who had lived some years in this region said it
was the cradle of compulsory education But he said that the English
idea that compulsory education would reduce bastardy and intemperance
was an errorit has not that effect He said there was more seduction
in the Protestant than in the Catholic cantons because the confessional
protected the girls I wonder why it doesnt protect married women in
France and Spain

This gentleman said that among the poorer peasants in the Valais it was
common for the brothers in a family to cast lots to determine which
of them should have the coveted privilege of marrying and his
brethrendoomed bachelorsheroically banded themselves together to
help support the new family

We left Zermatt in a wagonand in a rainstorm toofor St Nicholas
about ten oclock one morning Again we passed between those grassclad
prodigious cliffs specked with wee dwellings peeping over at us from
velvety green walls ten and twelve hundred feet high It did not seem
possible that the imaginary chamois even could climb those precipices
Lovers on opposite cliffs probably kiss through a spyglass and
correspond with a rifle

In Switzerland the farmers plow is a wide shovel which scrapes up and
turns over the thin earthy skin of his native rockand there the man of
the plow is a hero Now here by our St Nicholas road was a grave and
it had a tragic story A plowman was skinning his farm one morningnot
the steepest part of it but still a steep partthat is he was not
skinning the front of his farm but the roof of it near the eaveswhen
he absentmindedly let go of the plowhandles to moisten his hands in
the usual way he lost his balance and fell out of his farm backward
poor fellow he never touched anything till he struck bottom fifteen
hundred feet below This was on a SundayMT We throw a halo of
heroism around the life of the soldier and the sailor because of the
deadly dangers they are facing all the time But we are not used to
looking upon farming as a heroic occupation This is because we have not
lived in Switzerland



From St Nicholas we struck out for Vispor Vispachon foot The
rainstorms had been at work during several days and had done a deal of
damage in Switzerland and Savoy We came to one place where a stream had
changed its course and plunged down a mountain in a new place sweeping
everything before it Two poor but precious farms by the roadside were
ruined One was washed clear away and the bedrock exposed the other
was buried out of sight under a tumbled chaos of rocks gravel mud
and rubbish The resistless might of water was well exemplified Some
saplings which had stood in the way were bent to the ground stripped
clean of their bark and buried under rocky debris The road had been
swept away too

In another place where the road was high up on the mountains face and
its outside edge protected by flimsy masonry we frequently came across
spots where this masonry had carved off and left dangerous gaps for
mules to get over and with still more frequency we found the masonry
slightly crumbled and marked by mulehoofs thus showing that there had
been danger of an accident to somebody When at last we came to a
badly ruptured bit of masonry with hoofprints evidencing a desperate
struggle to regain the lost foothold I looked quite hopefully over the
dizzy precipice But there was nobody down there

They take exceedingly good care of their rivers in Switzerland and other
portions of Europe They wall up both banks with slanting solid stone
masonryso that from end to end of these rivers the banks look like the
wharves at St Louis and other towns on the Mississippi River

It was during this walk from St Nicholas in the shadow of the majestic
Alps that we came across some little children amusing themselves in
what seemed at first a most odd and original waybut it wasnt it
was in simply a natural and characteristic way They were roped together
with a string they had mimic alpenstocks and iceaxes and were
climbing a meek and lowly manurepile with a most bloodcurdling amount
of care and caution The guide at the head of the line cut imaginary
steps in a laborious and painstaking way and not a monkey budged till
the step above was vacated If we had waited we should have witnessed an
imaginary accident no doubt and we should have heard the intrepid band
hurrah when they made the summit and looked around upon the magnificent
view and seen them throw themselves down in exhausted attitudes for a
rest in that commanding situation



In Nevada I used to see the children play at silvermining Of course
the great thing was an accident in a mine and there were two star
parts that of the man who fell down the mimic shaft and that of the
daring hero who was lowered into the depths to bring him up I knew one
small chap who always insisted on playing BOTH of these partsand he
carried his point He would tumble into the shaft and die and then come
to the surface and go back after his own remains

It is the smartest boy that gets the hero part everywhere he is head
guide in Switzerland head miner in Nevada head bullfighter in Spain
etc but I knew a preachers son seven years old who once selected
a part for himself compared to which those just mentioned are tame
and unimpressive Jimmys father stopped him from driving imaginary
horsecars one Sundaystopped him from playing captain of an imaginary
steamboat next Sundaystopped him from leading an imaginary army to
battle the following Sundayand so on Finally the little fellow said

Ive tried everything and they wont any of them do What CAN I play

I hardly know Jimmy but you MUST play only things that are suitable
to the Sabbathday

Next Sunday the preacher stepped softly to a backroom door to see if
the children were rightly employed He peeped in A chair occupied the
middle of the room and on the back of it hung Jimmys cap one of
his little sisters took the cap down nibbled at it then passed it to
another small sister and said Eat of this fruit for it is good The
Reverend took in the situationalas they were playing the Expulsion
from Eden Yet he found one little crumb of comfort He said to himself
For once Jimmy has yielded the chief roleI have been wronging him I
did not believe there was so much modesty in him I should have expected
him to be either Adam or Eve This crumb of comfort lasted but a very
little while he glanced around and discovered Jimmy standing in an
imposing attitude in a corner with a dark and deadly frown on his face
What that meant was very plainHE WAS IMPERSONATING THE DEITY Think of
the guileless sublimity of that idea



We reached Vispach at  PM only about seven hours out from St
Nicholas So we must have made fully a mile and a half an hour and it
was all downhill too and very muddy at that We stayed all night at
the Hotel de Soleil I remember it because the landlady the portier
the waitress and the chambermaid were not separate persons but were
all contained in one neat and chipper suit of spotless muslin and she
was the prettiest young creature I saw in all that region She was the
landlords daughter And I remember that the only native match to her
I saw in all Europe was the young daughter of the landlord of a village
inn in the Black Forest Why dont more people in Europe marry and keep
hotel



Next morning we left with a family of English friends and went by train
to Brevet and thence by boat across the lake to Ouchy Lausanne

Ouchy is memorable to me not on account of its beautiful situation and
lovely surroundingsalthough these would make it stick long in ones
memorybut as the place where I caught the London TIMES dropping into
humor It was NOT aware of it though It did not do it on purpose
An English friend called my attention to this lapse and cut out the
reprehensible paragraph for me Think of encountering a grin like this
on the face of that grim journal

ERRATUMWe are requested by Reuters Telegram Company to correct an
erroneous announcement made in their Brisbane telegram of the d inst
published in our impression of the th inst stating that Lady Kennedy
had given birth to twins the eldest being a son The Company explain
that the message they received contained the words Governor of
Queensland TWINS FIRST SON Being however subsequently informed that
Sir Arthur Kennedy was unmarried and that there must be some mistake a
telegraphic repetition was at once demanded It has been received today
th inst and shows that the words really telegraphed by Reuters
agent were Governor Queensland TURNS FIRST SOD alluding to the
MaryboroughGympic Railway in course of construction The words in
italics were mutilated by the telegraph in transmission from Australia
and reaching the company in the form mentioned above gave rise to the
mistake

I had always had a deep and reverent compassion for the sufferings of
the prisoner of Chillon whose story Byron had told in such moving
verse so I took the steamer and made pilgrimage to the dungeons of the
Castle of Chillon to see the place where poor Bonnivard endured his
dreary captivity three hundred years ago I am glad I did that for it
took away some of the pain I was feeling on the prisoners account His
dungeon was a nice cool roomy place and I cannot see why he should
have been dissatisfied with it If he had been imprisoned in a St
Nicholas private dwelling where the fertilizer prevails and the goat
sleeps with the guest and the chickens roost on him and the cow comes
in and bothers him when he wants to muse it would have been another
matter altogether but he surely could not have had a very cheerless
time of it in that pretty dungeon It has romantic windowslits that
let in generous bars of light and it has tall noble columns carved
apparently from the living rock and what is more they are written
all over with thousands of names some of themlike Byrons and Victor
Hugosof the first celebrity Why didnt he amuse himself reading
these names Then there are the couriers and touristsswarms of them
every daywhat was to hinder him from having a good time with them I
think Bonnivards sufferings have been overrated



Next we took the train and went to Martigny on the way to Mont Blanc
Next morning we started about eight oclock on foot We had plenty of
company in the way of wagonloads and muleloads of touristsand dust
This scattering procession of travelers was perhaps a mile long The
road was uphillinterminable uphilland tolerably steep The weather
was blisteringly hot and the man or woman who had to sit on a creeping
mule or in a crawling wagon and broil in the beating sun was an
object to be pitied We could dodge among the bushes and have the
relief of shade but those people could not They paid for a conveyance
and to get their moneys worth they rode

We went by the way of the Tte Noir and after we reached high ground
there was no lack of fine scenery In one place the road was tunneled
through a shoulder of the mountain from there one looked down into a
gorge with a rushing torrent in it and on every hand was a charming
view of rocky buttresses and wooded heights There was a liberal
allowance of pretty waterfalls too on the Tte Noir route



About half an hour before we reached the village of Argentire a vast
dome of snow with the sun blazing on it drifted into view and framed
itself in a strong Vshaped gateway of the mountains and we recognized
Mont Blanc the monarch of the Alps With every step after that
this stately dome rose higher and higher into the blue sky and at last
seemed to occupy the zenith

Some of Mont Blancs neighborsbare lightbrown steeplelike
rockswere very peculiarly shaped Some were whittled to a sharp point
and slightly bent at the upper end like a ladys finger one monster
sugarloaf resembled a bishops hat it was too steep to hold snow on
its sides but had some in the division



While we were still on very high ground and before the descent toward
Argentire began we looked up toward a neighboring mountaintop and
saw exquisite prismatic colors playing about some white clouds which
were so delicate as to almost resemble gossamer webs The faint pinks
and greens were peculiarly beautiful none of the colors were deep they
were the lightest shades They were bewitching commingled We sat down
to study and enjoy this singular spectacle The tints remained during
several minutesflitting changing melting into each other paling
almost away for a moment then reflushinga shifting restless
unstable succession of soft opaline gleams shimmering over that air
film of white cloud and turning it into a fabric dainty enough to
clothe an angel with

By and by we perceived what those superdelicate colors and their
continuous play and movement reminded us of it is what one sees in a
soapbubble that is drifting along catching changes of tint from the
objects it passes A soapbubble is the most beautiful thing and the
most exquisite in nature that lovely phantom fabric in the sky was
suggestive of a soapbubble split open and spread out in the sun I
wonder how much it would take to buy a soapbubble if there was only
one in the world One could buy a hatful of KohiNoors with the same
money no doubt



We made the tramp from Martigny to Argentire in eight hours We beat
all the mules and wagons we didnt usually do that We hired a sort of
open baggagewagon for the trip down the valley to Chamonix and then
devoted an hour to dining This gave the driver time to get drunk He
had a friend with him and this friend also had had time to get drunk

When we drove off the driver said all the tourists had arrived and
gone by while we were at dinner but said he impressively be not
disturbed by thatremain tranquilgive yourselves no uneasinesstheir
dust rises far before usrest you tranquil leave all to meI am the
king of drivers Behold

Down came his whip and away we clattered I never had such a shaking up
in my life The recent flooding rains had washed the road clear away in
places but we never stopped we never slowed down for anything We tore
right along over rocks rubbish gullies open fieldssometimes with
one or two wheels on the ground but generally with none Every now and
then that calm goodnatured madman would bend a majestic look over his
shoulder at us and say Ah you perceive It is as I have saidI am
the king of drivers Every time we just missed going to destruction
he would say with tranquil happiness Enjoy it gentlemen it is very
rare it is very unusualit is given to few to ride with the king of
driversand observe it is as I have said I am he



He spoke in French and punctuated with hiccoughs His friend was
French too but spoke in Germanusing the same system of punctuation
however The friend called himself the Captain of Mont Blanc and
wanted us to make the ascent with him He said he had made more ascents
than any other manforty sevenand his brother had made thirtyseven
His brother was the best guide in the world except himselfbut he
yes observe him wellhe was the Captain of Mont Blancthat title
belonged to none other

The king was as good as his wordhe overtook that long procession
of tourists and went by it like a hurricane The result was that we got
choicer rooms at the hotel in Chamonix than we should have done if
his majesty had been a slower artistor rather if he hadnt most
providentially got drunk before he left Argentire
