CHAPTER XI

COME in says the woman and I did  She says  Take a cheer

I done it  She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes and says

What might your name be

Sarah Williams

Where bouts do you live  In this neighborhood

Nom  In Hookerville seven mile below  Ive walked all the way and
Im all tired out

Hungry too I reckon  Ill find you something

Nom I aint hungry  I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below
here at a farm so I aint hungry no more  Its what makes me so late
My mothers down sick and out of money and everything and I come to
tell my uncle Abner Moore  He lives at the upper end of the town she
says  I haint ever been here before  Do you know him

No but I dont know everybody yet  I havent lived here quite two
weeks Its a considerable ways to the upper end of the town  You better
stay here all night  Take off your bonnet

No I says Ill rest a while I reckon and go on  I aint afeared
of the dark

She said she wouldnt let me go by myself but her husband would be in by
and by maybe in a hour and a half and shed send him along with me
Then she got to talking about her husband and about her relations up the
river and her relations down the river and about how much better off
they used to was and how they didnt know but theyd made a mistake
coming to our town instead of letting well aloneand so on and so on
till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was
going on in the town but by and by she dropped on to pap and the murder
and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along  She told
about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars only she got it
ten and all about pap and what a hard lot he was and what a hard lot I
was and at last she got down to where I was murdered  I says

Who done it  Weve heard considerable about these goings on down in
Hookerville but we dont know who twas that killed Huck Finn

Well I reckon theres a right smart chance of people HERE thatd like
to know who killed him  Some think old Finn done it himself

Nois that so

Most everybody thought it at first  Hell never know how nigh he come
to getting lynched  But before night they changed around and judged it
was done by a runaway nigger named Jim

Why HE

I stopped  I reckoned I better keep still  She run on and never
noticed I had put in at all

The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed  So theres a
reward out for himthree hundred dollars  And theres a reward out for
old Finn tootwo hundred dollars  You see he come to town the morning
after the murder and told about it and was out with em on the
ferryboat hunt and right away after he up and left  Before night they
wanted to lynch him but he was gone you see  Well next day they found
out the nigger was gone they found out he hadnt ben seen sence ten
oclock the night the murder was done  So then they put it on him you
see and while they was full of it next day back comes old Finn and
went boohooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all
over Illinois with The judge gave him some and that evening he got
drunk and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty
hardlooking strangers and then went off with them  Well he haint
come back sence and they aint looking for him back till this thing
blows over a little for people thinks now that he killed his boy and
fixed things so folks would think robbers done it and then hed get
Hucks money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit  People
do say he warnt any too good to do it  Oh hes sly I reckon  If he
dont come back for a year hell be all right  You cant prove anything
on him you know everything will be quieted down then and hell walk in
Hucks money as easy as nothing

Yes I reckon so m  I dont see nothing in the way of it  Has
everybody quit thinking the nigger done it

Oh no not everybody  A good many thinks he done it  But theyll get
the nigger pretty soon now and maybe they can scare it out of him

Why are they after him yet

Well youre innocent aint you  Does three hundred dollars lay around
every day for people to pick up  Some folks think the nigger aint far
from here  Im one of thembut I haint talked it around  A few days
ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log
shanty and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island
over yonder that they call Jacksons Island  Dont anybody live there
says I No nobody says they  I didnt say any more but I done some
thinking  I was pretty near certain Id seen smoke over there about the
head of the island a day or two before that so I says to myself like
as not that niggers hiding over there anyway says I its worth the
trouble to give the place a hunt  I haint seen any smoke sence so I
reckon maybe hes gone if it was him but husbands going over to see
him and another man  He was gone up the river but he got back today
and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago

I had got so uneasy I couldnt set still  I had to do something with my
hands so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it
My hands shook and I was making a bad job of it  When the woman stopped
talking I looked up and she was looking at me pretty curious and smiling
a little  I put down the needle and thread and let on to be interested
and I was tooand says

Three hundred dollars is a power of money  I wish my mother could get
it Is your husband going over there tonight

Oh yes  He went uptown with the man I was telling you of to get a
boat and see if they could borrow another gun  Theyll go over after
midnight

Couldnt they see better if they was to wait till daytime

Yes  And couldnt the nigger see better too  After midnight hell
likely be asleep and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up
his camp fire all the better for the dark if hes got one

I didnt think of that

The woman kept looking at me pretty curious and I didnt feel a bit
comfortable  Pretty soon she says

What did you say your name was honey

MMary Williams

Somehow it didnt seem to me that I said it was Mary before so I didnt
look upseemed to me I said it was Sarah so I felt sort of cornered
and was afeared maybe I was looking it too  I wished the woman would
say something more the longer she set still the uneasier I was  But now
she says

Honey I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in

Oh yesm I did  Sarah Mary Williams  Sarahs my first name  Some
calls me Sarah some calls me Mary

Oh thats the way of it

Yesm

I was feeling better then but I wished I was out of there anyway  I
couldnt look up yet

Well the woman fell to talking about how hard times was and how poor
they had to live and how the rats was as free as if they owned the
place and so forth and so on and then I got easy again  She was right
about the rats Youd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner
every little while  She said she had to have things handy to throw at
them when she was alone or they wouldnt give her no peace  She showed
me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot and said she was a good shot
with it generly but shed wrenched her arm a day or two ago and didnt
know whether she could throw true now  But she watched for a chance and
directly banged away at a rat but she missed him wide and said Ouch
it hurt her arm so  Then she told me to try for the next one  I wanted
to be getting away before the old man got back but of course I didnt
let on  I got the thing and the first rat that showed his nose I let
drive and if hed a stayed where he was hed a been a tolerable sick
rat  She said that was firstrate and she reckoned I would hive the
next one  She went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back and
brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with  I
held up my two hands and she put the hank over them and went on talking
about her and her husbands matters  But she broke off to say

Keep your eye on the rats  You better have the lead in your lap
handy

So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment and I clapped my
legs together on it and she went on talking  But only about a minute
Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face and very
pleasant and says

Come now whats your real name

Whwhat mum

Whats your real name  Is it Bill or Tom or Bobor what is it

I reckon I shook like a leaf and I didnt know hardly what to do  But I
says

Please to dont poke fun at a poor girl like me mum  If Im in the way
here Ill

No you wont  Set down and stay where you are  I aint going to hurt
you and I aint going to tell on you nuther  You just tell me your
secret and trust me  Ill keep it and whats more Ill help you
Soll my old man if you want him to  You see youre a runaway
prentice thats all  It aint anything  There aint no harm in it
Youve been treated bad and you made up your mind to cut  Bless you
child I wouldnt tell on you  Tell me all about it now thats a good
boy

So I said it wouldnt be no use to try to play it any longer and I would
just make a clean breast and tell her everything but she musnt go back
on her promise  Then I told her my father and mother was dead and the
law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back
from the river and he treated me so bad I couldnt stand it no longer
he went away to be gone a couple of days and so I took my chance and
stole some of his daughters old clothes and cleared out and I had been
three nights coming the thirty miles  I traveled nights and hid
daytimes and slept and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home
lasted me all the way and I had aplenty  I said I believed my uncle
Abner Moore would take care of me and so that was why I struck out for
this town of Goshen

Goshen child  This aint Goshen  This is St Petersburg  Goshens
ten mile further up the river  Who told you this was Goshen

Why a man I met at daybreak this morning just as I was going to turn
into the woods for my regular sleep  He told me when the roads forked I
must take the right hand and five mile would fetch me to Goshen

He was drunk I reckon  He told you just exactly wrong

Well he did act like he was drunk but it aint no matter now  I got
to be moving along  Ill fetch Goshen before daylight

Hold on a minute  Ill put you up a snack to eat  You might want it

So she put me up a snack and says

Say when a cows laying down which end of her gets up first  Answer
up prompt nowdont stop to study over it  Which end gets up first

The hind end mum

Well then a horse

The forrard end mum

Which side of a tree does the moss grow on

North side

If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside how many of them eats with
their heads pointed the same direction

The whole fifteen mum

Well I reckon you HAVE lived in the country  I thought maybe you was
trying to hocus me again  Whats your real name now

George Peters mum

Well try to remember it George  Dont forget and tell me its
Elexander before you go and then get out by saying its George Elexander
when I catch you  And dont go about women in that old calico  You do a
girl tolerable poor but you might fool men maybe  Bless you child
when you set out to thread a needle dont hold the thread still and fetch
the needle up to it hold the needle still and poke the thread at it
thats the way a woman most always does but a man always does tother
way  And when you throw at a rat or anything hitch yourself up a tiptoe
and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can and miss
your rat about six or seven foot Throw stiffarmed from the shoulder
like there was a pivot there for it to turn on like a girl not from the
wrist and elbow with your arm out to one side like a boy  And mind
you when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees
apart she dont clap them together the way you did when you catched the
lump of lead  Why I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the
needle and I contrived the other things just to make certain  Now trot
along to your uncle Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters and if
you get into trouble you send word to Mrs Judith Loftus which is me
and Ill do what I can to get you out of it  Keep the river road all the
way and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you The river
roads a rocky one and your feetll be in a condition when you get to
Goshen I reckon

I went up the bank about fifty yards and then I doubled on my tracks and
slipped back to where my canoe was a good piece below the house  I
jumped in and was off in a hurry  I went upstream far enough to make
the head of the island and then started across  I took off the
sunbonnet for I didnt want no blinders on then  When I was about the
middle I heard the clock begin to strike so I stops and listens the
sound come faint over the water but cleareleven  When I struck the
head of the island I never waited to blow though I was most winded but
I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be and started
a good fire there on a high and dry spot

Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place a mile and a half
below as hard as I could go  I landed and slopped through the timber
and up the ridge and into the cavern  There Jim laid sound asleep on
the ground  I roused him out and says

Git up and hump yourself Jim  There aint a minute to lose  Theyre
after us

Jim never asked no questions he never said a word but the way he worked
for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared  By that time
everything we had in the world was on our raft and she was ready to be
shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid  We put out the camp
fire at the cavern the first thing and didnt show a candle outside
after that

I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece and took a look but
if there was a boat around I couldnt see it for stars and shadows aint
good to see by  Then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the
shade past the foot of the island dead stillnever saying a word




CHAPTER XII

IT must a been close on to one oclock when we got below the island at
last and the raft did seem to go mighty slow  If a boat was to come
along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois shore
and it was well a boat didnt come for we hadnt ever thought to put the
gun in the canoe or a fishingline or anything to eat  We was in
ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things  It warnt good
judgment to put EVERYTHING on the raft

If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I
built and watched it all night for Jim to come  Anyways they stayed
away from us and if my building the fire never fooled them it warnt no
fault of mine  I played it as low down on them as I could

When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a
big bend on the Illinois side and hacked off cottonwood branches with
the hatchet and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there
had been a cavein in the bank there  A towhead is a sandbar that has
cottonwoods on it as thick as harrowteeth

We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois
side and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place so we
warnt afraid of anybody running across us  We laid there all day and
watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore and
upbound steamboats fight the big river in the middle  I told Jim all
about the time I had jabbering with that woman and Jim said she was a
smart one and if she was to start after us herself she wouldnt set down
and watch a camp fireno sir shed fetch a dog  Well then I said
why couldnt she tell her husband to fetch a dog  Jim said he bet she
did think of it by the time the men was ready to start and he believed
they must a gone uptown to get a dog and so they lost all that time or
else we wouldnt be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the
villageno indeedy we would be in that same old town again  So I said
I didnt care what was the reason they didnt get us as long as they
didnt

When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the
cottonwood thicket and looked up and down and across nothing in sight
so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam
to get under in blazing weather and rainy and to keep the things dry
Jim made a floor for the wigwam and raised it a foot or more above the
level of the raft so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach
of steamboat waves  Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of
dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it
to its place this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly
the wigwam would keep it from being seen  We made an extra steeringoar
too because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something
We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on because we
must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming
downstream to keep from getting run over but we wouldnt have to light
it for upstream boats unless we see we was in what they call a
crossing for the river was pretty high yet very low banks being still
a little under water so upbound boats didnt always run the channel
but hunted easy water

This second night we run between seven and eight hours with a current
that was making over four mile an hour  We catched fish and talked and
we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness  It was kind of
solemn drifting down the big still river laying on our backs looking
up at the stars and we didnt ever feel like talking loud and it warnt
often that we laughedonly a little kind of a low chuckle  We had
mighty good weather as a general thing and nothing ever happened to us
at allthat night nor the next nor the next

Every night we passed towns some of them away up on black hillsides
nothing but just a shiny bed of lights not a house could you see  The
fifth night we passed St Louis and it was like the whole world lit up
In St Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand
people in St Louis but I never believed it till I see that wonderful
spread of lights at two oclock that still night  There warnt a sound
there everybody was asleep

Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten oclock at some little
village and buy ten or fifteen cents worth of meal or bacon or other
stuff to eat and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warnt roosting
comfortable and took him along  Pap always said take a chicken when
you get a chance because if you dont want him yourself you can easy
find somebody that does and a good deed aint ever forgot  I never see
pap when he didnt want the chicken himself but that is what he used to
say anyway

Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a
watermelon or a mushmelon or a punkin or some new corn or things of
that kind  Pap always said it warnt no harm to borrow things if you was
meaning to pay them back some time but the widow said it warnt anything
but a soft name for stealing and no decent body would do it  Jim said
he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right so the
best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list
and say we wouldnt borrow them any morethen he reckoned it wouldnt be
no harm to borrow the others  So we talked it over all one night
drifting along down the river trying to make up our minds whether to
drop the watermelons or the cantelopes or the mushmelons or what  But
towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory and concluded to
drop crabapples and psimmons  We warnt feeling just right before that
but it was all comfortable now  I was glad the way it come out too
because crabapples aint ever good and the psimmons wouldnt be ripe
for two or three months yet

We shot a waterfowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or
didnt go to bed early enough in the evening  Take it all round we
lived pretty high

The fifth night below St Louis we had a big storm after midnight with a
power of thunder and lightning and the rain poured down in a solid
sheet We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself
When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead
and high rocky bluffs on both sides  By and by says I HelLO Jim
looky yonder It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock  We
was drifting straight down for her  The lightning showed her very
distinct  She was leaning over with part of her upper deck above water
and you could see every little chimblyguy clean and clear and a chair
by the big bell with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it when
the flashes come

Well it being away in the night and stormy and all so mysteriouslike
I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck
laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river  I
wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little and see what there
was there  So I says

Les land on her Jim

But Jim was dead against it at first  He says

I doan want to go fooln long er no wrack  Wes doin blame well en
we better let blame well alone as de good book says  Like as not deys
a watchman on dat wrack

Watchman your grandmother I says there aint nothing to watch but
the texas and the pilothouse and do you reckon anybodys going to resk
his life for a texas and a pilothouse such a night as this when its
likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute  Jim couldnt
say nothing to that so he didnt try  And besides I says we might
borrow something worth having out of the captains stateroom  Seegars I
bet youand cost five cents apiece solid cash  Steamboat captains is
always rich and get sixty dollars a month and THEY dont care a cent
what a thing costs you know long as they want it  Stick a candle in
your pocket I cant rest Jim till we give her a rummaging  Do you
reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing  Not for pie he wouldnt
Hed call it an adventurethats what hed call it and hed land on
that wreck if it was his last act  And wouldnt he throw style into it
wouldnt he spread himself nor nothing  Why youd think it was
Christopher Clumbus discovering KingdomCome  I wish Tom Sawyer WAS
here

Jim he grumbled a little but give in  He said we mustnt talk any more
than we could help and then talk mighty low  The lightning showed us
the wreck again just in time and we fetched the stabboard derrick and
made fast there

The deck was high out here  We went sneaking down the slope of it to
labboard in the dark towards the texas feeling our way slow with our
feet and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys for it was so
dark we couldnt see no sign of them  Pretty soon we struck the forward
end of the skylight and clumb on to it and the next step fetched us in
front of the captains door which was open and by Jimminy away down
through the texashall we see a light and all in the same second we seem
to hear low voices in yonder

Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick and told me to come
along  I says all right and was going to start for the raft but just
then I heard a voice wail out and say

Oh please dont boys I swear I wont ever tell

Another voice said pretty loud

Its a lie Jim Turner  Youve acted this way before  You always want
moren your share of the truck and youve always got it too because
youve swore t if you didnt youd tell  But this time youve said it
jest one time too many  Youre the meanest treacherousest hound in this
country

By this time Jim was gone for the raft  I was just abiling with
curiosity and I says to myself Tom Sawyer wouldnt back out now and so
I wont either Im agoing to see whats going on here  So I dropped on
my hands and knees in the little passage and crept aft in the dark till
there warnt but one stateroom betwixt me and the crosshall of the
texas  Then in there I see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand
and foot and two men standing over him and one of them had a dim
lantern in his hand and the other one had a pistol  This one kept
pointing the pistol at the mans head on the floor and saying

Id LIKE to  And I orter tooa mean skunk

The man on the floor would shrivel up and say Oh please dont Bill I
haint ever goin to tell

And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say

Deed you AINT  You never said no truer thing n that you bet you
And once he said  Hear him beg and yit if we hadnt got the best of
him and tied him hed a killed us both  And what FOR  Jist for nothn
Jist because we stood on our RIGHTSthats what for  But I lay you
aint agoin to threaten nobody any more Jim Turner  Put UP that
pistol Bill

Bill says

I dont want to Jake Packard  Im for killin himand didnt he kill
old Hatfield jist the same wayand dont he deserve it

But I dont WANT him killed and Ive got my reasons for it

Bless yo heart for them words Jake Packard  Ill never forgit you
longs I live says the man on the floor sort of blubbering

Packard didnt take no notice of that but hung up his lantern on a nail
and started towards where I was there in the dark and motioned Bill to
come  I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards but the boat
slanted so that I couldnt make very good time so to keep from getting
run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side  The
man came apawing along in the dark and when Packard got to my
stateroom he says

Herecome in here

And in he come and Bill after him  But before they got in I was up in
the upper berth cornered and sorry I come  Then they stood there with
their hands on the ledge of the berth and talked  I couldnt see them
but I could tell where they was by the whisky theyd been having  I was
glad I didnt drink whisky but it wouldnt made much difference anyway
because most of the time they couldnt a treed me because I didnt
breathe  I was too scared  And besides a body COULDNT breathe and
hear such talk  They talked low and earnest  Bill wanted to kill
Turner  He says

Hes said hell tell and he will  If we was to give both our shares to
him NOW it wouldnt make no difference after the row and the way weve
served him  Shores youre born hell turn States evidence now you
hear ME  Im for putting him out of his troubles

Som I says Packard very quiet

Blame it Id sorter begun to think you wasnt  Well then thats all
right  Les go and do it

Hold on a minute I haint had my say yit  You listen to me
Shootings good but theres quieter ways if the things GOT to be done
But what I say is this  it aint good sense to go courtn around after a
halter if you can git at what youre up to in some way thats jist as
good and at the same time dont bring you into no resks  Aint that so

You bet it is  But how you goin to manage it this time

Well my idea is this  well rustle around and gather up whatever
pickins weve overlooked in the staterooms and shove for shore and hide
the truck Then well wait  Now I say it aint agoin to be moren two
hours befo this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river  See
Hell be drownded and wont have nobody to blame for it but his own
self  I reckon thats a considerble sight better n killin of him  Im
unfavorable to killin a man as long as you can git aroun it it aint
good sense it aint good morals  Aint I right

Yes I reckn you are  But spose she DONT break up and wash off

Well we can wait the two hours anyway and see cant we

All right then come along

So they started and I lit out all in a cold sweat and scrambled
forward It was dark as pitch there but I said in a kind of a coarse
whisper Jim  and he answered up right at my elbow with a sort of a
moan and I says

Quick Jim it aint no time for fooling around and moaning theres a
gang of murderers in yonder and if we dont hunt up their boat and set
her drifting down the river so these fellows cant get away from the
wreck theres one of em going to be in a bad fix  But if we find their
boat we can put ALL of em in a bad fixfor the sheriff ll get em
Quickhurry  Ill hunt the labboard side you hunt the stabboard
You start at the raft and

Oh my lordy lordy  RAF  Dey ain no raf no mo she done broke
loose en gone Ien here we is




CHAPTER XIII

WELL I catched my breath and most fainted  Shut up on a wreck with such
a gang as that  But it warnt no time to be sentimentering  Wed GOT to
find that boat nowhad to have it for ourselves  So we went aquaking
and shaking down the stabboard side and slow work it was tooseemed a
week before we got to the stern  No sign of a boat  Jim said he didnt
believe he could go any furtherso scared he hadnt hardly any strength
left he said  But I said come on if we get left on this wreck we are
in a fix sure  So on we prowled again  We struck for the stern of the
texas and found it and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight
hanging on from shutter to shutter for the edge of the skylight was in
the water  When we got pretty close to the crosshall door there was the
skiff sure enough  I could just barely see her  I felt ever so
thankful  In another second I would a been aboard of her but just then
the door opened  One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple
of foot from me and I thought I was gone but he jerked it in again and
says

Heave that blame lantern out o sight Bill

He flung a bag of something into the boat and then got in himself and
set down  It was Packard  Then Bill HE come out and got in  Packard
says in a low voice

All readyshove off

I couldnt hardly hang on to the shutters I was so weak  But Bill says

Hold ond you go through him

No  Didnt you

No  So hes got his share o the cash yet

Well then come along no use to take truck and leave money

Say wont he suspicion what were up to

Maybe he wont  But we got to have it anyway Come along

So they got out and went in

The door slammed to because it was on the careened side and in a half
second I was in the boat and Jim come tumbling after me  I out with my
knife and cut the rope and away we went

We didnt touch an oar and we didnt speak nor whisper nor hardly even
breathe  We went gliding swift along dead silent past the tip of the
paddlebox and past the stern then in a second or two more we was a
hundred yards below the wreck and the darkness soaked her up every last
sign of her and we was safe and knowed it

When we was three or four hundred yards downstream we see the lantern
show like a little spark at the texas door for a second and we knowed by
that that the rascals had missed their boat and was beginning to
understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was

Then Jim manned the oars and we took out after our raft  Now was the
first time that I begun to worry about the menI reckon I hadnt had
time to before  I begun to think how dreadful it was even for
murderers to be in such a fix  I says to myself there aint no telling
but I might come to be a murderer myself yet and then how would I like
it  So says I to Jim

The first light we see well land a hundred yards below it or above it
in a place where its a good hidingplace for you and the skiff and then
Ill go and fix up some kind of a yarn and get somebody to go for that
gang and get them out of their scrape so they can be hung when their
time comes

But that idea was a failure for pretty soon it begun to storm again and
this time worse than ever  The rain poured down and never a light
showed everybody in bed I reckon  We boomed along down the river
watching for lights and watching for our raft  After a long time the
rain let up but the clouds stayed and the lightning kept whimpering
and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead floating and we
made for it

It was the raft and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again  We
seen a light now away down to the right on shore  So I said I would go
for it The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole
there on the wreck  We hustled it on to the raft in a pile and I told
Jim to float along down and show a light when he judged he had gone
about two mile and keep it burning till I come then I manned my oars
and shoved for the light  As I got down towards it three or four more
showedup on a hillside  It was a village  I closed in above the shore
light and laid on my oars and floated  As I went by I see it was a
lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a doublehull ferryboat  I skimmed
around for the watchman awondering whereabouts he slept and by and by
I found him roosting on the bitts forward with his head down between his
knees  I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves and begun to cry

He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way but when he see it was only
me he took a good gap and stretch and then he says

Hello whats up  Dont cry bub  Whats the trouble

I says

Pap and mam and sis and

Then I broke down  He says

Oh dang it now DONT take on so we all has to have our troubles and
this n ll come out all right  Whats the matter with em

Theyretheyreare you the watchman of the boat

Yes he says kind of prettywellsatisfied like  Im the captain and
the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deckhand and
sometimes Im the freight and passengers  I aint as rich as old Jim
Hornback and I cant be so blame generous and good to Tom Dick and
Harry as what he is and slam around money the way he does but Ive told
him a many a time t I wouldnt trade places with him for says I a
sailors lifes the life for me and Im derned if ID live two mile out
o town where there aint nothing ever goin on not for all his
spondulicks and as much more on top of it  Says I

I broke in and says

Theyre in an awful peck of trouble and

WHO is

Why pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker and if youd take your
ferryboat and go up there

Up where  Where are they

On the wreck

What wreck

Why there aint but one

What you dont mean the Walter Scott

Yes

Good land what are they doin THERE for gracious sakes

Well they didnt go there apurpose

I bet they didnt  Why great goodness there aint no chance for em
if they dont git off mighty quick  Why how in the nation did they ever
git into such a scrape

Easy enough  Miss Hooker was avisiting up there to the town

Yes Booths Landinggo on

She was avisiting there at Booths Landing and just in the edge of the
evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horseferry to stay
all night at her friends house Miss Whatyoumaycallher I disremember
her nameand they lost their steeringoar and swung around and went
afloating down stern first about two mile and saddlebaggsed on the
wreck and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost
but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck  Well about an
hour after dark we come along down in our tradingscow and it was so
dark we didnt notice the wreck till we was right on it and so WE
saddlebaggsed but all of us was saved but Bill Whippleand oh he WAS
the best cretur I most wish t it had been me I do

My George  Its the beatenest thing I ever struck  And THEN what did
you all do

Well we hollered and took on but its so wide there we couldnt make
nobody hear  So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help
somehow I was the only one that could swim so I made a dash for it and
Miss Hooker she said if I didnt strike help sooner come here and hunt
up her uncle and hed fix the thing  I made the land about a mile
below and been fooling along ever since trying to get people to do
something but they said What in such a night and such a current
There aint no sense in it go for the steam ferry  Now if youll go
and

By Jackson Id LIKE to and blame it I dont know but I will but who
in the dingnations agoing to PAY for it  Do you reckon your pap

Why THATS all right  Miss Hooker she tole me PARTICULAR that her
uncle Hornback

Great guns is HE her uncle  Looky here you break for that light over
yonderway and turn out west when you git there and about a quarter of
a mile out youll come to the tavern tell em to dart you out to Jim
Hornbacks and hell foot the bill  And dont you fool around any
because hell want to know the news  Tell him Ill have his niece all
safe before he can get to town  Hump yourself now Im agoing up
around the corner here to roust out my engineer

I struck for the light but as soon as he turned the corner I went back
and got into my skiff and bailed her out and then pulled up shore in the
easy water about six hundred yards and tucked myself in among some
woodboats for I couldnt rest easy till I could see the ferryboat start
But take it all around I was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of
taking all this trouble for that gang for not many would a done it  I
wished the widow knowed about it  I judged she would be proud of me for
helping these rapscallions because rapscallions and dead beats is the
kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in

Well before long here comes the wreck dim and dusky sliding along
down A kind of cold shiver went through me and then I struck out for
her  She was very deep and I see in a minute there warnt much chance
for anybody being alive in her  I pulled all around her and hollered a
little but there wasnt any answer all dead still  I felt a little bit
heavyhearted about the gang but not much for I reckoned if they could
stand it I could

Then here comes the ferryboat so I shoved for the middle of the river on
a long downstream slant and when I judged I was out of eyereach I laid
on my oars and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for
Miss Hookers remainders because the captain would know her uncle
Hornback would want them and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up
and went for the shore and I laid into my work and went abooming down
the river

It did seem a powerful long time before Jims light showed up and when
it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off  By the time I got
there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east so we
struck for an island and hid the raft and sunk the skiff and turned in
and slept like dead people




CHAPTER XIV

BY and by when we got up we turned over the truck the gang had stole
off of the wreck and found boots and blankets and clothes and all
sorts of other things and a lot of books and a spyglass and three
boxes of seegars  We hadnt ever been this rich before in neither of our
lives  The seegars was prime  We laid off all the afternoon in the
woods talking and me reading the books and having a general good time
I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat
and I said these kinds of things was adventures but he said he didnt
want no more adventures  He said that when I went in the texas and he
crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died
because he judged it was all up with HIM anyway it could be fixed for if
he didnt get saved he would get drownded and if he did get saved
whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward and
then Miss Watson would sell him South sure  Well he was right he was
most always right he had an uncommon level head for a nigger

I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such and
how gaudy they dressed and how much style they put on and called each
other your majesty and your grace and your lordship and so on stead
of mister and Jims eyes bugged out and he was interested  He says

I didn know dey was so many un um  I haint hearn bout none un um
skasely but ole King Sollermun onless you counts dem kings dats in a
pack er kyards  How much do a king git

Get  I says why they get a thousand dollars a month if they want
it they can have just as much as they want everything belongs to them

AIN dat gay  En what dey got to do Huck

THEY dont do nothing  Why how you talk They just set around

No is dat so

Of course it is  They just set aroundexcept maybe when theres a
war then they go to the war  But other times they just lazy around or
go hawkingjust hawking and spShd you hear a noise

We skipped out and looked but it warnt nothing but the flutter of a
steamboats wheel away down coming around the point so we come back

Yes says I and other times when things is dull they fuss with the
parlyment and if everybody dont go just so he whacks their heads off
But mostly they hang round the harem

Roun de which

Harem

Whats de harem

The place where he keeps his wives  Dont you know about the harem
Solomon had one he had about a million wives

Why yes dats so IId done forgot it  A harems a bodnhouse I

I never see such a nigger  If he got a notion in his head once there
warnt no getting it out again  He was the most down on Solomon of any
nigger I ever see  So I went to talking about other kings and let
Solomon slide  I told about Louis Sixteenth that got his head cut off in
France long time ago and about his little boy the dolphin that would a
been a king but they took and shut him up in jail and some say he died
there

Po little chap

But some says he got out and got away and come to America

So I quit




CHAPTER XV

WE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo at the bottom
of Illinois where the Ohio River comes in and that was what we was
after  We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the
Ohio amongst the free States and then be out of trouble

Well the second night a fog begun to come on and we made for a towhead
to tie to for it wouldnt do to try to run in a fog but when I paddled
ahead in the canoe with the line to make fast there warnt anything but
little saplings to tie to  I passed the line around one of them right on
the edge of the cut bank but there was a stiff current and the raft
come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she
went  I see the fog closing down and it made me so sick and scared I
couldnt budge for most a half a minute it seemed to meand then there
warnt no raft in sight you couldnt see twenty yards  I jumped into
the canoe and run back to the stern and grabbed the paddle and set her
back a stroke  But she didnt come  I was in such a hurry I hadnt
untied her  I got up and tried to untie her but I was so excited my
hands shook so I couldnt hardly do anything with them

As soon as I got started I took out after the raft hot and heavy right
down the towhead  That was all right as far as it went but the towhead
warnt sixty yards long and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot
out into the solid white fog and hadnt no more idea which way I was
going than a dead man

Thinks I it wont do to paddle first I know Ill run into the bank or a
towhead or something I got to set still and float and yet its mighty
fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time  I
whooped and listened  Away down there somewheres I hears a small whoop
and up comes my spirits  I went tearing after it listening sharp to
hear it again  The next time it come I see I warnt heading for it but
heading away to the right of it  And the next time I was heading away to
the left of itand not gaining on it much either for I was flying
around this way and that and tother but it was going straight ahead
all the time

I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan and beat it all the
time but he never did and it was the still places between the whoops
that was making the trouble for me  Well I fought along and directly I
hears the whoop BEHIND me  I was tangled good now  That was somebody
elses whoop or else I was turned around

I throwed the paddle down  I heard the whoop again it was behind me
yet but in a different place it kept coming and kept changing its
place and I kept answering till by and by it was in front of me again
and I knowed the current had swung the canoes head downstream and I
was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering  I
couldnt tell nothing about voices in a fog for nothing dont look
natural nor sound natural in a fog

The whooping went on and in about a minute I come abooming down on a
cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it and the current throwed me
off to the left and shot by amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared
the currrent was tearing by them so swift

In another second or two it was solid white and still again  I set
perfectly still then listening to my heart thump and I reckon I didnt
draw a breath while it thumped a hundred

I just give up then  I knowed what the matter was  That cut bank was an
island and Jim had gone down tother side of it  It warnt no towhead
that you could float by in ten minutes  It had the big timber of a
regular island it might be five or six miles long and more than half a
mile wide

I kept quiet with my ears cocked about fifteen minutes I reckon  I
was floating along of course four or five miles an hour but you dont
ever think of that  No you FEEL like you are laying dead still on the
water and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you dont think to
yourself how fast YOURE going but you catch your breath and think my
how that snags tearing along  If you think it aint dismal and lonesome
out in a fog that way by yourself in the night you try it onceyoull
see

Next for about a half an hour I whoops now and then at last I hears
the answer a long ways off and tries to follow it but I couldnt do it
and directly I judged Id got into a nest of towheads for I had little
dim glimpses of them on both sides of mesometimes just a narrow channel
between and some that I couldnt see I knowed was there because Id hear
the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung
over the banks  Well I warnt long loosing the whoops down amongst the
towheads and I only tried to chase them a little while anyway because
it was worse than chasing a Jackolantern  You never knowed a sound
dodge around so and swap places so quick and so much

I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times to
keep from knocking the islands out of the river and so I judged the raft
must be butting into the bank every now and then or else it would get
further ahead and clear out of hearingit was floating a little faster
than what I was

Well I seemed to be in the open river again by and by but I couldnt
hear no sign of a whoop nowheres  I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a
snag maybe and it was all up with him  I was good and tired so I laid
down in the canoe and said I wouldnt bother no more  I didnt want to
go to sleep of course but I was so sleepy I couldnt help it so I
thought I would take jest one little catnap

But I reckon it was more than a catnap for when I waked up the stars
was shining bright the fog was all gone and I was spinning down a big
bend stern first  First I didnt know where I was I thought I was
dreaming and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up
dim out of last week

It was a monstrous big river here with the tallest and the thickest kind
of timber on both banks just a solid wall as well as I could see by the
stars  I looked away downstream and seen a black speck on the water
I took after it but when I got to it it warnt nothing but a couple of
sawlogs made fast together  Then I see another speck and chased that
then another and this time I was right  It was the raft

When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his
knees asleep with his right arm hanging over the steeringoar  The
other oar was smashed off and the raft was littered up with leaves and
branches and dirt  So shed had a rough time

I made fast and laid down under Jims nose on the raft and began to gap
and stretch my fists out against Jim and says

Hello Jim have I been asleep  Why didnt you stir me up

Goodness gracious is dat you Huck  En you ain deadyou ain
drowndedyous back agin  Its too good for true honey its too
good for true Lemme look at you chile lemme feel o you  No you ain
dead yous back agin live en soun jis de same ole Huckde same ole
Huck thanks to goodness

Whats the matter with you Jim  You been adrinking

Drinkin  Has I ben adrinkin  Has I had a chance to be adrinkin

Well then what makes you talk so wild

How does I talk wild

HOW  Why haint you been talking about my coming back and all that
stuff as if Id been gone away

HuckHuck Finn you look me in de eye look me in de eye  HAINT you
ben gone away

Gone away  Why what in the nation do you mean  I haint been gone
anywheres  Where would I go to

Well looky here boss deys sumfn wrong dey is  Is I ME or who IS
I Is I heah or whah IS I  Now dats what I wants to know

Well I think youre here plain enough but I think youre a
tangleheaded old fool Jim

I is is I  Well you answer me dis  Didnt you tote out de line in de
canoe fer to make fas to de towhead

No I didnt  What towhead  I haint see no towhead

You haint seen no towhead  Looky here didnt de line pull loose en de
raf go ahummin down de river en leave you en de canoe behine in de
fog

What fog

Why de fogde fog dats been aroun all night  En didnt you whoop
en didnt I whoop tell we got mix up in de islands en one un us got
los en tother one was jis as good as los kase he didn know whah he
wuz En didnt I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible
time en mos git drownded  Now ain dat so bossaint it so  You
answer me dat

Well this is too many for me Jim  I haint seen no fog nor no
islands nor no troubles nor nothing  I been setting here talking with
you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago and I reckon
I done the same  You couldnt a got drunk in that time so of course
youve been dreaming

Dad fetch it how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes

Well hang it all you did dream it because there didnt any of it
happen

But Huck its all jis as plain to me as

It dont make no difference how plain it is there aint nothing in it
I know because Ive been here all the time

Jim didnt say nothing for about five minutes but set there studying
over it  Then he says

Well den I reckn I did dream it Huck but dog my cats ef it aint de
powerfullest dream I ever see  En I haint ever had no dream bfo dats
tired me like dis one

Oh well thats all right because a dream does tire a body like
everything sometimes  But this one was a staving dream tell me all
about it Jim

So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through just as it
happened only he painted it up considerable  Then he said he must start
in and terpret it because it was sent for a warning  He said the
first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good but the
current was another man that would get us away from him  The whoops was
warnings that would come to us every now and then and if we didnt try
hard to make out to understand them theyd just take us into bad luck
stead of keeping us out of it  The lot of towheads was troubles we was
going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks
but if we minded our business and didnt talk back and aggravate them we
would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river
which was the free States and wouldnt have no more trouble

It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft but it was
clearing up again now

Oh well thats all interpreted well enough as far as it goes Jim I
says but what does THESE things stand for

It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar  You could
see them firstrate now

Jim looked at the trash and then looked at me and back at the trash
again  He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he couldnt
seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right
away  But when he did get the thing straightened around he looked at me
steady without ever smiling and says

What do dey stan for  Ise gwyne to tell you  When I got all wore out
wid work en wid de callin for you en went to sleep my heart wuz mos
broke bekase you wuz los en I didn kyer no mo what become er me en
de raf  En when I wake up en fine you back agin all safe en soun de
tears come en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo foot Is so
thankful En all you wuz thinkin bout wuz how you could make a fool uv
ole Jim wid a lie  Dat truck dah is TRASH en trash is what people is
dat puts dirt on de head er dey frens en makes em ashamed

Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam and went in there without
saying anything but that  But that was enough  It made me feel so mean
I could almost kissed HIS foot to get him to take it back

It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble
myself to a nigger but I done it and I warnt ever sorry for it
afterwards neither  I didnt do him no more mean tricks and I wouldnt
done that one if Id a knowed it would make him feel that way
