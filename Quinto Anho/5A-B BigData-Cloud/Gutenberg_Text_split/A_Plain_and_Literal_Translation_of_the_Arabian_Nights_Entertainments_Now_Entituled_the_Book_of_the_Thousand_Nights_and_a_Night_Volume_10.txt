               MAARUF THE COBBLER AND HIS WIFE FATIMAH


There dwelt once upon a time in the Godguarded city of Cairo a cobbler
who lived by patching old shoes His name was Maaruf and he had a
wife called Fatimah whom the folk had nicknamed The Dung for that
she was a whorish worthless wretch scanty of shame and mickle of
mischief She ruled her spouse and used to abuse him and curse him a
thousand times a day and he feared her malice and dreaded her
misdoings for that he was a sensible man and careful of his repute but
poorconditioned When he earned much he spent it on her and when he
gained little she revenged herself on his body that night leaving him
no peace and making his night black as her book for she was even as
of one like her saith the poet

 How manifold nights have I passed with my wife  In the saddest plight
    with all misery rife
 Would Heaven when first I went in to her  With a cup of cold poison Id
    taen her life

Amongst other afflictions which befel him from her one day she said to
him O Maaruf I wish thee to bring me this night a vermicellicake
dressed with bees honey He replied So Allah Almighty aid me to
its price I will bring it thee By Allah I have no dirhams today but
our Lord will make things easy Rejoined sheAnd Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


         Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninetieth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that Maaruf the
Cobbler said to his spouse If Allah aid me to its price I will bring
it to thee this night By Allah I have no dirhams today but our Lord
will make things easy to me She rejoined I wot naught of these
words whether He aid thee or aid thee not look thou come not to me
save with the vermicelli and bees honey and if thou come without it I
will make thy night black as thy fortune whenas thou marriedst me and
fellest into my hand Quoth he Allah is bountiful and going out
with grief scattering itself from his body prayed the dawnprayer and
opened his shop saying I beseech thee O Lord to vouchsafe me the
price of the Kunafah and ward off from me the mischief of yonder wicked
woman this night After which he sat in the shop till noon but no work
came to him and his fear of his wife redoubled Then he arose and
locking his shop went out perplexed as to how he should do in the
matter of the vermicellicake seeing he had not even the wherewithal to
buy bread Presently he came up to the shop of the Kunafahseller and
stood before it distraught whilst his eyes brimmed with tears The
pastrycook glanced at him and said O Master Maaruf why dost thou
weep Tell me what hath befallen thee So he acquainted him with his
case saying My wife is a shrew a virago who would have me bring her
a Kunafah but I have sat in my shop till past midday and have not
gained even the price of bread wherefore I am in fear of her The cook
laughed and said No harm shall come to thee How many pounds wilt thou
have Five pounds answered Maaruf So the man weighed him out five
pounds of vermicellicake and said to him I have clarified butter but
no bees honey Here is driphoney however which is better than
bees honey and what harm will there be if it be with driphoney
Maaruf was ashamed to object because the pastrycook was to have
patience with him for the price and said Give it me with driphoney
So he fried a vermicellicake for him with butter and drenched it with
driphoney till it was fit to present to Kings Then he asked him
Dost thou want bread and cheese and Maaruf answered Yes So
he gave him four half dirhams worth of bread and one of cheese and the
vermicelli was ten nusfs Then said he Know O Maaruf that thou
owest me fifteen nusfs so go to thy wife and make merry and take this
nusf for the Hammam and thou shalt have credit for a day or two or
three till Allah provide thee with thy daily bread And straiten not thy
wife for I will have patience with thee till such time as thou shalt
have dirhams to spare So Maaruf took the vermicellicake and bread
and cheese and went away with a heart at ease blessing the pastrycook
and saying Extolled be Thy perfection O my Lord How bountiful art
Thou When he came home his wife enquired of him Hast thou brought
the vermicellicake and replying Yes he set it before her She
looked at it and seeing that it was dressed with canehoney said to
him Did I not bid thee bring it with bees honey Wilt thou contrary
my wish and have it dressed with canehoney He excused himself to her
saying I bought it not save on credit but said she This talk is
idle I will not eat Kunafah save with bees honey And she was wroth
with it and threw it in his face saying Begone thou pimp and bring
me other than this Then she dealt him a buffet on the cheek and
knocked out one of his teeth The blood ran down upon his breast and for
stress of anger he smote her on the head a single blow and a slight
whereupon she clutched his beard and fell to shouting out and saying
Help O Moslems So the neighbours came in and freed his beard from
her grip then they reproved and reproached her saying We are all
content to eat Kunafah with canehoney Why then wilt thou oppress
this poor man thus Verily this is disgraceful in thee And they went
on to soothe her till they made peace between her and him But when the
folk were gone she sware that she would not eat of the vermicelli and
Maaruf burning with hunger said in himself She sweareth that she
will not eat so I will een eat Then he ate and when she saw him
eating she said Inshallah may the eating of it be poison to destroy
the far ones body Quoth he It shall not be at thy bidding and
went on eating laughing and saying Thou swarest that thou wouldst not
eat of this but Allah is bountiful and tomorrow night an the Lord
decree I will bring thee Kunafah dressed with bees honey and thou
shalt eat it alone And he applied himself to appeasing her whilst she
called down curses upon him and she ceased not to rail at him and
revile him with gross abuse till the morning when she bared her forearm
to beat him Quoth he Give me time and I will bring thee other
vermicellicake Then he went out to the mosque and prayed after which
he betook himself to his shop and opening it sat down but hardly had
he done this when up came two runners from the Kazis court and said to
him Up with thee speak with the Kazi for thy wife hath complained of
thee to him and her favour is thus and thus He recognised her by their
description and saying May Allah Almighty torment her walked with
them till he came to the Kazis presence where he found Fatimah
standing with her arm bound up and her faceveil besmeared with blood
and she was weeping and wiping away her tears Quoth the Kazi Ho man
hast thou no fear of Allah the Most High Why hast thou beaten this good
woman and broken her forearm and knocked out her tooth and entreated her
thus And quoth Maaruf If I beat her or put out her tooth sentence
me to what thou wilt but in truth the case was thus and thus and the
neighbours made peace between me and her And he told him the story
from first to last Now this Kazi was a benevolent man so he brought
out to him a quarter dinar saying O man take this and get her
Kunafah with bees honey and do ye make peace thou and she Quoth
Maaruf Give it to her So she took it and the Kazi made peace
between them saying O wife obey thy husband and thou O man deal
kindly with her Then they left the court reconciled at the Kazis
hands and the woman went one way whilst her husband returned by
another way to his shop and sat there when behold the runners came up
to him and said Give us our fee Quoth he The Kazi took not of me
aught on the contrary he gave me a quarter dinar But quoth they
Tis no concern of ours whether the Kazi took of thee or gave to thee
and if thou give us not our fee we will exact it in despite of thee
And they fell to dragging him about the market so he sold his tools and
gave them half a dinar whereupon they let him go and went away whilst
he put his hand to his cheek and sat sorrowful for that he had no tools
wherewith to work Presently up came two illfavoured fellows and said
to him Come O man and speak with the Kazi for thy wife hath
complained of thee to him Said he He made peace between us just
now But said they We come from another Kazi and thy wife hath
complained of thee to our Kazi So he arose and went with them to their
Kazi calling on Allah for aid against her and when he saw her he said
to her Did we not make peace good woman Whereupon she cried There
abideth no peace between me and thee Accordingly he came forward and
told the Kazi his story adding And indeed the Kazi Suchanone made
peace between us this very hour Whereupon the Kazi said to her O
strumpet since ye two have made peace with each other why comest thou
to me complaining Quoth she He beat me after that but quoth the
Kazi Make peace each with other and beat her not again and she will
cross thee no more So they made peace and the Kazi said to Maaruf
Give the runners their fee So he gave them their fee and going back
to his shop opened it and sat down as he were a drunken man for excess
of the chagrin which befel him Presently while he was still sitting
behold a man came up to him and said O Maaruf rise and hide
thyself for thy wife hath complained of thee to the High Court and
Ab Tabak is after thee So he shut his shop and fled towards the
Gate of Victory He had five Nusfs of silver left of the price of
the lasts and gear and therewith he bought four worth of bread and one
of cheese as he fled from her Now it was the winter season and the
hour of midafternoon prayer so when he came out among the
rubbishmounds the rain descended upon him like water from the mouths
of waterskins and his clothes were drenched He therefore entered the
diliyah where he saw a ruined place and therein a deserted cell
without a door and in it he took refuge and found shelter from the
rain The tears streamed from his eyelids and he fell to complaining of
what had betided him and saying Whither shall I flee from this whore
I beseech Thee O Lord to vouchsafe me one who shall conduct me to a
far country where she shall not know the way to me Now while he sat
weeping behold the wall clave and there came forth to him therefrom
one of tall stature whose aspect caused his bodypile to bristle and
his flesh to creep and said to him O man what aileth thee that thou
disturbest me this night These two hundred years have I dwelt here and
have never seen any enter this place and do as thou dost Tell me what
thou wishest and I will accomplish thy need as ruth for thee hath got
hold upon my heart Quoth Maaruf Who and what art thou and quoth
he I am the Haunter of this place So Maaruf told him all that
had befallen him with his wife and he said Wilt thou have me convey
thee to a country where thy wife shall know no way to thee Yes
said Maaruf and the other Then mount my back So he mounted on his
back and he flew with him from after suppertide till daybreak when he
set him down on the top of a high mountainAnd Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


        Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninetyfirst Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Marid having
taken up Maaruf the Cobbler flew off with him and set him down upon a
high mountain and said to him O mortal descend this mountain and thou
wilt see the gate of a city Enter it for therein thy wife cannot come
at thee He then left him and went his way whilst Maaruf abode in
amazement and perplexity till the sun rose when he said to himself I
will up with me and go down into the city indeed there is no profit in
my abiding upon this highland So he descended to the mountainfoot and
saw a city girt by towering walls full of lofty palaces and
goldadorned buildings which was a delight to beholders He entered in
at the gate and found it a place such as lightened the grieving heart
but as he walked through the streets the townsfolk stared at him as a
curiosity and gathered about him marvelling at his dress for it was
unlike theirs Presently one of them said to him O man art thou a
stranger Yes What countryman art thou I am from the city of
Cairo the Auspicious And when didst thou leave Cairo I left it
yesterday at the hour of afternoonprayer Whereupon the man laughed
at him and cried out saying Come look O folk at this man and hear
what he saith Quoth they What doeth he say and quoth the townsman
He pretendeth that he cometh from Cairo and left it yesterday at the
hour of afternoonprayer At this they all laughed and gathering round
Maaruf said to him O man art thou mad to talk thus How canst thou
pretend that thou leftest Cairo at midafternoon yesterday and foundedst
thyself this morning here when the truth is that between our city and
Cairo lieth a full years journey Quoth he None is mad but you As
for me I speak sooth for here is bread which I brought with me from
Cairo and see tis yet new Then he showed them the bread and they
stared at it for it was unlike their country bread So the crowd
increased about him and they said to one another This is Cairo bread
look at it and he became a gazingstock in the city and some believed
him whilst others gave him the lie and made mock of him Whilst this
was going on behold up came a merchant riding on a shemule and
followed by two black slaves and brake a way through the people
saying O folk are ye not ashamed to mob this stranger and make mock
of him and scoff at him And he went on to rate them till he drave
them away from Maaruf and none could make him any answer Then he said
to the stranger Come O my brother no harm shall betide thee from
these folk Verily they have no shame So he took him and carrying
him to a spacious and richlyadorned house seated him in a speakroom
fit for a King whilst he gave an order to his slaves who opened a
chest and brought out to him a dress such as might be worn by a merchant
worth a thousand He clad him therewith and Maaruf being a seemly
man became as he were consul of the merchants Then his host called for
food and they set before them a tray of all manner exquisite viands The
twain ate and drank and the merchant said to Maaruf O my brother
what is thy name My name is Maaruf and I am a cobbler by trade and
patch old shoes What countryman art thou I am from Cairo What
quarter Dost thou know Cairo I am of its children I come
from the Red Street And whom dost thou know in the Red Street
I know such an one and such an one answered Maaruf and named several
people to him Quoth the other Knowest thou Shaykh Ahmad the
druggist He was my next neighbour wall to wall Is he well
Yes How many sons hath he Three Mustaf Mohammed and Ali And
what hath Allah done with them As for Mustaf he is well and he is a
learned man a professor Mohammed is a druggist and opened him a
shop beside that of his father after he had married and his wife hath
borne him a son named Hasan Allah gladden thee with good news said
the merchant and Maaruf continued As for Ali he was my friend when
we were boys and we always played together I and he We used to go in
the guise of the children of the Nazarenes and enter the church and
steal the books of the Christians and sell them and buy food with the
price It chanced once that the Nazarenes caught us with a book
whereupon they complained of us to our folk and said to Alis fatherAn
thou hinder not thy son from troubling us we will complain of thee to
the King So he appeased them and gave Ali a thrashing wherefore he ran
away none knew whither and he hath now been absent twenty years and no
man hath brought news of him Quoth the host I am that very Ali son
of Shaykh Ahmad the druggist and thou art my playmate Maaruf So
they saluted each other and after the salam Ali said Tell me why O
Maaruf thou camest from Cairo to this city Then he told him all that
had befallen him of illdoing with his wife Fatimah the Dung and said
So when her annoy waxed on me I fled from her towards the Gate of
Victory and went forth the city Presently the rain fell heavy on me
so I entered a ruined cell in the Adiliyah and sat there weeping
whereupon there came forth to me the Haunter of the place which was an
Ifrit of the Jinn and questioned me I acquainted him with my case and
he took me on his back and flew with me all night between heaven and
earth till he set me down on yonder mountain and gave me to know of
this city So I came down from the mountain and entered the city when
the people crowded about me and questioned me I told them that I had
left Cairo yesterday but they believed me not and presently thou
camest up and driving the folk away from me carriedst me to this house
Such then is the cause of my quitting Cairo and thou what object
brought thee hither Quoth Ali The giddiness of folly turned my
head when I was seven years old from which time I wandered from land to
land and city to city till I came to this city the name whereof is
Ikhtiyn alKhatan I found its people an hospitable folk and a
kindly compassionate for the poor man and selling to him on credit and
believing all he said So quoth I to themI am a merchant and have
preceded my packs and I need a place wherein to bestow my baggage And
they believed me and assigned me a lodging Then quoth I to themIs
there any of you will lend me a thousand dinars till my loads arrive
when I will repay it to him for I am in want of certain things before
my goods come They gave me what I asked and I went to the merchants
bazar where seeing goods I bought them and sold them next day at a
profit of fifty gold pieces and bought others And I consorted with
the folk and entreated them liberally so that they loved me and I
continued to sell and buy till I grew rich Know O my brother that
the proverb saith The world is show and trickery and the land where
none wotteth thee there do whatso liketh thee Thou too an thou say to
all who ask thee Im a cobbler by trade and poor withal and I fled
from my wife and left Cairo yesterday they will not believe thee and
thou wilt be a laughingstock among them as long as thou abidest in the
city whilst an thou tell them An Ifrit brought me hither they will
take fright at thee and none will come near thee for they will say
This man is possessed of an Ifrit and harm will betide whoso approacheth
him And such public report will be dishonouring both to thee and to me
because they ken I come from Cairo Maaruf askedHow then shall I
do and Ali answered I will tell thee how thou shalt do Inshallah
Tomorrow I will give thee a thousand dinars and a shemule to ride and
a black slave who shall walk before thee and guide thee to the gate of
the merchants bazar and do thou go into them I will be there sitting
amongst them and when I see thee I will rise to thee and salute thee
with the salam and kiss thy hand and make a great man of thee Whenever
I ask thee of any kind of stuff saying Hast thou brought with thee
aught of such a kind do thou answer Plenty And if they question
me of thee I will praise thee and magnify thee in their eyes and say to
them Get him a storehouse and a shop I also will give thee out for a
man of great wealth and generosity and if a beggar come to thee bestow
upon him what thou mayst so will they put faith in what I say and
believe in thy greatness and generosity and love thee Then will I
invite thee to my house and invite all the merchants on thy account and
bring together thee and them so that all may know thee and thou know
themAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her

       Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninetysecond Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the merchant
Ali said to Maaruf I will invite thee to my house and invite all the
merchants on thy account and bring together thee and them so that all
may know thee and thou know them whereby thou shalt sell and buy and
take and give with them nor will it be long ere thou become a man of
money Accordingly on the morrow he gave him a thousand dinars and a
suit of clothes and a black slave and mounting him on a shemule said
to him Allah give thee quittance of responsibility for all this
inasmuch as thou art my friend and it behoveth me to deal generously
with thee Have no care but put away from thee the thought of thy
wifes misways and name her not to any Allah requite thee with good
replied Maaruf and rode on preceded by his blackamoor till the slave
brought him to the gate of the merchants bazar where they were all
seated and amongst them Ali who when he saw him rose and threw
himself upon him crying A blessed day O Merchant Maaruf O man of
good works and kindness And he kissed his hand before the
merchants and said to them Our brothers ye are honoured by
knowing the merchant Maaruf So they saluted him and Ali signed
to them to make much of him wherefore he was magnified in their eyes
Then Ali helped him to dismount from his shemule and saluted him with
the salam after which he took the merchants apart one after other and
vaunted Maaruf to them They asked Is this man a merchant and he
answered Yes and indeed he is the chiefest of merchants there liveth
not a wealthier than he for his wealth and the riches of his father and
forefathers are famous among the merchants of Cairo He hath partners in
Hind and Sind and AlYaman and is high in repute for generosity So know
ye his rank and exalt ye his degree and do him service and wot also
that his coming to your city is not for the sake of traffic and none
other save to divert himself with the sight of folks countries indeed
he hath no need of strangerhood for the sake of gain and profit having
wealth that fires cannot consume and I am one of his servants And he
ceased not to extol him till they set him above their heads and began
to tell one another of his qualities Then they gathered round him and
offered him junkets and sherbets and even the Consul of the
Merchants came to him and saluted him whilst Ali proceeded to ask him
in the presence of the traders O my lord haply thou hast brought with
thee somewhat of such and such a stuff and Maaruf answered
Plenty Now Ali had that day shown him various kinds of costly clothes
and had taught him the names of the different stuffs dear and cheap
Then said one of the merchants O my lord hast thou brought with thee
yellow broad cloth and Maaruf said Plenty Quoth another And
gazelles blood red and quoth the Cobbler Plenty and as often
as he asked him of aught he made him the same answer So the other
said O Merchant Ali had thy countryman a mind to transport a thousand
loads of costly stuffs he could do so and Ali said He would take
them from a single one of his storehouses and miss naught thereof
Now whilst they were sitting behold up came a beggar and went the
round of the merchants One gave him a half dirham and another a
copper but most of them gave him nothing till he came to Maaruf
who pulled out a handful of gold and gave it to him whereupon he
blessed him and went his ways The merchants marvelled at this and said
Verily this is a Kings bestowal for he gave the beggar gold without
count and were he not a man of vast wealth and money without end he
had not given a beggar a handful of gold After a while there came to
him a poor woman and he gave her a handful of gold whereupon she went
away blessing him and told the other beggars who came to him one
after other and he gave them each a handful of gold till he disbursed
the thousand dinars Then he struck hand upon hand and said Allah is
our sufficient aid and excellent is the Agent Quoth the Consul What
aileth thee O Merchant Maaruf and quoth he It seemeth that the
most part of the people of this city are poor and needy had I known
their misery I would have brought with me a large sum of money in my
saddlebags and given largesse thereof to the poor I fear me I may be
long abroad and tis not in my nature to baulk a beggar and I have
no gold left so if a pauper come to me what shall I say to him
Quoth the Consul Say Allah will send thee thy daily bread but
Maaruf replied That is not my practice and I am careridden because
of this Would I had other thousand dinars wherewith to give alms till
my baggage come Have no care for that quoth the Consul and sending
one of his dependents for a thousand dinars handed them to Maaruf who
went on giving them to every beggar who passed till the call to
noonprayer Then they entered the Cathedralmosque and prayed the
noonprayers and what was left him of the thousand gold pieces he
scattered on the heads of the worshippers This drew the peoples
attention to him and they blessed him whilst the merchants marvelled at
the abundance of his generosity and openhandedness Then he turned to
another trader and borrowing of him other thousand ducats gave these
also away whilst Merchant Ali looked on at what he did but could not
speak He ceased not to do thus till the call to midafternoon prayer
when he entered the mosque and prayed and distributed the rest of the
money On this wise by the time they locked the doors of the bazar
he had borrowed five thousand sequins and given them away saying to
every one of whom he took aught Wait till my baggage come when if
thou desire gold I will give thee gold and if thou desire stuffs thou
shalt have stuffs for I have no end of them At eventide Merchant Ali
invited Maaruf and the rest of the traders to an entertainment and
seated him in the upper end the place of honour where he talked of
nothing but cloths and jewels and whenever they made mention to him of
aught he said I have plenty of it Next day he again repaired to
the marketstreet where he showed a friendly bias towards the merchants
and borrowed of them more money which he distributed to the poor nor
did he leave doing thus twenty days till he had borrowed threescore
thousand dinars and still there came no baggage no nor a burning
plague At last folk began to clamour for their money and say The
merchant Maarufs baggage cometh not How long will he take peoples
monies and give them to the poor And quoth one of them My rede is
that we speak to Merchant Ali So they went to him and said O
Merchant Ali Merchant Maarufs baggage cometh not Said he Have
patience it cannot fail to come soon Then he took Maaruf aside and
said to him O Maaruf what fashion is this Did I bid thee brown
the bread or burn it The merchants clamour for their coin and tell me
that thou owest them sixty thousand dinars which thou hast borrowed and
given away to the poor How wilt thou satisfy the folk seeing that thou
neither sellest nor buyest Said Maaruf What matters it and
what are threescore thousand dinars When my baggage shall come I will
pay them in stuffs or in gold and silver as they will Quoth Merchant
Ali Allah is Most Great Hast thou then any baggage and he said
Plenty Cried the other Allah and the Hallows requite thee thine
impudence Did I teach thee this saying that thou shouldst repeat it to
me But I will acquaint the folk with thee Maaruf rejoined Begone
and prate no more Am I a poor man I have endless wealth in my baggage
and as soon as it cometh they shall have their moneys worth two for
one I have no need of them At this Merchant Ali waxed wroth and said
Unmannerly wight that thou art I will teach thee to lie to me and be
not ashamed Said Maaruf Een work the worst thy hand can do They
must wait till my baggage come when they shall have their due and
more So Ali left him and went away saying in himself I praised him
whilome and if I blame him now I make myself out a liar and become of
those of whom it is saidWhoso praiseth and then blameth lieth
twice And he knew not what to do Presently the traders came to
him and said O Merchant Ali hast thou spoken to him Said he O
folk I am ashamed and though he owe me a thousand dinars I cannot
speak to him When ye lent him your money ye consulted me not so ye
have no claim on me Dun him yourselves and if he pay you not complain
of him to the King of the city sayingHe is an impostor who hath
imposed upon us And he will deliver you from the plague of him
Accordingly they repaired to the King and told him what had passed
saying O King of the age we are perplexed anent this merchant whose
generosity is excessive for he doeth thus and thus and all he
borroweth he giveth away to the poor by handsful Were he a man of
naught his sense would not suffer him to lavish gold on this wise and
were he a man of wealth his good faith had been made manifest to us by
the coming of his baggage but we see none of his luggage although he
avoucheth that he hath a baggagetrain and hath preceded it Now some
time hath past but there appeareth no sign of his baggagetrain and he
oweth us sixty thousand gold pieces all of which he hath given away in
alms And they went on to praise him and extol his generosity Now this
King was a very covetous man a more covetous than Ashab and when
he heard tell of Maarufs generosity and openhandedness greed of gain
got the better of him and he said to his Wazir Were not this merchant
a man of immense wealth he had not shown all this munificence His
baggagetrain will assuredly come whereupon these merchants will flock
to him and he will scatter amongst them riches galore Now I have more
right to this money than they wherefore I have a mind to make friends
with him and profess affection for him so that when his baggage cometh
whatso the merchants would have had I shall get of him and I will give
him my daughter to wife and join his wealth to my wealth Replied the
Wazir O King of the age methinks he is naught but an impostor and
tis the impostor who ruineth the house of the covetousAnd Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say

        Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninetythird Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Wazir
said to the King Methinks he is naught but an impostor and tis the
impostor who ruineth the house of the covetous the King said O
Wazir I will prove him and soon know if he be an impostor or a true man
and whether he be a rearling of Fortune or not The Wazir asked And
how wilt thou prove him and the King answered I will send for him
to the presence and entreat him with honour and give him a jewel which I
have An he know it and wot its price he is a man of worth and wealth
but an he know it not he is an impostor and an upstart and I will do
him die by the foulest fashion of deaths So he sent for Maaruf who
came and saluted him The King returned his salam and seating him beside
himself said to him Art thou the merchant Maaruf and said he
Yes Quoth the King The merchants declare that thou owest them sixty
thousand ducats Is this true Yes quoth he Asked the King Then
why dost thou not give them their money and he answered Let them
wait till my baggage come and I will repay them twofold An they wish
for gold they shall have gold and should they wish for silver they
shall have silver or an they prefer for merchandise I will give them
merchandise and to whom I owe a thousand I will give two thousand in
requital of that wherewith he hath veiled my face before the poor for I
have plenty Then said the King O merchant take this and look what
is its kind and value And he gave him a jewel the bigness of a
hazelnut which he had bought for a thousand sequins and not having its
fellow prized it highly Maaruf took it and pressing it between his
thumb and forefinger brake it for it was brittle and would not brook
the squeeze Quoth the King Why hast thou broken the jewel and
Maaruf laughed and said O King of the age this is no jewel This is
but a bittock of mineral worth a thousand dinars why dost thou style it
a jewel A jewel I call such as is worth threescore and ten thousand
gold pieces and this is called but a piece of stone A jewel that is not
of the bigness of a walnut hath no worth in my eyes and I take no
account thereof How cometh it then that thou who art King stylest
this thing a jewel when tis but a bit of mineral worth a thousand
dinars But ye are excusable for that ye are poor folk and have not in
your possession things of price The King asked O merchant hast thou
jewels such as those whereof thou speakest and he answered Plenty
Whereupon avarice overcame the King and he said Wilt thou give me real
jewels Said Maaruf When my baggagetrain shall come I will give
thee no end of jewels and all that thou canst desire I have in plenty
and will give thee without price At this the King rejoiced and said
to the traders Wend your ways and have patience with him till his
baggage arrive when do ye come to me and receive your monies from me
So they fared forth and the King turned to his Wazir and said to him
Pay court to Merchant Maaruf and take and give with him in talk and
bespeak him of my daughter Princess Duny that he may wed her and so
we gain these riches he hath Said the Wazir O King of the age this
mans fashion misliketh me and methinks he is an impostor and a liar so
leave this whereof thou speakest lest thou lose thy daughter for
naught Now this Minister had sued the King aforetime to give him his
daughter to wife and he was willing to do so but when she heard of it
she consented not to marry him Accordingly the King said to him O
traitor thou desirest no good for me because in past time thou
soughtest my daughter in wedlock but she would none of thee so now
thou wouldst cut off the way of her marriage and wouldst have the
Princess lie fallow that thou mayst take her but hear from me one
word Thou hast no concern in this matter How can he be an impostor and
a liar seeing that he knew the price of the jewel even that for which
I bought it and brake it because it pleased him not He hath jewels in
plenty and when he goeth in to my daughter and seeth her to be
beautiful she will captivate his reason and he will love her and give
her jewels and things of price but as for thee thou wouldst forbid my
daughter and myself these good things So the Minister was silent for
fear of the Kings anger and said to himself Set the curs on the
cattle Then with show of friendly bias he betook himself to
Maaruf and said to him His highness the King loveth thee and hath a
daughter a winsome lady and a lovesome to whom he is minded to marry
thee What sayst thou Said he No harm in that but let him wait till
my baggage come for marriagesettlements on Kings daughters are large
and their rank demandeth that they be not endowed save with a dowry
befitting their degree At this present I have no money with me till the
coming of my baggage for I have wealth in plenty and needs must I make
her marriageportion five thousand purses Then I shall need a thousand
purses to distribute amongst the poor and needy on my weddingnight and
other thousand to give to those who walk in the bridal procession and
yet other thousand wherewith to provide provaunt for the troops and
others and I shall want an hundred jewels to give to the Princess
on the weddingmorning and other hundred gems to distribute among
the slavegirls and eunuchs for I must give each of them a jewel in
honour of the bride and I need wherewithal to clothe a thousand naked
paupers and alms too needs must be given All this cannot be done till
my baggage come but I have plenty and once it is here I shall make no
account of all this outlay The Wazir returned to the King and told him
what Maaruf said whereupon quoth he Since this is his wish how
canst thou style him impostor and liar Replied the Minister And I
cease not to say this But the King chid him angrily and threatened
him saying By the life of my head an thou cease not this talk I
will slay thee Go back to him and fetch him to me and I will manage
matters with him myself So the Wazir returned to Maaruf and said to
him Come and speak with the King I hear and I obey said Maaruf
and went in to the King who said to him Thou shalt not put me off
with these excuses for my treasury is full so take the keys and spend
all thou needest and give what thou wilt and clothe the poor and do thy
desire and have no care for the girl and the handmaids When the baggage
shall come do what thou wilt with thy wife by way of generosity and
we will have patience with thee anent the marriageportion till then
for there is no manner of difference betwixt me and thee none at all
Then he sent for the Shaykh AlIslam and bade him write out the
marriagecontract between his daughter and Merchant Maaruf and he did
so after which the King gave the signal for beginning the wedding
festivities and bade decorate the city The kettle drums beat and the
tables were spread with meats of all kinds and there came performers who
paraded their tricks Merchant Maaruf sat upon a throne in a parlour
and the players and gymnasts and effeminates and dancingmen of
wondrous movements and posturemakers of marvellous cunning came before
him whilst he called out to the treasurer and said to him Bring gold
and silver So he brought gold and silver and Maaruf went round among
the spectators and largessed each performer by the handful and he gave
alms to the poor and needy and clothes to the naked and it was a
clamorous festival and a right merry The treasurer could not bring
money fast enough from the treasury and the Wazirs heart was like to
burst for rage but he dared not say a word whilst Merchant Ali
marvelled at this waste of wealth and said to Merchant Maaruf Allah
and the Hallows visit this upon thy headsides Doth it not suffice
thee to squander the traders money but thou must squander that of the
King to boot Replied Maaruf Tis none of thy concern whenas my
baggage shall come I will requite the King manifold And he went on
lavishing money and saying in himself A burning plague What will
happen will happen and there is no flying from that which is
foreordained The festivities ceased not for the space of forty days
and on the oneandfortieth day they made the brides cortge and all
the Emirs and troops walked before her When they brought her in before
Maaruf he began scattering gold on the peoples heads and they made
her a mighty fine procession whilst Maaruf expended in her honour vast
sums of money Then they brought him in to Princess Dunya and he sat
down on the high divan after which they let fall the curtains and shut
the doors and withdrew leaving him alone with his bride whereupon he
smote hand upon hand and sat awhile sorrowful and saying There is no
Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great
Quoth the Princess O my lord Allah preserve thee What aileth thee
that thou art troubled Quoth he And how should I be other than
troubled seeing that thy father hath embarrassed me and done with me a
deed which is like the burning of green corn She asked And what hath
my father done with thee Tell me and he answered He hath brought
me in to thee before the coming of my baggage and I want at very least
an hundred jewels to distribute among thy handmaids to each a jewel so
she might rejoice therein and say My lord gave me a jewel on the night
of his going in to my lady This good deed would I have done in honour
of thy station and for the increase of thy dignity and I have no need
to stint myself in lavishing jewels for I have of them great plenty
Rejoined she Be not concerned for that As for me trouble not thyself
about me for I will have patience with thee till thy baggage shall
come and as for my women have no care for them Rise doff thy clothes
and take thy pleasure and when the baggage cometh we shall get the
jewels and the rest So he arose and putting off his clothes sat down
on the bed and sought loveliesse and they fell to toying with each
other He laid his hand on her knee and she sat down in his lap and
thrust her lip like a titbit of meat into his mouth and that hour was
such as maketh a man to forget his father and his mother So he clasped
her in his arms and strained her fast to his breast and sucked her lip
till the honeydew ran out into his mouth and he laid his hand under
her leftarmpit whereupon his vitals and her vitals yearned for
coition Then he clapped her between the breasts and his hand slipped
down between her thighs and she girded him with her legs whereupon he
made of the two parts proof amain and crying out O sire of the
chinveils twain applied the priming and kindled the match and set
it to the touchhole and gave fire and breached the citadel in its four
corners so there befel the mystery concerning which there is no
enquiry and she cried the cry that needs must be criedAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninetyfourth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that while the
Princess Dunya cried the cry which must be cried Merchant Maaruf
abated her maidenhead and that night was one not to be counted among
lives for that which it comprised of the enjoyment of the fair clipping
and dallying langue fourre and futtering till the dawn of day when
he arose and entered the Hammam whence after donning a suit for sovrans
suitable he betook himself to the Kings Divan All who were there rose
to him and received him with honour and worship giving him joy and
invoking blessings upon him and he sat down by the Kings side and
asked Where is the treasurer They answered Here he is before
thee and he said to him Bring robes of honour for all the Wazirs and
Emirs and dignitaries and clothe them therewith The treasurer brought
him all he sought and he sat giving to all who came to him and lavishing
largesse upon every man according to his station On this wise he abode
twenty days whilst no baggage appeared for him nor aught else till the
treasurer was straitened by him to the uttermost and going in to the
King as he sat alone with the Wazir in Maarufs absence kissed ground
between his hands and said O King of the age I must tell thee
somewhat lest haply thou blame me for not acquainting thee therewith
Know that the treasury is being exhausted there is none but a little
money left in it and in ten days more we shall shut it upon emptiness
Quoth the King O Wazir verily my soninlaws baggagetrain tarrieth
long and there appeareth no news thereof The Minister laughed and
said Allah be gracious to thee O King of the age Thou art none other
but heedless with respect to this impostor this liar As thy head
liveth there is no baggage for him no nor a burning plague to rid us
of him Nay he hath but imposed on thee without surcease so that he
hath wasted thy treasures and married thy daughter for naught How long
therefore wilt thou be heedless of this liar Then quoth the King O
Wazir how shall we do to learn the truth of his case and quoth the
Wazir O King of the age none may come at a mans secret but his wife
so send for thy daughter and let her come behind the curtain that I may
question her of the truth of his estate to the intent that she may make
question of him and acquaint us with his case Cried the King There
is no harm in that and as my head liveth if it be proved that he is a
liar and an impostor I will verily do him die by the foulest of
deaths Then he carried the Wazir into the sittingchamber and sent for
his daughter who came behind the curtain her husband being absent and
said What wouldst thou O my father Said he Speak with the Wazir
So she asked Ho thou the Wazir what is thy will and he answered
O my lady thou must know that thy husband hath squandered thy fathers
substance and married thee without a dower and he ceaseth not to
promise us and break his promises nor cometh there any tidings of his
baggage in short we would have thee inform us concerning him Quoth
she Indeed his words be many and he still cometh and promiseth me
jewels and treasures and costly stuffs but I see nothing Quoth the
Wazir O my lady canst thou this night take and give with him in talk
and whisper to himSay me sooth and fear from me naught for thou art
become my husband and I will not transgress against thee So tell me the
truth of the matter and I will devise thee a device whereby thou shalt
be set at rest And do thou play near and far with him in words and
profess love to him and win him to confess and after tell us the facts
of his case And she answered O my papa I know how I will make proof
of him Then she went away and after supper her husband came in to her
according to his wont whereupon Princess Dunya rose to him and took him
under the armpit and wheedled him with winsomest wheedling and
allsufficient are womans wiles whenas she would aught of men and
she ceased not to caress him and beguile him with speech sweeter than
the honey till she stole his reason and when she saw that he altogether
inclined to her she said to him O my beloved O coolth of my eyes and
fruit of my vitals Allah never desolate me by less of thee nor Time
sunder us twain me and thee Indeed the love of thee hath homed in my
heart and the fire of passion hath consumed my liver nor will I ever
forsake thee or transgress against thee But I would have thee tell me
the truth for that the sleights of falsehood profit not nor do they
secure credit at all seasons How long wilt thou impose upon my father
and lie to him I fear lest thine affair be discovered to him ere we
can devise some device and he lay violent hands upon thee So acquaint
me with the facts of the case for naught shall befal thee save that
which shall begladden thee and when thou shalt have spoken sooth fear
not harm shall betide thee How often wilt thou declare that thou art a
merchant and a man of money and hast a luggagetrain This long while
past thou sayest My baggage my baggage but there appeareth no sign of
thy baggage and visible in thy face is anxiety on this account So an
there be no worth in thy words tell me and I will contrive thee a
contrivance whereby thou shalt come off safe Inshallah He replied I
will tell thee the truth and then do thou whatso thou wilt Rejoined
she Speak and look thou speak soothly for sooth is the ark of safety
and beware of lying for it dishonoureth the liar and Godgifted is he
who said

 Ware that truth thou speak albe sooth when said  Shall cause thee in
    threatend fire to fall
 And seek Allahs approof for most foolish he  Who shall anger his Lord
    to make friends with thrall

He said Know then O my lady that I am no merchant and have no
baggage no nor a burning plague nay I was but a cobbler in my own
country and had a wife called Fatimah the Dung with whom there befel me
this and that And he told her his story from beginning to end whereat
she laughed and said Verily thou art clever in the practice of lying
and imposture Whereto he answered O my lady may Allah Almighty
preserve thee to veil sins and countervail chagrins Rejoined she
Know that thou imposedst upon my sire and deceivedst him by dint of
thy deluding vaunts so that of his greed for gain he married me to
thee Then thou squanderedst his wealth and the Wazir beareth thee a
grudge for this How many a time hath he spoken against thee to my
father saying Indeed he is an impostor a liar But my sire hearkened
not to his say for that he had sought me in wedlock and I consented not
that he be baron and I femme However the time grew longsome upon my
sire and he became straitened and said to me Make him confess So I
have made thee confess and that which was covered is discovered Now my
father purposeth thee a mischief because of this but thou art become my
husband and I will never transgress against thee An I told my father
what I have learnt from thee he would be certified of thy falsehood and
imposture and that thou imposest upon Kings daughters and squanderest
royal wealth so would thine offence find with him no pardon and he
would slay thee sans a doubt wherefore it would be bruited among the
folk that I married a man who was a liar an impostor and this would
smirch mine honour Furthermore an he kill thee most like he will
require me to wed another and to such thing I will never consent no
not though I die So rise now and don a Mamelukes dress and take
these fifty thousand dinars of my monies and mount a swift steed and
get thee to a land whither the rule of my father doth not reach Then
make thee a merchant and send me a letter by a courier who shall bring
it privily to me that I may know in what land thou art so I may send
thee all my hand can attain Thus shall thy wealth wax great and if my
father die I will send for thee and thou shalt return in respect and
honour and if we die thou or I and go to the mercy of God the Most
Great the Resurrection shall unite us This then is the rede that is
right and while we both abide alive and well I will not cease to send
thee letters and monies Arise ere the day wax bright and thou be in
perplexed plight and perdition upon thy head alight Quoth he O my
lady I beseech thee of thy favour to bid me farewell with thine
embracement and quoth she No harm in that So he embraced her
and knew her carnally after which he made the Ghuslablution then
donning the dress of a white slave he bade the syces saddle him a
thoroughbred steed Accordingly they saddled him a courser and he
mounted and farewelling his wife rode forth the city at the last of the
night whilst all who saw him deemed him one of the Mamelukes of the
Sultan going abroad on some business Next morning the King and his
Wazir repaired to the sittingchamber and sent for Princess Dunya who
came behind the curtain and her father said to her O my daughter
what sayst thou Said she I say Allah blacken thy Wazirs face
because he would have blackened my face in my husbands eyes Asked the
King How so and she answered He came in to me yesterday but
before I could name the matter to him behold in walked Faraj the Chief
Eunuch letter in hand and saidTen white slaves stand under the
palace window and have given me this letter sayingKiss for us the
hands of our lord Merchant Maaruf and give him this letter for we
are of his Mamelukes with the baggage and it hath reached us that he
hath wedded the Kings daughter so we are come to acquaint him with
that which befel us by the way Accordingly I took the letter and read
as followsFrom the five hundred Mamelukes to his highness our lord
Merchant Maaruf But further We give thee to know that after thou
quittedst us the Arabs came out upon us and attacked us They were
two thousand horse and we five hundred mounted slaves and there befel a
mighty sore fight between us and them They hindered us from the road
thirty days doing battle with them and this is the cause of our tarrying
from theeAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying
her permitted say


        Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninetyfifth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Princess Dunya
said to her sire My husband received a letter from his dependents
ending withThe Arabs hindered us from the road thirty days which is
the cause of our being behind time They also took from us of the
luggage two hundred loads of cloth and slew of us fifty Mamelukes When
the news reached my husband he cried Allah disappoint them What ailed
them to wage war with the Arabs for the sake of two hundred loads of
merchandise What are two hundred loads It behoved them not to tarry on
that account for verily the value of the two hundred loads is only some
seven thousand dinars But needs must I go to them and hasten them As
for that which the Arabs have taken twill not be missed from the
baggage nor doth it weigh with me a whit for I reckon it as if I had
given it to them by way of an alms Then he went down from me laughing
and taking no concern for the wastage of his wealth nor the slaughter of
his slaves As soon as he was gone I looked out from the lattice and
saw the ten Mamelukes who had brought him the letter as they were
moons each clad in a suit of clothes worth two thousand dinars there
is not with my father a chattel to match one of them He went forth with
them to bring up his baggage and hallowed be Allah who hindered me from
saying to him aught of that thou badest me for he would have made mock
of me and thee and haply he would have eyed me with the eye of
disparagement and hated me But the fault is all with thy Wazir who
speaketh against my husband words that besit him not Replied the King
O my daughter thy husbands wealth is indeed endless and he recketh
not of it for from the day he entered our city he hath done naught
but give alms to the poor Inshallah he will speedily return with the
baggage and good in plenty shall betide us from him And he went on to
appease her and menace the Wazir being duped by her device So fared it
with the King but as regards Merchant Maaruf he rode on into waste
lands perplexed and knowing not to what quarter he should betake him
and for the anguish of parting he lamented and in the pangs of passion
and lovelonging he recited these couplets

 Time falsed our Union and divided who were one in tway  And the sore
    tyranny of Time doth melt my heart away
 Mine eyes neer cease to drop the tear for parting with my dear  When
    shall Disunion come to end and dawn the Unionday
 O favour like the full moons face of sheen indeed Im he  Whom thou
    didst leave with vitals torn when faring on thy way
 Would I had never seen thy sight or met thee for an hour  Since after
    sweetest taste of thee to bitters Im a prey

 Maaruf will never cease to be enthralled by Dunys charms  And
    long live she albe he die whom love and longing slay
 O brilliance like resplendent sun of noontide deign them heal  His
    heart for kindness and the fire of longing love allay
 Would Heaven I wot an eer the days shall deign conjoin our lots  Join
    us in pleasant talk o nights in Union glad and gay
 Shall my loves palace hold two hearts that savour joy and I  Strain
    to my breast the branch I saw upon the sandhill sway
 O favour of full moon in sheen never may sun o thee  Surcease to rise
    from Eastern rim with allenlightening ray
 Im well content with passionpine and all its bane and bate  For luck
    in love is evermore the butt of jealous Fate

And when he ended his verses he wept with sore weeping for indeed the
ways were walled up before his face and death seemed to him better than
dreeing life and he walked on like a drunken man for stress of
distraction and stayed not till noontide when he came to a little town
and saw a plougher hard by ploughing with a yoke of bulls Now hunger
was sore upon him and he went up to the ploughman and said to him
Peace be with thee and he returned his salam and said to him
Welcome O my lord Art thou one of the Sultans Mamelukes Quoth
Maaruf Yes and the other said Alight with me for a guestmeal
Whereupon Maaruf knew him to be of the liberal and said to him O my
brother I see with thee naught with which thou mayst feed me how is
it then that thou invitest me Answered the husbandman O my lord
weal is well nigh Dismount thee here the town is near hand and I
will go and fetch thee dinner and fodder for thy stallion Rejoined
Maaruf Since the town is near at hand I can go thither as quickly as
thou canst and buy me what I have a mind to in the bazar and eat The
peasant replied O my lord the place is but a little village and
there is no bazar there neither selling nor buying So I conjure thee
by Allah alight here with me and hearten my heart and I will run
thither and return to thee in haste Accordingly he dismounted and the
Fellah left him and went off to the village to fetch dinner for him
whilst Maaruf sat awaiting him Presently he said in himself I have
taken this poor man away from his work but I will arise and plough in
his stead till he come back to make up for having hindered him from
his work Then he took the plough and starting the bulls ploughed
a little till the share struck against something and the beasts
stopped He goaded them on but they could not move the plough so he
looked at the share and finding it caught in a ring of gold cleared
away the soil and saw that it was set centremost a slab of alabaster
the size of the nether millstone He strave at the stone till he pulled
it from its place when there appeared beneath it a souterrain with a
stair Presently he descended the flight of steps and came to a place
like a Hammam with four dases the first full of gold from floor to
roof the second full of emeralds and pearls and coral also from ground
to ceiling the third of jacinths and rubies and turquoises and the
fourth of diamonds and all manner other preciousest stones At the upper
end of the place stood a coffer of clearest crystal full of uniongems
each the size of a walnut and upon the coffer lay a casket of gold the
bigness of a lemon When he saw this he marvelled and rejoiced with joy
exceeding and said to himself I wonder what is in this casket So he
opened it and found therein a sealring of gold whereon were graven
names and talismans as they were the tracks of creeping ants He rubbed
the ring and behold a voice said Adsum Here am I at thy service O
my lord Ask and it shall be given unto thee Wilt thou raise a city or
ruin a capital or kill a king or dig a riverchannel or aught of the
kind Whatso thou seekest it shall come to pass by leave of the King
of Allmight Creator of day and night Maaruf asked O creature of
my lord who and what art thou and the other answered I am the
slave of this sealring standing in the service of him who possesseth
it Whatsoever he seeketh that I accomplish for him and I have no
excuse in neglecting that he biddeth me do because I am Sultan over
twoandseventy tribes of the Jinn each twoandseventy thousand in

        Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninetysixth Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the
Slave of the Signetring acquainted Maaruf with his case the Merchant
asked him What is thy name and the Jinni answered My name is Ab
alSadt Quoth Maaruf O Abu alSaadat what is this place and
who enchanted thee in this casket and quoth he O my lord this is a
treasure called the Hoard of Shaddd son of Ad him who the base of
Manycolumned Iram laid the like of which in the lands was never
made I was his slave in his lifetime and this is his Sealring
which he laid up in his treasure but it hath fallen to thy lot
Maaruf enquired Canst thou transport that which is in this hoard to
the surface of the earth and the Jinni replied Yes Nothing were
easier Said Maaruf Bring it forth and leave naught So the Jinni
signed with his hand to the ground which clave asunder and he sank and
was absent a little while Presently there came forth young boys full
of grace and fair of face bearing golden baskets filled with gold which
they emptied out and going away returned with more nor did they cease
to transport the gold and jewels till ere an hour had sped they said
Naught is left in the hoard Thereupon out came Abu alSaadat and
said to Maaruf O my lord thou seest that we have brought forth all
that was in the hoard Maaruf asked Who be these beautiful boys
and the Jinni answered They are my sons This matter merited not that
I should muster for it the Marids wherefore my sons have done thy
desire and are honoured by such service So ask what thou wilt beside
this Quoth Maaruf Canst thou bring me hemules and chests and fill
the chests with the treasure and load them on the mules Quoth Abu
alSaadat Nothing easier and cried a great cry whereupon his sons
presented themselves before him to the number of eight hundred and he
said to them Let some of you take the semblance of hemules and others
of muleteers and handsome Mamelukes the like of the least of whom is
not found with any of the Kings and others of you be transmewed to
muleteers and the rest to menials So seven hundred of them changed
themselves into btmules and other hundred took the shape of slaves
Then Abu alSaadat called upon his Marids who presented themselves
between his hands and he commanded some of them to assume the aspect of
horses saddled with saddles of gold crusted with jewels And when
Maaruf saw them do as he bade he cried Where be the chests They
brought them before him and he said Pack the gold and the stones each
sort by itself So they packed them and loaded three hundred hemules
with them Then asked Maaruf O Abu alSaadat canst thou bring me
some loads of costly stuffs and the Jinni answered Wilt thou have
Egyptian stuffs or Syrian or Persian or Indian or Greek Maaruf said
Bring me an hundred loads of each kind on five hundred mules and Abu
alSaadat O my lord accord me delay that I may dispose my Marids for
this and send a company of them to each country to fetch an hundred
loads of its stuffs and then take the form of hemules and return
carrying the stuffs Maaruf enquired What time dost thou want and
Abu alSaadat replied The time of the blackness of the night and day
shall not dawn ere thou have all thou desirest Said Maaruf I grant
thee this time and bade them pitch him a pavilion So they pitched it
and he sat down therein and they brought him a table of food Then said
Abu alSaadat to him O my lord tarry thou in this tent and these my
sons shall guard thee so fear thou nothing for I go to muster my
Marids and despatch them to do thy desire So saying he departed
leaving Maaruf seated in the pavilion with the table before him and
the Jinnis sons attending upon him in the guise of slaves and servants
and suite And while he sat in this state behold up came the
husbandman with a great porringer of lentils and a nosebag full of
barley and seeing the pavilion pitched and the Mamelukes standing hands
upon breasts thought that the Sultan was come and had halted on that
stead So he stood openmouthed and said in himself Would I had killed
a couple of chickens and fried them red with clarified cowbutter for
the Sultan And he would have turned back to kill the chickens as a
regale for the Sultan but Maaruf saw him and cried out to him and said
to the Mamelukes Bring him hither So they brought him and his
porringer of lentils before Maaruf who said to him What is this
Said the peasant This is thy dinner and thy horses fodder Excuse me
for I thought not that the Sultan would come hither and had I known
that I would have killed a couple of chickens and entertained him in
goodly guise Quoth Maaruf The Sultan is not come I am his
soninlaw and I was vexed with him However he hath sent his officers
to make his peace with me and now I am minded to return to city But
thou hast made me this guestmeal without knowing me and I accept it
from thee lentils though it be and will not eat save of thy cheer
Accordingly he bade him set the porringer amiddlemost the table and ate
of it his sufficiency whilst the Fellah filled his belly with those
rich meats Then Maaruf washed his hands and gave the Mamelukes leave
to eat so they fell upon the remains of the meal and ate and when the
porringer was empty he filled it with gold and gave it to the peasant
saying Carry this to thy dwelling and come to me in the city and I
will entreat thee with honour Thereupon the peasant took the porringer
full of gold and returned to the village driving the bulls before him
and deeming himself akin to the King Meanwhile they brought Maaruf
girls of the Brides of the Treasure who smote on instruments of
music and danced before him and he passed that night in joyance and
delight a night not to be reckoned among lives Hardly had dawned the
day when there arose a great cloud of dust which presently lifting
discovered seven hundred mules laden with stuffs and attended by
muleteers and baggagetenders and cressetbearers With them came Abu
alSaadat riding on a shemule in the guise of a caravanleader and
before him was a travellinglitter with four cornerterminals of
glittering red gold set with gems When Abu alSaadat came up to the
tent he dismounted and kissing the earth said to Maaruf O my lord
thy desire hath been done to the uttermost and in the litter is a
treasuresuit which hath not its match among Kings raiment so don it
and mount the litter and bid us do what thou wilt Quoth Maaruf O
Abu alSaadat I wish thee to go to the city of Ikhtiyan alKhutan and
present thyself to my fatherinlaw the King and go thou not in to him
but in the guise of a mortal courier and quoth he To hear is to
obey So Maaruf wrote a letter to the Sultan and sealed it and Abu
alSaadat took it and set out with it and when he arrived he found
the King saying O Wazir indeed my heart is concerned for my
soninlaw and I fear lest the Arabs slay him Would Heaven I wot
whither he was bound that I might have followed him with the troops
Would he had told me his destination Said the Wazir Allah be
merciful to thee for this thy heedlessness As thy head liveth the
wight saw that we were awake to him and feared dishonour and fled for
he is nothing but an impostor a liar And behold at this moment in
came the courier and kissing ground before the King wished him
permanent glory and prosperity and length of life Asked the King Who
art thou and what is thy business I am a courier answered the
Jinni and thy soninlaw who is come with the baggage sendeth me to
thee with a letter and here it is So he took the letter and read
therein these words After salutations galore to our uncle the
glorious King Know that I am at hand with the baggagetrain so come
thou forth to meet me with the troops Cried the King Allah blacken
thy brow O Wazir How often wilt thou defame my soninlaws name and
call him liar and impostor Behold he is come with the baggagetrain
and thou art naught but a traitor The Minister hung his head
groundwards in shame and confusion and replied O King of the age I
said not this save because of the long delay of the baggage and because
I feared the loss of the wealth he hath wasted The King exclaimed O
traitor what are my riches Now that his baggage is come he will give
me great plenty in their stead Then he bade decorate the city and
going in to his daughter said to her Good news for thee Thy husband
will be here anon with his baggage for he hath sent me a letter to that
effect and here am I now going forth to meet him The Princess Dunya
marvelled at this and said in herself This is a wondrous thing Was he
laughing at me and making mock of me or had he a mind to try me when
he told me that he was a pauper But Alhamdolillah Glory to God for
that I failed not of my duty to him On this wise fared it in the
Palace but as regards Merchant Ali the Cairene when he saw the
decoration of the city and asked the cause thereof they said to him
The baggagetrain of Merchant Maaruf the Kings soninlaw is come
Said he Allah is Almighty What a calamity is this man He came to
me fleeing from his wife and he was a poor man Whence then should he
get a baggagetrain But haply this is a device which the Kings
daughter hath contrived for him fearing his disgrace and Kings are not
unable to do anything May Allah the Most High veil his fame and not
bring him to public shameAnd Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say


       Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninetyseventh Night

She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Merchant
Ali asked the cause of the decorations they told him the truth of the
case so he blessed Merchant Maaruf and cried May Allah Almighty veil
his fame and not bring him to public shame And all the merchants
rejoiced and were glad for that they would get their monies Then the
King assembled his troops and rode forth whilst Abu alSaadat returned
to Maaruf and acquainted him with the delivering of the letter Quoth
Maaruf Bind on the loads and when they had done so he donned the
treasuresuit and mounting the litter became a thousand times greater
and more majestic than the King Then he set forward but when he had
gone halfway behold the King met him with the troops and seeing him
riding in the Takhtrawan and clad in the dress aforesaid threw himself
upon him and saluted him and giving him joy of his safety greeted him
with the greeting of peace Then all the Lords of the land saluted him
and it was made manifest that he had spoken the truth and that in him
there was no lie Presently he entered the city in such state procession
as would have caused the gallbladder of the lion to burst for envy
and the traders pressed up to him and kissed his hands whilst Merchant
Ali said to him Thou hast played off this trick and it hath prospered
to thy hand O Shaykh of Impostors But thou deservest it and may Allah
the Most High increase thee of His bounty whereupon Maaruf laughed
Then he entered the palace and sitting down on the throne said Carry
the loads of gold into the treasury of my uncle the King and bring me
the bales of cloth So they brought them to him and opened them before
him bale after bale till they had unpacked the seven hundred loads
whereof he chose out the best and said Bear these to Princess Dunya
that she may distribute them among her slavegirls and carry her also
this coffer of jewels that she may divide them among her handmaids and
eunuchs Then he proceeded to make over to the merchants in whose debt
he was stuffs by way of payment for their arrears giving him whose due
was a thousand stuffs worth two thousand or more after which he fell
to distributing to the poor and needy whilst the King looked on with
greedy eyes and could not hinder him nor did he cease largesse till he
had made an end of the seven hundred loads when he turned to the troops
and proceeded to apportion amongst them emeralds and rubies and pearls
and coral and other jewels by handsful without count till the King
said to him Enough of this giving O my son There is but little left
of the baggage But he said I have plenty Then indeed his good
faith was become manifest and none could give him the lie and he had
come to reck not of giving for that the Slave of the Sealring brought
him whatsoever he sought Presently the treasurer came in to the King
and said O King of the age the treasury is full indeed and will not
hold the rest of the loads Where shall we lay that which is left of the
gold and jewels And he assigned to him another place As for the
Princess Dunya when she saw this her joy redoubled and she marvelled
and said in herself Would I wot how came he by all this wealth In
like manner the traders rejoiced in that which he had given them and
blessed him whilst Merchant Ali marvelled and said to himself I
wonder how he hath lied and swindled that he hath gotten him all these
treasures Had they come from the Kings daughter he had not wasted
them on this wise But how excellent is his saying who said

 When the Kings King giveth in reverence pause  And venture not to
    enquire the cause
 Allah gives His gifts unto whom He will  So respect and abide by His
    Holy Laws

So far concerning him but as regards the King he also marvelled with
passing marvel at that which he saw of Maarufs generosity and
openhandedness in the largesse of wealth Then the Merchant went in to
his wife who met him smiling and laughinglipped and kissed his hand
saying Didst thou mock me or hadst thou a mind to prove me with thy
sayingI am a poor man and a fugitive from my wife Praised be Allah
for that I failed not of my duty to thee For thou art my beloved and
there is none dearer to me than thou whether thou be rich or poor But
I would have thee tell me what didst thou design by these words Said
Maaruf I wished to prove thee and see whether thy love were sincere
or for the sake of wealth and the greed of worldly good But now tis
become manifest to me that thine affection is sincere and as thou art a
true woman so welcome to thee I know thy worth Then he went apart
into a place by himself and rubbed the sealring whereupon Abu
alSaadat presented himself and said to him Adsum at thy service
Ask what thou wilt Quoth Maaruf I want a treasuresuit and
treasuretrinkets for my wife including a necklace of forty unique
jewels Quoth the Jinni To hear is to obey and brought him what he
sought whereupon Maaruf dismissed him and carrying the dress and
ornaments in to his wife laid them before her and said Take these and
put them on and welcome When she saw this her wits fled for joy and
she found among the ornaments a pair of anklets of gold set with jewels
of the handiwork of the magicians and bracelets and earrings and a
belt such as no money could buy So she donned the dress and
ornaments and said to Maaruf O my lord I will treasure these up for
holidays and festivals But he answered Wear them always for I have
others in plenty And when she put them on and her women beheld her
they rejoiced and bussed his hands Then he left them and going apart by
himself rubbed the sealring whereupon its slave appeared and he said
to him Bring me an hundred suits of apparel with their ornaments of
gold Hearing and obeying answered Abu al Saadat and brought him
the hundred suits each with its ornaments wrapped up within it Maaruf
took them and called aloud to the slavegirls who came to him and he
gave them each a suit so they donned them and became like the
blackeyed girls of Paradise whilst the Princess Dunya shone amongst
them as the moon among the stars One of the handmaids told the King of
this and he came in to his daughter and saw her and her women dazzling
all who beheld them whereat he wondered with passing wonderment Then
he went out and calling his Wazir said to him O Wazir such and such
things have happened what sayst thou now of this affair Said he O
King of the age this be no merchants fashion for a merchant keepeth a
piece of linen by him for years and selleth it not but at a profit How
should a merchant have generosity such as this generosity and whence
should he get the like of these monies and jewels of which but a slight
matter is found with the Kings So how should loads thereof be found
with merchants Needs must there be a cause for this but an thou wilt
hearken to me I will make the truth of the case manifest to thee
Answered the King O Wazir I will do thy bidding Rejoined the
Minister Do thou foregather with thy soninlaw and make a show of
affect to him and talk with him and sayO my soninlaw I have a mind
to go I and thou and the Wazir but no more to a flowergarden that we
may take our pleasure there When we come to the garden we will set on
the table wine and I will ply him therewith and compel him to drink
for when he shall have drunken he will lose his reason and his
judgment will forsake him Then we will question him of the truth of his
case and he will discover to us his secrets for wine is a traitor and
Allahgifted is he who said

 When we drank the wine and it crept its way  To the place of Secrets
    I cried O stay
 In my fear lest its influence stint my wits  And my friends spy matters
    that hidden lay

When he hath told us the truth we shall ken his case and may deal with
him as we will because I fear for thee the consequences of this his
present fashion haply he will covet the kingship and win over the
troops by generosity and lavishing money and so depose thee and take the
kingdom from thee True answered the KingAnd Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say


       Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninetyeighth Night

She resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Wazir
devised this device the King said to him Thou hast spoken sooth and
they passed the night on this agreement And when morning morrowed the
King went forth and sat in the guestchamber when lo and behold the
grooms and servingmen came in to him in dismay Quoth he What hath
befallen you and quoth they O King of the age the Syces curried
the horses and foddered them and the hemules which brought the baggage
but when we arose in the morning we found that thy soninlaws
Mamelukes had stolen the horses and mules We searched the stables but
found neither horse nor mule so we entered the lodging of the Mamelukes
and found none there nor know we how they fled The King marvelled at
this unknowing that the horses and Mamelukes were all Ifrits the
subjects of the Slave of the Spell and asked the grooms O accursed
how could a thousand beasts and five hundred slaves and servants flee
without your knowledge Answered they We know not how it happened
and he cried Go and when your lord cometh forth of the Harim tell
him the case So they went out from before the King and sat down
bewildered till Maaruf came out and seeing them chagrined enquired of
them What may be the matter They told him all that had happened and
he said What is their worth that ye should be concerned for them Wend
your ways And he sat laughing and was neither angry nor grieved
concerning the case whereupon the King looked in the Wazirs face and
said to him What manner of man is this with whom wealth is of no
worth Needs must there be a reason for this Then they talked with him
awhile and the King said to him O my soninlaw I have a mind to go
I thou and the Wazir to a garden where we may divert ourselves No
harm in that said Maaruf So they went forth to a flowergarden
wherein every sort of fruit was of kinds twain and its waters were
flowing and its trees towering and its birds carolling There they
entered a pavilion whose sight did away sorrow from the soul and sat
talking whilst the Minister entertained them with rare tales and quoted
merry quips and mirthprovoking sayings and Maaruf attentively
listened till the time of dinner came when they set on a tray of meats
and a flagon of wine When they had eaten and washed hands the Wazir
filled the cup and gave it to the King who drank it off then he filled
a second and handed it to Maaruf saying Take the cup of the drink to
which Reason boweth neck in reverence Quoth Maaruf What is this O
Wazir and quoth he This is the grizzled virgin and the old maid
long kept at home the giver of joy to hearts whereof saith the
poet

 The feet of sturdy Miscreants went trampling heavy tread  And she
    hath taen a vengeance dire on every Arabs head
 A Kfir youth like fullest moon in darkness hands her round  Whose eyne
    are strongest cause of sin by him inspiritd

And Allahgifted is he who said

 Tis as if wine and he who bears the bowl  Rising to show her charms
    for man to see
 Were dancing undurnSun whose face the moon  Of night adorned with
    stars of Gemini

 So subtle is her essence it would seem  Through every limb like course
    of soul runs she

And how excellent is the saying of the poet

 Slept in mine arms full Moon of brightest blee  Nor did that sun
    eclipse in goblet see
 I nighted spying fire whereto bow down  Magians which bowed from
    ewers lip to me

And that of another

 It runs through every joint of them as runs  The surge of health
    returning to the sick

And yet another

 I marvel at its pressers how they died  And left us aqua vitlymph
    of life

And yet goodlier is the saying of Abu Nowas

 Cease then to blame me for thy blame doth anger bring  And with the
    draught that madded me come medcining
 A yellow girl whose court cures every carking care  Did a stone
    touch it would with joy and glee upspring
 She riseth in her ewer during darkest night  The house with brightest
    sheeniest light illumining
 And going round of youths to whom the world inclines  Neer save
    in whatso way they please their hearts shall wring
 From hand of coynted lass begarbed like yarded lad  Wencher
    and Tribe of Lot alike enamouring
 She comes and say to him who dares claim lore of love  Something hast
    learnt but still theres many another thing

But best of all is the saying of Ibn alMutazz

 On the shaded woody island His showers Allah deign  Shed on Convent
    hight Abdn drop and drip of railing rain
 Oft the breezes of the morning have awakened me therein  When the Dawn
    shows her blaze ere the bird of flight was fain
 And the voices of the monks that with chants awoke the walls 
    Blackfrocked shavelings ever wont the cup amorn to drain
 Mid the throng how many fair with languourkohld eyes  And lids
    enfolding lovely orbs where black on white was lain
 In secret came to see me by shirt of night disguised  In terror and in
    caution ahurrying amain
 Then I rose and spread my cheek like a carpet on his path  In homage
    and with skirts wiped his trail from off the plain
 But threatening disgrace rose the Crescent in the sky  Like the paring
    of a nail yet the light would never wane
 Then happened whatso happened I disdain to kiss and tell  So deem of
    us thy best and with queries never mell

And gifted of God is he who saith

  In the morn I am richest of men  And in joy at good news I start up
  For I look on the liquid gold  And I measure it out by the cup

And how goodly is the saying of the poet

 By Allah this is th only alchemy  All said of other science false we
    see
 Carat of wine on hundredweight of woe  Transmuteth gloomiest grief to
    joy and glee

And that of another

 The glasses are heavy when empty brought  Till we charge them all with
    unmixd wine
 Then so light are they that to fly theyre fain  As bodies lightened by
    soul divine

And yet another

 Winecup and rubywine high worship claim  Dishonour twere to see
    their honour waste
 Bury me when Im dead by side of vine  Whose veins shall moisten
    bones in clay misplaced
 Nor bury me in wold and wild for I  Dread only after death no wine to
    taste

And he ceased not to egg him on to the drink naming to him such of the
virtues of wine as he thought well and reciting to him what occurred to
him of poetry and pleasantries on the subject till Maaruf addressed
himself to sucking the cuplips and cared no longer for aught else The
Wazir ceased not to fill for him and he to drink and enjoy himself and
make merry till his wits wandered and he could not distinguish right
from wrong When the Minister saw that drunkenness had attained in him
to utterest and the bounds transgressed he said to him By Allah O
Merchant Maaruf I admire whence thou gottest these jewels whose like
the Kings of the Chosros possess not In all our lives never saw we a
merchant that had heaped up riches like unto thine or more generous than
thou for thy doings are the doings of Kings and not merchants doings
Wherefore Allah upon thee do thou acquaint me with this that I may
know thy rank and condition And he went on to test him with questions
and cajole him till Maaruf being reft of reason said to him Im
neither merchant nor King and told him his whole story from first to
last Then said the Wazir I conjure thee by Allah O my lord Maaruf
show us the ring that we may see its make So in his drunkenness he
pulled off the ring and said Take it and look upon it The Minister
took it and turning it over said If I rub it will its slave appear
Replied Maaruf Yes Rub it and he will appear to thee and do thou
divert thyself with the sight of him Thereupon the Wazir rubbed the
ring and behold forthright appeared the Jinni and said Adsum at thy
service O my lord Ask and it shall be given to thee Wilt thou ruin a
city or raise a capital or kill a king Whatso thou seekest I will do
for thee sans fail The Wazir pointed to Maaruf and said Take up
yonder wretch and cast him down in the most desolate of desert lands
where he shall find nothing to eat nor drink so he may die of hunger
and perish miserably and none know of him Accordingly the Jinni
snatched him up and flew with him betwixt heaven and earth which when
Maaruf saw he made sure of destruction and wept and said O Abu
alSaadat whither goest thou with me Replied the Jinni I go to
cast thee down in the Desert Quarter O illbred wight of gross
wits Shall one have the like of this talisman and give it to the folk
to gaze at Verily thou deservest that which hath befallen thee and
but that I fear Allah I would let thee fall from a eight of a
thousand fathoms nor shouldst thou reach the earth till the winds had
torn thee to shreds Maaruf was silent and did not again bespeak
him till he reached the Desert Quarter and casting him down there went
away and left him in that horrible placeAnd Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say


        Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninetyninth Night

She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Slave of the
Sealring took up Maaruf and cast him down in the Desert Quarter where
he left him and went his ways So much concerning him but returning to
the Wazir who was now in possession of the talisman he said to the
King How deemest thou now Did I not tell thee that this fellow was a
liar an impostor but thou wouldst not credit me Replied the King
Thou wast in the right O my Wazir Allah grant thee weal But give me
the ring that I may solace myself with the sight The Minister looked
at him angrily and spat in his face saying O lackwits how shall I
give it to thee and abide thy servant after I am become thy master But
I will spare thee no more on life Then he rubbed the sealring and
said to the Slave Take up this illmannered churl and cast him down by
his soninlaw the swindlerman So the Jinni took him up and flew off
with him whereupon quoth the King to him O creature of my Lord what
is my crime Abu alSaadat replied That wot I not but my master
hath commanded me and I cannot cross whoso hath compassed the enchanted
ring Then he flew on with him till he came to the Desert Quarter and
casting him down where he had cast Maaruf left him and returned The
King hearing Maaruf weeping went up to him and acquainted him with his
case and they sat weeping over that which had befallen them and found
neither meat nor drink Meanwhile the Minister after driving
fatherinlaw and soninlaw from the country went forth from the
garden and summoning all the troops held a Divan and told them what he
had done with the King and Maaruf and acquainted them with the affair
of the talisman adding Unless ye make me Sultan over you I will bid
the Slave of the Sealring take you up one and all and cast you down in
the Desert Quarter where you shall die of hunger and thirst They
replied Do us no damage for we accept thee as Sultan over us and will
not anywise gainsay thy bidding So they agreed in their own despite
to his being Sultan over them and he bestowed on them robes of honour
seeking all he had a mind to of Abu alSaadat who brought it to him
forthwith Then he sat down on the throne and the troops did homage to
him and he sent to Princess Dunya the Kings daughter saying Make
thee ready for I mean to come in unto thee this night because I long
for thee with love When she heard this she wept for the case of her
husband and father was grievous to her and sent to him saying Have
patience with me till my period of widowhood be ended then draw up
thy contract of marriage with me and go in to me according to law But
he sent back to say to her I know neither period of widowhood nor to
delay have I a mood and I need not a contract nor know I lawful from
unlawful but needs must I go in unto thee this night She answered him
saying So be it then and welcome to thee but this was a trick on
her part When the answer reached the Wazir he rejoiced and his breast
was broadened for that he was passionately in love with her He bade
set food before all the folk saying Eat this is my bridefeast for
I purpose to go in to the Princess Dunya this night Quoth the Shaykh
alIslam It is not lawful for thee to go in unto her till her days of
widowhood be ended and thou have drawn up thy contract of marriage with
her But he answered I know neither days of widowhood nor other
period so multiply not words on me The Shaykh AlIslam was
silent fearing his mischief and said to the troops Verily this
man is a Kafir a Miscreant and hath neither creed nor religious
conduct As soon as it was evenfall he went in to her and found her
robed in her richest raiment and decked with her goodliest adornments
When she saw him she came to meet him laughing and said A blessed
night But hadst thou slain my father and my husband it had been more
to my mind And he said There is no help but I slay them Then she
made him sit down and began to jest with him and make show of love
caressing him and smiling in his face so that his reason fled but she
cajoled him with her coaxing and cunning only that she might get
possession of the ring and change his joy into calamity on the mother of
his forehead nor did she deal thus with him but after the rede of
him who said

      I attained by my wits  What no sword had obtained
      And return wi the spoils  Whose sweet pluckings I gained

When he saw her caress him and smile upon him desire surged up in him
and he besought her of carnal knowledge but when he approached her
she drew away from him and burst into tears saying O my lord seest
thou not the man looking at us I conjure thee by Allah screen me from
his eyes How canst thou know me what while he looketh on us When he
heard this he was angry and asked Where is the man and answered
she There he is in the bezel of the ring putting out his head and
staring at us He thought that the Jinni was looking at them and said
laughing Fear not this is the Slave of the Sealring and he is
subject to me Quoth she I am afraid of Ifrits pull it off and throw
it afar from me So he plucked it off and laying it on the cushion
drew near to her but she dealt him a kick her foot striking him full
in the stomach and he fell over on his back senseless whereupon
she cried out to her attendants who came to her in haste and said to
them Seize him So forty slavegirls laid hold on him whilst she
hurriedly snatched up the ring from the cushion and rubbed it whereupon
Abu alSaadat presented himself saying Adsum at thy service O my
mistress Cried she Take up yonder Infidel and clap him in jail and
shackle him heavily So he took him and throwing him into the Prison of
Wrath returned and reported I have laid him in limbo Quoth she
Whither wentest thou with my father and my husband and quoth he I
cast them down in the Desert Quarter Then cried she I command thee
to fetch them to me forthwith He replied I hear and I obey and
taking flight at once stayed not till he reached the Desert Quarter
where he lighted down upon them and found them sitting weeping and
complaining each to other Quoth he Fear not for relief is come to
you and he told them what the Wazir had done adding Indeed I
imprisoned him with my own hands in obedience to her and she hath
bidden me bear you back And they rejoiced in his news Then he took
them both up and flew home with them nor was it more than an hour
before he brought them in to Princess Dunya who rose and saluted sire
and spouse Then she made them sit down and brought them food and
sweetmeats and they passed the rest of the night with her On the next
day she clad them in rich clothing and said to the King O my papa sit
thou upon thy throne and be King as before and make my husband thy Wazir
of the Right and tell thy troops that which hath happened Then send for
the Minister out of prison and do him die and after burn him for that
he is a Miscreant and would have gone in unto me in the way of
lewdness without the rites of wedlock and he hath testified against
himself that he is an Infidel and believeth in no religion And do
tenderly by thy soninlaw whom thou makest thy Wazir of the Right He
replied Hearing and obeying O my daughter But do thou give me the
ring or give it to thy husband Quoth she It behoveth not that either
thou or he have the ring I will keep the ring myself and belike I
shall be more careful of it than you Whatso ye wish seek it of me and I
will demand it for you of the Slave of the Sealring So fear no harm so
long as I live and after my death do what ye twain will with the ring
Quoth the King This is the right rede O my daughter and taking his
soninlaw went forth to the Divan Now the troops had passed the night
in sore chagrin for Princess Dunya and that which the Wazir had done
with her in going in to her after the way of lewdness without
marriagerites and for his illusage of the King and Maaruf and they
feared lest the law of AlIslam be dishonoured because it was manifest
to them that he was a Kafir So they assembled in the Divan and fell to
reproaching the Shaykh alIslam saying Why didst thou not forbid him
from going in to the Princess in the way of lewdness Said he O folk
the man is a Miscreant and hath gotten possession of the ring and I and
you may not prevail against him But Almighty Allah will requite him his
deed and be ye silent lest he slay you And as the host was thus
engaged in talk behold the King and Maaruf entered the DivanAnd
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say

Illustration


                 Now when it was the Thousandth Night

She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the
troops sorely chagrined sat in the Divan talking over the illdeeds done
by the Wazir to their Sovran his soninlaw and his daughter behold
the King and Maaruf entered Then the King bade decorate the city and
sent to fetch the Wazir from the place of duresse So they brought him
and as he passed by the troops they cursed him and abused him and
menaced him till he came to the King who commanded to do him dead by
the vilest of deaths Accordingly they slew him and after burned his
body and he went to Hell after the foulest of plights and right well
quoth one of him

 The Compassionate show no ruth to the tomb where his bones shall lie 
    And Munkar and eke Nakr neer cease to abide thereby

The King made Maaruf his Wazir of the Right and the times were pleasant
to them and their joys were untroubled They abode thus five years till
in the sixth year the King died and Princess Dunya made Maaruf Sultan
in her fathers stead but she gave him not the sealring During this
time she had conceived by him and borne him a boy of passing loveliness
excelling in beauty and perfection who ceased not to be reared in the
laps of nurses till he reached the age of five when his mother fell
sick of a deadly sickness and calling her husband to her said to him
I am ill Quoth he Allah preserve thee O dearling of my heart But
quoth she Haply I shall die and thou needest not that I commend to thy
care thy son wherefore I charge thee but be careful of the ring for
thine own sake and for the sake of this thy boy And he answered No
harm shall befal him whom Allah preserveth Then she pulled off the
ring and gave it to him and on the morrow she was admitted to the mercy
of Allah the Most High whilst Maaruf abode in possession of the
kingship and applied himself to the business of governing Now it
chanced that one day as he shook the handkerchief and the troops
withdrew to their places that he betook himself to the sittingchamber
where he sat till the day departed and the night advanced with murks
bedight Then came in to him his cupcompanions of the notables
according to their custom and sat with him by way of solace and
diversion till midnight when they craved permission to withdraw He
gave them leave and they retired to their houses after which there came
in to him a slavegirl affected to the service of his bed who spread
him the mattress and doffing his apparel clad him in his sleepinggown
Then he lay down and she kneaded his feet till sleep overpowered him
whereupon she withdrew to her own chamber and slept But suddenly he
felt something beside him in the bed and awaking started up in alarm and
cried I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the stoned Then he opened
his eyes and seeing by his side a woman foul of favour said to her
Who art thou Said she Fear not I am thy wife Fatimah alUrrah
Whereupon he looked in her face and knew her by her loathly form and the
length of her dogteeth so he asked her Whence camest thou in to me
and who brought thee to this country In what country art thou at this
present In the city of Ikhtiyan alKhutan But thou when didst thou
leave Cairo But now How can that be Know said she that
when I fell out with thee and Satan prompted me to do thee a damage I
complained of thee to the magistrates who sought for thee and the Kazis
enquired of thee but found thee not When two days were past
repentance gat hold upon me and I knew that the fault was with me but
penitence availed me not and I abode for some days weeping for thy
loss till what was in my hand failed and I was obliged to beg my bread
So I fell to begging of all from the courted rich to the contemned
poor and since thou leftest me I have eaten of the bitterness of
beggary and have been in the sorriest of conditions Every night I sat
beweeping our separation and that which I suffered since thy departure
of humiliation and ignominy of abjection and misery And she went on
to tell him what had befallen her whilst he stared at her in amazement
till she said Yesterday I went about begging all day but none gave me
aught and as often as I accosted any one and craved of him a crust of
bread he reviled me and gave me naught When night came I went to bed
supperless and hunger burned me and sore on me was that which I
suffered and I sat weeping when behold one appeared to me and said O
woman why weepest thou Said I erst I had a husband who used to provide
for me and fulfil my wishes but he is lost to me and I know not whither
he went and have been in sore straits since he left me Asked he What
is thy husbands name and I answered His name is Maaruf Quoth he I
ken him Know that thy husband is now Sultan in a certain city and if
thou wilt I will carry thee to him Cried I I am under thy protection
of thy bounty bring me to him So he took me up and flew with me between
heaven and earth till he brought me to this pavilion and said to
meEnter yonder chamber and thou shalt see thy husband asleep on the
couch Accordingly I entered and found thee in this state of lordship
Indeed I had not thought thou wouldst forsake me who am thy mate and
praised be Allah who hath united thee with me Quoth Maaruf Did I
forsake thee or thou me Thou complainedst of me from Kazi to Kazi and
endedst by denouncing me to the High Court and bringing down on me Ab
Tabak from the Citadel so I fled in mine own despite And he went on
to tell her all that had befallen him and how he was become Sultan and
had married the Kings daughter and how his beloved Dunya had died
leaving him a son who was then seven years old She rejoined That
which happened was foreordained of Allah but I repent me and I place
myself under thy protection beseeching thee not to abandon me but
suffer me eat bread with thee by way of an alms And she ceased not to
humble herself to him and to supplicate him till his heart relented
towards her and he said Repent from mischief and abide with me and
naught shall betide thee save what shall pleasure thee but an thou
work any wickedness I will slay thee nor fear any one And fancy not
that thou canst complain of me to the High Court and that Abu Tabak will
come down on me from the Citadel for I am become Sultan and the folk
dread me but I fear none save Allah Almighty because I have a
talismanic ring which when I rub the Slave of the Signet appeareth to
me His name is Abu alSaadat and whatsoever I demand of him he
bringeth to me So an thou desire to return to thine own country I
will give thee what shall suffice thee all thy life long and will send
thee thither speedily but an thou desire to abide with me I will
clear for thee a palace and furnish it with the choicest of silks and
appoint thee twenty slavegirls to serve thee and provide thee with
dainty dishes and sumptuous suits and thou shalt be a Queen and live in
all delight till thou die or I die What sayest thou of this I wish
to abide with thee she answered and kissed his hand and vowed
repentance from frowardness Accordingly he set apart a palace for her
sole use and gave her slavegirls and eunuchs and she became a Queen
The young Prince used to visit her as he visited his sire but she hated
him for that he was not her son and when the boy saw that she looked on
him with the eye of aversion and anger he shunned her and took a
dislike to her As for Maaruf he occupied himself with the love of
fair handmaidens and bethought him not of his wife Fatimah the Dung for
that she was grown a grizzled old fright foulfavoured to the sight a
baldheaded blight loathlier than the snake speckled black and white
the more that she had beyond measure evil entreated him aforetime and
as saith the adage Illusage the root of desire disparts and sows hate
in the soil of hearts and Godgifted is he who saith

 Beware of losing hearts of men by thine injurious deed  For when
    Aversion takes his place none may dear Love restore
 Hearts when affection flies from them are likest unto glass  Which
    broken cannot whole be madetis breached for evermore

And indeed Maaruf had not given her shelter by reason of any
praiseworthy quality in her but he dealt with her thus generously only
of desire for the approval of Allah AlmightyHere Dunyazad interrupted
her sister Shahrazad saying How winsome are these words of thine
which win hold of the heart more forcibly than enchanters eyne and how
beautiful are these wondrous books thou hast cited and the marvellous
and singular tales thou hast recited Quoth Shahrazad And where is
all this compared with what I shall relate to thee on the coming night
an I live and the King deign spare my days So when morning morrowed
and the day brake in its sheen and shone the King arose from his couch
with breast broadened and in high expectation for the rest of the tale
and saying By Allah I will not slay her till I hear the last of her
story repaired to his Durbr while the Wazir as was his wont
presented himself at the Palace shroud under arm Shahriyar tarried
abroad all that day bidding and forbidding between man and man after
which he returned to his Harim and according to his custom went in to
his wife Shahrazad


             Now when it was the Thousand and First Night

Dunyazad said to her sister Do thou finish for us the History of
Maaruf She replied With love and goodly gree an my lord deign
permit me recount it Quoth the King I permit thee for that I am
fain of hearing it So she saidIt hath reached me O auspicious King
that Maaruf would have naught to do with his wife by way of conjugal
duty Now when she saw that he held aloof from her bed and occupied
himself with other women she hated him and jealousy gat the mastery of
her and Iblis prompted her to take the sealring from him and slay him
and make herself Queen in his stead So she went forth one night from
her pavilion intending for that in which was her husband King Maaruf
and it chanced by decree of the Decreer and His written destiny that
Maaruf lay that night with one of his concubines a damsel endowed with
beauty and loveliness symmetry and a stature all grace And it was his
wont of the excellence of his piety that when he was minded to have
to lie with a woman he would doff the enchanted sealring from his
finger in reverence to the Holy Names graven thereon and lay it on the
pillow nor would he don it again till he had purified himself by the
Ghuslablution Moreover when he had lain with a woman he was used to
order her go forth from him before daybreak of his fear for the
sealring and when he went to the Hammam he locked the door of the
pavilion till his return when he put on the ring and after this all
were free to enter according to custom His wife Fatimah the Dung knew
of all this and went not forth from her place till she had certified
herself of the case So she sallied out when the night was dark
purposing to go in to him whilst he was drowned in sleep and steal the
ring unseen of him Now it chanced at this time that the Kings son had
gone out without light to the Chapel of Ease for an occasion and sat
down over the marble slab of the jakes in the dark leaving the
door open Presently he saw Fatimah come forth of her pavilion and make
stealthily for that of his father and said in himself What aileth this
witch to leave her lodging in the dead of the night and make for my
fathers pavilion Needs must there be some reason for this so he went
out after her and followed in her steps unseen of her Now he had a
short sword of watered steel which he held so dear that he went not to
his fathers Divan except he were girt therewith and his father used
to laugh at him and exclaim Mahallah This is a mighty fine sword
of thine O my son But thou hast not gone down with it to battle nor
cut off a head therewith Whereupon the boy would reply I will not
fail to cut off with it some head which deserveth cutting And
Maaruf would laugh at his words Now when treading in her track he
drew the sword from its sheath and he followed her till she came to his
fathers pavilion and entered whilst he stood and watched her from the
door He saw her searching about and heard her say to herself Where
hath he laid the sealring whereby he knew that she was looking for
the ring and he waited till she found it and said Here it is Then
she picked it up and turned to go out but he hid behind the door As
she came forth she looked at the ring and turned it about in her grasp
But when she was about to rub it he raised his hand with the sword and
smote her on the neck and she cried a single cry and fell down dead
With this Maaruf awoke and seeing his wife strown on the ground with
her blood flowing and his son standing with the drawn sword in his
hand said to him What is this O my son He replied O my father
how often hast thou said to me Thou hast a mighty fine sword but thou
hast not gone down with it to battle nor cut off a head And I have
answered thee saying I will not fail to cut off with it a head which
deserveth cutting And now behold I have therewith cut off for thee a
head well worth the cutting And he told him what had passed Maaruf
sought for the Sealring but found it not so he searched the dead
womans body till he saw her hand closed upon it whereupon he took it
from her grasp and said to the boy Thou art indeed my very son
without doubt or dispute Allah ease thee in this world and the next
even as thou hast eased me of this vile woman Her attempt led only to
her own destruction and Allahgifted is he who said

 When forwards Allahs aid a mans intent  His wish in every case shall
    find consent
 But an that aid of Allah be refused  His first attempt shall do him
    damagement

Then King Maaruf called aloud to some of his attendants who came in
haste and he told them what his wife Fatimah the Dung had done and bade
them to take her and lay her in a place till the morning They did his
bidding and next day he gave her in charge to a number of eunuchs who
washed her and shrouded her and made her a tomb and buried her
Thus her coming from Cairo was but to her grave and Allahgifted is he
who said

 We trod the steps appointed for us and he whose steps are appointed
    must tread them
 He whose death is decreed to take place in our land shall not die in any
    land but that

And how excellent is the saying of the poet

 I wot not whenas to a land I fare  Good luck pursuing what my lot
    shall be
 Whether the fortune I perforce pursue  Or the misfortune which pursueth
    me

After this King Maaruf sent for the husbandman whose guest he had
been when he was a fugitive and made him his Wazir of the Right and
his Chief Counsellor Then learning that he had a daughter of
passing beauty and loveliness of qualities natureennobled at birth and
exalted of worth he took her to wife and in due time he married his
son So they abode awhile in all solace of life and its delight and
their days were serene and their joys untroubled till there came to
them the Destroyer of delights and the Sunderer of societies the
Depopulator of populous places and the Orphaner of sons and daughters
And glory be to the Living who dieth not and in whose hand are the Keys
of the Seen and the Unseen

                              Conclusion


Now during this time Shahrazad had borne the King three boy children
so when she had made an end of the story of Maaruf she rose to her
feet and kissing ground before him said O King of the time and unique
one of the age and the tide I am thine handmaid and these thousand
nights and a night have I entertained thee with stories of folk gone
before and admonitory instances of the men of yore May I then make bold
to crave a boon of Thy Highness He replied Ask O Shahrazad and it
shall be granted to thee Whereupon she cried out to the nurses
and the eunuchs saying Bring me my children So they brought them to
her in haste and they were three boy children one walking one
crawling and one sucking She took them and setting them before the
King again kissed the ground and said O King of the age these are
thy children and I crave that thou release me from the doom of death as
a dole to these infants for an thou kill me they will become
motherless and will find none among women to rear them as they should be
reared When the King heard this he wept and straining the boys to his
bosom said By Allah O Shahrazad I pardoned thee before the coming
of these children for that I found thee chaste pure ingenuous and
pious Allah bless thee and thy father and thy mother and thy root and
thy branch I take the Almighty to witness against me that I exempt thee
from aught that can harm thee So she kissed his hands and feet and
rejoiced with exceeding joy saying The Lord make thy life long and
increase thee in dignity and majesty presently adding Thou
marvelledst at that which befel thee on the part of women yet there
betided the Kings of the Chosros before thee greater mishaps and more
grievous than that which hath befallen thee and indeed I have set forth
unto thee that which happened to Caliphs and Kings and others with their
women but the relation is longsome and hearkening groweth tedious and
in this is allsufficient warning for the man of wits and admonishment
for the wise Then she ceased to speak and when King Shahriyar heard
her speech and profited by that which she said he summoned up his
reasoning powers and cleansed his heart and caused his understanding
revert and turned to Allah Almighty and said to himself Since there
befel the Kings of the Chosros more than that which hath befallen me
never whilst I live shall I cease to blame myself for the past As for
this Shahrazad her like is not found in the lands so praise be to Him
who appointed her a means for delivering His creatures from oppression
and slaughter Then he arose from his sance and kissed her head
whereat she rejoiced she and her sister Dunyazad with exceeding joy
When the morning morrowed the King went forth and sitting down on the
throne of the Kingship summoned the Lords of his land whereupon the
Chamberlains and Nabobs and Captains of the host went in to him and
kissed ground before him He distinguished the Wazir Shahrazads sire
with special favour and bestowed on him a costly and splendid robe of
honour and entreated him with the utmost kindness and said to him
Allah protect thee for that thou gavest me to wife thy noble daughter
who hath been the means of my repentance from slaying the daughters of
folk Indeed I have found her pure and pious chaste and ingenuous and
Allah hath vouchsafed me by her three boy children wherefore praised be
He for his passing favour Then he bestowed robes of honour upon his
Wazirs and Emirs and Chief Officers and he set forth to them briefly
that which had betided him with Shahrazad and how he had turned from his
former ways and repented him of what he had done and purposed to take
the Wazirs daughter Shahrazad to wife and let draw up the
marriagecontract with her When those who were present heard this they
kissed the ground before him and blessed him and his betrothed
Shahrazad and the Wazir thanked her Then Shahriyar made an end of his
sitting in all weal whereupon the folk dispersed to their
dwellingplaces and the news was bruited abroad that the King purposed
to marry the Wazirs daughter Shahrazad Then he proceeded to make
ready the wedding gear and presently he sent after his brother King
Shah Zaman who came and King Shahriyar went forth to meet him with the
troops Furthermore they decorated the city after the goodliest fashion
and diffused scents from censers and burnt aloeswood and other perfumes
in all the markets and thoroughfares and rubbed themselves with
saffron what while the drums beat and the flutes and pipes sounded
and mimes and mountebanks played and plied their arts and the King
lavished on them gifts and largesse and in very deed it was a notable
day When they came to the palace King Shahriyar commanded to spread
the tables with beasts roasted whole and sweetmeats and all manner of
viands and bade the crier cry to the folk that they should come up to
the Divan and eat and drink and that this should be a means of
reconciliation between him and them So high and low great and small
came up unto him and they abode on that wise eating and drinking seven
days with their nights Then the King shut himself up with his brother
and related to him that which had betided him with the Wazirs daughter
Shahrazad during the past three years and told him what he had heard
from her of proverbs and parables chronicles and pleasantries quips
and jests stories and anecdotes dialogues and histories and elegies
and other verses whereat King Shah Zaman marvelled with the uttermost
marvel and said Fain would I take her younger sister to wife so we
may be two brothersgerman to two sistersgerman and they on like wise
be sisters to us for that the calamity which befel me was the cause of
our discovering that which befel thee and all this time of three years
past I have taken no delight in woman save that I lie each night with a
damsel of my kingdom and every morning I do her to death but now I
desire to marry thy wifes sister Dunyazad When King Shahriyar heard
his brothers words he rejoiced with joy exceeding and arising
forthright went in to his wife Shahrazad and acquainted her with that
which his brother purposed namely that he sought her sister Dunyazad in
wedlock whereupon she answered O King of the age we seek of him one
condition to wit that he take up his abode with us for that I cannot
brook to be parted from my sister an hour because we were brought up
together and may not endure separation each from other If he
accept this pact she is his handmaid King Shahriyar returned to his
brother and acquainted him with that which Shahrazad had said and he
replied Indeed this is what was in my mind for that I desire
nevermore to be parted from thee one hour As for the kingdom Allah the
Most High shall send to it whomso He chooseth for that I have no longer
a desire for the kingship When King Shahriyar heard his brothers
words he rejoiced exceedingly and said Verily this is what I wished
O my brother So AlhamdolillahPraised be Allahwho hath brought about
union between us Then he sent after the Kazis and Olema Captains and
Notables and they married the two brothers to the two sisters The
contracts were written out and the two Kings bestowed robes of honour of
silk and satin on those who were present whilst the city was decorated
and the rejoicings were renewed The King commanded each Emir and Wazir
and Chamberlain and Nabob to decorate his palace and the folk of the
city were gladdened by the presage of happiness and contentment King
Shahriyar also bade slaughter sheep and set up kitchens and made
bridefeasts and fed all comers high and low and he gave alms to the
poor and needy and extended his bounty to great and small Then the
eunuchs went forth that they might perfume the Hammam for the brides
so they scented it with rosewater and willowflowerwater and pods of
musk and fumigated it with Kkil eaglewood and ambergris Then
Shahrazad entered she and her sister Dunyazad and they cleansed their
heads and clipped their hair When they came forth of the Hammambath
they donned raiment and ornaments such as men were wont prepare for the
Kings of the Chosros and among Shahrazads apparel was a dress purfled
with red gold and wrought with counterfeit presentments of birds and
beasts And the two sisters encircled their necks with necklaces of
jewels of price in the like whereof Iskander rejoiced not for
therein were great jewels such as amazed the wit and dazzled the eye
and the imagination was bewildered at their charms for indeed each of
them was brighter than the sun and the moon Before them they lighted
brilliant flambeaux of wax in candelabra of gold but their faces
outshone the flambeaux for that they had eyes sharper than unsheathed
swords and the lashes of their eyelids bewitched all hearts Their
cheeks were rosy red and their necks and shapes gracefully swayed and
their eyes wantoned like the gazelles and the slavegirls came to meet
them with instruments of music Then the two Kings entered the
Hammambath and when they came forth they sat down on a couch set with
pearls and gems whereupon the two sisters came up to them and stood
between their hands as they were moons bending and leaning from side
to side in their beauty and loveliness Presently they brought forward
Shahrazad and displayed her for the first dress in a red suit
whereupon King Shahriyar rose to look upon her and the wits of all
present men and women were bewitched for that she was even as saith of
her one of her describers

 A sun on wand in knoll of sand she showed  Clad in her cramoisyhued
    chemisette
 Of her lips honeydew she gave me drink  And with her rosy cheeks
    quencht fire she set

Then they attired Dunyazad in a dress of blue brocade and she became as
she were the full moon when it shineth forth So they displayed her in
this for the first dress before King Shah Zaman who rejoiced in her
and wellnigh swooned away for lovelonging and amorous desire yea he
was distraught with passion for her whenas he saw her because she was
as saith of her one of her describers in these couplets

 She comes apparelled in an azure vest  Ultramarine as skies are deckt
    and dight
 I viewd th unparalleld sight which showed my eyes  A Summermoon
    upon a Winternight

Then they returned to Shahrazad and displayed her in the second dress a
suit of surpassing goodliness and veiled her face with her hair like a
chinveil Moreover they let down her sidelocks and she was even
as saith of her one of her describers in these couplets

 O hail to him whose locks his cheeks oershade  Who slew my life by
    cruel hard despight
 Said I Hast veiled the Morn in Night He said  Nay I but veil Moon
    in hue of Night

Then they displayed Dunyazad in a second and a third and a fourth dress
and she paced forward like the rising sun and swayed to and fro in the
insolence of beauty and she was even as saith the poet of her in these
couplets

 The sun of beauty she to all appears  And lovely coy she mocks all
    loveliness
 And when he fronts her favour and her smile  Amorn the sun of day in
    clouds must dress

Then they displayed Shahrazad in the third dress and the fourth and the
fifth and she became as she were a Bnbranch snell or a thirsting
gazelle lovely of face and perfect in attributes of grace even as
saith of her one in these couplets

 She comes like fullest moon on happy night  Taper of waist with shape
    of magic might
 She hath an eye whose glances quell mankind  And ruby on her cheeks
    reflects his light
 Enveils her hips the blackness of her hair  Beware of curls that bite
    with viperbite
 Her sides are silkensoft that while the heart  Mere rock behind that
    surface scapes our sight
 From the fringed curtains of her eyne she shoots  Shafts that at
    furthest range on mark alight

Then they returned to Dunyazad and displayed her in the fifth dress and
in the sixth which was green when she surpassed with her loveliness
the fair of the four quarters of the world and outvied with the
brightness of her countenance the full moon at rising tide for she was
even as saith of her the poet in these couplets

 A damsel twas the tirers art had decked with snare and sleight  And
    robed with rays as though the sun from her had borrowed light
 She came before us wondrous clad in chemisette of green  As veild by
    his leafy screen Pomegranate hides from sight
 And when he said How callest thou the fashion of thy dress  She
    answered us in pleasant way with double meaning dight
 We call this garment crvecur and rightly is it hight  For many
    a heart wi this we brake and harried many a sprite

Then they displayed Shahrazad in the sixth and seventh dresses and clad
her in youths clothing whereupon she came forward swaying from side to
side and coquettishly moving and indeed she ravished wits and hearts and
ensorcelled all eyes with her glances She shook her sides and swayed
her haunches then put her hair on swordhilt and went up to King
Shahriyar who embraced her as hospitable host embraceth guest and
threatened her in her ear with the taking of the sword and she was even
as saith of her the poet in these words

 Were not the Murk of gender male  Than feminines surpassing fair
 Tirewomen they had grudged the bride  Who made her beard and whiskers
    wear

Thus also they did with her sister Dunyazad and when they had made an
end of the display the King bestowed robes of honour on all who were
present and sent the brides to their own apartments Then Shahrazad went
in to King Shahriyar and Dunyazad to King Shah Zaman and each of them
solaced himself with the company of his beloved consort and the hearts
of the folk were comforted When morning morrowed the Wazir came in to
the two Kings and kissed ground before them wherefore they thanked him
and were large of bounty to him Presently they went forth and sat down
upon couches of Kingship whilst all the Wazirs and Emirs and Grandees
and Lords of the land presented themselves and kissed ground King
Shahriyar ordered them dresses of honour and largesse and they prayed
for the permanence and prosperity of the King and his brother Then the
two Sovrans appointed their sireinlaw the Wazir to be Viceroy in
Samarcand and assigned him five of the Chief Emirs to accompany him
charging them attend him and do him service The Minister kissed the
ground and prayed that they might be vouchsafed length of life then he
went in to his daughters whilst the Eunuchs and Ushers walked before
him and saluted them and farewelled them They kissed his hands and
gave him joy of the Kingship and bestowed on him immense treasures
after which he took leave of them and setting out fared days and
nights till he came near Samarcand where the townspeople met him at a
distance of three marches and rejoiced in him with exceeding joy So he
entered the city and they decorated the houses and it was a notable day
He sat down on the throne of his kingship and the Wazirs did him homage
and the Grandees and Emirs of Samarcand and all prayed that he might be
vouchsafed justice and victory and length of continuance So he bestowed
on them robes of honour and entreated them with distinction and they
made him Sultan over them As soon as his fatherinlaw had departed for
Samarcand King Shahriyah summoned the Grandees of his realm and made
them a stupendous banquet of all manner of delicious meats and exquisite
sweetmeats He also bestowed on them robes of honour and guerdoned them
and divided the kingdoms between himself and his brother in their
presence whereat the folk rejoiced Then the two Kings abode each
ruling a day in turn and they were ever in harmony each with other
while on similar wise their wives continued in the love of Allah
Almighty and in thanksgiving to Him and the peoples and the provinces
were at peace and the preachers prayed for them from the pulpits and
their report was bruited abroad and the travellers bore tidings of them
to all lands In due time King Shahriyah summoned chroniclers and
copyists and bade them write all that had betided him with his wife
first and last so they wrote this and named it The Stories of the
Thousand Nights and A Night The book came to thirty volumes and these
the King laid up in his treasury And the two brothers abode with their
wives in all pleasance and solace of life and its delights for that
indeed Allah the Most High had changed their annoy into joy and on this
wise they continued till there took them the Destroyer of delights and
the Severer of societies the Desolator of dwellingplaces and Garnerer
of graveyards and they were translated to the ruth of Almighty Allah
their houses fell waste and their palaces lay in ruins and the
Kings inherited their riches Then there reigned after them a wise
ruler who was just keenwitted and accomplished and loved tales and
legends especially those which chronicle the doings of Sovrans and
Sultans and he found in the treasury these marvellous stories and
wondrous histories contained in the thirty volumes aforesaid So he
read in them a first book and a second and a third and so on to the last
of them and each book astounded and delighted him more than that which
preceded it till he came to the end of them Then he admired whatso he
had read therein of description and discourse and rare traits and
anecdotes and moral instances and reminiscences and bade the folk copy
them and dispread them over all lands and climes wherefore their report
was bruited abroad and the people named them The marvels and wonders
of the Thousand Nights and A Night This is all that hath come down to
us of the origin of this book and Allah is Allknowing So Glory
be to Him whom the shifts of Time waste not away nor doth aught of
chance or change affect His sway whom one case diverteth not from other
case and Who is sole in the attributes of perfect grace And prayer and
peace be upon the Lords Pontiff and Chosen One among His creatures our
lord MOHAMMED the Prince of mankind through whom we supplicate Him for a
goodly and a godly

                            Terminal Essay


                              PRELIMINARY

The reader who has reached this terminal stage will hardly require my
assurance that he has seen the medival Arab at his best and perhaps
at his worst In glancing over the myriad pictures of this panorama
those who can discern the soul of goodness in things evil will note the
true nobility of the Moslems mind in the Moyen Age and the cleanliness
of his life from cradle to grave As a child he is devoted to his
parents fond of his comrades and respectful to his pastors and
masters even schoolmasters As a lad he prepares for manhood with a
will and this training occupies him throughout youthtide he is a
gentleman in manners without awkwardness vulgar astonishment or
mauvaisehonte As a man he is highspirited and energetic always ready
to fight for his Sultan his country and especially his Faith
courteous and affable rarely failing in temperance of mind and
selfrespect selfcontrol and selfcommand hospitable to the stranger
attached to his fellowcitizens submissive to superiors and kindly to
inferiorsif such classes exist Eastern despotisms have arrived nearer
the idea of equality and fraternity than any republic yet invented As a
friend he proves a model to the Damons and Pythiases as a lover an
exemplar to Don Quijote without the noble old Caballeros touch of
eccentricity As a knight he is the mirror of chivalry doing battle for
the weak and debelling the strong while ever defending the honour of
women As a husband his patriarchal position causes him to be loved and
fondly loved by more than one wife as a father affection for his
children rules his life he is domestic in the highest degree and he
finds few pleasures beyond the bosom of his family Lastly his death is
simple path ethic and edifying as the life which led to it

Considered in a higher phase the medival Moslem mind displays like
the ancient Egyptian a most exalted moral idea the deepest reverence
for all things connected with his religion and a sublime conception of
the Unity and Omnipotence of the Deity Noteworthy too is a proud
resignation to the decrees of Fate and Fortune Kaz wa Kadar of
Destiny and Predestinationa feature which ennobles the low aspect of
AlIslam even in these her days of comparative degeneration and local
decay Hence his moderation in prosperity his fortitude in adversity
his dignity his perfect selfdominance and lastly his lofty quietism
which sounds the true heroic ring This again is softened and tempered
by a simple faith in the supremacy of Love over Fear an unbounded
humanity and charity for the poor and helpless an unconditional
forgiveness of the direst injuries which is the note of the noble a
generosity and liberality which at times seem impossible and an
enthusiasm for universal benevolence and beneficence which exalting
kindly deeds done to man above every form of holiness constitute the
root and base of Oriental nay of all courtesy And the whole is
crowned by pure trust and natural confidence in the progress and
perfectability of human nature which he exalts instead of degrading
this he holds to be the foundationstone of society and indeed the very
purpose of its existence His Pessimism resembles far more the optimism
which the socalled Books of Moses borrowed from the Ancient Copt than
the mournful and melancholy creed of the true Pessimist as Solomon the
Hebrew the Indian Buddhist and the esoteric European imitators of
Buddhism He cannot but sigh when contemplating the sin and sorrow the
pathos and bathos of the world and feel the pity of it with its shifts
and changes ending in nothingness its scanty happiness and its copious
misery But his melancholy is expressed in

                A voice divinely sweet a voice no less
                Divinely sad

Nor does he mourn as they mourn who have no hope he has an absolute
conviction in future compensation and meanwhile his lively poetic
impulse the poetry of ideas not of formal verse and his radiant
innate idealism breathe a soul into the merest matter of squalid
workaday life and awaken the sweetest harmonies of Nature epitomised
in Humanity

Such was the Moslem at a time when the dark clouds of ignorance and
superstition hung so thick on the intellectual horizon of Europe as to
exclude every ray of learning that darted from the East and when all
that was polite or elegant in literature was classed among the Studia
Arabum

Nor is the shady side of the picture less notable Our Arab at his worst
is a mere barbarian who has not forgotten the savage He is a model
mixture of childishness and astuteness of simplicity and cunning
concealing levity of mind under solemnity of aspect His stolid
instinctive conservatism grovels before the tyrant rule of routine
despite that turbulent and licentious independence which ever suggests
revolt against the ruler his mental torpidity founded upon physical
indolence renders immediate action and all manner of exertion
distasteful his conscious weakness shows itself in overweening
arrogance and intolerance His crass and selfsatisfied ignorance makes
him glorify the most ignoble superstitions while acts of revolting
savagery are the natural results of a malignant fanaticism and a furious
hatred of every creed beyond the pale of AlIslam

It must be confessed that these contrasts make a curious and interesting
tout ensemble


                                   I
                       THE ORIGIN OF THE NIGHTS


                           ATHE BIRTHPLACE

Here occur the questions Where and When was written and to Whom do we
owe a prosepoem which like the dramatic epos of Herodotus has no
equal

I proceed to lay before the reader a procsverbal of the sundry
pleadings already in court as concisely as is compatible with
intelligibility furnishing him with references to original authorities
and warning him that a fullydetailed account would fill a volume Even
my own reasons for decidedly taking one side and rejecting the other
must be stated briefly And before entering upon this subject I would
distribute the prosematter of our Recueil of Folklore under three
heads

   The Apologue or Beastfable proper a theme which may be of any
  age as it is found in the hieroglyphs and in the cuneiforms

   The Fairytale as for brevity we may term the stories based upon
  supernatural agency this was a favourite with olden Persia and
  Mohammed most austere and puritanical of the Prophets strongly
  objected to it because preferred by the more sensible of his
  converts to the dry legends of the Talmud and the Koran quite as
  fabulous without the halo and glamour of fancy

   The Histories and historical anecdotes analects and acroamata
  in which the names when not used anachronistically by the editor or
  copier give unerring data for the earliest date  quo and which by
  the mode of treatment suggest the latest

Each of these constituents will require further notice when the
subjectmatter of the book is discussed The metrical portion of The
Nights may also be divided into three categories viz

   The oldest and classical poetry of the Arabs eg the various
  quotations from the Suspended Poems

   The medival beginning with the laureates of AlRashids court
  such as AlAsma and Ab Nows and ending with AlHarr AH
    

   The modern quotations and the pices de circonstance by the
  editors or copyists of the Compilation

Upon the metrical portion also further notices must be offered at the
end of this Essay

In considering the unde derivatur of The Nights we must carefully
separate subjectmatter from languagemanner The neglect of such
essential difference has caused the remark It is not a little curious
that the origin of a work which has been known to Europe and has been
studied by many during nearly two centuries should still be so
mysterious and that students have failed in all attempts to detect the
secret Hence also the chief authorities at once branched off into two
directions One held the work to be practically Persian the other as
persistently declared it to be purely Arab

Professor Galland in his Epistle Dedicatory to the Marquise dO
daughter of his patron M de Guillerague showed his literary acumen and
unfailing sagacity by deriving The Nights from India vi Persia and
held that they had been reduced to their present shape by an Auteur
Arabe inconnu This reference to India also learnedly advocated by M
Langls was inevitable in those days it had not then been proved that
India owed all her literature to far older civilisations and even that
her alphabet the Ngari erroneously called Devangari was derived
through Phnicia and Himyarland from Ancient Egypt So Europe was
contented to compare The Nights with the Fables of Pilpay for upwards of
a century At last the Pehlevi or old Iranian origin of the work found
an able and strenuous advocate in Baron von HammerPurgstall who
worthily continued what Galland had begun although a most inexact
writer he was extensively read in Oriental history and poetry His
contention was that the book is an Arabisation of the Persian Hazr
Afsnah or Thousand Tales and he proved his point

Von Hammer began by summoning into Court the Herodotus of the Arabs
Ali Ab alHasan AlMasdi who in AH    about one
generation before the founding of Cairo published at Bassorah the first
edition of his farfamed Murj alDahab wa Madin alJauhar Meads of
Gold and Mines of Gems The Styrian Orientalist quotes with sundry
misprints an ampler version of a passage in Chapter lxviii which
is abbreviated in the French translation of M C Barbier de
Meynard

And indeed many men well acquainted with their Arab histories
opine that the stories above mentioned and other trifles were strung
together by men who commended themselves to the Kings by relating them
and who found favour with their contemporaries by committing them to
memory and by reciting them Of such fashion is the fashion of the
books which have come down to us translated from the Persian
Frasiyah the Indian Hindyah and the GrcoRoman
Rmyah we have noted the judgment which should be passed upon
compositions of this nature Such is the book entituled Hazr Afsnah
or The Thousand Tales which word in Arabic signifies Khurfah
Faceti it is known to the public under the name of The Book of a
Thousand Nights and a Night Kitab Alf Laylah wa Laylah This is
an history of a King and his Wazir the ministers daughter and a
slavegirl jriyah who are named Shrzd lionborn and Dnrzd
ducatborn Such also is the Tale of Farzah alii Firza
and Sims containing details concerning the Kings and Wazirs of Hind
the Book of AlSindibd and others of a similar stamp

Von Hammer adds quoting chapt cxvi of AlMasdi that AlMansr
second Abbaside AH    and grandfather of AlRashd
caused many translations of Greek and Latin Syriac and Persian
Pehlevi works to be made into Arabic specifying the Kallah wa
Damnah the Fables of Bidpi Pilpay the Logic of Aristotle the
Geography of Ptolemy and the Elements of Euclid Hence he concludes
Loriginal des Mille et une Nuits    selon toute vraisemblance a
t traduit au temps du Khalife Mansur cestdire trente ans avant le
rgne du Khalife Haroun alRaschid qui par la suite devait luimme
jouer un si grand rle dans ces histoires He also notes that about a
century after AlMasudi had mentioned the Hazr Afsnah it was
versified and probably remodelled by one Rsti the Takhallus or nom
de plume of a bard at the Court of Mahmd the Ghaznevite Sultan who
after a reign of thirtythree years ob AD 

Von Hammer some twelve years afterwards Journ Asiat August 
brought forward in his Note sur lorigine Persane des Mille et une
Nuits a second and an even more important witness this was the famous
Kitab alFihrist or Index List of Arabic works written in AH
   by Mohammed bin Ishk alNadm cupcompanion or equerry
popularly known as Ebou Yacoub elWerrek The following is an
extract p  from the Eighth Discourse which consists of three arts
funn The first section on the history of the confabulatores
nocturni tellers of night tales and the relaters of fanciful
adventures together with the names of books treating upon such
subjects Mohammed ibn Ishk saithThe first who indited themes of
imagination and made books of them consigning these works to the
libraries and who ordered some of them as though related by the tongues
of brute beasts were the paloPersians and the Kings of the First
Dynasty The Ashkanian Kings of the Third Dynasty appended others to
them and they were augmented and amplified in the days of the
Sassanides the fourth and last royal house The Arabs also
translated them into Arabic and the loquent and eloquent polished and
embellished them and wrote others resembling them The first work of
such kind was entituled The Book of Hazr Afsn signifying Alf
Khurfah the argument whereof was as follows A King of their Kings was
wont when he wedded a woman and had lain one night with her to slay
her on the next morning Presently he espoused a damsel of the daughters
of the Kings Shahrzd hight one endowed with intellect and
erudition and whenas she lay with him she fell to telling him tales of
fancy moreover she used to connect the story at the end of the night
with that which might induce the King to preserve her alive and to ask
her of its ending on the next night until a thousand nights had passed
over her Meanwhile he cohabited with her till she was blest by boon of
child of him when she acquainted him with the device she had wrought
upon him wherefore he admired her intelligence and inclined to her and
preserved her life That King had also a Kahramnah nurse and duenna
not entremetteuse hight Dnrzd Dunyzd who aided the wife in
this artifice It is also said that this book was composed for or
by Humi daughter of Bahman and in it were included other matters
Mohammed bin Ishak addsAnd the truth is Inshallah that the
first who solaced himself with hearing nighttales was AlIskandar he
of Macedon and he had a number of men who used to relate to him
imaginary stories and provoke him to laughter he however designed not
therein merely to please himself but that he might thereby become the
more cautious and alert After him the Kings in like fashion made use of
the book entitled Hazr Afsn It containeth a thousand nights but
less than two hundred nightstories for a single history often occupied
several nights I have seen it complete sundry times and it is in
truth a corrupted book of cold tales

A writer in The Athenum objecting to Lanes modern date for The
Nights adduces evidence to prove the greater antiquity of the work
Abu alHasan Ibn Said bin Musa alGharnti  of Granada born in
AH    and ob Tunis AH    left his native city and
arrived at Cairo in AH    This Spanish poet and historian
wrote AlMuhall bi alAshr The Adorned with Verses a Topography of
Egypt and Africa which is apparently now lost In this he quotes from
AlKurtubi the Cordovan and he in his turn is quoted by the Arab
historian of Spain Ab alAbbs Ahmad bin Mohammed alMakkri in the
Windwafts of Perfume from the Branches of Andalusia the Blooming
AD  Mr Payne x  thus translates from Dr Dozys
published text

Ibn Said may God have mercy upon him sets forth in his book El
Muhella bisShaar quoting from El Curtubi the story of the building of
the Houdej in the Garden of Cairo the which was of the magnificent
pleasaunces of the Fatimite Khalifs the rare of ordinance and
surpassing to wit that the Khalif El Aamir biahkamillah let
build it for a Bedouin woman the love of whom had gotten the mastery of
him in the neighbourhood of the Chosen Garden and used to resort
often thereto and was slain as he went thither and it ceased not to be
a pleasuringplace for the Khalifs after him The folk abound in stories
of the Bedouin girl and Ibn Meyyah of the sons of her uncle
cousin and what hangs thereby of the mention of ElAamir so that the
tales told of them on this account became like unto the story of El
Bettl and the Thousand Nights and a Night and what resembleth
them

The same passage from Ibn Said corresponding in three MSS occurs in
the famous Khitat attributed to AlMakrizi ob AD  and was
thus translated from a MS in the British Museum by Mr John Payne ix


The Khalif ElAamir biahkamillah set apart in the neighbourhood of
the Chosen Garden a place for his beloved the Bedouin maid
Aaliyah which he named El Houdej Quoth Ibn Said in the book
ElMuhella bilashar from the History of El Curtubi concerning the
traditions of the folk of the story of the Bedouin maid and Ibn Menah
Meyyah of the sons of her uncle and what hangs thereby of the mention
of the Khalif El Aamr biahkamillah so that their traditions or
tales upon the garden became like unto El Bettl and the Thousand
Nights and what resembleth them

This evidently means either that The Nights existed in the days of
Almir xiith cent or that the author compared them with a work
popular in his own age Mr Payne attaches much importance to the
discrepancy of titles which appears to me a minor detail The change of
names is easily explained Amongst the Arabs as amongst the wild Irish
there is divinity the proverb says luck in odd numbers and
consequently the others are inauspicious Hence as Sir Wm Ouseley says
Travels ii  the number Thousand and One is a favourite in the East
Olivier Voyages vi  Paris  and quotes the Cistern of the
Thousand and One Columns at Constantinople Kmpfer Amn Exot p
 notes of the Takiyahs or Dervishes convents and the Mazrs or
Santons tombs near Konah Iconium Multa seges sepulchralium qu
virorum ex omni vo doctissimorum exuvias condunt mille et unum
recenset auctor Libri qui inscribitur Hassaaer we jek mesaar Hazr ve
yek Mezr ie mille et unum mausolea A book The Hazar o yek Rz
  Days was composed in the midxviith century by the famous
Dervaysh Mukhlis Chief Sofi of Isfahan it was translated into French
by Petis de la Croix with a preface by Cazotte and was Englished by
Ambrose Phillips Lastly in India and throughout Asia where Indian
influence extends the number of cyphers not followed by a significant
number is indefinite for instance to determine hundreds the Hindus
affix the required figure to the end and for  write  for 
 But the grand fact of the Hazr Afsnah is its being the archetype
of The Nights unquestionably proving that the Arab work borrows from
the Persian bodily its cadre or framework the principal
characteristic its exordium and its dnoement whilst the two heroines
still bear the old Persic names

Baron Silvestre de Sacyclarum et venerabile nomenis the chief
authority for the Arab provenance of The Nights Apparently founding his
observations upon Galland he is of opinion that the work as now
known was originally composed in Syria and written in the vulgar
dialect that it was never completed by the author whether he was
prevented by death or by other cause and that imitators endeavoured to
finish the work by inserting romances which were already known but which
formed no part of the original recueil such as the Travels of Sindbad
the Seaman the Book of the Seven Wazirs and others He accepts the
Persian scheme and cadre of the work but no more He contends that no
considerable body of prMohammedan or nonArabic fiction appears in the
actual texts and that all the tales even those dealing with
events localised in Persia India China and other infidel lands and
dated from anteislamitic ages mostly with the navest anachronism
confine themselves to depicting the people manners and customs of
Baghdad and Mosul Damascus and Cairo during the Abbaside epoch and he
makes a point of the whole being impregnated with the strongest and most
zealous spirit of Mohammedanism He points out that the language is the
popular or vulgar dialect differing widely from the classical and
literary that it contains many words in common modern use and that
generally it suggests the decadence of Arabian literature Of one tale
he remarksThe History of the loves of Camaralzaman and Budour
Princess of China is no more Indian or Persian than the others The
princes father has Moslems for subjects his mother is named Fatimah
and when imprisoned he solaces himself with reading the Koran The Genii
who interpose in these adventures are again those who had dealings
with Solomon In fine all that we here find of the City of the Magians
as well as of the fireworshippers suffices to show that one should not
expect to discover in it anything save the production of a Moslem
writer

All this with due deference to so high an authority is very
superficial Granted which nobody denies that the archetypal Hazr
Afsnah was translated from Persic into Arabic nearly a thousand years
ago it had ample time and verge enough to assume another and a foreign
dress the corpus however remaining untouched Under the hands of a host
of editors scribes and copyists who have no scruples anent changing
words names and dates abridging descriptions and attaching their own
decorations the florid and rhetorical Persian would readily be
converted into the straightforward businesslike matter of fact
Arabic And what easier than to islamise the old Zoroasterism to
transform Ahrimn into Ibls the Shaytn Jn bin Jn into Father Adam
and the Divs and Peris of Kayomars and the olden Guebre Kings into the
Jinns and Jinniyahs of Sulayman Volumes are spoken by the fact that the
Arab adapter did not venture to change the Persic names of the two
heroines and of the royal brothers or to transfer the miseenscne any
whither from Khorasan or outer Persia Where the story has not been too
much worked by the literatos pen for instance the Ten Wazirs in the
Bresl Edit vi  which is the Guebre Bakhtiyrnmah the names
and incidents are old Iranian and with few exceptions distinctly
Persian And at times we can detect the process of transition eg
when the Mzin of Khorsn of the Wortley Montagu MS becomes the
Hasan of Bassorah of the Turner Macan MS Mac Edit

Evidently the learned Baron had not studied such works as the
Totkahni or Parrotchat which notably translated by Nakhshabi from
the Sanskrit SukaSaptati has now become as orthodoxically Moslem
as The Nights The old Hindu Rajah becomes Ahmad Sultan of Balkh the
Prince is Maymn and his wife Khujisteh Another instance of such
radical change is the later Syriac version of Kallah wa Dimnah
old Pilpay converted to Christianity We find precisely the same
process in European folklore for instance the Gesta Romanorum in
which after five hundred years the life manners and customs of the
Romans lapse into the knightly and chivalrous the Christian and
ecclesiastical developments of medival Europe Here therefore I hold
that the Austrian Arabist has proved his point whilst the Frenchman has
failed

Mr Lane during his three years labour of translation first accepted
Von Hammers view and then came round to that of De Sacy differing
however in minor details especially in the native country of The
Nights Syria had been chosen because then the most familiar to
Europeans the Wife of Bath had made three pilgrimages to Jerusalem
but few cared to visit the barbarous and dangerous NileValley Mr
Lane however was an enthusiast for Egypt or rather for Cairo the only
part of it he knew and when he pronounces The Nights to be of purely
Arab that is of Nilotic origin his opinion is entitled to no more
deference than his deriving the subAfrican and negroid Fellah from
Arabia the land per excellentiam of pure and noble blood Other authors
have wandered still further afield Some finding Mosul idioms in the
Recueil propose Middlegates for its birthplace and Mr W G P
Palgrave boldly says The original of this entertaining work appears to
have been composed in Baghdad about the eleventh century another less
popular but very spirited version is probably of Tunisian authorship and
somewhat later


                              BTHE DATE

The next point to consider is the date of The Nights in its present
form and here opinions range between the tenth and the sixteenth
centuries Professor Galland began by placing it arbitrarily in the
middle of the thirteenth De Sacy who abstained from detailing reasons
and who forgetting the number of editors and scribes through whose
hands it must have passed argued only from the nature of the language
and the peculiarities of style proposed le milieu du neuvime sicle de
lhgire  AD  as its latest date Mr Hole who knew The
Nights only through Gallands version had already advocated in his
Remarks the close of the fifteenth century and M Caussin de
Perceval upon the authority of a supposed note in Gallands MS
vol iii fol  verso declares the compiler to have been living in
AD  and  Mr Lane says Not begun earlier than the last
fourth of the fifteenth century nor ended before the first fourth of the
sixteenth ie soon after Egypt was conquered by Selim Sultan of
the Osmanli Turks in AD  Lastly the learned Dr Weil says in his
far too scanty Vorwort p ix nd EditDas wahrscheinlichste drfte
also sein das im  Jahrhundert ein Egyptier nach altern Vorbilde
Erzhlungen fr  Nchte theils erdichtete theils nach mndlichen
Sagen oder frhern schriftlichen Aufzeichnungen bearbeitete dass er
aber entweder sein Werk nicht vollendete oder dass ein Theil desselben
verloren ging so dass das Fehlende von Andern bis ins  Jahrhundert
hinein durch neue Erzhlungen ergnzt wurde

But as justly observed by Mr Payne the first step when enquiring into
the original date of The Nights is to determine the nucleus of the
Repertory by a comparison of the four printed texts and the dozen MSS
which have been collated by scholars This process makes it evident
that the tales common to all are the following thirteen

   The Introduction with a single incidental story The Bull and the
       Ass

   The Trader and the Jinni with three incidentals

   The Fisherman and the Jinni with four

   The Porter and the three Ladies of Baghdad

   The Tale of the Three Apples

   The Tale of Nr alDn Ali and his son Badr alDn Hasan

   The Hunchbacks Tale with eleven

   Nur alDn and Ans alJals

   Tale of Ghnim bin Ayyb with two

  Al bin Bakkr and Shams alNahr with two

  Tale of Kamar alZamn

  The Ebony Horse and

  Julnr the Seaborn

These fortytwo tales occupying one hundred and twenty Nights form
less than a fifth part of the whole collection which in the Mac
Edit contains a total of two hundred and sixtyfour Hence Dr
Patrick Russell the Natural Historian of Aleppo whose
valuable monograph amply deserves study even in this our day believed
that the original Nights did not outnumber two hundred to which
subsequent writers added till the total of a thousand and one was made
up Dr Jonathan Scott who quotes Russell held it highly
probable that the tales of the original Arabian Nights did not run
through more than two hundred and eighty Nights if so many So this
suggestion I may subjoin habent sua fata libelli Galland who
preserves in his Mille et une Nuits only about one fourth of The Nights
ends them in No cclxiv with the seventh voyage of Sindbad after
that he intentionally omits the dialogue between the sisters and the
reckoning of time to proceed uninterruptedly with the tales And so his
imitator Petis de la Croix in his Mille et un Jours reduces the
thousand to two hundred and thirtytwo

The internal chronological evidence offered by the Collection is useful
only in enabling us to determine that the tales were not written after
a certain epoch the actual dates and consequently all deductions from
them are vitiated by the habits of the scribes For instance we find
the Tale of the Fisherman and the Jinni vol i  placed in AH 
 AD  which is hardly possible The immortal Barber in the
Tailors Tale vol i  places his adventure with the unfortunate
lover on Safar  AH   March th  and  years of the
era of Alexander This is supported in his Tale of Himself vol i
pp  where he dates his banishment from Baghdad during the
reign of the penultimate Abbaside AlMustansir bi llah AH
   and his return to Baghdad after the accession of
another Caliph who can be no other but AlMuntasim bi llah AH
  AD  Again at the end of the tale vol i  he
is described as an ancient man past his ninetieth year and a very
old man in the days of AlMustansir vol i  so that the
Hunchbacks adventure can hardly be placed earlier than AD  or
seven years after the storming of Baghdad by Hulku Khan successor of
Janghz Khan a terrible catastrophe which resounded throughout the
civilised world Yet there is no allusion to this crucial epoch and the
total silence suffices to invalidate the date Could we assume it
as true by adding to AD  half a century for the composition of
the Hunchbacks story and its incidentals we should place the earliest
date in AD 

As little can we learn from inferences which have been drawn from the
body of the book at most they point to its several editions or
redactions In the Tale of the Ensorcelled Prince vol i  Mr
Lane i  conjectured that the four colours of the fishes were
suggested by the sumptuary laws of the Mameluke Soldan Mohammed ibn
Kalaun subsequently to the commencement of the eighth century of the
Flight or fourteenth of our era But he forgets that the same
distinction of dress was enforced by the Caliph Omar after the capture
of Jerusalem in AD  that it was revived by Harun alRashid a
contemporary of Carolus Magnus and that it was noticed as a long
standing grievance by the socalled Mandeville in AD  In the Tale
of the Porter and the Ladies of Baghdad the Sultni oranges vol i
 have been connected with Sultnyah city in Persian Irk which was
founded about the middle of the thirteenth century but Sultni may
simply mean royal a superior growth The same story makes mention
vol i  of Kalandars or religious mendicants a term popularly
corrupted even in writing to Karandal Here again Kalandar may
be due only to the scribes as the Bresl Edit reads Saalk  asker
beggar The Khan alMasrr in the Nazarene Brokers story i  was a
ruin during the early ninth century AH  AD  but the Bb
Zuwaylah i  dates from AD  In the same tale occurs the Darb
alMunkari or Munakkari which is probably the Darb alMunkadi of
AlMakrizis careful topography the Khitat ii  Here we learn that
in his time about AD  the name had become obsolete and the
highway was known as Darb alAmr Baktamr alUstaddar from one of two
high officials who both died in the fourteenth century circ AD
 And lastly we have the Khan alJwali built about AD  In
Badr alDin Hasan vol i  Shib is given as a Wazirial title and
it dates only from the end of the fourteenth century In Sindbad
the Seaman there is an allusion vol vi  to the great Hindu
Kingdom Vijayanagar of the Narasimha the great power of the
Deccan but this may be due to editors or scribes as the despotism was
founded only in the fourteenth century AD  The Ebony Horse
vol v  apparently dates before Chaucer and The Sleeper and The
Waker Bresl Edit iv  may precede Shakespeares Taming of
the Shrew no stress however can be laid upon such resemblances the
nouvelles being worldwide But when we come to the last stories
especially to Kamar alZaman II and the tale of Maarf we are
apparently in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries The first contains
Night cmlxxvii the word Lwandiyah  Levantine the mention of a
watch  Sah in the next Night and further on cmlxxvi the
Shaykh AlIslam an officer invented by Mohammed II after the capture
of Stambul in AD  In Maarf the diliyah is named the mosque
founded outside the Bab alNasr by AlMalik aldil Tmn Bey in AH
  AD  But I repeat all these names may be mere
interpolations

On the other hand a study of the vie intime in AlIslam and of the
manners and customs of the people proves that the body of the work as
it now stands must have been written before AD  The Arabs use
wines ciders and barleybeer not distilled spirits they have no
coffee or tobacco and while familiar with smallpox judr they
ignore syphilis The battles in The Nights are fought with bows and
javelins swords spears for infantry and lances for cavalry and
whenever firearms are mentioned we must suspect the scribe Such is
the case with the Madfa or cannon by means of which Badr alDin Hasan
breaches the bulwarks of the Lady of Beautys virginity i  This
consideration would determine the work to have been written before the
fourteenth century We ignore the inventiondate and the inventor of
gunpowder as of all old discoveries which have affected mankind at
large all we know is that the popular ideas betray great ignorance and
we are led to suspect that an explosive compound having been discovered
in the earliest ages of human society was utilised by steps so gradual
that history has neglected to trace the series According to
Demmin bullets for stuffing with some incendiary composition in
fact bombs were discovered by Dr Keller in the Palafites or Crannogs
of Switzerland and the Hindus AgniAstar fireweapon Agnibn
firearrow and Shatagni hundredkiller like the Roman
Phalarica and the Greek fire of Byzantium suggest explosives Indeed
Dr Oppert accepts the statement of Flavius Philostratus that when
Appolonius of Tyana that grand semimythical figure was travelling in
India he learned the reason why Alexander of Macedon desisted from
attacking the Oxydrac who live between the Ganges and the Hyphasis
Satadru or SutledgeThese holy men beloved by the gods overthrow
their enemies with tempests and thunderbolts shot from their walls
Passing over the Arab sieges of Constantinople AD  and Meccah
AD  and the disputed passage in Firishtah touching the Tufang or
musket during the reign of Mahmd the Ghaznevite ob AD 
we come to the days of Alphonso the Valiant whose long and short guns
used at the Siege of Madrid in AD  are preserved in the Armeria
Real Viardot has noted that the African Arabs first employed cannon in
AD  and that the Maghribis defended Algeciras near Gibraltar with
great guns in AD  and utilised them to besiege Seville in AD
 This last feat of arms introduced the cannon into barbarous
Northern Europe and it must have been known to civilised Asia for many
a decade before that date

The mention of wine in The Nights especially the Nabz or fermented
infusion of raisins well known to the prMohammedan Badawis
perpetually recurs As a rule except only in the case of holy
personages and mostly of the Caliph AlRashid the service of wine
appears immediately after the hands are washed and women as well as
men drink like true Orientals for the honest purpose of getting
drunkla recherche de lidal as the process has been called Yet
distillation became well known in the fourteenth century Amongst the
Greeks and Romans it was confined to manufacturing aromatic waters and
Nicander the poet BC  used for a still the term  like the
Irish pot and its produce poteen The simple art of converting salt
water into fresh by boiling the former and passing the steam through a
cooled pipe into a recipient would not have escaped the students of the
Philosophers stone and thus we find throughout Europe the Arabic
modifications of Greek terms Alchemy Alembic Al Chemistry and
Elixir while Alcohol AlKohl originally meaning extreme tenuity
or impalpable state of pulverulent substances clearly shows the origin
of the article Avicenna who died in AH    nearly two
hundred years before we read of distillation in Europe compared the
human body with an alembic the belly being the cucurbit and the head
the capitalhe forgot one important difference but nimporte Spirits
of wine were first noticed in the xiiith century when the Arabs had
overrun the Western Mediterranean by Arnaldus de Villa Nova who dubs
the new invention a universal panacea and his pupil Raymond Lully
nat Majorca AD  declared this essence of wine to be a boon
from the Deity Now The Nights even in the latest adjuncts never
allude to the white coffee of the respectable Moslem the Rki
raisinbrandy or Mahayt aqua vit of the modern Mohametan the
drinkers confine themselves to wine like our contemporary Dalmatians
one of the healthiest and the most vigorous of seafaring races in
Europe

Syphilis also which at the end of the xvth century began to infect
Europe is ignored by The Nights I do not say it actually began
diseases do not begin except with the dawn of humanity and their
history as far as we know is simple enough They are at first sporadic
and comparatively nonlethal at certain epochs which we can determine
and for reasons which as yet we cannot they break out into epidemics
raging with frightful violence they then subside into the endemic state
and lastly they return to the milder sporadic form For instance
English cholera was known of old in  Oct  the Asiatic type
took its place and now after sundry violent epidemics the disease is
becoming endemic on the Northern seaboard of the Mediterranean notably
in Spain and Italy So smallpox Aljudr vol i  passed over
from Central Africa to Arabia in the year of Mohammeds birth AD 
and thence overspread the civilised world as an epidemic an endemic
and a sporadic successively The Greater Pox has appeared in human
bones of prehistoric graves and Moses seems to mention gonorrha Levit
xv  Passing over allusions in Juvenal and Martial we find
Eusebius relating that Galerius died AD  of ulcers on the
genitals and other parts of his body and about a century afterwards
Bishop Palladius records that one Hero after conversation with a
prostitute fell a victim to an abscess on the penis phagednic
shanker In  the famous Joanna of Naples founded t  in her
town of Avignon a bordel whose inmates were to be medically inspecteda
measure to which England proh pudor still objects In her Statuts du
Lieupublique dAvignon No iv she expressly mentions the Mal vengut
de paillardise Such houses says Ricord who studied the subject since
 were common in France after AD  and sporadic venereals were
known there But in AD  an epidemic broke out with alarming
intensity at Barcelona as we learn from the Tractado llamado fructo de
todos los Sanctos contra el mal serpentino venido de la Isla espanola
of Rodrigo Ruiz Das the specialist In Santo Domingo the disease was
common under the names Hipas Guaynaras and Taynastizas hence the
opinion in Europe that it arose from the mixture of European and
Indian blood Some attributed it to the Gypsies who migrated to
Western Europe in the xvth century others to the Moriscos expelled
from Spain But the pest got its popular name after the violent outbreak
at Naples in AD  when Charles VIII of Anjou with a large army
of mercenaries Frenchmen Spaniards and Germans attacked Ferdinand
II Thence it became known as the Mal de Naples and Morbus Gallicusuna
gallica being still the popular term in neoLatin landsand the French
disease in England As early as July  Marin Sanuto Journal i 
describes with details the Mal Franzoso The scientific syphilis
dates from Fracastoris poem AD  in which Syphilus the Shepherd
is struck like Job for abusing the sun After crippling a Pope Sixtus
IV and killing a King Francis I the Grosse Vrole began to
abate its violence under the effects of mercury it is said and became
endemic a stage still shown at Scherlievo near Fiume where legend says
it was implanted by the Napoleonic soldiery The Aleppo and other
buttons also belong apparently to the same grade Elsewhere it settled
as a sporadic and now it appears to be dying out while gonorrha is on
the increase

The Nights I have said belongs to the days before coffee AD 
and tobacco AD  had overspread the East The former which
derives its name from the Kf or Kff province lying south of
Abyssinia proper and peopled by the Sidma Gallas was introduced to
Mokha of AlYaman in AD  by the Shaykh alShzili who lies
buried there and found a congenial name in the Arabic Kahwah  old
wine In The Nights Mac Edit it is mentioned twelve times
but never in the earlier tales except in the case of Kamar alZaman II
it evidently does not belong to the epoch and we may fairly suspect the
scribe In the xvith century coffee began to take the place of wine in
the nearer East and it gradually ousted the classical drink from daily
life and from folktales

It is the same with tobacco which is mentioned only once by The Nights
cmxxxi in conjunction with meat vegetables and fruit and where it
is called Tbah Lane iii  holds it to be the work of a copyist
but in the same tale of Abu Kir and Abu Sir sherbet and coffee appear
to have become en vogue in fact to have gained the ground they now
hold The result of Lord Macartneys Mission to China was a suggestion
that smoking might have originated spontaneously in the Old World
This is undoubtedly true The Bushmen and other wild tribes of Southern
Africa threw their Dakh cannabis indica on the fire and sat round
it inhaling the intoxicating fumes Smoking without tobacco was easy
enough The North American Indians of the Great Red Pipe Stone Quarry
and those who lived above the line where nicotiana grew used the
kinnikinik or bark of the red willow and some seven other
succedanea But tobacco proper which soon superseded all materials
except hemp and opium was first adopted by the Spaniards of Santo
Domingo in AD  and reached England in  Hence the word which
amongst the socalled Red Men denoted the pipe the container not the
contained spread over the Old World as a generic term with additions
like Tutun for especial varieties The change in English manners
brought about by the cigar after dinner has already been noticed and
much of the modified sobriety of the present day may be attributed to
the influence of the Holy Herb en cigarette Such we know from history
was its effect amongst Moslems and the normal wineparties of The
Nights suggest that the pipe was unknown even when the latest tales were
written


                                   C

We know absolutely nothing of the author or authors who produced our
marvellous Recueil Galland justly observes Epist Dedic probably
this great work is not by a single hand for how can we suppose that one
man alone could own a fancy fertile enough to invent so many ingenious
fictions Mr Lane and Mr Lane alone opined that the work was
written in Egypt by one person or at most by two one ending what the
other had begun and that he or they had rewritten the tales and
completed the collection by new matter composed or arranged for the
purpose It is hard to see how the distinguished Arabist came to such a
conclusion at most it can be true only of the editors and scribes of
MSS evidently copied from each other such as the Mac and the Bul
texts As the Reviewer Forbes Falconer in the Asiatic Journal vol
xxx  says Every step we have taken in the collation of these
agreeable fictions has confirmed us in the belief that the work called
the Arabian Nights is rather a vehicle for stories partly fixed and
partly arbitrary than a collection fairly deserving from its constant
identity with itself the name of a distinct work and the reputation of
having wholly emanated from the same inventive mind To say nothing of
the improbability of supposing that one individual with every license
to build upon the foundation of popular stories a work which had once
received a definite form from a single writer would have been
multiplied by the copyist with some regard at least to his arrangement
of words as well as matter But the various copies we have seen bear
about as much mutual resemblance as if they had passed through the
famous process recommended for disguising a plagiarism Translate your
English author into French and again into English

Moreover the style of the several Tales which will be considered in a
future page  iii so far from being homogeneous is heterogeneous in
the extreme Different nationalities show themselves West Africa Egypt
and Syria are all represented and while some authors are intimately
familiar with Baghdad Damascus and Cairo others are equally ignorant
All copies written and printed absolutely differ in the last tales and
a measure of the divergence can be obtained by comparing the Bresl
Edit with the Mac text indeed it is my conviction that the MSS
preserved in Europe would add sundry volumes full of tales to those
hitherto translated and here the Wortley Montagu copy can be taken as a
test We may I believe safely compare the history of The Nights with
the socalled Homeric poems the Iliad and the Odyssey a collection of
immortal ballads and old Epic formul and verses traditionally handed
down from rhapsode to rhapsode incorporated in a slowlyincreasing body
of poetry and finally welded together about the age of Pericles

To conclude From the data above given I hold myself justified in
drawing the following deductions

   The framework of the book is purely Persian perfunctorily
  Arabised the archetype being the Hazr Afsnah

   The oldest tales such as Sindibad the Seven Wazirs and King
  Jilid may date from the reign of AlMansur eighth century AD

   The thirteen tales mentioned above p  as the nucleus of the
  Repertory together with Dalilah the Crafty may be placed in
  our tenth century

   The latest tales notably Kamar alZaman the Second and Maaruf
  the Cobbler are as late as the sixteenth century

   The work assumed its present form in the thirteenth century

   The author is unknown for the best reason there never was one
  for information touching the editors and copyists we must await the
  fortunate discovery of some MSS

                         THE NIGHTS IN EUROPE

The history of The Nights in Europe is one of slow and gradual
development The process was begun  by Galland a Frenchman
continued  by Von Hammer an AustroGerman and finished by Mr
John Payne  an Englishman But we must not forget that it is
wholly and solely to the genius of the Gaul that Europe owes The
Arabian Nights Entertainments over which Western childhood and youth
have spent so many spelling hours Antoine Galland was the first to
discover the marvellous fund of material for the storyteller buried in
the Oriental mine and he had in a high degree that art of telling a
tale which is far more captivating than culture or scholarship Hence
his delightful version or perversion became one of the worlds
classics and at once made Sheherazade and Dinarzarde Haroun Alraschid
the Calendars and a host of other personages as familiar to the home
reader as Prospero Robinson Crusoe Lemuel Gulliver and Dr Primrose
Without the name and fame won for the work by the brilliant paraphrase
of the learned and singleminded Frenchman Lanes curious hash and
latinized English at once turgid and emasculated would have found few
readers Mr Paynes admirable version appeals to the Orientalist and
the stylist not to the manyheaded and mine to the anthropologist
and student of Eastern manners and customs Galland did it and alone he
did it his fine literary flaire his pleasing style his polished
taste and perfect tact at once made his work take high rank in the
republic of letters nor will the immortal fragment ever be superseded in
the infallible judgment of childhood As the Encyclopdia Britannica has
been pleased to ignore this excellent man and admirable Orientalist
numismatologist and littrateur the reader may not be unwilling to see
a short sketch of his biography

Antoine Galland was born in AD  of peasant parents poor and
honest at Rollot a little bourg in Picardy some two leagues from
Montdidier He was a seventh child and his mother left a widow in early
life and compelled to earn her livelihood saw scant chance of educating
him when the kindly assistance of a Canon of the Cathedral and President
of the Collge de Noyon relieved her difficulties In this establishment
Galland studied Greek and Hebrew for ten years after which the strait
thing at home apprenticed him to a trade But he was made for letters
he hated manual labour and he presently removed en cachette to Paris
where he knew only an ancient kinswoman She introduced him to a
priestly relative of the Canon of Noyon who in turn recommended him to
the Sousprincipal of the Collge Du Plessis Here he made such
notable progress in Oriental studies that M Petitpied a Doctor of the
Sorbonne struck by his abilities enabled him to study at the Collge
Royal and eventually to catalogue the Eastern MSS in the great
ecclesiastical Society Thence he passed to the Collge Mazarin where a
Professor M Godouin was making an experiment which might be revived
to advantage in our present schools He collected a class of boys aged
about four and proposed to teach them Latin speedily and easily by
making them converse in the classical language as well as read and write
it Galland his assistant had not time to register success or
failure before he was appointed attachsecretary to M de Nointel named
in  Ambassadeur de France for Constantinople His special province
was to study the dogmas and doctrines and to obtain official
attestations concerning the articles of the Orthodox or Greek
Christianity which had then been a subject of lively discussion amongst
certain Catholics especially Arnauld Antoine and Claude the Minister
and which even in our day occasionally crops up amongst
Protestants Galland by frequenting the cafs and listening to
the taleteller soon mastered Romaic and grappled with the religious
question under the tuition of a deposed Patriarch and of sundry Matrns
or Metropolitans whom the persecutions of the Pashas had driven for
refuge to the Palais de France M de Nointel after settling certain
knotty points in the Capitulations visited the harbourtowns of the
Levant and the Holy Places including Jerusalem where Galland copied
epigraphs sketched monuments and collected antiques such as the
marbles in the Baudelot Gallery of which Pre Dom Bernard de Montfaucon
presently published specimens in his Palographia Grca etc
Parisiis 

In Syria Galland was unable to buy a copy of The Nights as he expressly
states in his Epistle Dedicatory il a fallu le faire venir de Syrie
But he prepared himself for translating it by studying the manners and
customs the religion and superstitions of the people and in 
leaving his chief who was ordered back to Stambul he returned to
France In Paris his numismatic fame recommended him to MM Vaillant
Carcary and Giraud who strongly urged a second visit to the Levant for
the purpose of collecting and he set out without delay In  he made
a third journey travelling at the expense of the Compagnie des
IndesOrientales with the main object of making purchases for the
Library and Museum of Colbert the magnificent The commission ended
eighteen months afterwards with the changes of the Company when Colbert
and the Marquis de Louvois caused him to be created Antiquary to the
King Louis le Grand and charged him with collecting coins and medals
for the royal cabinet As he was about to leave Smyrna he had a narrow
escape from the earthquake and subsequent fire which destroyed some
fifteen thousand of the inhabitants he was buried in the ruins but
his kitchen being cold as becomes a philosophers he was dug out
unburnt

Galland again returned to Paris where his familiarity with Arabic and
Hebrew Persian and Turkish recommended him to MM Thevenot and Bignon
this first President of the Grand Council acknowledged his services by a
pension He also became a favourite with DHerbelot whose Bibliothque
Orientale left unfinished at his death he had the honour of completing
and prefacing President Bignon died within the twelvemonth which
made Galland attach himself in  to M Foucault Councillor of State
and Intendant governor of Caen in Lower Normandy then famous for its
academy in his new patrons fine library and numismatic collection he
found materials for a long succession of works including a translation
of the Koran They recommended him strongly to the literary world
and in  he was made a member of the Acadmie des Inscriptions et
Belles Lettres

At Caen Galland issued in  the first part of his Mille et une
Nuits Contes Arabes traduits en Franois which at once became famous as
The Arabian Nights Entertainments Mutilated fragmentary and
paraphrastic though the tales were the glamour of imagination the
marvel of the miracles and the gorgeousness and magnificence of the
scenery at once secured an exceptional success it was a revelation in
romance and the public recognised that it stood in presence of a
monumental literary work France was afire with delight at a something
so new so unconventional so entirely without purpose religious moral
or philosophical the Oriental wanderer in his stately robes was a
startling surprise to the easygoing and utterly corrupt Europe of the
ancien rgime with its indecently tight garments and perfectly loose
morals Ils produisirent said Charles Nodier a genius in his way
ds le moment de leur publication cet effet qui assure aux productions
de lesprit une vogue populaire quoiquils appartinssent  une
littrature peu connue en France et que ce genre de composition admt
ou plutt exiget des dtails de moeurs de caractre de costume et de
localits absolument trangers  toutes les ides tablies dans nos
contes et nos romans On fut tonn du charme qui rsultait de leur
lecture Cest que la vrit des sentimens la nouveaut des tableaux
une imagination fconde en prodiges un coloris plein de chaleur
lattrait dune sensibilit sans prtention et le sel dun comique sans
caricature cest que lesprit et le naturel enfin plaisent partout et
plaisent  tout le monde

The Contes Arabes at once made Gallands name and a popular tale is told
of them and him known to all reviewers who however mostly mangle it
In the Biographie Universelle of Michaud we findDans les deux
premiers volumes de ces contes lexorde tait toujours Ma chre sur
si vous ne dormez pas faitesnous un de ces contes que vous savez
Quelques jeunes gens ennuys de cette plate uniformit allrent une
nuit quil faisait trsgrand froid frapper  la porte de lauteur qui
courut en chemise  sa fentre Aprs lavoir fait morfondre quelque
temps par diverses questions insignifiantes ils terminrent en lui
disant Ah Monsieur Galland si vous ne dormez pas faitesnous un de
ces beaux contes que vous savez si bien Galland profita de la leon
et supprima dans les volumes suivants le prambule qui lui avait attir
la plaisanterie This legend has the merit of explaining why the
Professor so soon gave up the Arab framework which he had deliberately
adopted

The Nights was at once translated from the French though when
where and by whom no authority seems to know In Lowndes
Bibliographers Manual the English Editio Princeps is thus noticed
Arabian Nights Entertainments translated from the French London
 mo  vols and a footnote states that this translation very
inaccurate and vulgar in its diction was often reprinted In 
Addison introduced into the Spectator No  Nov  the Story of
Alnaschar  AlNashshr the Sawyer and says that his remarks on Hope
may serve as a moral to an Arabian tale which I find translated into
French by Monsieur Galland His version appears from the tone and
style to have been made by himself and yet in that year a second
English edition had appeared The nearest approach to the Edit Princeps
in the British Museum is a set of six volumes bound in three and
corresponding with Gallands first half dozen Tomes i and ii are from
the fourth edition of  Nos iii and iv are from the second of
 and v and vi are from the third of  It is conjectured that
the two first volumes were reprinted several times apart from their
subsequents as was the fashion of the day but all is mystery We my
friends and I have turned over scores of books in the British Museum
the University Library and the Advocates Libraries of Edinburgh and
Glasgow I have been permitted to put the question in Notes and
Queries and in the Antiquary but all our researches hitherto have
been in vain

The popularity of The Nights in England must have rivalled their vogue
in France judging from the fact that in  or nine years after
Gallands Edit Prin appeared they had already reached a fourth issue
Even the ignoble national jealousy which prompted Sir William Jones
grossly to abuse that valiant scholar Auquetil du Perron could not mar
their popularity But as there are men who cannot read Pickwick so they
were not wanting who spoke of Dreams of the distempered fancy of the
East When the work was first published in England says Henry
Webber it seems to have made a considerable impression upon the
public Pope in  sent two volumes French or English to Bishop
Atterbury without making any remark on the work but from his very
silence it may be presumed that he was not displeased with the perusal
The bishop who does not appear to have joined a relish for the flights
of imagination to his other estimable qualities expressed his dislike
of these tales pretty strongly and stated it to be his opinion formed
on the frequent descriptions of female dress that they were the work of
some Frenchman Petis de la Croix a mistake afterwards corrected by
Warburton The Arabian Nights however quickly made their way to
public favour We have been informed of a singular instance of the
effect they produced soon after their first appearance Sir James
Stewart Lord Advocate for Scotland having one Saturday evening found
his daughters employed in reading these volumes seized them with a
rebuke for spending the evening before the Sawbbath in such worldly
amusement but the grave advocate himself became a prey to the
fascination of the tales being found on the morning of the Sabbath
itself employed in their perusal from which he had not risen the whole
night As late as  Dr Beattie professed himself uncertain whether
they were translated or fabricated by M Galland and while Dr Pusey
wrote of them Noctes Mille et Una dict qu in omnium firm populorum
cultiorum linguas convers in deliciis omnium habentur manibusque
omnium terentur the amiable Carlyle in the gospel according to
Saint Froude characteristically termed them downright lies and
forbade the house to such unwholesome literature What a sketch of
character in two words

The only fault found in France with the Contes Arabes was that their
style is peu correcte in fact they want classicism Yet all Gallic
imitators Trbutien included have carefully copied their leader and
Charles Nodier remarksIl me semble que lon na pas rendu assez de
justice au style de Galland Abondant sans tre prolixe naturel et
familier sans tre lche ni trivial il ne manque jamais de cette
lgance qui rsulte de la facilit et qui prsente je ne sais quel
mlange de la navet de Perrault et de la bonhomie de La Fontaine

Our Professor with a name now thoroughly established returned in 
to Paris where he was an assiduous and efficient member of the Socit
Numismatique and corresponded largely with foreign Orientalists Three
years afterwards he was made Professor of Arabic at the Collge de
France succeeding Pierre Dippy and during the next half decade he
devoted himself to publishing his valuable studies Then the end came
In his last illness an attack of asthma complicated with pectoral
mischief he sent to Noyon for his nephew Julien Galland to assist
him in ordering his MSS and in making his will after the simplest
military fashion he bequeathed his writings to the Bibliothque du Roi
his Numismatic Dictionary to the Academy and his Alcoran to the Abb
Bignon He died aged sixtynine on February   leaving his
second Part of The Nights unpublished

Professor Galland was a French littrateur of the good old school which
is rapidly becoming extinct Homme vrai dans les moindres choses as his
loge stated simple in life and manners and singlehearted in his
devotion to letters he was almost childish in worldly matters while
notable for penetration and acumen in his studies He would have been as
happy one of his biographers remarks in teaching children the elements
of education as he was in acquiring his immense erudition Briefly
truth and honesty exactitude and indefatigable industry characterised
his most honourable career

Galland informs us Epist Ded that his MS consisted of four volumes
only three of which are extant bringing the work down to Night
cclxxxii or about the beginning of Camaralzaman The missing
portion if it contained like the other volumes  pages would end
that tale together with the Stories of Ghnim and the Enchanted Ebony
Horse and such is the disposition in the Bresl Edit which mostly
favours in its ordinance the text used by the first translator But this
would hardly have filled more than twothirds of his volumes for the
other third he interpolated or is supposed to have interpolated the
ten following tales

   Histoire du prince Zeyn Alasnam et du Roi des Gnies

   Histoire de Codadad et de ses frres

   Histoire de la Lampe merveilleuse Aladdin

   Histoire de laveugle Baba Abdalla

   Histoire de Sidi Nouman

   Histoire de Cogia Hassan Alhabbal

   Histoire dAli Baba et de Quarante Voleurs extermins par une
       Esclave

   Histoire dAli Cogia marchand de Bagdad

   Histoire du prince Ahmed et de la fe PeriBanou

  Histoire de deux Surs jalouses de leur Cadette

Concerning these interpolations which contain two of the best and most
widely known stories in the work Aladdin and the Forty Thieves
conjectures have been manifold but they mostly run upon three lines De
Sacy held that they were found by Galland in the public libraries of
Paris Mr Chenery whose acquaintance with Arabic grammar was ample
suggested that the Professor had borrowed them from the recitations of
the Rawis rhapsodists or professional storytellers in the bazars of
Smyrna and other ports of the Levant The late Mr Henry Charles Coote
in the FolkLore Record vol iii Part ii p  et seq On the
source of some of M Gallands Tales quotes from popular Italian
Sicilian and Romaic stories incidents identical with those in Prince
Ahmad Aladdin Ali Baba and the Envious Sisters suggesting that the
Frenchman had heard these paramythia in Levantine coffeehouses and
had inserted them into his unequalled corpus fabularum Mr Payne ix
 conjectures the probability of their having been composed at a
comparatively recent period by an inhabitant of Baghdad in imitation of
the legends of Haroun er Rashid and other wellknown tales of the
original work and adds It is possible that an exhaustive examination
of the various MS copies of the Thousand and One Nights known to exist
in the public libraries of Europe might yet cast some light upon the
question of the origin of the interpolated Tales I quite agree with
him taking The Sleeper and the Waker and Zeyn Alasnam as cases in
point but I should expect for reasons before given to find the
stories in a Persic rather than an Arabic MS And I feel convinced that
all will be recovered Galland was not the man to commit a literary
forgery

As regards Aladdin the most popular tale of the whole work I am
convinced that it is genuine although my unfortunate friend the late
Professor Palmer doubted its being an Eastern story It is laid down
upon all the lines of Oriental fiction The miseenscne is China
where they drink a certain warm liquor tea the heros father is a
poor tailor and as in Judar and his Brethren the Maghribi Magician
presently makes his appearance introducing the Wonderful Lamp and the
Magical Ring Even the Sorcerers cry New lamps for old lampsa
prime pointis paralleled in the Tale of the Fishermans son where
the Jew asks in exchange only old rings and the Princess recollecting
that her husband kept a shabby wellworn ring in his writingstand and
he being asleep took it out and sent it to the man In either tale the
palace is transported to a distance and both end with the death of the
wicked magician and the hero and heroine living happily together ever
after

All Arabists have remarked the sins of omission and commission of
abridgment amplification and substitution and the audacious distortion
of fact and phrase in which Galland freely indulged whilst his
knowledge of Eastern languages proves that he knew better But literary
license was the order of his day and at that time French always the
most bgueule of European languages was bound by a rigorisme of the
narrowest and the straightest of lines from which the least cart
condemned a man as a barbarian and a tudesque If we consider Galland
fairly we shall find that he errs mostly for a purpose that of
popularising his work and his success indeed justified his means He
has been derided by scholars for H Monsieur and Ah Madame but
he could not write O mon sieur and O ma dame although we can borrow
from biblical and Shakespearean English O my lord and O my lady
Bon Dieu ma sur which our translators english by O heavens Night

Maimune are hardly what a Jinni would say to a Jinniyah ccxiii but

the false note struck in two passages Je mestimais heureuse davoir

horrible que le visage Night clvii is a mere affectation of
Orientalism Lastly Une vieille dame de leur connaissance Night
clviii puts French polish upon the matter of fact Arabs an old

The list of absolute mistakes not including violent liberties can
hardly be held excessive Professor Weil and Mr Payne ix  justly
charge Galland with making the Trader Night i throw away the shells
corces of the date which has only a pellicle as Galland certainly
knew but dates were not seen every day in France while almonds and
walnuts were of the quatre mendiants He preserves the corces which
later issues have changed to noyaux probably in allusion to the jerking
practice called Inw Again in the First Shaykhs Story vol i 
the maillet is mentioned as the means of slaughtering cattle because
familiar to European readers at the end of the tale it becomes le
couteau funeste In Badr alDin a tarte  la crme so well known to
the West displaces naturally enough the outlandish mess of
pomegranateseeds Though the text especially tells us the hero removed
his bagtrousers not only son habit and placed them under the

fully dressed apparently for the purpose of informing his readers in a
footnote that Easterns se couchent en caleon Night lxxx It was
mere ignorance to confound the arbalte or crossbow with the stonebow
Night xxxviii but this has universally been done even by Lane who
ought to have known better and it was an unpardonable carelessness or
something worse to turn Nr fire and Dn in lieu of into le faux

Lle de la Lune Dog and dogson are not injures atroces et
indignes dun grand roi the greatest Eastern kings allow themselves
far more energetic and significant language Fitnah is by no means
Force de curs Lastly the dnoement of The Nights is widely
different in French and in Arabic but that is probably not Gallands
fault as he never saw the original and indeed he deserves high praise
for having invented so pleasant and sympathetic a close inferior only
to the Oriental device

Gallands fragment has a strange effect upon the Orientalist and those
who take the scholastic view be it wide or narrow De Sacy does not
hesitate to say that the work owes much to his fellowcountrymans hand
but I judge otherwise it is necessary to dissociate the two works and
to regard Gallands paraphrase which contains only a quarter of The
Thousand Nights and a Night as a wholly different book Its attempts to
amplify beauties and to correct or conceal the defects and the
grotesqueness of the original absolutely suppress much of the local
colour clothing the bare body in the best of Parisian suits It ignores
the rhymed prose and excludes the verse rarely and very rarely
rendering a few lines in a balanced style It generally rejects the
proverbs epigrams and moral reflections which form the pith and marrow
of the book and worse still it disdains those finer touches of
character which are often Shakespearean in their depth and delicacy and
which applied to a race of familiar ways and thoughts manners and
customs would have been the wonder and delight of Europe It shows only
a single side of the gem that has so many facets By deference to public
taste it was compelled to expunge the often repulsive simplicity the
childish indecencies and the wild orgies of the original contrasting
with the gorgeous tints the elevated morality and the religious tone of
passages which crowd upon them We miss the odeur du sang which taints
the parfums du harem also the humouristic tale and the Rabelaisian
outbreak which relieve and throw out into strong relief the splendour of
Empire and the havoc of Time Considered in this light it is a caput
mortuum a magnificent texture seen on the wrong side and it speaks
volumes for the genius of the man who could recommend it in such blurred
and caricatured condition to readers throughout the civilised world But
those who look only at Gallands picture his effort to transplant into
European gardens the magic flowers of Eastern fancy still compare his
tales with the sudden prospect of magnificent mountains seen after a
long desertmarch they arouse strange longings and indescribable
desires their marvellous imaginativeness produces an insensible
brightening of mind and an increase of fancypower making one dream
that behind them lies the new and unseen the strange and unexpectedin
fact all the glamour of the unknown

The Nights has been translated into every farextending Eastern tongue
Persian Turkish and Hindostani The latter entitles them Hikyt
alJallah or Noble Tales and the translation was made by Munshi Shams
alDin Ahmad for the use of the College of Fort George in AH  
 All these versions are direct from the Arabic my search for
a translation of Galland into any Eastern tongue has hitherto been
fruitless

I was assured by the late Bertholdy Seemann that the language of
Hoffmann and Heine contained a literal and complete translation of The
Nights but personal enquiries at Leipzig and elsewhere convinced me
that the work still remains to be done The first attempt to improve
upon Galland and to show the world what the work really is was made by
Dr Max Habicht and was printed at Breslau  in fifteen small
square volumes Thus it appeared before the Tunis Manuscript
of which it purports to be a translation The German version is if
possible more condemnable than the Arabic original It lacks every
charm of style it conscientiously shirks every difficulty it abounds
in the most extraordinary blunders and it is utterly useless as a
picture of manners or a book of reference We can explain its lches
only by the theory that the eminent Professor left the labour to his
collaborateurs and did not take the trouble to revise their careless
work

The next German translation was by Aulic Councillor J von
HammerPurgstall who during his short stay at Cairo and
Constantinople turned into French the tales neglected by Galland After
some difference with M Caussin de Perceval in  the Styrian
Orientalist entrusted his MS to Herr Cotta the publisher of Tubingen
Thus a German version appeared the translation of a translation at the
hand of Professor Zinserling while the French version was
unaccountably lost en route to London Finally the Contes indits
etc appeared in a French translation by G S Trbutien Paris
mdcccxxviii Von Hammer took liberties with the text which can compare
only with those of Lane he abridged and retrenched till the likeness in
places entirely disappeared he shirked some difficult passages and he
misexplained others In fact the work did no honour to the amiable and
laborious historian of the Turks

The only good German translation of The Nights is due to Dr Gustav Weil
who born on April   is still  professing at
Heidelburg His originals he tells us were the Breslau Edition
the Bulak text of Abd alRahman alSafati and a MS in the library of
Saxe Gotha The venerable savant who has rendered such service to
Arabism informs me that Aug Lewalds Vorhalle pp ixv was
written without his knowledge Dr Weil neglects the division of days
which enables him to introduce any number of tales for instance
Gallands eleven occupy a large part of vol iii The Vorwort wants
development the notes confined to a few words are inadequate and
verse is everywhere rendered by prose the Saja or assonance being
wholly ignored On the other hand the scholar shows himself by a correct
translation contrasting strongly with those which preceded him and by
a strictly literal version save where the treatment required to be
modified in a book intended for the public Under such circumstances it
cannot well be other than longsome and monotonous reading

Although Spain and Italy have produced many and remarkable Orientalists
I cannot find that they have taken the trouble to translate The Nights
for themselves cheap and gaudy versions of Galland seem to have
satisfied the public Notes on the Romaic Icelandic Russian 
and other versions will be found in a future page

Professor Galland has never been forgotten in France where amongst a
host of editions four have claims to distinction and his success
did not fail to create a host of imitators and to attract what De Sacy
justly terms une prodigieuse importation de marchandise de
contrebande As early as  Von Hammer numbered seven in France
Trbutien Prface xviii and during later years they have grown
prodigiously Mr William F Kirby who has made a special study of the
subject has favoured me with detailed bibliographical notes on
Gallands imitators which are printed in Appendix No II


                                  III
                THE MATTER AND THE MANNER OF THE NIGHTS


                             ATHE MATTER

Returning to my threefold distribution of this Prose Poem  I into
Fable Fairy Tale and historical Anecdote let me proceed to
consider these sections more carefully

The Apologue or Beastfable which apparently antedates all other
subjects in The Nights has been called One of the earliest creations
of the awakening consciousness of mankind I should regard it despite
a monumental antiquity as the offspring of a comparatively civilised
age when a jealous despotism or a powerful oligarchy threw difficulties
and dangers in the way of speaking plain truths A hint can be given
and a friend or foe can be lauded or abused as Belins the sheep or
Isengrim the wolf when the Author is debarred the higher enjoyment of
praising them or dispraising them by name And as the purposes of
fables are twofold

               Duplex libelli dos est quod risum movet
               Et quod prudenti vitam consilio monet

The speaking of brute beasts would give a piquancy and a pleasantry to
moral design as well as to social and political satire

The literary origin of the fable is not Buddhistic we must especially
shun that IndoGermanic school which goes to India for its origins
when Pythagoras Solon Herodotus Plato Aristotle and possibly Homer
sat for instruction at the feet of the Hirseshtha the learned
grammarians of the pharaohnic court Nor was it sopic evidently sop
inherited the hoarded wealth of ages As Professor Lepsius taught us
In the olden times within the memory of man we know only of one
advanced culture of only one mode of writing and of only one
literary development viz those of Egypt The invention of an
alphabet as opposed to a syllabary unknown to Babylonia to Assyria
and to that extreme bourne of their civilising influences China would
for ever fix their literaturepoetry history and criticism the
apologue and the anecdote To mention no others The Lion and the Mouse
appears in a Leyden papyrus dating from BC  the days of
Rameses III Rhampsinitus or Hak On not as a rude and early attempt
but in a finished form postulating an ancient origin and illustrious
ancestry The dialogue also is brought to perfection in the discourse
between the Jackal Koufi and the Ethiopian Cat Revue gyptologique
ivme anne Part i Africa therefore was the home of the Beastfable
not as Professor Mahaffy thinks because it was the chosen land of
animal worship where

             Oppida tota canem venerantur nemo Dianam

but simply because the Nileland originated every form of literature
between Fabliau and Epos

From Kemi the Blackland it was but a step to Phnicia Juda
Phrygia and Asia Minor whence a ferry led over to Greece Here the
Apologue found its populariser in  sop whose name involved in
myth possibly connects with sopus et Aithiops idem sonant
says the sages This would show that the Hellenes preserved a legend of
the land whence the Beastfable arose and we may accept the fabulists
ra as contemporary with Crsus and Solon BC  about a century
after Psammeticus Psamethik st threw Egypt open to the restless
Greek From Africa too the Fable would in early ages migrate
eastwards and make for itself a new home in the second great focus of
civilisation formed by the TigrisEuphrates Valley The late Mr George
Smith found amongst the cuneiforms fragmentary Beastfables such as
dialogues between the Ox and the Horse the Eagle and the Sun In after
centuries when the conquests of Macedonian Alexander completed what
Sesostris and Semiramis had begun and mingled the manifold families of
mankind by joining the eastern to the western world the Orient became
formally hellenised Under the Seleucid and during the life of the
independent Bactrian kingdom BC  Grecian art and science
literature and even language overran the old Iranic reign and extended
eastwards throughout northern India Porus sent two embassies to
Augustus in BC  and in one of them the herald Zarmanochagas
Shramanchrya of Bargosa the modern Baroch in Guzerat bore an
epistle upon vellum written in Greek Strabo xv    Videtis
gentes populosque mutasse sedes says Seneca De Cons ad Helv c vi
Quid sibi volunt in mediis barbarorum regionibus Grc artes Quid
inter Indos Persasque Macedonicus sermo Atheniensis in Asia turba est
Upper India in the Macedonian days would have been mainly Buddhistic
possessing a rude alphabet borrowed from Egypt through Arabia and
Phnicia but still in a low and barbarous condition her buildings were
wooden and she lacked as far as we know stonearchitecturethe main
test of social development But the Bactrian Kingdom gave an impulse to
her civilisation and the result was classical opposed to vedic Sanskrit
From Persia Greek letters extending southwards to Arabia would find
indigenous imitators and there sop would be represented by the sundry
sages who share the name Lokman One of these was of servile
condition tailor carpenter or shepherd and a Habashi thiopian
meaning a negro slave with blubber lips and splay feet so far showing a
superficial likeness to the sop of history

The sopic fable carried by the Hellenes to India might have fallen in
with some rude and fantastic barbarian of Buddhistic persuasion and
indigenous origin so Reynard the Fox has its analogue amongst the
Kafirs and the Vi tribe of Mandengan negroes in Liberia amongst
whom one Doalu invented or rather borrowed a syllabarium The modern
Gypsies are said also to have beastfables which have never been traced
to a foreign source Leland But I cannot accept the refinement of
difference which Professor Benfey followed by Mr KeithFalconer
discovers between the sopic and the Hindu apologueIn the former
animals are allowed to act as animals the latter makes them act as men
in the form of animals The essence of the beastfable is a
reminiscence of Homo primigenius with erected ears and hairy hide and
its expression is to make the brother brute behave think and talk like
him with the superadded experience of ages To early man the lower
animals which are born live and die like himself showing all the
same affects and disaffects loves and hates passions prepossessions
and prejudices must have seemed quite human enough and on an equal
level to become his substitutes The savage when he began to reflect
would regard the carnivore and the serpent with awe wonder and dread
and would soon suspect the same mysterious potency in the brute as in
himself so the Malays still look upon the Uranutan or Woodman as
the possessor of superhuman wisdom The hunter and the herdsman who had
few other companions would presently explain the peculiar relations of
animals to themselves by material metamorphosis the bodily
transformation of man to brute giving increased powers of working him
weal and woe A more advanced stage would find the step easy to
metempsychosis the beast containing the Ego alias soul of the
human such instinctive belief explains much in Hindu literature but it
was not wanted at first by the Apologue

This blending of blood this racial baptism would produce a fine robust
progeny and after our second century gyptoGrcoIndian stories
overran the civilized globe between Rome and China Tales have wings and
fly farther than the jade hatchets of protohistoric days And the
result was a book which has had more readers than any other except the
Bible Its original is unknown The volume which in Pehlevi became
the Jvidn Khirad Wisdom of Ages or the Testament of Hoshang that
ancient guebre King and in Sanskrit the Panchatantra Five Chapters
is a recueil of apologues and anecdotes related by the learned Brahman
Vishnu Sharm for the benefit of his pupils the sons of an Indian
Rajah The Hindu original has been adapted and translated into a number
of languages Arabic Hebrew and Syriac Greek and Latin Persian and
Turkish under a host of names Voltaire wisely remarks of
this venerable productionQuand on fait rflexion que presque toute la
terre a t enfatue de pareils contes et quils ont fait lducation
du genre humain on trouve les fables de Pilpay de Lokman
dsope bien raisonables But methinks the sage of Ferney might have
said far more These fables speak with the large utterance of early man
they have also their own especial beautythe charms of wellpreserved
and timehonoured old age There is in their wisdom a perfume of the
past homely and ancientfashioned like a whiff of pot pourri
wondrous soothing withal to olfactories agitated by the patchoulis and
jockey clubs of modern pretenders and petitmatres with their grey
young heads and pert intelligence the motto of whose ignorance is
Connu Were a dose of its antique mature experience adhibited to the
Western before he visits the East those few who could digest it might
escape the normal lot of being twisted round the fingers of every rogue
they meet from Dragoman to Rajah And a quotation from them tells at
once it shows the quoter to be a man of education not a Jangal a
sylvan or savage as the AngloIndian official is habitually termed by
his more civilised fellowsubject

The main difference between the classical apologue and the fable in The
Nights is that while sop and Gabrias write laconic tales with a single
event and a simple moral the Arabian fables are often longcontinued
novelle involving a variety of events each characterised by some social
or political aspect forming a narrative highly interesting in itself
often exhibiting the most exquisite moral and yet preserving with rare
ingenuity the peculiar characteristics of the actors And the
distinction between the ancient and the medival apologue including the
modern which since Reineke Fuchs is mainly German appears equally
pronounced The latter is humorous enough and rich in the wit which
results from superficial incongruity but it ignores the deep underlying
bond which connects man with beast Again the main secret of its
success is the strain of pungent satire especially in the Renardine
Cycle which the people could apply to all unpopular lordes and
prelates gostly and worldly

Our Recueil contains two distinct sets of apologues The first
vol iii consists of eleven alternating with five anecdotes Nights
cxlvicliii following the lengthy and knightly romance of King Omar
bin al Numan and followed by the melancholy love tale of Ali bin
Bakkr The second series in vol ix consisting of eight fables not
including ten anecdotes Nights cmicmxxiv is injected into the
romance of King Jaliad and Shimas mentioned by AlMasudi as
independent of The Nights In both places the Beastfables are
introduced with some art and add variety to the subjectmatter
obviating monotonythe deadly sin of such worksand giving repose to the
hearer or reader after a climax of excitement such as the murder of the
Wazirs And even these are not allowed to pall upon the mental palate
being mingled with anecdotes and short tales such as the Hermits iii
 with biographical or literary episodes acroamata tabletalk and
analects where humorous Rabelaisian anecdote finds a place in fact the
fabliau or novella This style of composition may be as ancient as the
apologues We know that it dates as far back as Rameses III from the
history of the Two Brothers in the Orbigny papyrus the prototype
of Yusuf and Zulaykha the Koranic Joseph and Potiphars wife It is
told with a charming navet and such sharp touches of local colour as
Come let us make merry an hour and lie together Let down thy hair

Some of the apologues in The Nights are pointless enough rien moins
quamusants but in the best specimens such as the Wolf and the
Fox the wicked man and the wily man both characters are
carefully kept distinct and neither action nor dialogue ever flags
Again The Flea and the Mouse iii  of a type familiar to students
of the Pilpay cycle must strike the homereader as peculiarly quaint

Next in date to the Apologue comes the Fairy Tale proper where the
natural universe is supplemented by one of purely imaginative existence
As the active world is inferior to the rational soul says Bacon with
his normal sound sense so Fiction gives to Mankind what History denies
and in some measure satisfies the Mind with Shadows when it cannot enjoy
the Substance And as real History gives us not the success of things
according to the deserts of vice and virtue Fiction corrects it and
presents us with the fates and fortunes of persons rewarded and punished
according to merit But I would say still more History paints or
attempts to paint life as it is a mighty maze with or without a plan
Fiction shows or would show us life as it should be wisely ordered and
laid down on fixed lines Thus Fiction is not the mere handmaid of
History she has a household of her own and she claims to be the triumph
of Art which as Gothe remarked is Art because it is not Nature
Fancy la folle du logis is that kind and gentle portress who holds
the gate of Hope wide open in opposition to Reason the surly and
scrupulous guard As Palmerin of England says and says well For
that the report of noble deeds doth urge the courageous mind to equal
those who bear most commendation of their approved valiancy this is the
fair fruit of Imagination and of ancient histories And last but not
least the faculty of Fancy takes count of the cravings of mans nature
for the marvellous the impossible and of his higher aspirations for
the Ideal the Perfect she realises the wild dreams and visions of his
generous youth and portrays for him a portion of that other and better
world with whose expectation he would console his age

The imaginative varnish of The Nights serves admirably as a foil to the
absolute realism of the picture in general We enjoy being carried away
from trivial and commonplace characters scenes and incidents from the
matter of fact surroundings of a workaday world a life of eating and
drinking sleeping and waking fighting and loving into a society and a
miseenscne which we suspect can exist and which we know does not
Every man at some turn or term of his life has longed for supernatural
powers and a glimpse of Wonderland Here he is in the midst of it Here
he sees mighty spirits summoned to work the human mites will however
whimsical who can transport him in an eyetwinkling whithersoever he
wishes who can ruin cities and build palaces of gold and silver gems
and jacinths who can serve up delicate viands and delicious drinks in
priceless chargers and impossible cups and bring the choicest fruits
from farthest Orient here he finds magas and magicians who can make
kings of his friends slay armies of his foes and bring any number of
beloveds to his arms And from this outraging probability and
outstripping possibility arises not a little of that strange fascination
exercised for nearly two centuries upon the life and literature of
Europe by The Nights even in their mutilated and garbled form The
reader surrenders himself to the spell feeling almost inclined to
enquire And why may it not be true His brain is dazed and
dazzled by the splendours which flash before it by the sudden
procession of Jinns and Jinniyahs demons and fairies some hideous
others preternaturally beautiful by good wizards and evil sorcerers
whose powers are unlimited for weal and for woe by mermen and mermaids
flying horses talking animals and reasoning elephants by magic rings
and their slaves and by talismanic couches which rival the carpet of
Solomon Hence as one remarks these Fairy Tales have pleased and still
continue to please almost all ages all ranks and all different
capacities

Dr Hawkesworth observes that these Fairy Tales find favour
because even their machinery wild and wonderful as it is has its
laws and the magicians and enchanters perform nothing but what was
naturally to be expected from such beings after we had once granted
them existence Mr Heron rather supposes the very contrary is the
truth of the fact It is surely the strangeness the unknown nature the
anomalous character of the supernatural agents here employed that makes
them to operate so powerfully on our hopes fears curiosities
sympathies and in short on all the feelings of our hearts We see men
and women who possess qualities to recommend them to our favour
subjected to the influence of beings whose good or ill will power or
weakness attention or neglect are regulated by motives and
circumstances which we cannot comprehend and hence we naturally
tremble for their fate with the same anxious concern as we should for
a friend wandering in a dark night amidst torrents and precipices or
preparing to land on a strange island while he knew not whether he
should be received on the shore by cannibals waiting to tear him
piecemeal and devour him or by gentle beings disposed to cherish him
with fond hospitality Both writers have expressed themselves well but
meseems each has secured as often happens a fragment of the truth and
holds it to be the whole Truth Granted that such spiritual creatures as
Jinns walk the earth we are pleased to find them so very human as wise
and as foolish in word and deed as ourselves similarly we admire in a
landscape natural forms like those of Staffa or the Palisades which
favour the works of architecture Again supposing such
preternaturalisms to be around and amongst us the wilder and more
capricious they prove the more our attention is excited and our
forecasts are baffled to be set right in the end But this is not all
The grand source of pleasure in Fairy Tales is the natural desire to
learn more of the Wonderland which is known to many as a word and
nothing more like Central Africa before the last half century thus the
interest is that of the Personal Narrative of a grand exploration to
one who delights in travels The pleasure must be greatest where faith
is strongest for instance amongst imaginative races like the Kelts and
especially Orientals who imbibe supernaturalism with their mothers
milk I am persuaded writes Mr Bayle St John that the great
scheme of preternatural energy so fully developed in The Thousand and
One Nights is believed in by the majority of the inhabitants of all the
religious professions both in Syria and Egypt He might have added by
every reasoning being from prince to peasant from Mullah to Badawi
between Marocco and Outer Ind

The Fairy Tale in The Nights is wholly and purely Persian The gifted
Iranian race physically the noblest and the most beautiful of all known
to me has exercised upon the worldhistory an amount of influence which
has not yet been fully recognised It repeated for Babylonian art and
literature what Greece had done for Egyptian whose dominant idea was
that of working for eternity a    Hellas and Iran
instinctively chose as their characteristic the idea of Beauty
rejecting all that was exaggerated and grotesque and they made the
sphere of Art and Fancy as real as the world of Nature and Fact The
innovation was hailed by the Hebrews The socalled Books of Moses
deliberately and ostentatiously ignored the future state of rewards and
punishments the other world which ruled the life of the Egyptian in
this world the lawgiver whoever he may have been Osarsiph or Moshe
apparently held the tenet unworthy of a race whose career he was
directing to conquest and isolation in dominion But the Jews removed
to Mesopotamia the second cradle of the creeds presently caught the
infection of their Asiatic media superadded Babylonian legend to
Egyptian myth stultified The Law by supplementing it with the
absurdities of foreign fable and ended as the Talmud proves with
becoming the most wildly superstitious and otherworldly of mankind

The same change befel AlIslam The whole of its supernaturalism is
borrowed bodily from Persia which had imparadised Earth by making it
the abode of angels Mohammed a great and commanding genius blighted
and narrowed by surroundings and circumstance to something little higher
than a Covenanter or a Puritan declared to his followers

           I am sent to stablish the manners and customs

and his deficiency of imagination made him dislike everything but
women perfumes and prayers with an especial aversion to music and
poetry plastic art and fiction Yet his system unlike that of Moses
demanded thaumaturgy and metaphysical entities and these he perforce
borrowed from the Jews who had borrowed them from the Babylonians his
soul and spirit his angels and devils his cosmogony his heavens and
hells even the Bridge over the Great Depth are all either Talmudic or
Iranian But there he stopped and would have stopped others His enemies
among the Koraysh were in the habit of reciting certain Persian fabliaux
and of extolling them as superior to the silly and equally fictitious
stories of the Glorious Koran The leader of these scoffers was one
Nazr ibn Hris who taken prisoner after the Battle of Bedr was
incontinently decapitated by apostolic command for what appears to be
a natural and sensible preference It was the same furious fanaticism
and oneidead intolerance which made Caliph Omar destroy all he could
find of the Alexandrian Library and prescribe burning for the Holy Books
of the Persian Guebres And the taint still lingers in AlIslam it will
be said of a pious man He always studies the Koran the Traditions and
other books of Law and Religion and he never reads poems nor listens to
music or to stories

Mohammed left a dispensation or rather a reformation so arid jejune and
material that it promised little more than the Law of Moses before
this was vivified and racially baptised by Mesopotamian and Persic
influences But human nature was stronger than the Prophet and thus
outraged took speedy and absolute revenge Before the first century had
elapsed orthodox AlIslam was startled by the rise of Tasawwuf or
Sufyism a revival of classic Platonism and Christian Gnosticism
with a mingling of modern Hylozoism which quickened by the glowing
imagination of the East speedily formed itself into a creed the most
poetical and impractical the most spiritual and the most transcendental
ever invented satisfying all mans hunger for belief which if placed
upon a solid basis of fact and proof would forthright cease to be
belief

I will take from The Nights as a specimen of the true Persian romance
The Queen of the Serpents vol v  the subject of Lanes
Carlylean denunciation The first gorgeous picture is the Session of the
Snakes which like their Indian congeners the Nga kings and queens
have human heads and reptile bodies an Egyptian myth that engendered
the old serpent of Genesis The Sultnah welcomes Hsib Karm alDn
the hapless lad who had been left in a cavern to die by the greedy
woodcutters and in order to tell him her tale introduces the
Adventures of Bulkiy the latter is an Israelite converted by editor
and scribe to Mohammedanism but we can detect under his assumed faith
the older creed Solomon is not buried by authentic history beyond the
Seven mystic Seas but at Jerusalem or Tiberias and his sealring
suggests the JmiJam the crystal cup of the great King Jamshd The
descent of the Archangel Gabriel so familiar to AlIslam is the
manifestation of Bahman the First Intelligence the mightiest of the
Angels who enabled ZarathustraZoroaster to walk like Bulukiya over the
Dlat or Caspian Sea Amongst the sights shown to Bulukiya as he
traverses the Seven Oceans is a battle royal between the believing and
the unbelieving Jinns true Magian dualism the eternal duello of the
Two Roots or antagonistic Principles Good and Evil Hormuzd and
Ahriman which Milton has debased into a commonplace modern combat
fought also with cannon Sakhr the Jinni is Eshem chief of the Divs and
Kaf the encircling mountain is a later edition of Persian Alborz So
in the Mantak alTayr Colloquy of the Flyers the Birds emblems of
souls seeking the presence of the gigantic feathered biped Simurgh
their god traverse seven Seas according to others seven Wadys of
Search of Love of Knowledge of Competence of Unity of Stupefaction
and of Altruism ie annihilation of self the several stages of
contemplative life At last standing upon the mysterious island of the
Simurgh and casting a clandestine glance at him they saw thirty
birds in him and when they turned their eyes to themselves the
thirty birds seemed one Simurgh they saw in themselves the entire
Simurgh they saw in the Simurgh the thirty birds entirely Therefore
they arrived at the solution of the problem We and Thou that is
the identity of God and Man they were for ever annihilated in the
Simurgh and the shade vanished in the sun Ibid iii  The wild
ideas concerning Khalt and Malt vol v  are again Guebre From
the seed of Kayomars the androgyne like preAdamite man sprang a tree
shaped like two human beings and thence proceeded Meshia and Meshianah
first man and woman progenitors of mankind who though created for
Shdistn Lightland were seduced by Ahriman This twomantree is
evidently the duality of Physis and Antiphysis Nature and her
counterpart the battle between Mihr Izad or Mithra with his Surush and
Feristeh Seraphs and Angels against the Divs who are the children of
Time led by the archdemon Eshem Thus when Hormuzd created the planets
the dog and all useful animals and plants Ahriman produced the comets
the wolf noxious beasts and poisonous growths The Hindus represent the
same metaphysical idea by Bramh the Creator and Visvakarma the
Anticreator miscalled by Europeans Vulcan the former fashions a
horse and a bull and the latter caricatures them with an ass and a
buffaloevolution turned topsy turvy After seeing nine angels and
obtaining an explanation of the Seven Stages of Earth which is supported
by the GaviZamn the energy symbolised by a bull implanted by the
Creator in the mundane sphere Bulukiya meets the four Archangels to
wit Gabriel who is the Persian Rawnbakhsh or Lifegiver Michael or
Beshter Raphael or Israfil alias Ardibihisht and Azazel or Azrail who
is Dum or Mordad the Deathgiver and the four are about to attack the
Dragon that is the demons hostile to mankind who were driven behind
AlborzKaf by Tahmuras the ancient Persian king Bulukiya then recites
an episode within an episode the Story of Jnshh itself a Persian

the young Prince no sooner comes to mans estate than he loses himself
out hunting and falls in with cannibals whose bodies divide
longitudinally each moiety going its own way these are the Shikk
split ones which the Arabs borrowed from the Persian Nmchihrah or
Halffaces They escape to the Apeisland whose denizens are human in
intelligence and speak articulately as the universal East believes they
can these Simiads are at chronic war with the Ants alluding to some
obscure myth which gave rise to the golddiggers of Herodotus and other
classics emmets in size somewhat less than dogs but bigger than
foxes The episode then falls into the banalities of Oriental
folklore Janshah passing the Sabbation river and reaching the Jews
city is persuaded to be sewn up in a skin and is carried in the normal
way to the top of the Mountain of Gems where he makes acquaintance with
Shaykh Nasr Lord of the Birds he enters the usual forbidden room
falls in love with the pattern Swanmaiden wins her by the popular
process loses her and recovers her through the Monk Yaghms whose
name like that of King Teghms is a burlesque of the Greek and
finally when she is killed by a shark determines to mourn her loss
till the end of his days Having heard this story Bulukiya quits him
and resolving to regain his natal land falls in with Khizr and the
Green Prophet who was Wazir to Kay Kobad vith century BC and was
connected with Macedonian Alexander  enables him to win his wish The
rest of the tale calls for no comment

Thirdly and lastly we have the histories historical stories and the
Ana of great men in which Easterns as well as Westerns delight the
gravest writers do not disdain to relieve the dullness of chronicles and
annals by means of such discussions humorous or pathetic moral or
grossly indecent The dates must greatly vary some of the anecdotes
relating to the early Caliphs appear almost contemporary others like
Ali of Cairo and Abu alShamat may be as late as the Ottoman Conquest
of Egypt sixteenth century All are distinctly Sunnite and show fierce
animus against the Shiah heretics suggesting that they were written
after the destruction of the Fatimite dynasty twelfth century by Salah
alDin Saladin the Kurd one of the latest historical personages and
the last king named in The Nights These anecdotes are so often
connected with what a learned Frenchman terms the regne ferique de
Haroun erRschid that the Great Caliph becomes the hero of this
portion of The Nights Aaron the Orthodox was the central figure of the
most splendid empire the world had seen the Viceregent of Allah
combining the powers of Csar and Pope and wielding them right worthily
according to the general voice of historians To quote a few Ali bin
Talib alKhorsni described him in AD  a century andahalf
after his death when flattery would be tonguetied as one devoted to
war and pilgrimage whose bounty embraced the folk at large Saadi
ob AD  tells a tale highly favourable to him in the Gulistan
lib i  Fakhr alDin xivth century lauds his merits
eloquence science and generosity and AlSiyuti nat AD 
asserts He was one of the most distinguished of Caliphs and the most
illustrious of the Princes of the Earth p  The Shaykh
alNafzwi sixteenth century in his Rauz altir f Nazh
alKhtir  Scented Gardensite for Heartdelight calls Harun chapt
vii the Master of munificence and bounty the best of the generous
And even the latest writers have not ceased to praise him Says Al Azz
Efendi the Cretan in the Story of Jewd p  Harun was the
most bounteous illustrious and upright of the Abbaside Caliphs

The fifth Abbaside was fair and handsome of noble and majestic
presence a sportsman and an athlete who delighted in polo and archery
He showed sound sense and true wisdom in his speech to the
grammarianpoet AlAsma who had undertaken to teach himNe
menseignez jamais en public et ne vous empressez pas trop de me donner
des avis en particulier Attendez ordinairement que je vous interroge
et contentezvous de me donner une response prcise  ce que je vous
demanderai sans y rien ajouter de superflu Gardez vous surtout de
vouloir me proccuper pour vous attirer ma crance et pour vous donner
de lautorit Ne vous tendez jamais trop en long sur les histoires et
les traditions que vous me raconterez si je ne vous en donne la
permission Lorsque vous verrai que je meloignerai de lquit dans mes
jugements ramenezmoi avec douceur sans user de paroles fcheuses ni
de rprimandes Enseignezmoi principalement les choses qui sont les
plus ncessaires pour les discours que je dois faire en public dans les
mosques et ailleurs et ne parlez point en termes obscurs ou
mystrieux ni avec des paroles trop recherches

He became well read in science and letters especially history and
tradition for his understanding was as the understanding of the
learned and like all educated Arabs of his day he was a connoisseur
of poetry which at times he improvised with success He made the
pilgrimage every alternate year and sometimes on foot while his
military expeditions almost equalled his pilgrimages Day after day
during his Caliphate he prayed a hundred bows never neglecting them
save for some especial reason till his death and he used to give from
his privy purse alms to the extent of a hundred dirhams per diem He
delighted in panegyry and liberally rewarded its experts one of whom
Abd alSammk the Preacher fairly said of him Thy humility in thy
greatness is nobler than thy greatness No Caliph says AlNiftawayh
had been so profusely liberal to poets lawyers and divines although
as the years advanced he wept over his extravagance amongst other sins
There was vigorous manliness in his answer to the Grecian Emperor who
had sent him an insulting missiveIn the name of Allah From the
Commander of the Faithful Harun alRashid to Nicephorus the Roman dog
I have read thy writ O son of a miscreant mother Thou shalt not hear
thou shalt see my reply Nor did he cease to make the Byzantine feel
the weight of his arm till he nakhd his camel in the imperial
Courtyard and this was only one instance of his indomitable energy and
hatred of the Infidel Yet if the West is to be believed he forgot his
fanaticism in his diplomatic dealings and courteous intercourse with
Carolus Magnus Finally his civilised and well regulated rule
contrasted as strongly with the barbarity and turbulence of occidental
Christendom as the splendid Court and the luxurious life of Baghdad and
its carpets and hangings devanced the quasisavagery of London and Paris
whose palatial halls were spread with rushes

The great Caliph ruled twentythree years and a few months AH 
 AD  and as his youth was chequered and his reign was
glorious so was his end obscure After a vision foreshadowing his
death which happened as becomes a good Moslem during a military
expedition to Khorasan he ordered his grave to be dug and himself to be
carried to it in a covered litter when sighting the fosse he exclaimed
O son of man thou art come to this Then he commanded himself to be
set down and a perlection of the Koran to be made over him in the litter
on the edge of the grave He was buried t fortyfive at Sanbd a
village near Ts

Aaron the Orthodox appears in The Nights as a headstrong and violent
autocrat a right royal figure according to the Moslem ideas of his day
But his career shows that he was not more tyrannical or more sanguinary
than the normal despot of the East or the contemporary Kings of the
West in most points indeed he was far superior to the historic
misrulers who have afflicted the world from Spain to furthest China But
a single great crime a tragedy whose details are almost incredibly
horrible marks his reign with the stain of infamy with a blot of blood
never to be washed away This tale full of the waters of the eye as
Firdausi sings is the massacre of the Barmecides a story which has
often been told and which cannot here be passed over in silence The
ancient and noble Iranian house belonging to the Ebn or Arabised
Persians had long served the Ommiades till early in our eighth
century Khlid bin Bermek the chief entered the service of the
first Abbaside and became Wazir and Intendant of Finance to AlSaffah
The most remarkable and distinguished of the family he was in office
when AlMansur transferred the capital from Damascus the headquarters
of the hated Ommiades to Baghdad built ad hoc After securing the
highest character in history by his personal gifts and public services
he was succeeded by his son and heir Yhy John a statesman famed
from early youth for prudence and profound intelligence liberality and
nobility of soul He was charged by the Caliph AlMahdi with the
education of his son Harun hence the latter was accustomed to call him
father and until the assassination of the fantastic tyrant AlHdi
who proposed to make his own child Caliph he had no little difficulty
in preserving the youth from death in prison The Orthodox once seated
firmly on the throne appointed Yahya his Grand Wazir This great
administrator had four sons AlFazl Jaafar Mohammed and Musa
in whose time the house of Bermek rose to that height from which decline
and fall are in the East well nigh certain and immediate AlFazl was
a fosterbrother of Harun an exchange of suckling infants having taken
place between the two mothers for the usual object a tightening of the
ties of intimacy he was a man of exceptional mind but he lacked the
charm of temper and manner which characterised Jaafar The poets and
rhetoricians have been profuse in their praises of the cadet who appears
in The Nights as an adviser of calm sound sense an intercessor and a
peacemaker and even more remarkable than the rest of his family for an
almost incredible magnanimity and generosityune gnrosit effrayante
Mohammed was famed for exalted views and nobility of sentiment and Musa
for bravery and energy of both it was justly said They did good and
harmed not

For ten years not including an interval of seven from the time of
AlRashids accession AD  to the date of their fall AD 
Yahya and his sons AlFazl and Jaafar were virtually rulers of the
great heterogeneous empire which extended from Mauritania to Tartary
and they did notable service in arresting its disruption Their downfall
came sudden and terrible like a thunderbolt from the blue As the
Caliph and Jaafar were halting in AlUmr the convent near Anbrtown
on the Euphrates after a convivial evening spent in different
pavilions Harun during the dead of the night called up his page Ysir
alRikhlah and bade him bring Jaafars head The messenger found
Jaafar still carousing with the blind poet Ab Zakkr and the Christian
physician Gabriel ibn Bakhtiash and was persuaded to return to the
Caliph and report his death the Wazir adding An he express regret I
shall owe thee my life and if not whatso Allah will be done Jaafar
followed to listen and heard only the Caliph exclaim O sucker of thy
mothers clitoris if thou answer me another word I will send thee
before him whereupon he at once bandaged his own eyes and received the
fatal blow AlAsma who was summoned to the presence shortly after
recounts that when the head was brought to Harun he gazed at it and
summoning two witnesses commanded them to decapitate Yasir crying I
cannot bear to look upon the slayer of Jaafar His vengeance did not
cease with the death he ordered the head to be gibbetted at one end and
the trunk at the other abutment of the Tigris bridge where the corpses
of the vilest malefactors used to be exposed and some months
afterwards he insulted the remains by having them burnedthe last and
worst indignity which can be offered to a Moslem There are indeed pity
and terror in the difference between two such items in the
Treasuryaccounts as these Four hundred thousand dinars  to
a robe of honour for the Wazir Jaafar bin Yahya and Ten krt 
shill to naphtha and reeds for burning the body of Jaafar the
Barmecide

Meanwhile Yahya and AlFazl seized by the Caliph Haruns command at
Baghdad were significantly cast into the prison Habs alZandikahof
the Guebresand their immense wealth which some opine hastened their
downfall was confiscated According to the historian AlTabari who
however is not supported by all the annalists the whole Barmecide
family men women and children numbering over a thousand were
slaughtered with only three exceptions Yahya his brother Mohammed and
his son AlFazl The Caliphs fosterfather who lived to the age of
seventyfour was allowed to die in jail AH  after two years
imprisonment at Rukkah AlFazl after having been tortured with two
hundred blows in order to make him produce concealed property survived
his father three years and died in Nov AH  some four months
before his terrible fosterbrother A pathetic tale is told of the son
warming water for the old mans use by pressing the copper ewer to his
stomach

The motives of this terrible massacre are variously recounted but no
sufficient explanation has yet been or possibly ever will be given
The popular idea is embodied in The Nights Harun wishing Jaafar
to be his companion even in the Harem had wedded him pro form to his
eldest sister Abbsah the loveliest woman of her day and brilliant
in mind as in body but he had expressly said I will marry thee to
her that it may be lawful for thee to look upon her but thou shalt not
touch her Jaafar bound himself by a solemn oath but his mother
Attbah was mad enough to deceive him in his cups and the result was a
boy Ibn Khallikan or according to others twins The issue was sent
under the charge of a confidential eunuch and a slavegirl to Meccah for
concealment but the secret was divulged to Zubaydah who had her own
reasons for hating husband and wife and cherished an especial grievance
against Yahya Thence it soon found its way to headquarters
Haruns treatment of Abbsah supports the general conviction according
to the most credible accounts she and her child were buried alive in a
pit under the floor of her apartment

But possibly Jaafars perjury was only the last straw Already
AlFazl bin Raba the deadliest enemy of the Barmecides had been
entrusted AD  with the Wazirate which he kept seven years
Jaafar had also acted generously but imprudently in abetting the escape
of Yahya bin Abdillah Sayyid and Alide for whom the Caliph had
commanded confinement in a close dark dungeon when charged with
disobedience the Wazir had made full confession and Harun had they say
exclaimed Thou hast done well but was heard to mutter Allah slay
me an I slay thee not The great house seems at times to have
abused its powers by being too peremptory with Harun and Zubaydah
especially in money matters and its very greatness would have
created for it many and powerful enemies and detractors who plied the
Caliph with anonymous verse and prose Nor was it forgotten that before
the spread of AlIslam they had presided over the Naubehr or Pyrthrum
of Balkh and Harun is said to have remarked anent Yahya The zeal for
magianism rooted in his heart induces him to save all the monuments
connected with his faith Hence the charge that they were
Zandakah a term properly applied to those who study the Zend
scripture but popularly meaning Mundanists Positivists Reprobates
Atheists and it may be noted that immediately after AlRashids death
violent religious troubles broke out in Baghdad Ibn Khallikan
quotes Sad ibn Slim a wellknown grammarian and traditionist who
philosophically remarked Of a truth the Barmecides did nothing to
deserve AlRashids severity but the day of their power and
prosperity had been long and whatso endureth long waxeth longsome
Fakhr alDin says p  On attribue encore leur ruine aux manires
fires et orgueilleuses de Djafar Jaafar et de Fadhl AlFazl
manires que les rois ne sauroient supporter According to Ibn Badrn
the poet when the Caliphs sister Olayyah asked him O my lord
I have not seen thee enjoy one happy day since putting Jaafar to death
wherefore didst thou slay him he answered My dear life an I thought
that my shirt knew the reason I would rend it in pieces I therefore
hold with AlMasudi As regards the intimate cause of the
catastrophe it is unknown and Allah is Omniscient

Aaron the Orthodox appears sincerely to have repented his enormous
crime From that date he never enjoyed refreshing sleep he would have
given his whole realm to recall Jaafar to life and if any spoke
slightingly of the Barmecides in his presence he would exclaim God
damn your fathers Cease to blame them or fill the void they have left
And he had ample reason to mourn the loss After the extermination of
the wise and enlightened family the affairs of the Caliphate never
prospered Fazl bin Raba though a man of intelligence and devoted to
letters proved a poor substitute for Yahya and Jaafar and the Caliph
is reported to have applied to him the couplet

 No sire to your sire I bid you spare  Your calumnies or their
    place replace

His unwise elevation of his two rival sons filled him with fear of
poison and lastly the violence and recklessness of the popular
mourning for the Barmecides whose echo has not yet died away must
have added poignancy to his tardy penitence The crime still sticks
fiery off from the rest of Haruns career it stands out in ghastly
prominence as one of the most terrible tragedies recorded by history
and its horrible details make men write passionately on the subject to
this our day

As of Harun so of Zubaydah it may be said that she was far superior in
most things to contemporary royalties and she was not worse at her
worst than the normal despotqueen of the Morningland We must not take
seriously the tales of her jealousy in The Nights which mostly end in
her selling off or burying alive her rivals but even were all true
she acted after the recognised fashion of her exalted sisterhood The
secret history of Cairo during the last generation tells of many a
viceregal dame who committed all the crimes without any of the virtues
which characterised Haruns cousinspouse And the difference between
the manners of the Caliphate and the respectability of the nineteenth
century may be measured by the Tale called AlMaamun and
Zubaydah The lady having won a game of forfeits from her
husband and being vexed with him for imposing unseemly conditions when
he had been the winner condemned him to lie with the foulest and
filthiest kitchenwench in the palace and thus was begotten the Caliph
who succeeded and destroyed her son

Zubaydah was the granddaughter of the second Abbaside AlMansur by his
son Jaafar whom The Nights persistently term AlKasim her name was
Amat alAzz or Handmaid of the Almighty her cognomen was Umm Jaafar
as her husbands was Ab Jaafar and her popular name Creamkin
derives from Zubdah cream or fresh butter on account of her
plumpness and freshness She was as majestic and munificent as her
husband and the hum of prayer was never hushed in her palace
AlMasudi makes a historian say to the dangerous Caliph AlKhir
The nobleness and generosity of this Princess in serious matters as in
her diversions place her in the highest rank and he proceeds to give
ample proof AlSiyuti relates how she once filled a poets mouth with
jewels which he sold for twenty thousand dinars Ibn Khallikan i 
affirms of her Her charity was ample her conduct virtuous and the
history of her pilgrimage to Meccah and of what she undertook to execute
on the way is so wellknown that it were useless to repeat it I have
noted Pilgrimage iii  how the Darb alSharki or Eastern road from
Meccah to AlMedinah was due to the piety of Zubaydah who dug wells from
Baghdad to the Prophets burial place and built not only cisterns and
caravanserais but even a wall to direct pilgrims over the shifting
sands She also supplied Meccah which suffered severely from want of
water with the chief requisite for public hygiene by connecting it
through levelled hills and hewn rocks with the Ayn alMushsh in the
Arafat subrange and the fine aqueduct some ten miles long was erected
at a cost of  to  of gold pieces We cannot
wonder that her name is still famous among the Badawin and the Sons of
the Holy Cities She died at Baghdad after a protracted widowhood in
AH  and her tomb which still exists was long visited by the
friends and dependents who mourned the loss of a devout and most liberal
woman

The reader will bear with me while I run through the tales and add a few
remarks to the notices given in the notes the glance must necessarily
be brief however extensive be the theme The admirable introduction
follows in all the texts and MSS known to me the same main lines but
differs greatly in minor details as will be seen by comparing Mr
Paynes translation with Lanes and mine In the Tale of the Sage Dbn
appears the speaking head which is found in the Kmil in Mirkhond and
in the Kitb alUyn M C Barbier de Meynard v  traces it back
to an abbreviated text of AlMasudi I would especially recommend to
students The Porter and the Three Ladies of Baghdad i  whose
mighty orgie ends so innocently in general marriage Lane iii 
blames it because it represents Arab ladies as acting like Arab
courtesans but he must have known that during his day the indecent
frolic was quite possible in some of the highest circles of his beloved
Cairo To judge by the style and changes of person some of the most
archaic expressions suggest the hand of the Rwi or professional
taleteller yet as they are in all the texts they cannot be omitted in
a loyal translation The following story of The Three Apples perfectly
justifies my notes concerning which certain carpers complain What
Englishman would be jealous enough to kill his cousinwife because a
blackamoor in the streets boasted of her favours But after reading what
is annotated in vol i  and purposely placed there to give the
keynote of the book he will understand the reasonable nature of the
suspicion and I may add that the same cause has commended these skunks
of the human race to debauched women in England

The next tale sometimes called The Two Wazrs is notable for its
regular and genuine dramaintrigue which however appears still more
elaborate and perfected in other pieces The richness of this Oriental
plotinvention contrasts strongly with all European literatures except
the Spaniards whose taste for the theatre determined his direction
and the Italian which in Boccaccios day had borrowed freely through
Sicily from the East And the remarkable deficiency lasted till the
romantic movement dawned in France when Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas
showed their marvellous powers of faultless fancy boundless imagination
and scenic luxuriance raising French Poetry from the dead and not
mortally wounding French prose The Two Wazirs is followed by the
gem of the volume The Adventure of the Hunchbackjester i  also
containing an admirable surprise and a fine development of character
while its wild but natural simplicity and its humour are so abounding
that it has echoed through the world to the farthest West It gave to
Addison the Story of Alnaschar and to Europe the term Barmecide
Feast from the Tale of Shacabac vol i  The adventures of the
corpse were known in Europe long before Galland as shown by three
fabliaux in Barbazan I have noticed that the Barbers Tale of himself
i  is historical and I may add that it is told in detail by
AlMasudi chapt cxiv

Follows the tale of Nr alDn Al and what Galland miscalls The Fair
Persian a brightly written historiette with not a few touches of true
humour Noteworthy are the Slavers address vol ii  the fine
description of the Baghdad garden vol ii  the drinkingparty
vol ii  the Caliphs frolic vol ii  and the happy end of
the heros misfortunes vol ii  Its brightness is tempered by the
gloomy tone of the tale which succeeds and which has variants in the
Bgh o Bahr a Hindustani version of the Persian Tale of the Four
Darwayshes and in the Turkish Kirk Vezir or Book of the Forty
Vezirs Its dismal pripties are relieved only by the witty indecency
of Eunuch Bukhayt and the admirable humour of Eunuch Kfur whose
halflie is known throughout the East Here also the lovers agonies
are piled upon him for the purpose of unpiling at last the Oriental
taleteller knows by experience that as a rule doleful endings dont
pay

The next is the long romance of chivalry King Omar bin alNuman
etc which occupies an eighth of the whole repertory and the best part
of two volumes Mr Lane omits it because obscene and tedious showing
the license with which he translated and he was set right by a learned
reviewer who truly declared that the omission of halfadozen
passages out of four hundred pages would fit it for printing in any
language and the charge of tediousness could hardly have been
applied more unhappily The tale is interesting as a picture of
medival Arab chivalry and has many other notable points for instance
the lines iii  beginning Allah holds the kingship are a lesson
to the manichanism of Christian Europe It relates the doings of three
royal generations and has all the characteristics of Eastern art it is
a phantasmagoria of Holy Places palaces and Harems convents castles
and caverns here restful with gentle landscapes ii  and there
bristling with furious battlepictures ii    and tales
of princely prowess and knightly derringdo The characters stand out
well King Numan is an old lecher who deserves his death the ancient
Dame Zt alDawh merits her title Lady of Calamities to her foes
Princess Abrzah appears as a charming Amazon doomed to a miserable and
pathetic end Zau alMakn is a wise and pious royalty Nuzhat alZamn
though a longsome talker is a model sister the Wazir Dandn a sage
and sagacious counsellor contrasts with the Chamberlain an ambitious
miscreant Knmakn is the typical Arab knight gentle and brave

             Now managing the mouthes of stubborne steedes
             Now practising the proof of warlike deedes

And the kindhearted simpleminded Stoker serves as a foil to the
villains the kidnapping Badawi and Ghazbn the detestable negro The
fortunes of the family are interrupted by two episodes both equally
remarkable Taj alMulk is the model lover whom no difficulties or
dangers can daunt In Azz and Azzah ii  we have the beau idal
of a loving woman the writers object was to represent a softy who
had the luck to win the love of a beautiful and clever cousin and the
mad folly to break her heart The poetical justice which he receives at
the hands of women of quite another stamp leaves nothing to be desired
Finally the plot of King Omar is well worked out and the gathering of
all the actors upon the stage before the curtain drops may be improbable
but it is highly artistic

The long Crusading Romance is relieved by a sequence of sixteen
fabliaux partly historiettes of men and beasts and partly apologues
propera subject already noticed We have then iii  the saddening
and dreary lovetale of Ali bin Bakkr a Persian youth and the Caliphs
concubine Shams alNahr Here the end is made doleful enough by the
deaths of the two martyrs who are killed off like Romeo and
Juliet a lesson that the course of true Love is sometimes troubled
and that men as well as women can die of the socalled tender
passion It is followed iii  by the long tale of Kamar alZamn
or Moon of the Age the first of that name the Camaralzaman whom
Galland introduced into the best European society Like The Ebony
Horse it seems to have been derived from a common source with Peter of
Provence and Cleomades and Claremond and we can hardly wonder at its
wide diffusion the tale is brimful of life change movement
containing as much character and incident as would fill a modern
threevolumer and the Supernatural pleasantly jostles the Natural
Dahnash the Jinn and Maymnah daughter of AlDimiryt a renowned
King of the Jann being as human in their jealousy about the virtue of
their lovers as any children of Adam and so their metamorphosis to
fleas has all the effect of a surprise The troupe is again drawn with
a broad firm touch Prince Charming the hero is weak and wilful
shifty and immoral hasty and violent his two spouses are rivals in
abominations as his sons Amjad and Asad are examples of a fraternal
affection rarely found in halfbrothers by sisterwives There is at
least one fine melodramatic situation iii  and marvellous feats
of indecency a practical joke which would occur only to the canopic
mind iii  emphasise the recovery of her husband by that
remarkable blackguard the Lady Budr The interpolated tale of
Niamah and Naomi iv  a simple and pleasing narrative of youthful
amours contrasts well with the boiling passions of the incestuous and
murderous Queens and serves as a pause before the grand dnoement
when the parted meet the lost are found the unwedded are wedded and
all ends merrily as a xixth century novel

The long tale of Al alDin our old friend Aladdin is wholly out of
place in its present position iv  it is a counterpart of Ali Nr
alDn and Miriam the Girdlegirl vol ix  and the mention of the
Shahbandar or Harbourmaster iv  the Kunsl or Consul p  the
Kaptn Capitano the use of cannon at sea and the choice of Genoacity
p  prove that it belongs to the xvth or xvith century and should
accompany Kamar alZamn II and Maaruf at the end of The Nights
Despite the lutist Zubaydah being carried off by the Jinn the Magic
Couch a modification of Solomons carpet and the murder of the King
who refused to islamize it is evidently a European tale and I believe
with Dr Bacher that it is founded upon the legend of Charlemagnes
daughter Emma and his secretary Eginhardt as has been noted in the
counterpart vol ix 

This quasihistorical fiction is followed by a succession of fabliaux
novelle and historiettes which fill the rest of vol iv and the whole
of vol v till we reach the terminal story The Queen of the Serpents
vol v pp  It appears to me that most of them are historical
and could easily be traced Not a few are in AlMasudi for instance
the grim Tale of Hatim of Tayy vol iv  is given bodily in Meads
of Gold iii  and the two adventures of Ibrahim alMahdi with the
barbersurgeon vol iv  and the Merchants sister vol iv 
are in his pages vol vii pp  and  The City of Lubtayt vol
iv  embodies the legend of Don Rodrigo last of the Goths and may
have reached the ears of Washington Irving Manycolumned Iram vol iv
 is held by all Moslems to be factual and sundry writers have
recorded the tricks played by AlMaamun with the Pyramids of Jzah which
still show his handiwork The germ of Isaac of Mosul vol iv 
is found in AlMasudi who vii  names Burn the poetess Ibn
Khall i  and Harun alRashid and the Slavegirl vol iv  is
told by a host of writers Ali the Persian is a rollicking tale of fun
from some Iranian jestbook Abu Mohammed hight Lazybones belongs to the
cycle of Sindbad the Seaman with a touch of Whittington and his Cat
and Zumurrud Smaragdine in Ali Shar vol iv  shows at her sale
the impudence of Miriam the Girdlegirl and in bed the fescennine device
of the Lady Budur The Ruined Man who became Rich etc vol iv 
is historical and AlMasudi vii  relates the coquetry of Mahbbah
the concubine vol iv  the historian also quotes four couplets
two identical with Nos  and  in The Nights vol iv  and
adding

 Then see the slave who lords it oer her lord  In lover privacy and
    public site
 Behold these eyes that one like Jaafar saw  Allah on Jaafar reign
    boons infinite

Uns alWujd vol v  is a lovetale which has been translated into
a host of Eastern languages and The Lovers of the Banu Ozrah belong to
AlMasuds Martyrs of Love vii  with the ozrite Ozrite love
of Ibn Khallikan iv  Harun and the Three Poets vol v  has
given to Cairo a proverb which Burckhardt No  renders The day
obliterates the word or promise of the Night for

                The promise of night is effaced by day

It suggests Congreves Doris

                 For who oer night obtaind her grace
                     She can next day disown etc

Harun and the three Slavegirls vol v  smacks of Gargantua lib
i c II It belongs to me said one Tis mine said another and so
forth The Simpleton and the Sharper vol v  like the Foolish
Dominie vol v  is an old Joe Miller in Hindu as well as Moslem
folklore Kisra Anushirwn vol v  is The King the Owl and the
Villages of AlMasdi iii  who also notices the Persian
monarchs four seals of office ii  and Masrur the Eunuch and Ibn
AlKribi vol v  is from the same source as Ibn alMaghzili the
Reciter and a Eunuch belonging to the Caliph AlMutazad vol viii
 In the Tale of Tawaddud vol v  we have the fullest
development of the disputations and displays of learning then so common
in Europe teste the Admirable Crichton and these were affected not
only by Eastern taletellers but even by sober historians To us it is
much like padding when Nuzhat alZamn vol ii  etc fags her
hapless hearers with a discourse covering sixteen mortal pages when the
Wazir Dandan vol ii  etc reports at length the cold speeches of
the five highbosomed maids and the Lady of Calamities and when Wird
Khan in presence of his papa Nights cmxivxvi discharges his
patristic exercitations and heterogeneous knowledge Yet AlMasudi also
relates at dreary extension vol vi  the disputation of the
twelve sages in presence of Barmecide Yahya upon the origin the
essence the accidents and the omnes res of Love and in another place
vii  shows Honayn author of the Book of Natural Questions
undergoing a long examination before the Caliph AlWsik Vathek and
describing amongst other things the human teeth See also the dialogue
or catechism of AlHajjj and Ibn AlKirrya in Ibn Khallikan vol i


These disjecta membra of tales and annals are pleasantly relieved by the
seven voyages of Sindbad the Seaman vol vi  The Arabian
Odyssey may like its Greek brother descend from a noble family the
Shipwrecked Mariner a Coptic traveltale of the twelfth dynasty BC
 preserved on a papyrus at St Petersburg In its actual condition
Sindbad is a fanciful compilation like De Foes Captain Singleton
borrowed from travellers tales of an immense variety and extracts from
AlIdrsi AlKazwni and Ibn alWardi Here we find the Polyphemus the
Pygmies and the cranes of Homer and Herodotus the escape of
Aristomenes the Plinian monsters well known in Persia the magnetic
mountain of Saint Brennan Brandanus the aeronautics of Duke Ernest
of Bavaria and sundry cuttings from Moslem writers dating between
our ninth and fourteenth centuries The Shaykh of the Seaboard
appears in the Persian romance of Kmarupa translated by Francklin all
the particulars absolutely corresponding The Odyssey is valuable
because it shows how far Eastward the medival Arab had extended
already in The Ignorance he had reached China and had formed a centre of
trade at Canton But the higher merit of the cento is to produce one of
the most charming books of travel ever written like Robinson Crusoe the
delight of children and the admiration of all ages

The hearty life and realism of Sindbad are made to stand out in strong
relief by the deep melancholy which pervades The City of Brass vol
vi  a dreadful book for a dreary day It is curious to compare the
doleful verses pp   with those spoken to Caliph AlMutawakkil
by Abu alHasan Ali AlMasudi vii  We then enter upon the
venerable Sindibadnameh the Malice of Women vol vi  of which
according to the Kitab alFihrist vol i  there were two
editions a Sinzibd alKabr and a Sinzibd alSaghr the latter being
probably an epitome of the former This bundle of legends I have shown
was incorporated with The Nights as an editors addition and as an
independent work it has made the round of the world Space forbids any
detailed notice of this choice collection of anecdotes for which a
volume would be required I may however note that the Wifes device
vol vi  has its analogues in the Kath chapt xiii in the
Gesta Romanorum No xxviii and in Boccaccio Day iii  and Day vi
 modified by La Fontaine to Richard Minutolo Contes lib i tale 
it is quoted almost in the words of The Nights by the Shaykh alNafzwi
p  That most witty and indecent tale The Three Wishes vol vi
 has forced its way disguised as a babe into our nurseries Another
form of it is found in the Arab proverb More luckless than Bass
Kamus a fair Israelite who persuaded her husband also a Jew to wish
that she might become the loveliest of women Jehovah granted it
spitefully as Jupiter the consequence was that her contumacious
treatment of her mate made him pray that the beauty might be turned into
a bitch and the third wish restored her to her original state

The Story of Jdar vol vi  is Egyptian to judge from its local
knowledge pp  and  together with its ignorance of Marocco p
 It shows a contrast in which Arabs delight of an almost
angelical goodness and forgiveness with a wellnigh diabolical
malignity and we find the same extremes in Ab Sr the nobleminded
Barber and the hideously inhuman Ab Kr The excursion to Mauritania is
artfully managed and gives a novelty to the miseenscne Gharb and
Ajb vi  vii  belongs to the cycle of Antar and King Omar bin
Numan its exaggerations make it a fine type of Oriental Chauvinism
pitting the superhuman virtues valour nobility and success of all that
is Moslem against the scum of the earth which is nonMoslem Like the
exploits of Friar John of the Choppingknives Rabelais i c  it
suggests ridicule cast on impossible battles and tales of giants
paynims and paladins The long romance is followed by thirteen
historiettes all apparently historical compare Hind daughter of
AlNuman vol viii  and Isaac of Mosul and the Devil vol
vii  with AlMasudi v  and vi  They end in two long
detectivetales like those which M Gaboriau has popularised the
Rogueries of Dalilah and the Adventures of Mercury Ali based upon the
principle One thief wots another The former who has appeared before
vol ii  seems to have been a noted character AlMasudi says
viii  in a word this Shaykh AlUkb outrivalled in his
rogueries and the ingenuities of his wiles Dllah Dalilah the
Crafty and other tricksters and coneycatchers ancient and modern

The Tale of Ardashir vol vii  lacks originality we are now
entering upon a series of pictures which are replicas of those
preceding This is not the case with that charming Undine Julnr the
Seaborn vol vii  which like Abdullah of the Land and
Abdullah of the Sea vol ix Night cmxl describes the vie intime of
mermen and merwomen Somewhat resembling Swifts inimitable creations
the Houyhnhnms for instance they prove amongst other things that
those who dwell in a denser element can justly blame and severely
criticise the contradictory and unreasonable prejudices and
predilections of mankind Sayf alMulk vol viii Night dcclviii
the romantic tale of two lovers shows by its introduction that it was
originally an independent work and it is known to have existed in Persia
during the eleventh century this novella has found its way into every
Moslem language of the East even into Sindi which calls the hero
Sayfal Here we again meet the Old Man of the Sea or rather the Shaykh
of the Seaboard and make acquaintance with a Jinn whose soul is outside
his body thus he resembles Hermotimos of Klazamun in Apollonius whose
spirit left his mortal frame  discretion The author philanthropically
remarking vol viii  Knowest thou not that a single mortal is
better in Allahs sight than a thousand Jinn brings the wooing to a
happy end which leaves a pleasant savour upon the mental palate

Hasan of Bassorah vol viii  is a Master Shoetie on a large
scale like Sindbad but his voyages and travels extend into the
supernatural and fantastic rather than the natural world Though long
the tale is by no means wearisome and the characters are drawn with a
fine firm hand The hero with his henlike persistency of purpose his
weeping fainting and versifying is interesting enough and proves that
Love can find out the way The charming adopted sister the model of
what the feminine friend should be the silly little wife who never
knows that she is happy till she loses happiness the violent and
hardhearted queen with all the cruelty of a good woman and the manners
and customs of Amazonland are outlined with a lifelike vivacity
Khalfah the next tale vol viii  is valuable as a study of
Eastern life showing how the fisherman emerges from the squalor of his
surroundings and becomes one of the Caliphs favourite cupcompanions
Ali Nur alDin vol viii  and King Jaliad vol ix Night
dcccxciv have been noticed elsewhere and there is little to say of the
concluding stories which bear the evident impress of a more modern date

Dr Johnson thus sums up his notice of The Tempest Whatever might have
been the intention of their author these tales are made instrumental to
the production of many characters diversified with boundless invention
and preserved with profound skill in nature extensive knowledge of
opinions and accurate observation of life Here are exhibited princes
courtiers and sailors all speaking in their real characters There is
the agency of airy spirits and of earthy goblin the operations of
magic the tumults of a storm the adventures of a desert island the
native effusion of untaught affection the punishment of guilt and the
final happiness of those for whom our passions and reason are equally
interested

We can fairly say this much and far more for our Tales Viewed as a tout
ensemble in full and complete form they are a drama of Eastern life
and a Dance of Death made sublime by faith and the highest emotions by
the certainty of expiation and the fulness of atoning equity where
virtue is victorious vice is vanquished and the ways of Allah are
justified to man They are a panorama which remains kenspeckle upon the
mental retina They form a phantasmagoria in which archangels and
angels devils and goblins men of air of fire of water naturally
mingle with men of earth where flying horses and talking fishes are
utterly realistic where King and Prince meet fisherman and pauper
lamia and cannibal where citizen jostles Badawi eunuch meets knight
the Kazi hobnobs with the thief the pure and pious sit down to the
same tray with the bawd and the pimp where the professional
religionist the learned Koranist and the strictest moralist consort
with the wicked magician the scoffer and the debaucheepoet like Abu
Nowas where the courtier jests with the boor and where the sweep is
bedded with the noble lady And the characters are finished and
quickened by a few touches swift and sure as the glance of sunbeams
The work is a kaleidoscope where everything falls into picture gorgeous
palaces and pavilions grisly underground caves and deadly wolds
gardens fairer than those of the Hesperid seas dashing with clashing
billows upon enchanted mountains valleys of the Shadow of Death
airvoyages and promenades in the abysses of ocean the duello the
battle and the siege the wooing of maidens and the marriagerite All
the splendour and squalor the beauty and baseness the glamour and
grotesqueness the magic and the mournfulness the bravery and the
baseness of Oriental life are here its pictures of the three great Arab
passions love war and fancy entitle it to be called Blood Musk and
Hashish And still more the genius of the storyteller quickens
the dry bones of history and by adding Fiction to Fact revives the dead
past the Caliphs and the Caliphate return to Baghdad and Cairo whilst
Asmodeus kindly removes the terraceroof of every tenement and allows
our curious glances to take in the whole interior This is perhaps the
best proof of their power Finally the picturegallery opens with a
series of weird and striking adventures and shows as a tailpiece an
idyllic scene of love and wedlock in halls before reeking with lust and
blood

I have noticed in my Foreword that the two main characteristics of The
Nights are Pathos and Humour alternating with highly artistic contrast
and carefully calculated to provoke tears and smiles in the coffeehouse
audience which paid for them The sentimental portion mostly breathes a
tender passion and a simple sadness such are the Badawis dying
farewell vol i  the ladys broken heart on account of her lovers
hand being cut off vol i  the Wazirs death the mourners song
and the tongue of the case vol ii  the murder of Princess
Abrzah with the babe sucking its dead mothers breast vol ii 
and generally the last moments of good Moslems eg vol v 
which are described with inimitable terseness and navet The sad and
the gay mingle in the character of the good Hammamstoker who becomes Roi
Crotte and the melancholy deepens in the Tale of the Mad Lover vol v
 the Blacksmith who could handle fire without hurt vol v 
the Devotee Prince vol v  and the whole Tale of Azzah vol ii
 whose angelic love is set off by the sensuality and selfishness of
her more fortunate rivals A new note of absolutely tragic dignity seems
to be struck in the Sweep and the Noble Lady vol iv  showing the
piquancy of sentiment which can be evolved from the common and the
unclean The pretty conceit of the Lute vol v  is afterwards
carried out in the Song vol viii  which is a masterpiece of
originality and in the Arabic of exquisite tenderness and poetic
melancholy the wail over the past and the vain longing for reunion And
the very depths of melancholy of majestic pathos and of true sublimity
are reached in Manycolumned Iram vol iv  and the City of Brass
vol vi  the metrical part of the latter shows a luxury of woe it
is one long wail of despair which echoes long and loud in the hearers
heart

In my Foreword I have compared the humorous vein of the comic tales with
our northern wut chiefly for the dryness and slyness which pervade
it But it differs in degree as much as the pathos varies The staple
article is Cairene chaff a peculiar banter possibly inherited from
their pagan forefathers instances of this are found in the Cock and Dog
vol i  the Eunuchs address to the Cook vol i  the
Wazirs exclamation Too little pepper vol i  the
selfcommuning of Judar vol vi  the Hashisheater in Ali Shr
vol iv  the scene between the brotherWazirs vol i  the
treatment of the Gobbo vol i   the Water of Zemzem vol i
 and the Eunuchs Bukhayt and Kafur vol ii   At times
it becomes a masterpiece of fun of rollicking Rabelaisian humour
underlaid by the caustic motherwit of Sancho Panza as in the orgie of
the Ladies of Baghdad vol i   the Holy Ointment applied to the
beard of Luka the Knightunxerunt regem Salomonem vol ii  and
Jaafar and the Old Badawi vol v  with its reminiscence of
chaffy King Amasis This reaches its acme in the description of ugly
old age vol v  in The Three Wishes the wickedest of satires on
the alter sexus vi  in Ali the Persian vol iv  in the
Lady and her Five Suitors vol vi  which corresponds and
contrasts with the dully told Story of Upakosa and her Four Lovers of
the Kath p  and in The Man of AlYaman vol iv  where we
find the true Falstaffian touch But there is sterling wit sweet and
bright expressed without any artifice of words in the immortal
Barbers tales of his brothers especially the second the fifth and the
sixth vol i   and  Finally wherever the honest and
independent old debauchee Abu Nowas makes his appearance the fun becomes
fescennine and milesian


                      BTHE MANNER OF THE NIGHTS

And now after considering the matter I will glance at the language and
style of The Nights The first point to remark is the peculiarly happy
framework of the Recueil which I cannot but suspect set an example to
the Decamerone and its host of successors The admirable
Introduction a perfect miseenscne gives the amplest raison dtre
of the work which thus has all the unity required for a great romantic
recueil We perceive this when reading the contemporary Hindu work the
Kath Sarit Sgara which is at once so like and so unlike The
Nights here the preamble is insufficient the whole is clumsy for want
of a thread upon which the many independent tales and fables should be
strung and the consequent disorder and confusion tell upon the
reader who cannot remember the sequence without taking notes

As was said in my Foreword without the Nights no Arabian Nights and
now so far from holding the pauses an intolerable interruption to the
narrative I attach additional importance to these pleasant and restful
breaks introduced into long and intricate stories Indeed beginning
again I should adopt the plan of the Cal Edit opening and ending every
division with a dialogue between the sisters Upon this point however
opinions will differ and the critic will remind me that the consensus of
the MSS would be wanting The Bresl Edit in many places merely
interjects the number of the night without interrupting the tale the
MS in the Bibliothque Nationale used by Galland contains only cclxxxii
and the Frenchman ceases to use the division after the ccxxxvith Night
and in some editions after the cxcviith A fragmentary MS
according to Scott whose friend J Anderson found it in Bengal breaks
away after Night xxix and in the Wortley Montagu the Sultan relents at
an early opportunity the stories as in Galland continuing only as an
amusement I have been careful to preserve the balanced sentences with
which the tales open the tautology and the proserhyme serving to
attract attention eg In days of yore and in times long gone
before there was a King etc in England where we strive not to waste
words this becomes Once upon a time The closings also are artfully
calculated by striking a minor chord after the rush and hurry of the
incidents to suggest repose And they led the most pleasurable of
lives and the most delectable till there came to them the Destroyer of
delights and the Severer of societies and they became as though they had
never been Place this by the side of Boccaccios favourite
formulEgli conquist poi la Scozia e funne re coronato ii  Et
onorevolmente visse infino lla fine ii  Molte volte goderono del
loro amore Iddio faccia noi goder del nostro iii  E cosi nella sua
grossezza si rimase e ancor vi si sta vi  We have further docked
this tail into And they lived happily ever after

I cannot take up the Nights in their present condition without feeling
that the work has been written down from the Rwi or Nakkl the
conteur or professional storyteller also called Kasss and Maddh
corresponding with the Hindu Bhat or Bard To these men my learned
friend Baron A von Kremer would attribute the Muallakt vulgarly
called the Suspended Poems as being indited from the relation of the
Rwi Hence in our text the frequent interruption of the formula Kl
alRwi  quotes the reciter dice Turpino Moreover The Nights read
in many places like a handbook or guide for the professional who would
learn them by heart here and there introducing his gag and patter
To this business possibly we may attribute much of the ribaldry which
starts up in unexpected places it was meant simply to provoke a laugh
How old the custom is and how unchangeable is Eastern life is shown a
correspondent suggests by the Book of Esther which might form part of
The Alf Laylah On that night we read in Chap vi  could not the
King sleep and he commanded to bring the book of records of the
chronicles and they were read before the King The Rwi would declaim
the recitative somewhat in conversational style he would intone the
Saja or proserhyme and he would chant to the twanging of the Rabb a
onestringed viol the poetical parts Dr Scott borrows from the
historian of Aleppo a lifelike picture of the Storyteller He recites
walking to and fro in the middle of the coffeeroom stopping only now
and then when the expression requires some emphatical attitude He is
commonly heard with great attention and not unfrequently in the midst
of some interesting adventure when the expectation of his audience is
raised to the highest pitch he breaks off abruptly and makes his
escape leaving both his hero or heroine and his audience in the utmost
embarrassment Those who happen to be near the door endeavour to detain
him insisting upon the story being finished before he departs but he
always makes his retreat good and the auditors suspending their
curiosity are induced to return at the same time next day to hear the
sequel He has no sooner made his exit than the company in separate
parties fall to disputing about the characters of the drama or the event
of an unfinished adventure The controversy by degrees becomes serious
and opposite opinions are maintained with no less warmth than if the
fall of the city depended upon the decision

At Tangier where a murder in a coffeehouse had closed these hovels
pending a sufficient payment to the Pasha and where during the hard
winter of  the poorer classes were compelled to puff their Kayf
Bhang cannabis indica and sip their black coffee in the muddy
streets under a rainy sky I found the Rwi active on Sundays and
Thursdays the marketdays The favourite place was the Soko de barra
or large bazar outside the town whose condition is that of Suez and
Bayrut half a century ago It is a foul slope now slippery with viscous
mud then powdery with fetid dust dotted with graves and decaying
tombs unclean booths gargottes and tattered tents and frequented by
women mere bundles of unclean rags and by men wearing the haik or
burns a Franciscan frock tending their squatting camels and
chaffering over cattle for Gibraltar beefeaters Here the marketpeople
form ring about the reciter a stalwart man affecting little raiment
besides a broad waistbelt into which his lower chiffons are tucked and
noticeable only for his shock hair wild eyes broad grin and generally
disreputable aspect He usually handles a short stick and when drummer
and piper are absent he carries a tiny tomtom shaped like an
hourglass upon which he taps the periods This Scealuidhe as the
Irish call him opens the drama with extempore prayer proving that he
and the audience are good Moslems he speaks slowly and with emphasis
varying the diction with breaks of animation abundant action and the
most comical grimace he advances retires and wheels about
illustrating every point with pantomime and his features voice and
gestures are so expressive that even Europeans who cannot understand a
word of Arabic divine the meaning of his tale The audience stands
breathless and motionless surprising strangers by the ingenuousness
and freshness of feeling hidden under their hard and savage exterior
The performance usually ends with the embryo actor going round for alms
and flourishing in air every silver bit the usual honorarium being a
few fls that marvellous money of Barbary big coppers worth
onetwelfth of a penny All the tales I heard were purely local but
Fakhri Bey a young Osmanli domiciled for some time in Fez and Mequinez
assured me that The Nights are still recited there

Many travellers including Dr Russell have complained that they failed
to find a complete MS copy of The Nights Evidently they never heard of
the popular superstition which declares that no one can read through
them without dyingit is only fair that my patrons should know this
Yacoub Artn Pasha declares that the superstition dates from the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and he explains it in two ways
Firstly it is a facetious exaggeration meaning that no one has leisure
or patience to wade through the long repertory Secondly the work is
condemned as futile When Egypt produced savants and legists like Ibn
alHajar AlAyni and AlKastallni to mention no others the taste
of the country inclined to dry factual studies and positive science
nor indeed has this taste wholly died out there are not a few who
like Khayri Pasha contend that the mathematic is more useful even for
legal studies than history and geography and at Cairo the chief of the
Educational Department has always been an engineer ie a
mathematician The Olema declared war against all futilities in which
they included not only stories but also what is politely entitled
Authentic History From this to the fatal effect of such lecture is only
a step Society however cannot rest without light literature so the
novelreading class was thrown back upon writings which had all the
indelicacy and few of the merits of The Nights

Turkey is the only Moslem country which has dared to produce a regular
drama and to arouse the energies of such brilliant writers as Munf
Pasha statesman and scholar Ekrem Bey literato and professor Keml
Bey held by some to be the greatest writer in modern Osmanliland and
Abd alHakk Hamd Bey first Secretary of the London Embassy The
theatre began in its ruder form by taking subjects bodily from The
Nights then it annexed its plays as we dothe Novel having ousted the
Dramafrom the French and lastly it took courage to be original Many
years ago I saw Harun alRashid and the Three Kalandars with deerskins
and all their properties de rigueur in the courtyard of Government
House Damascus declaiming to the extreme astonishment and delight of
the audience It requires only to glance at The Nights for seeing how
much histrionic matter they contain

In considering the style of The Nights we must bear in mind that the
work has never been edited according to our ideas of the process
Consequently there is no just reason for translating the whole verbatim
et literatim as has been done by Torrens Lane and Payne in his Tales
from the Arabic This conscientious treatment is required for
versions of an author like Camoens whose works were carefully corrected
and arranged by a competent littrateur but it is not merited by The
Nights as they now are The Macnaghten the Bulak and the Bayrut texts
though printed from MSS identical in order often differ in minor
matters Many friends have asked me to undertake the work but even if
lightened by the aid of Shaykhs Munshis and copyists the labour would
be severe tedious and thankless better leave the holes open than patch
them with fancy work or with heterogeneous matter The learned indeed
as Lane tells us i  iii  being thoroughly dissatisfied with
the plain and popular the ordinary and vulgar note of the language
have attempted to refine and improve it and have more than once
threatened to remodel it that is to make it odious This would be to
dress up Robert Burns in plumes borrowed from Dryden and Pope

The first defect of the texts is in the distribution and arrangement of
the matter as I have noticed in the case of Sindbad the Seaman vol
vi  Moreover many of the earlier Nights are overlong and not a few
of the others are overshort this however has the prime recommendation
of variety Even the vagaries of editor and scribe will not account for
all the incoherences disorder and inconsequence and for the vain
iterations which suggest that the author has forgotten what he said In
places there are dead allusions to persons and tales which are left
dark eg vol i pp    etc The digressions are abrupt and
useless leading nowhere while sundry pages are wearisome for excess of
prolixity or hardly intelligible for extreme conciseness The perpetual
recurrence of mean colloquialisms and of words and idioms peculiar to
Egypt and Syria also takes from the pleasure of the perusal Yet we
cannot deny that it has its use this unadorned language of familiar
conversation in its day adapted for the understanding of the people is
best fitted for the Rawis craft in the camp and caravan the Harem the
bazar and the coffeehouse Moreover as has been well said The Nights
is the only written halfway house between the literary and colloquial
Arabic which is accessible to all and thus it becomes necessary to the
students who would qualify themselves for service in Moslem lands from
Mauritania to Mesopotamia It freely uses Turkish words like Khtn
and Persian terms as Shhbandar thus requiring for translation not
only a somewhat archaic touch but also a vocabulary borrowed from
various sources otherwise the effect would not be reproduced In
places however the style rises to the highly ornate approaching the
pompous eg the Wazirial addresses in the tale of King Jaliad The
battlescenes mostly admirable vol v  are told with the
conciseness of a despatch and the vividness of an artist the two
combining to form perfect wordpictures Of the Bada or euphuistic
style parleying euphuism and of AlSaja the prose rhyme I shall
speak in a future page

The characteristics of the whole are navet and simplicity clearness
and a singular concision The gorgeousness is in the imagery not in the
language the words are weak while the sense as in the classical
Scandnavian books is strong and here the Arabic differs diametrically
from the florid exuberance and turgid amplifications of the Persian
storyteller which sound so hollow and unreal by the side of a chaster
model It abounds in formul such as repetitions of religious phrases
which are unchangeable There are certain stock comparisons as Lokmans
wisdom Josephs beauty Jacobs grief Jobs patience Davids music
and Maryam the Virgins chastity The eyebrow is a Nn the eye a Sd
the mouth a Mm A hero is more prudent than the crow a better guide
than the Kat grouse more generous than the cock warier than the
crane braver than the lion more aggressive than the panther
finersighted than the horse craftier than the fox greedier than the
gazelle more vigilant than the dog and thriftier than the ant The
cupboy is a sun rising from the dark underworld symbolised by his
collar his cheekmole is a crumb of ambergris his nose is a scymitar
grided at the curve his lower lip is a jujube his teeth are the
Pleiades or hailstones his browlocks are scorpions his young hair on
the upper lip is an emerald his side beard is a swarm of ants or a Lm
lletter enclosing the roses or anemones of his cheek The cupgirl is
a moon who rivals the sheen of the sun her forehead is a pearl set off
by the jet of her idiotfringe her eyelashes scorn the sharp sword
and her glances are arrows shot from the bow of the eyebrows A mistress
necessarily belongs though living in the next street to the Wady Liw
and to a hostile clan of Badawin whose blades are ever thirsting for the
lovers blood and whose malignant tongues aim only at the defilement of
separation Youth is upright as an Alif or slender and bending as a
branch of the Bntree which we should call a willowwand while
Age crabbed and crooked bends groundwards vainly seeking in the dust
his lost juvenility As Baron de Slane says of these stock comparisons
Ibn Khall i xxxvi The figurative language of Moslem poets is
often difficult to be understood The narcissus is the eye the
feeble stem of that plant bends languidly under its flower and thus
recalls to mind the languor of the eyes Pearls signify both tears
and teeth the latter are sometimes called hailstones from their
whiteness and moisture the lips are cornelians or rubies the
gums a pomegranate flower the dark foliage of the myrtle is
synonymous with the black hair of the beloved or with the first down
on the cheeks of puberty The down itself is called the izr or
headstall of the bridle and the curve of the izar is compared to the
letters lm  and nn  Ringlets trace on the cheek or
neck the letter Ww  they are called Scorpions as the Greek
 either from their dark colour or their agitated movements
the eye is a sword the eyelids scabbards the whiteness of the
complexion camphor and a mole or beautyspot musk which term
denotes also dark hair A mole is sometimes compared also to an
ant creeping on the cheek towards the honey of the mouth a
handsome face is both a full moon and day black hair is
night the waist is a willowbranch or a lance the water of
the face is selfrespect a poet sells the water of his face
when he bestows mercenary praises on a rich patron

This does not sound promising yet as has been said of Arab music the
persistent repetition of the same notes in the minor key is by no means
monotonous and ends with haunting the ear occupying the thought and
touching the soul Like the distant frogconcert and chirp of the
cicada the creak of the waterwheel and the stroke of hammers upon the
anvil from afar the murmur of the fountain the sough of the wind and
the plash of the wavelet they occupy the sensorium with a soothing
effect forming a barbaric music full of sweetness and peaceful
pleasure


                                  IV
                           SOCIAL CONDITION

I here propose to treat of the Social Condition which The Nights
discloses of AlIslam at the earlier period of its development
concerning the position of women and about the pornology of the great
Sagabook


                              AALISLAM

A splendid and glorious life was that of Baghdad in the days of the
mighty Caliph when the Capital had towered to the zenith of
grandeur and was already trembling and tottering to the fall The centre
of human civilization which was then confined to Greece and Arabia and
the metropolis of an Empire exceeding in extent the widest limits of
Rome it was essentially a city of pleasure a Paris of the ixth
century The Palace of Peace Dr alSalm worthy successor of
Babylon and Nineveh which had outrivalled Damascus the Smile of the
Prophet and Kufah the successor of Hira and the magnificent creation
of Caliph Omar possessed unrivalled advantages of site and climate The
TigrisEuphrates Valley where the fabled Garden of Eden has been
placed in early ages succeeded the NileValley as a great centre of
human development and the prerogative of a central and commanding
position still promises it even in the present state of decay and
desolation under the unspeakable Turk a magnificent future when
railways and canals shall connect it with Europe The city of palaces
and government offices hotels and pavilions mosques and colleges
kiosks and squares bazars and markets pleasure grounds and orchards
adorned with all the graceful charms which Saracenic architecture had
borrowed from the Byzantines lay couched upon the banks of the
DijlahHiddekel under a sky of marvellous purity and in a climate which
makes mere life a Kayfthe luxury of tranquil enjoyment It was
surrounded by farextending suburbs like Rusfah on the Eastern side
and villages like Baturanjah dear to the votaries of pleasure and with
the roar of a gigantic capital mingled the hum of prayer the trilling
of birds the thrilling of harp and lute the shrilling of pipes the
witching strains of the professional Almah and the minstrels lay

The population of Baghdad must have been enormous when the smallest
number of her sons who fell victims to Hulku Khan in  was estimated
at eight hundred thousand while other authorities more than double the
terrible butchers bill Her policy and polity were unique A
wellregulated routine of tribute and taxation personally inspected by
the Caliph a network of waterways canaux darrosage a noble system of
highways provided with viaducts bridges and caravanserais and a
postal service of mounted couriers enabled it to collect as in a
reservoir the wealth of the outer world The facilities for education
were upon the most extended scale large sums from private as well as
public sources were allotted to Mosques each of which by the
admirable rule of AlIslam was expected to contain a school these
establishments were richly endowed and stocked with professors collected
from every land between Khorasan and Marocco and immense
libraries attracted the learned of all nations It was a golden age
for poets and panegyrists koranists and literati preachers and
rhetoricians physicians and scientists who besides receiving high
salaries and fabulous presents were treated with all the honours of
Chinese Mandarins and like these the humblest Moslemfisherman or
artizancould aspire through knowledge or savoir faire to the highest
offices of the Empire The effect was a grafting of Egyptian and old
Mesopotamian of Persian and GrcoLatin fruits by long Time
deteriorated upon the strong young stock of Arab genius and the
result as usual after such imping was a shoot of exceptional
luxuriance and vitality The educational establishments devoted
themselves to the three main objects recognized by the Moslem world
Theology Civil Law and Belles Lettres and a multitude of trained
Councillors enabled the ruling powers to establish and enlarge that
complicated machinery of government at once concentrated and
decentralized a despotism often fatal to the wealthy great but never
neglecting the interests of the humbler lieges which forms the beau
idal of Oriental administration Under the Chancellors of the empire
the Kazis administered law and order justice and equity and from their
decisions the poorest subject Moslem or miscreant could claim with the
general approval of the lieges access and appeal to the Caliph who as
Imm or Antistes of the Faith was High President of a Court of
Cassation

Under wise administration Agriculture and Commerce the twin pillars of
national prosperity necessarily flourished A scientific canalisation
with irrigationworks inherited from the ancients made the Mesopotamian
Valley a rival of Kemi the Black Land and rendered cultivation a
certainty of profit not a mere speculation as it must ever be to those
who perforce rely upon the fickle rains of Heaven The remains of
extensive mines prove that this source of public wealth was not
neglected navigation laws encouraged transit and traffic and
ordinances for the fisheries aimed at developing a branch of industry
which is still backward even during the xixth century Most substantial
encouragement was given to trade and commerce to manufactures and
handicrafts by the flood of gold which poured in from all parts of
earth by the presence of a splendid and luxurious court and by the
call for new arts and industries which such a civilization would
necessitate The crafts were distributed into guilds and syndicates
under their respective chiefs whom the government did not govern too
much these Shahbandars Mukaddams and Nakbs regulated the several
trades rewarded the industrious punished the fraudulent and were
personally answerable as we still see at Cairo for the conduct of
their constituents Public order the sine qu non of stability and
progress was preserved first by the satisfaction of the lieges who
despite their characteristic turbulence had few if any grievances and
secondly by a welldirected and efficient police an engine of
statecraft which in the West seems most difficult to perfect In the
East however the Wali or Chief Commissioner can reckon more or less
upon the unsalaried assistance of society the cities are divided into
quarters shut off one from other by night and every Moslem is expected
by his law and religion to keep watch upon his neighbours to report
their delinquencies and if necessary himself to carry out the penal
code But in difficult cases the guardians of the peace were assisted by
a body of private detectives women as well as men these were called
Tawwbn  the Penitents because like our Bowstreet runners they had
given up an even less respectable calling Their adventures still
delight the vulgar as did the Newgate Calendar of past generations and
to this class we owe the Tales of Calamity Ahmad Dalilah the Wily One
Saladin with the three Chiefs of Police vol iv  and AlMalik
alZhir with the Sixteen Constables Bresl Edit xi pp  Here
and in many other places we also see the origin of that picaresque
literature which arose in Spain and overran Europe and which begat Le
Moyen de Parvenir

I need say no more on this heading the civilisation of Baghdad
contrasting with the barbarism of Europe then Germanic The Nights
itself being the best expositor On the other hand the action of the
statereligion upon the state the condition of AlIslam during the
reign of AlRashid its declension from the primitive creed and its
relation to Christianity and Christendom require a somewhat extended
notice In offering the following observations it is only fair to
declare my standpoints

   All forms of faith that is belief in things unseen not
  subject to the senses and therefore unknown and in our present
  stage of development unknowable are temporary and transitory no
  religion hitherto promulgated amongst men shows any prospect of
  being final or otherwise than finite

   Religious ideas which are necessarily limited may all be traced
  home to the old seat of science and art creeds and polity in the
  Nilevalley and to this day they retain the clearest signs of their
  origin

   All socalled revealed religions consist mainly of three
  portions a cosmogony more or less mythical a history more or less
  falsified and a moral code more or less pure

AlIslam it has been said is essentially a fighting faith and never
shows to full advantage save in the field The exceeding luxury of a
wealthy capital the debauchery and variety of vices which would spring
up therein naturally as weeds in a rich fallow and the cosmopolitan
views which suggest themselves in a meetingplace of nations were sore
trials to the primitive simplicity of the Religion of Resignationthe
saving faith Harun and his cousinwife as has been shown were
orthodox and even fanatical but the Barmecides were strongly suspected
of heretical leanings and while the manyheaded showed itself as
usual violent and ready to do battle about an Azancall the learned
who sooner or later leaven the masses were profoundly dissatisfied with
the dryness and barrenness of Mohammeds creed so acceptable to the
vulgar and were devising a series of schisms and innovations

In the Tale of Tawaddud vol v  the reader has seen a fairly
extended catechism of the Creed Dn the ceremonial observances
Mazhab and the apostolic practices Sunnat of the Shafi school
which with minor modifications applies to the other three orthodox
Europe has by this time clean forgotten some tricks of her former
bigotry such as Mawmet an idol and Mahommerie mummery a
place of Moslem worship educated men no longer speak with Ockley of the
great impostor Mahomet nor believe with the learned and violent Dr
Prideaux that he was foolish and wicked enough to dispossess certain
poor orphans the sons of an inferior artificer the Ban Najjr A
host of books has attempted though hardly with success to enlighten
popular ignorance upon a crucial point namely that the Founder of
AlIslam like the Founder of Christianity never pretended to establish
a new religion His claims indeed were limited to purging the School
of Nazareth of the dross of ages and of the manifold abuses with which
long use had infected its early constitution hence to the unprejudiced
observer his reformation seems to have brought it nearer the primitive
and original doctrine than any subsequent attempts especially the
Judaizing tendencies of the socalled Protestant churches The Meccan
Apostle preached that the Hanafyyah or orthodox belief which he
subsequently named AlIslam was first taught by Allah in all its
purity and perfection to Adam and consigned to certain inspired volumes
now lost and that this primal Holy Writ received additions in the days
of his descendants Shs Seth and Idris Enoch the founder of the
Sabian not Saban faith Here therefore AlIslam at once avoided
the deplorable assumption of the Hebrews and the Christiansan error
which has been so injurious to their science and their progressof
placing their first man in circa BC  or somewhat subsequent to
the building of the Pyramids the PreAdamite races and dynasties
of the Moslems remove a great stumblingblock and square with the
anthropological views of the present day In process of time when the
Adamite religion demanded a restoration and a supplement its pristine
virtue was revived restored and further developed by the books
communicated to Abraham whose dispensation thus takes the place of the
Hebrew Noah and his Noachid In due time the Torah or Pentateuch
superseded and abrogated the Abrahamic dispensation the Zabr of
David a book not confined to the Psalms reformed the Torah the Injl
or Evangel reformed the Zabur and was itself purified quickened and
perfected by the Koran which means  the Reading or the
Recital Hence Locke with many others held Moslems to be unorthodox
that is antiTrinitarian Christians who believe in the immaculate
Conception in the Ascension and in the divine mission of Jesus and
when Priestley affirmed that Jesus was sent from God all Moslems do
the same Thus they are in the main point of doctrine connected with
the Deity simply Arians as opposed to Athanasians History proves that
the former was the earlier faith which though formally condemned in
AD  by Constantines Council of Nice overspread the Orient
beginning with Eastern Europe where Ulphilas converted the Goths which
extended into Africa with the Vandals claimed a victim or martyr as
late as in the sixteenth century and has by no means died out in
this our day

The Talmud had been completed a full century before Mohammeds time and
the Evangel had been translated into Arabic moreover travel and
converse with his Jewish and Christian friends and companions must have
convinced the Meccan apostle that Christianity was calling as loudly for
reform as Judaism had done An exaggerated Trinitarianism or rather
Tritheism a Fourth Person and Saintworship had virtually dethroned
the Deity whilst Mariolatry had made the faith a religio muliebris and
superstition had drawn from its horrid fecundity an incredible number of
heresies and monstrous absurdities Even ecclesiastic writers draw the
gloomiest pictures of the Christian Church in the fourth and seventh
centuries and one declares that the Kingdom of Heaven had become a
Hell Egypt distracted by the bloodthirsty religious wars of Copt and
Greek had been covered with hermitages by a gens terna of
semimaniacal superstition Syria ever feracious of heresies had
allowed many of her finest tracts to be monopolised by monkeries and
nunneries After many a tentative measure Mohammed seems to have
built his edifice upon two bases the unity of the Godhead and the
priesthood of the paterfamilias He abolished for ever the sacerdos
alter Christus whose existence as some one acutely said is the best
proof of Christianity and whom all know to be its weakest point The
Moslem family however humble was to be the model in miniature of the
State and every father in AlIslam was made priest and pontiff in his
own house able unaided to marry himself to circumcise to baptise as
it were his children to instruct them in the law and canonically to
bury himself vol viii  Ritual properly so called there was
none congregational prayers were merely those of the individual en
masse and the only admitted approach to a sacerdotal order were the
Olema or scholars learned in the legistic and the Mullah or
schoolmaster By thus abolishing the priesthood Mohammed reconciled
ancient with modern wisdom Scito dominum said Cato pro tot
famili rem divinam facere No priest at a birth no priest at a
marriage no priest at a death is the aspiration of the present
Rationalistic School

The Meccan apostle wisely retained the compulsory sacrament of
circumcision and the ceremonial ablutions of the Mosaic law and the
five daily prayers not only diverted mans thoughts from the world but
tended to keep his body pure These two institutions had been practised
throughout life by the Founder of Christianity but the followers who
had never even seen him abolished them for purposes evidently political
and propagandist By ignoring the truth that cleanliness is next to
godliness they paved the way for such saints as Simon Stylites and Sabba
who like the lowest Hindu orders of ascetics made filth a concominant
and an evidence of piety even now English Catholic girls are at times
forbidden by Italian priests a frequent use of the bath as a signpost to
the sin of luxury Mohammed would have accepted the morals contained
in the Sermon on the Mount much more readily than did the Jews from whom
its matter was borrowed He did something to abolish the use of
wine which in the East means only its abuse and he denounced games of
chance well knowing that the excitable races of subtropical climates
cannot play with patience fairness or moderation He set aside certain
sums for charity to be paid by every Believer and he was the first to
establish a poorrate Zakt thus he avoided the shame and scandal of
mendicancy which beginning in the Catholic countries of Southern
Europe extends to Syria and as far East as Christianity is found By
these and other measures of the same import he made the ideal Moslems
life physically clean moderate and temperate

But Mohammed the master mind of the age had we must own a genuine
prophetic power a sinking of self in the Divine not distinguishable in
kind from the inspiration of the Hebrew prophets especially in that
puritanical and pharisaic narrowness which with characteristic
simplicity can see no good outside its own petty pale He had insight
as well as outsight and the two taught him that personal and external
reformation were mean matters compared with elevating the inner man In
the purer Faith which he was commissioned to abrogate and to quicken
he found two vital defects equally fatal to its energy and to its
longevity These were and are its egoism and its degradation of
humanity Thus it cannot be a pleroma it needs a Higher Law As
Judaism promised the good Jew all manner of temporal blessings issue
riches wealth honour power length of days so Christianity offered
the good Christian as a bribe to lead a godly life personal salvation
and a future state of happiness in fact the Kingdom of Heaven with an
alternative threat of Hell It never rose to the height of the Hindu
Brahmans and LaoTse the Ancient Teacher of Zeno the Stoic and his
disciples the noble Pharisees who believed and preached that Virtue
is its own reward It never dared to say Do good for Goods
sake even now it does not declare with Cicero The sum of all is
that what is right should be sought for its own sake because it is
right and not because it is enacted It does not even now venture to
say with Philo Judus The good man seeks the day for the sake of the
day and the light for the lights sake and he labours to acquire what
is good for the sake of the good itself and not of anything else So
far for the egotism nave and unconscious of Christianity whose
burden is Do good to escape Hell and gain Heaven

A no less defect in the School of Galilee is its low view of human
nature Adopting as sober and authentic history an OsirianHebrew myth
which Philo and a host of Rabbis explain away each after his own
fashion Christianity dwells lovingly as it were upon the Fall of
man and seems to revel in the contemptible condition to which
original sin condemned him thus grovelling before God ad majorem Dei
gloriam To such a point was and is this carried that the Synod of Dort
declared Infantes infidelium morientes in infanti reprobatos esse
statuimus nay many of the orthodox still hold a Christian babe dying
unbaptised to be unfit for a higher existence and some have even
created a limbo expressly to domicile the innocents of whom is the
kingdom of Heaven Here if any where the cloven foot shows itself and
teaches us that the only solid stratum underlying priestcraft is one
composed of  s d

 And I never can now believe it my Lord Bishop we come to this earth
 Ready damned with the seeds of evil sown quite so thick at our birth

sings Edwin Arnold We ask can infatuation or hypocrisyfor it
must be the one or the othergo farther But the Adamical myth is
opposed to all our modern studies The deeper we dig into the Earths
crust the lower are the specimens of human remains which occur and
hitherto not a single find has come to revive the faded glories of

              Adam the goodliest man of men since born 
              His sons the fairest of her daughters Eve

Thus Christianity admitting like Judaism its own saints and santons
utterly ignores the progress of humanity perhaps the only belief in
which the wise man can take unmingled satisfaction Both have proposed
an originally perfect being with hyacinthine locks from whose type all
the subsequent humans are degradations physical and moral We on the
other hand hold from the evidence of our senses that early man was a
savage very little superior to the brute that during mans millions of
years upon earth there has been a gradual advance towards perfection at
times irregular and even retrograde but in the main progressive and
that a comparison of man in the xixth century with the caveman
affords us the means of measuring past progress and of calculating the
future of humanity

Mahommed was far from rising to the moral heights of the ancient sages
he did nothing to abate the egotism of Christianity he even exaggerated
the pleasures of its Heaven and the horrors of its Hell On the other
hand he did much to exalt human nature He passed over the Fall with a
light hand he made man superior to the angels he encouraged his
fellowcreatures to be great and good by dwelling upon their nobler not
their meaner side he acknowledged even in this world the
perfectability of mankind including womankind and in proposing the
loftiest ideal he acted unconsciously upon the grand dictum of
chivalryHonneur oblige His prophets were mostly faultless men
and if the Pure of Allah sinned he sinned against himself Lastly
he made Allah predetermine the career and fortunes not only of empires
but of every created being thus inculcating sympathy and tolerance of
others which is true humanity and a proud resignation to evil as to
good fortune This is the doctrine which teaches the vulgar Moslem a
dignity observed even by the blind traveller and which enables him to
display a moderation a fortitude and a selfcommand rare enough
amongst the followers of the purer creed

Christian historians explain variously the portentous rise of AlIslam
and its marvellous spread over vast regions not only of pagans and
idolators but of Christians Prideaux disingenuously suggests that it
seems to have been purposely raised up by God to be a scourge to the
Christian church for not living in accordance with their most holy
religion The popular excuse is by the free use of the sword this
however is mere ignorance in Mohammeds day and early AlIslam only
actual fighters were slain the rest were allowed to pay the
Jizyah or capitationtax and to become tributaries enjoying almost
all the privileges of Moslems But even had forcible conversion been
most systematically practised it would have afforded an insufficient
explanation of the phenomenal rise of an empire which covered more
ground in eighty years than Rome had gained in eight hundred During so
short a time the grand revival of Monotheism had consolidated into a
mighty nation despite their eternal bloodfeuds the scattered Arab
tribes a sixyears campaign had conquered Syria and a lustre or two
utterly overthrew Persia humbled the GrcoRoman subdued Egypt and
extended the Faith along northern Africa as far as the Atlantic Within
three generations the Copts of Nileland had formally cast out
Christianity and the same was the case with Syria the cradle of the
Nazarene and Mesopotamia one of his strongholds although both were
backed by all the remaining power of the Byzantine empire Northwestern
Africa which had rejected the idolatrophilosophic system of pagan and
imperial Rome and had accepted after lukewarm fashion the Arian
Christianity imported by the Vandals and the Nicene mystery of the
Trinity hailed with enthusiasm the doctrines of the Koran and has
never ceased to be most zealous in its Islam And while Mohammedanism
speedily reduced the limits of Christendom by onethird while
throughout the Arabian Saracenic and Turkish invasions whole Christian
peoples embraced the monotheistic faith there are hardly any instances
of defection from the new creed and with the exception of Spain and
Sicily it has never been suppressed in any land where once it took
root Even now when Mohammedanism no longer wields the sword it is
spreading over wide regions in China in the Indian Archipelago and
especially in Western and Central Africa propagated only by
selfeducated individuals trading travellers while Christianity makes
no progress and cannot exist on the Dark Continent without strong
support from Government Nor can we explain this honourable reception by
the licentiousness ignorantly attributed to AlIslam one of the most
severely moral of institutions or by the allurements of polygamy and
concubinage slavery and a wholly sensual Paradise devoted to
eating drinking and the pleasures of the sixth sense The true and
simple explanation is that this grand Reformation of Christianity was
urgently wanted when it appeared that it suited the people better than
the creed which it superseded and that it has not ceased to be
sufficient for their requirements social sexual and vital As the
practical Orientalist Dr Leitner well observes from his own
experience The Mohammedan religion can adapt itself better than any
other and has adapted itself to circumstances and to the needs of the
various races which profess it in accordance with the spirit of the
age Hence I add its wide diffusion and its impregnable
position The dead hand stiff and motionless is a forcible simile for
the present condition of AlIslam but it results from limited and
imperfect observation and it fails in the sine qu non of similes and
metaphors a foundation of fact

I cannot quit this subject without a passing reference to an admirably
written passage in Mr Palgraves travels which is essentially
unfair to AlIslam The author has had ample opportunities of comparing
creeds of Jewish blood and born a Protestant he became a Catholic and
a Jesuit Pre Michel Cohen in a Syrian convent he crossed Arabia
as a good Moslem and he finally returned to his premier amour
Anglicanism But his picturesque depreciation of Mohammedanism which
has found due appreciation in more than one popular volume is a
notable specimen of special pleading of the ad captandum in its modern
and least honest form The writer begins by assuming the arid and barren
Wahhabiism which he had personally studied as a fair expression of
the Saving Faith What should we say to a Moslem traveller who would
make the Calvinism of the sourest Covenanter model genuine and ancient
Christianity What would sensible Moslems say to these propositions of
Professor Maccovius and the Synod of DortGood works are an obstacle to
salvation God does by no means will the salvation of all men he does
will sin and he destines men to sin as sin What would they think of
the Inadmissible Grace the Perseverance of the Elect the
Supralapsarian and the Sublapsarian and finally of a Deity the author
of mans existence temptation and fall who deliberately preordains
sin and ruin Father Cohen carries out into the regions of the extreme
his strictures on the one grand vitalising idea of AlIslam There is
no god but God and his deduction concerning the Pantheism of
Force sounds unreal and unsound compared with the sensible remarks upon
the same subject by Dr Badger who sees the abstruseness of the
doctrine and does not care to include it in hard and fast lines or to
subject it to mere logical analysis Upon the subject of
predestination Mr Palgrave quotes not from the Koran but from the
Ahds or Traditional Sayings of the Apostle but what importance
attaches to a legend in the Mischnah or Oral Law of the Hebrews
utterly ignored by the Written Law He joins the many in complaining
that even the mention of the love of God is absent from Mohammeds
theology burking the fact that it never occurs in the Jewish scriptures
and that the genius of Arabic like Hebrew does not admit the
expression worse still he keeps from his reader such Koranic passages
as to quote no other Allah loveth you and will forgive your sins
iii  He pities Allah for having no son companion or counsellor
and of course he must equally commiserate Jehovah Finally his views
of the lifelessness of AlIslam are directly opposed to the opinions of
Dr Leitner and the experience of all who have lived in Moslem lands
Such are the ingenious but not ingenuous distortions of fact the fine
instances of the pathetic fallacy and the noteworthy illustrations of
the falsehood of extremes which have engendered Mohammedanism a
Relapse the worst form of Monotheism and which have been eagerly
seized upon and further deformed by the authors of popular books that
is volumes written by those who know little for those who know less

In AlRashids day a mighty change had passed over the primitive
simplicity of AlIslam the change to which faiths and creeds like
races and empires and all things sublunary are subject The proximity
of Persia and the close intercourse with the GrcoRomans had polished
and greatly modified the physiognomy of the rugged old belief all
manner of metaphysical subtleties had cropped up with the usual
disintegrating effect and some of these threatened even the unity of
the Godhead Musaylimah and Karmat had left traces of their handiwork
the Mutazilites separatists or secessors actively propagated their
doctrine of a created and temporal Koran The Khrij or Ibzi who
rejects and reviles Ab Turb Caliph Ali contended passionately with
the Shah who reviles and rejects the other three Successors and
these sectarians favoured by the learned and by the Abbasides in their
jealous hatred of the Ommiades went to the extreme length of the
AliIlhithe Godmakers of Aliwhilst the Dahr and the Zindk the
Mundanist and the Agnostic proposed to sweep away the whole edifice
The neoPlatonism and Gnosticism which had not essentially affected
Christendom found in AlIslam a rich fallow and gained strength
and luxuriance by the solid materialism and conservatism of its basis
Such were a few of the distracting and resolving influences which Time
had brought to bear upon the True Believer and which after some half a
dozen generations had separated the several schisms by a wider breach
than that which yawns between Orthodox Romanist and Lutheran Nor was
this scandal in AlIslam abated until the Tartar sword applied to it the
sharpest remedy


                               BWOMAN

The next point I propose to consider is the position of womanhood in The
Nights so curiously at variance with the stock ideas concerning the
Moslem home and domestic policy still prevalent not only in England
but throughout Europe Many readers of these volumes have remarked to me
with much astonishment that they find the female characters more
remarkable for decision action and manliness than the male and are
wonderstruck by their masterful attitude and by the supreme influence
they exercise upon public and private life

I have glanced at the subject of the sex in AlIslam to such an extent
throughout my notes that little remains here to be added Women all the
world over are what men make them and the main charm of Amazonian
fiction is to see how they live and move and have their being without
any masculine guidance But it is the old evernew fable

              Who drew the Lion vanquished Twas a man

The books of the Ancients written in that stage of civilisation when
the sexes are at civil war make women even more than in real life the
creatures of their masters hence from the dawn of literature to the
present day the sex has been the subject of disappointed abuse and
eulogy almost as unmerited Ecclesiastes perhaps the strangest specimen
of an inspired volume the world has yet produced boldly declares One
upright man among a thousand I have found but a woman among all have
I not found vol vii  thus confirming the pessimism of
Petronius

            Femina nulla bona est et si bona contigit ulla
            Nescio quo fato res mala facta bona est

In the Psalms again xxx  we have the old sneer at the three
insatiables Hell Earth and the Parts feminine os vulv and
Rabbinical learning has embroidered these and other texts producing a
truly hideous caricature A Hadis attributed to Mohammed runs They
women lack wits and faith When Eve was created Satan rejoiced
sayingThou art half of my host the trustee of my secret and my shaft
wherewith I shoot and miss not Another tells us I stood at the gate
of Heaven and lo most of its inmates were poor and I stood at the
gate of Hell and lo most of its inmates were women Take care
of the glassphials cried the Prophet to a camelguide singing with a
sweet voice Yet the Meccan apostle made as has been seen his own
household produce two perfections The blatant popular voice follows
with such dictes as Women are made of nectar and poison Women
have long hair and short wits and so forth Nor are the Hindus behind
hand Woman has fickleness implanted in her by Nature like the flashings
of lightning Kath ss i  she is valueless as a straw to the
heroic mind  she is hard as adamant in sin and soft as flour in
fear  and like the fly she quits camphor to settle on compost
ii  What dependence is there in the crowing of a hen womens
opinions says the Hindi proverb also A virgin with grey hairs
ie a monster and Wherever wendeth a fairy face a devil wendeth
with her The same superficial view of holding woman to be lesser and
very inferior man is taken generally by the classics and Euripides
distinguished himself by misogyny although he drew the beautiful
character of Alcestis Simonides more merciful than Ecclesiastes after
naming his swinewomen dogwomen catwomen etc ends the decade with
the admirable beewoman thus making ten per cent honest In medival or
Germanic Europe the doctrine of the Virgin mother gave the sex a status
unknown to the ancients except in Egypt where Isis was the helpmate
and completion of Osiris in modern parlance The Woman clothed with the
Sun The kindly and courtly Palmerin of England in whose pages
gentlemen may find their choice of sweet inventions and gentlewomen be
satisfied with courtly expectations suddenly blurts out But in truth
women are never satisfied by reason being governed by accident or
appetite chapt xlix

The Nights as might be expected from the emotional East exaggerate
these views Women are mostly Sectaries of the god Wnsch beings of
impulse blown about by every gust of passion stable only in
instability constant only in inconstancy The false ascetic the
perfidious and murderous crone and the old hagprocuress who pimps like
Umm Kulsum for mere pleasure in the luxury of sin are drawn with
an experienced and loving hand Yet not the less do we meet with
examples of the dutiful daughter the model lover matronly in her
affection the devoted wife the perfect mother the saintly devotee
the learned preacher Univira the chaste widow and the selfsacrificing
heroic woman If we find vol iii  the sex described as

               An offal cast by kites whereer they list

and the studied insults of vol iii  we also come upon an admirable
sketch of conjugal happiness vol vii   and to mention no other
Shahryars attestation to Shahrazads excellence in the last charming
pages of The Nights It is the same with the Kath whose praise and
dispraise are equally enthusiastic eg Women of good family are
guarded by their own virtue the sole efficient chamberlain but the
Lord himself can hardly guard the unchaste Who can stem a furious
stream and a frantic woman i  Excessive love in woman is your
only hero for daring i  Thus fair ones naturally feeble bring
about a series of evil actions which engender discernment and aversion
to the world but here and there you will find a virtuous woman who
adorneth a glorious house as the streak of the moon arrayeth the breadth
of the Heavens i  So you see King honourable matrons are
devoted to their husbands and tis not the case that women are always
bad ii  And there is true wisdom in that even balance of
feminine qualities advocated by our HinduHindi classbook the
Totinmeh or Parrot volume The perfect woman has seven requisites She
must not always be merry  nor sad  she must not always be talking
 nor silently musing  she must not always be adorning herself 
nor neglecting her person  and  at all times she must be
moderate and selfpossessed

The legal status of womankind in AlIslam is exceptionally high a fact
of which Europe has often been assured although the truth has not even
yet penetrated into the popular brain Nearly a century ago one Mirza
Ab Tlib Khn an Amildr or revenue collector after living two years
in London wrote an apology for or rather a vindication of his
countrywomen which is still worth reading and quoting Nations are
but superficial judges of one another where customs differ they often
remark only the salient distinctive points which when examined prove
to be of minor importance Europeans seeing and hearing that women in
the East are cloistered as the Grecian matron was wont  
and  that wives may not walk out with their husbands and
cannot accompany them to balls and parties moreover that they are
always liable like the ancient Hebrew to the mortification of the
sisterwife have most ignorantly determined that they are mere
serviles and that their lives are not worth living Indeed a learned
lady Miss Martineau once visiting a Harem went into ectasies of pity
and sorrow because the poor things knew nothing ofsay trigonometry and
the use of the globes Sonnini thought otherwise and my experience
like that of all old dwellers in the East is directly opposed to this
conclusion

I have noted Night cmlxii that Mohammed in the fifth year of his
reign after his illadvised and scandalous marriage with his
fosterdaughter Zaynab established the Hijb or veiling of women It
was probably an exaggeration of local usage a modified separation of
the sexes which extended and still extends even to the Badawi must
long have been customary in Arabian cities and its object was to
deliver the sexes from temptation as the Koran says xxxii  purer
will this practice be for your hearts and their hearts The
women who delight in restrictions which tend to their honour accepted
it willingly and still affect it they do not desire a liberty or rather
a licence which they have learned to regard as inconsistent with their
timehonoured notions of feminine decorum and delicacy and they would
think very meanly of a husband who permitted them to be exposed like
hetair to the public gaze As Zubayr Pasha exiled to Gibraltar
for anothers treason said to my friend Colonel Buckle after visiting
quarters evidently laid out by a jealous husband We Arabs think that
when a man has a precious jewel tis wiser to lock it up in a box than
to leave it about for anyone to take The Eastern adopts the
instinctive the Western prefers the rational method The former
jealously guards his treasure surrounds it with all precautions fends
off from it all risks and if the treasure go astray kills it The
latter after placing it en evidence upon an eminence in ball dress
with back and bosom bared to the gaze of society a bundle of charms
exposed to every possible seduction allows it to take its own way and
if it be misled he kills or tries to kill the misleader It is a fiery
trial and the few who safely pass through it may claim a higher
standpoint in the moral world than those who have never been sorely
tried But the crucial question is whether Christian Europe has done
wisely in offering such temptations

The second and main objection to Moslem custom is the marriagesystem
which begins with a girl being wedded to a man whom she knows only by
hearsay This was the habit of our forbears not many generations ago
and it still prevails amongst noble houses in Southern Europe where a
lengthened study of it leaves me doubtful whether the lovemarriage
as it is called or wedlock with an utter stranger evidently the two
extremes is likely to prove the happier The sisterwife is or would
be a sore trial to monogamic races like those of Northern Europe where
Caia all but the equal of Caius in most points mental and physical and
superior in some not unfrequently proves herself the man of the
family the only man in the boat But in the East where the sex is
far more delicate where a girl is brought up in polygamy where
religious reasons separate her from her husband during pregnancy and
lactation for three successive years and where often enough like the
Mormon damsel she would hesitate to nigger it with a onewifeman the
case assumes a very different aspect and the load if burden it be
falls comparatively light Lastly the patriarchal household is mostly
confined to the grandee and the richard whilst Holy Law and public
opinion neither of which can openly be disregarded assign command of
the household to the equal or first wife and jealously guard the
rights and privileges of the others

Mirza Abu Talib the Persian Prince offers six reasons why the
liberty of the Asiatic women appears less than that of the Europeans
ending with

                    Ill fondly place on either eye
                    The man that can to this reply

He then lays down eight points in which the Moslem wife has greatly the
advantage over her Christian sisterhood and we may take his first as a
specimen Custom not contrary to law invests the Mohammedan mother
with despotic government of the homestead slaves servants and
children especially the latter she alone directs their early
education their choice of faith their marriage and their establishment
in life and in case of divorce she takes the daughters the sons going
to the sire She has also liberty to leave her home not only for one or
two nights but for a week or a fortnight without consulting her
husband and whilst she visits a strange household the master and all
males above fifteen are forbidden the Harem But the main point in
favour of the Moslem wife is her being a legal sharer inheritance is
secured to her by Koranic law she must be dowered by the bridegroom to
legalise marriage and all she gains is secured to her whereas in
England a Married Womans Property Act was completed only in 
after many centuries of the grossest abuses

Lastly Moslems and Easterns in general study and intelligently study
the art and mystery of satisfying the physical woman In my Foreword I
have noticed among barbarians the system of making men that is
of teaching lads first arrived at puberty the nice conduct of the
instrumentum paratum plantandis civibus a branch of the knowledgetree
which our modern education grossly neglects thereby entailing untold
miseries upon individuals families and generations The mock virtue
the most immodest modesty of England and of the United States in the
xixth century pronounces the subject foul and fulsome Society
sickens at all details and hence it is said abroad that the English
have the finest women in Europe and least know how to use them
Throughout the East such studies are aided by a long series of volumes
many of them written by learned physiologists by men of social standing
and by religious dignitaries high in office The Egyptians especially
delight in aphrodisiac literature treating as the Turks say de la
partie audessous de la taille and from fifteen hundred to two thousand
copies of a new work usually lithographed in cheap form readily sell
off The pudibund Lane makes allusion to and quotes A N i  one
of the most outspoken a to of  pages called the Halbat alKumayt
or RaceCourse of the Bay Horse a poetical and horsey term for
grapewine Attributed by DHerbelot to the Kazi Shams alDin Mohammed
it is wholly upon the subject of wassail and women till the last few
pages when his reverence exclaimsThis much O reader I have
recounted the better thou mayst know what to avoid and so forth
ending with condemning all he had praised Even the divine and
historian Jall alDn alSiyuti is credited with having written though
the authorship is much disputed a work entitled Kitb alzh fi ilm
alNikh  The Book of Exposition in the Science of Coition my copy a
lithograph of  pages undated but evidently Cairene begins with
exclaiming AlhamdolillahLaud to the Lord who adorned the virginal
bosom with breasts and who made the thighs of women anvils for the
spearhandles of men To the same amiable theologian are also ascribed
the Kitb Nawzir alAyk fi alNayk  Green Splendours of the Copse in
Copulation an abstract of the Kitb alWishh f fawid alNikh  Book
of the Zone on Coitionboon Of the abundance of pornographic literature
we may judge from a list of the following seven works given in the
second page of the Kitb Ruja alShaykh ila Sabh fi lKuwwat
alBh  Book of Agerejuvenescence in the power of Concupiscence
it is the work of Ahmad bin Sulayman surnamed Ibn Kaml Pasha

   Kitb alBh by AlNahli

   Kitb alArs wa alAris Book of the Bridal and the Brides by
  AlJhiz

   Kitb alKiyn Maidens Book by Ibn Hjib alNumn

   Kitb alzh f asrr alNikh Book of the Exposition on the
  Mysteries of married Fruition

   Kitb Jmi alLizzah The Compendium of Pleasure by Ibn

   Kitb alMunkahah wa alMuftahah f Asnf alJim wa ltih
  Book of Carnal Copulation and the Initiation into the modes of
  Coition and its Instrumentation by Aziz alDin alMash

To these I may add the Lizzat alNis Pleasures of Women a textbook
in Arabic Persian and Hindostani it is a translation and a very poor
attempt omitting much from and adding naught to the famous Sanskrit
work AnangaRanga Stage of the Bodiless One ie Cupido or Hindu Art
of Love Ars Amoris Indica I have copies of it in Sanskrit and
Marthi Guzrati and Hindostani the latter is an unpaged vo of p 
including eight pages of most grotesque illustrations showing the
various san the Figur Veneris or positions of copulation which seem
to be the triumphs of contortionists These pamphlets lithographed in
Bombay are broad cast over the land

It must not be supposed that such literature is purely and simply
aphrodisiacal The learned Sprenger a physician as well as an Arabist
says AlMasdi p  of a tractate by the celebrated Rhazes in the
Leyden Library The number of curious observations the correct and
practical ideas and the novelty of the notions of Eastern nations on
these subjects which are contained in this book render it one of the
most important productions of the medical literature of the Arabs I
can conscientiously recommend to the Anthropologist a study of the
Kutub alBh


                            CPORNOGRAPHY

Here it will be advisable to supplement what was said in my Foreword p
xv concerning the turpiloquium of The Nights Readers who have
perused the ten volumes will probably agree with me that the nave
indecencies of the text are rather gaudisserie than prurience and
when delivered with mirth and humour they are rather the excrements of
wit than designed for debauching the mind Crude and indelicate with
infantile plainness even gross and at times nasty in their terrible
frankness they cannot be accused of corrupting suggestiveness or subtle
insinuation of vicious sentiment Theirs is a coarseness of language
not of idea they are indecent not depraved and the pure and perfect
naturalness of their nudity seems almost to purify it showing that the
matter is rather of manners than of morals Such throughout the East is
the language of every man woman and child from prince to peasant from
matron to prostitute all are as the nave French traveller said of the
Japanese si grossiers quils ne savent nommer les choses que par leur
nom This primitive stage of language sufficed to draw from Lane and
Burckhardt strictures upon the most immodest freedom of conversation in
Egypt where as all the world over there are three several stages for
names of things and acts sensual First we have the mot cru the
popular term soon followed by the technical and scientific and
lastly the literary or figurative nomenclature which is often much
more immoral because more attractive suggestive and seductive than the
raw word And let me observe that the highest civilization is now
returning to the language of nature In La Glu of M J Richepin a
triumph of the realistic school we find such archaic expressions as
la pete putain foutue  la sixquatredix une factieuse ptarade
tu tes foutue de etc Eh vilain bougre and so forth To those
critics who complain of these raw vulgarisms and puerile indecencies in
The Nights I can reply only by quoting the words said to have been said
by Dr Johnson to the lady who complained of the naughty words in his
dictionaryYou must have been looking for them Madam

But I repeat p xvi there is another element in The Nights and that
is one of absolute obscenity utterly repugnant to English readers even
the least prudish It is chiefly connected with what our neighbours call
Le vice contre natureas if anything can be contrary to nature which
includes all things Upon this subject I must offer details as it
does not enter into my plan to ignore any theme which is interesting to
the Orientalist and the Anthropologist And they methinks do abundant
harm who for shame or disgust would suppress the very mention of such
matters in order to combat a great and growing evil deadly to the
birthratethe mainstay of national prosperitythe first requisite is
careful study As Albert Bollstoedt Bishop of Ratisbon rightly
saysQuia malum non evitatum nisi cognitum ideo necesse est cognoscere
immundiciem coitus et multa alia qu docentur in isto libro Equally
true are Professor Mantegazzas words Cacher les plaies du cur
humain au nom de la pudeur ce nest au contraire quhypocrisie ou peur
The late Mr Grote had reason to lament that when describing such
institutions as the farfamed   of Thebes the Sacred Band
annihilated at Chaeroneia he was compelled to a reticence which
permitted him to touch only the surface of the subject This was
inevitable under the present rule of Cant in a book intended for
the public but the same does not apply to my version of The Nights and
now I proceed to discuss the matter srieusement honntement
historiquement to show it in decent nudity not in suggestive figleaf
or feuille de vigne


                             DPEDERASTY

The execrabilis familia pathicorum first came before me by a chance of
earlier life In  when Sir Charles Napier had conquered and annexed
Sind despite a fraction mostly venal which sought favour with the now
defunct Court of Directors to the Honourable East India Company the
veteran began to consider his conquest with a curious eye It was
reported to him that Karchi a townlet of some two thousand souls and
distant not more than a mile from camp supported no less than three
lupanars or bordels in which not women but boys and eunuchs the former
demanding nearly a double price lay for hire Being then the only
British officer who could speak Sindi I was asked indirectly to make
enquiries and to report upon the subject and I undertook the task on
express condition that my report should not be forwarded to the Bombay
Government from whom supporters of the Conquerors policy could expect
scant favour mercy or justice Accompanied by a Munshi Mirza Mohammed
Hosayn of Shiraz and habited as a merchant Mirza Abdullah the
Bushiri passed many an evening in the townlet visited all the
porneia and obtained the fullest details which were duly despatched to
Government House But the Devils Brother presently quitted Sind
leaving in his office my unfortunate official this found its way with
sundry other reports to Bombay and produced the expected result A
friend in the Secretariat informed me that my summary dismissal from the
service had been formally proposed by one of Sir Charles Napiers
successors whose decease compels me parcere sepulto But this excess of
outraged modesty was not allowed

Subsequent enquiries in many and distant countries enabled me to arrive
at the following conclusions

   There exists what I shall call a Sotadic Zone bounded
  westwards by the northern shores of the Mediterranean N Lat 
  and by the southern N Lat  Thus the depth would be  to
   miles including meridional France the Iberian Peninsula Italy
  and Greece with the coastregions of Africa from Marocco to Egypt

   Running eastward the Sotadic Zone narrows embracing Asia Minor
  Mesopotamia and Chalda Afghanistan Sind the Punjab and Kashmir

   In IndoChina the belt begins to broaden enfolding China Japan
  and Turkistan

   It then embraces the South Sea Islands and the New World where
  at the time of its discovery Sotadic love was with some
  exceptions an established racial institution

   Within the Sotadic Zone the Vice is popular and endemic held at
  the worst to be a mere peccadillo whilst the races to the North and
  South of the limits here defined practise it only sporadically amid
  the opprobrium of their fellows who as a rule are physically
  incapable of performing the operation and look upon it with the

Before entering into topographical details concerning Pederasty which I
hold to be geographical and climatic not racial I must offer a few
considerations of its cause and origin We must not forget that the love
of boys has its noble sentimental side The Platonists and pupils of the
Academy followed by the Sufis or Moslem Gnostics held such affection
pure as ardent to be the beau idal which united in mans soul the
creature with the Creator Professing to regard youths as the most
cleanly and beautiful objects in this phenomenal world they declared
that by loving and extolling the chefduvre corporeal and
intellectual of the Demiurgus disinterestedly and without any
admixture of carnal sensuality they are paying the most fervent
adoration to the Causa causans They add that such affection passing as
it does the love of women is far less selfish than fondness for and
admiration of the other sex which however innocent always suggest
sexuality and Easterns add that the devotion of the moth to the
taper is purer and more fervent than the Bulbuls love for the Rose
Amongst the Greeks of the best ages the system of boyfavourites was
advocated on considerations of morals and politics The lover undertook
the education of the beloved through precept and example while the two
were conjoined by a tie stricter than the fraternal Hieronymus the
Peripatetic strongly advocated it because the vigorous disposition of
youths and the confidence engendered by their association often led to
the overthrow of tyrannies Socrates declared that a most valiant army
might be composed of boys and their lovers for that of all men they
would be most ashamed to desert one another And even Virgil despite
the foul flavour of Formosum pastor Corydon could write

                         Nisus amore pio pueri

The only physical cause for the practice which suggests itself to me and
that must be owned to be purely conjectural is that within the Sotadic
Zone there is a blending of the masculine and feminine temperaments a
crasis which elsewhere occurs only sporadically Hence the male
fminisme whereby the man becomes patiens as well as agens and the
woman a tribade a votary of mascula Sappho Queen of Frictrices or
Rubbers Prof Mantegazza claims to have discovered the cause of
this pathological love this perversion of the erotic sense one of the
marvellous list of amorous vagaries which deserve not prosecution but
the pitiful care of the physician and the study of the psychologist
According to him the nerves of the rectum and the genitalia in all
cases closely connected are abnormally so in the pathic who obtains by
intromission the venereal orgasm which is usually sought through the
sexual organs So amongst women there are tribads who can procure no
pleasure except by foreign objects introduced a posteriori Hence his
threefold distribution of sodomy  Peripheric or anatomical caused
by an unusual distribution of the nerves and their hypersthesia 
Luxurious when love a tergo is preferred on account of the narrowness
of the passage and  the Psychical But this is evidently
superficial the question is what causes this neuropathy this abnormal
distribution and condition of the nerves

As Prince Bismarck finds a moral difference between the male and female
races of history so I suspect a mixed physical temperament effected by
the manifold subtle influences massed together in the word climate
Something of the kind is necessary to explain the fact of this
pathological love extending over the greater portion of the habitable
world without any apparent connection of race or media from the
polished Greek to the cannibal Tupi of the Brazil Walt Whitman speaks
of the ashen grey faces of onanists the faded colours the puffy
features and the unwholesome complexion of the professed pederast with
his peculiar cachetic expression indescribable but once seen never
forgotten stamp the breed and Dr G Adolph is justified in declaring
Alle Gewohnneitspaederasten erkennen sich einander schnell oft met
einen Blick This has nothing in common with the fminisme which
betrays itself in the pathic by womanly gait regard and gesture it is
a something sui generis and the same may be said of the colour and look
of the young priest who honestly refrains from women and their
substitutes Dr Tardieu in his wellknown work tude Mdicolgale
sur les Attentats aux Murs and Dr Adolph note a peculiar
infundibuliform disposition of the After and a smoothness and want of
folds even before any abuse has taken place together with special forms
of the male organs in confirmed pederasts But these observations have
been rejected by Caspar Hoffman Brouardel and Dr J H Henry Coutagne
Notes sur la Sodomie Lyon  and it is a medical question whose
discussion would here be out of place

The origin of pederasty is lost in the night of ages but its historique
has been carefully traced by many writers especially Virey
Rosenbaum and M H E Meier The ancient Greeks who like the
modern Germans invented nothing but were great improvers of what other
races invented attributed the formal apostolate of Sotadism to Orpheus
whose stigmata were worn by the Thracian women

                         Omnemque refugerat Orpheus
     Fmineam venerem
     Ille etiam Thracum populis fuit auctor amorem
     In teneres transferre mares citraque juventam
     tatis breve ver et primos carpere flores

                                               Ovid Met x 

Euripides proposed Laus father of Oedipus as the inaugurator whereas
Timus declared that the fashion of making favourites of boys was
introduced into Greece from Crete for Malthusian reasons said Aristotle
Pol ii  attributing it to Minos Herodotus however knew far
better having discovered ii c  that the Orphic and Bacchic rites
were originally Egyptian But the Father of History was a traveller and
an annalist rather than an archologist and he tripped in the following
passage i c  As soon as they the Persians hear of any luxury
they instantly make it their own and hence among other matters they
have learned from the Hellenes a passion for boys unnatural lust
says modest Rawlinson Plutarch De Malig Herod xiii asserts
with much more probability that the Persians used eunuch boys according
to the Mos Grci long before they had seen the Grecian main

In the Holy Books of the Hellenes Homer and Hesiod dealing with the
heroic ages there is no trace of pederasty although in a long
subsequent generation Lucian suspected Achilles and Patroclus as he did
Orestes and Pylades Theseus and Pirithous Homers praises of beauty
are reserved for the feminines especially his favourite Helen But the
Dorians of Crete seem to have commended the abuse to Athens and Sparta
and subsequently imported it into Tarentum Agrigentum and other
colonies Ephorus in Strabo x    gives a curious account of the
violent abduction of beloved boys  by the lover
 of the obligations of the ravisher  to the favourite
 and of the marriageceremonies which lasted two months
See also Plato Laws i c  Servius Ad neid x  informs us De
Cretensibus accepimus quod in amore puerorum intemperantes fuerunt
quod postea in Laconas et in totam Grciam translatum est The Cretans
and afterwards their apt pupils the Chalcidians held it disreputable for
a beautiful boy to lack a lover Hence Zeus the national Doric god of
Crete loved Ganymede Apollo another Dorian deity loved Hyacinth
and Hercules a Doric hero who grew to be a sungod loved Hylas and a
host of others thus Crete sanctified the practice by the examples of
the gods and demigods But when legislation came the subject had
qualified itself for legal limitation and as such was undertaken by
Lycurgus and Solon according to Xenophon Lac ii  who draws a
broad distinction between the honest love of boys and dishonest
 lust They both approved of pure pederasta like that of
Harmodius and Aristogiton but forbade it with serviles because
degrading to a free man Hence the love of boys was spoken of like that
of women Plato Phdrus Repub VI c  and Xenophon Synop iv 
eg There was once a boy or rather a youth of exceeding beauty
and he had very many loversthis is the language of Hafiz and Saadi
schylus Sophocles and Euripides were allowed to introduce it upon the
stage for many men were as fond of having boys for their favourites as
women for their mistresses and this was a frequent fashion in many
wellregulated cities of Greece Poets like Alcus Anacreon Agathon
and Pindar affected it and Theognis sang of a beautiful boy in the
flower of his youth The statesmen Aristides and Themistocles
quarrelled over Stesileus of Teos and Pisistratus loved Charmus who
first built an altar to Puerile Eros while Charmus loved Hippias son of
Pisistratus Demosthenes the Orator took into keeping a youth called
Cnosion greatly to the indignation of his wife Xenophon loved Clinias
and Autolycus Aristotle Hermeas Theodectes and others
Empedocles Pausanias Epicurus Pytocles Aristippus Eutichydes and
Zeno with his Stoics had a philosophic disregard for women affecting
only pederasta A man in Athenus iv c  left in his will that
certain youths he had loved should fight like gladiators at his funeral
and Charicles in Lucian abuses Callicratidas for his love of sterile
pleasures Lastly there was the notable affair of Alcibiades and
Socrates the sanctus pderasta being violemment souponn when
under the mantlenon semper sine plag ab eo surrexit Athenus v c
 declares that Plato represents Socrates as absolutely intoxicated
with his passion for Alcibiades The ancients seem to have held the
connection impure or Juvenal would not have written

               Inter Socraticos notissima fossa cindos

followed by Firmicus vii  who speaks of Socratici pdicones It
is the modern fashion to doubt the pederasty of the master of Hellenic
Sophrosyne the Christian before Christianity but such a worldwide
term as Socratic love can hardly be explained by the lucusanonlucendo
theory We are overapt to apply our nineteenth century prejudices and
prepossessions to the morality of the ancient Greeks who would have
specimend such squeamishness in Attic salt

The Spartans according to Agnon the Academic confirmed by Plato
Plutarch and Cicero treated boys and girls in the same way before
marriage hence Juvenal xi  uses Lacedmonius for a pathic and
other writers apply it to a tribade After the Peloponnesian War which
ended in BC  the use became merged in the abuse Yet some purity
must have survived even amongst the Botians who produced the famous
Narcissus described by Ovid Met iii

            Nulli illum juvenes null tetigere puell

for Epaminondas whose name is mentioned with three beloveds

Philips reflections on the fatal field of Chaeroneia form their fittest
epitaph At last the Athenians according to schines officially
punished Sodomy with death but the threat did not abolish bordels of
boys like those of Karchi the Porneia and Pornoboskeia where slaves
and pueri venales stood as the term was near the Pnyx the city

It is calculated that the French of the sixteenth century had four
hundred names for the parts genital and three hundred for their use in
coition The Greek vocabulary is not less copious and some of its
pederastic terms of which Meier gives nearly a hundred and its
nomenclature of pathologic love are curious and picturesque enough to
merit quotation

public baths Debauchees had signals like freemasons whereby they
recognised one another The Greek Skematzein was made by closing the
hand to represent the scrotum and raising the middle finger as if to
feel whether a hen had eggs tter si les poulettes ont luf hence the
Athenians called it Catapygon or sodomite and the Romans digitus

That marvellous Satyricon which unites the wit of Molire with the

Erotic Latin glossaries give some ninety words connected with
Pederasty and some which speak with Roman simplicity are peculiarly
expressive Aversa Venus alludes to women being treated as boys hence
Martial translated by Piron addresses Mistress Martial x

The capillatus or comatus is also called calamistratus the darling

From Rome the practice extended far and wide to her colonies especially
the Provincia now called Provence Athenus xii  charges the people
of Massilia with acting like women out of luxury and he cites the
saying May you sail to Massilia as if it were another Corinth Indeed
the whole Keltic race is charged with Le Vice by Aristotle Pol ii
 Strabo iv  and Diodorus Siculus v  Roman civilisation
carried pederasty also to Northern Africa where it took firm root
while the negro and negroid races to the South ignore the erotic
perversion except where imported by foreigners into such kingdoms as
Bornu and Haussa In old Mauritania now Marocco the Moors proper
are notable sodomites Moslems even of saintly houses are permitted
openly to keep catamites nor do their disciples think worse of their
sanctity for such license in one case the English wife failed to banish
from the home that horrid boy

Yet pederasty is forbidden by the Koran In chapter iv  we read And
if two men among you commit the crime then punish them both the
penalty being some hurt or damage by public reproach insult or
scourging There are four distinct references to Lot and the Sodomites
in chapters vii  xi  xxvi  and xxix  In the
first the prophet commissioned to the people says Proceed ye to a
fulsome act wherein no creature hath foregone ye Verily ye come to men
in lieu of women lustfully We have then an account of the rain which
made an end of the wicked and this judgment on the Cities of the Plain
is repeated with more detail in the second reference Here the angels
generally supposed to be three Gabriel Michael and Raphael appeared
to Lot as beautiful youths a sore temptation to the sinners and the
godly mans arm was straitened concerning his visitors because he felt
unable to protect them from the erotic vagaries of his fellow townsmen
He therefore shut his doors and from behind them argued the matter
presently the riotous assembly attempted to climb the wall when Gabriel
seeing the distress of his host smote them on the face with one of his
wings and blinded them so that all moved off crying for aid and saying
that Lot had magicians in his house Hereupon the cities which if
they ever existed must have been Fellah villages were uplifted
Gabriel thrust his wing under them and raised them so high that the
inhabitants of the lower heaven the lunar sphere could hear the dogs
barking and the cocks crowing Then came the rain of stones these were
clay pellets baked in hellfire streaked white and red or having some
mark to distinguish them from the ordinary and each bearing the name of
its destination like the missiles which destroyed the host of Abrahat
alAshram Lastly the Cities were turned upside down and cast
upon earth These circumstantial unfacts are repeated at full length in
the other two chapters but rather as an instance of Allahs power than
as a warning against pederasty which Mohammed seems to have regarded
with philosophic indifference The general opinion of his followers is
that it should be punished like fornication unless the offenders made a
public act of penitence But here as in adultery the law is somewhat
too clement and will not convict unless four credible witnesses swear to
have seen rem in re I have noticed vol i  the vicious opinion
that the Ghilmn or Wuldn the beautiful boys of Paradise the
counterparts of the Houris will be lawful catamites to the True
Believers in a future state of happiness the idea is nowhere
countenanced in AlIslam and although I have often heard debauchees
refer to it the learned look upon the assertion as scandalous

As in Marocco so the Vice prevails throughout the old regencies of
Algiers Tunis and Tripoli and all the cities of the South Mediterranean
seaboard whilst it is unknown to the Nubians the Berbers and the
wilder tribes dwelling inland Proceeding Eastward we reach Egypt that
classical region of all abominations which marvellous to relate
flourished in closest contact with men leading the purest of lives
models of moderation and morality of religion and virtue Amongst the
ancient Copts Le Vice was part and portion of the Ritual and was
represented by two male partridges alternately copulating Interp in
Priapi Carm xvii The evil would have gained strength by the invasion
of Cambyses BC  whose armies after the victory over
Psammenitus settled in the NileValley and held it despite sundry
revolts for some hundred and ninety years During these six generations
the Iranians left their mark upon Lower Egypt and especially as the
late Rogers Bey proved upon the Fayyum the most ancient Delta of the
Nile Nor would the evil be diminished by the Hellenes who under
Alexander the Great liberator and saviour of Egypt BC 
extinguished the native dynasties the love of the Macedonian for Bagoas
the Eunuch being a matter of history From that time and under the rule
of the Ptolemies the morality gradually decayed the Canopic orgies
extended into private life and the debauchery of the men was equalled
only by the depravity of the women Neither Christianity nor AlIslam
could effect a change for the better and social morality seems to have
been at its worst during the past century when Sonnini travelled AD
 The French officer who is thoroughly trustworthy draws the
darkest picture of the widelyspread criminality especially of the

chuckle over the tale of Said Pasha and M de Ruyssenaer the

who was solemnly advised to make the experiment active and passive
before offering his opinion upon the subject In the present age
extensive intercourse with Europeans has produced not a reformation but
a certain reticence amongst the upper classes they are as vicious as
ever but they do not care for displaying their vices to the eyes of
mocking strangers

Syria and Palestine another ancient focus of abominations borrowed
from Egypt and exaggerated the worship of Androgynic and hermaphroditic
deities Plutarch De Iside notes that the old Nilotes held the moon to
be of malefemale sex the men sacrificing to Luna and the women to
Lunus Isis also was a hermaphrodite the idea being that ther or
Air the lower heavens was the menstruum of generative nature and
Damascius explained the tenet by the allfruitful and prolific powers of
the atmosphere Hence the fragment attributed to Orpheus the song of
Jupiter Air

                    All things from Jove descend
              Jove was a male Jove was a deathless bride
              For men call Air of twofold sex the Jove

Julius Firmicus relates that The Assyrians and part of the Africans
along the Mediterranean seaboard hold Air to be the chief element
and adore its fanciful figure imaginata figura consecrated under the
name of Juno or the Virgin Venus    Their companies of priests
cannot duly serve her unless they effeminate their faces smooth their
skins and disgrace their masculine sex by feminine ornaments You may
see men in their very temples amid general groans enduring miserable
dalliance and becoming passives like women viros muliebria pati and
they expose with boasting and ostentation the pollution of the impure
and immodest body Here we find the religious significance of eunuchry
It was practised as a religious rite by the Tympanotribas or
Gallus the castrated votary of Rhea or Bona Mater in Phrygia
called Cybele selfmutilated but not in memory of Atys and by a host
of other creeds even Christianity as sundry texts show could not
altogether cast out the old possession Here too we have an explanation
of Sotadic love in its second stage when it became like cannibalism a
matter of superstition Assuming a natureimplanted tendency we see
that like human sacrifice it was held to be the most acceptable offering
to the Godgoddess in the Orgia or sacred ceremonies a something set
apart for peculiar worship Hence in Rome as in Egypt the temples of
Isis Inachidos limina Isiac sacraria Lun were centres of sodomy and
the religious practice was adopted by the grand priestly castes from
Mesopotamia to Mexico and Peru

We find the earliest written notices of the Vice in the mythical
destruction of the Pentapolis Gen xix Sodom Gomorrah  mirah
the cultivated country Adama Zebom and Zoar or Bela The legend has
been amply embroidered by the Rabbis who make the Sodomites do
everything  lenvers eg if a man were wounded he was fined for
bloodshed and was compelled to fee the offender and if one cut off the
ear of a neighbours ass he was condemned to keep the animal till the
ear grew again The Jewish doctors declare the people to have been a
race of sharpers with rogues for magistrates and thus they justify the
judgment which they read literally But the traveller cannot accept it
I have carefully examined the lands at the North and at the South of
that most beautiful lake the socalled Dead Sea whose tranquil
loveliness backed by the grand plateau of Moab is an object of
admiration to all save patients suffering from the strange disease Holy
Land on the Brain But I found no traces of craters in the
neighbourhood no signs of vulcanism no remains of meteoric stones
the asphalt which named the water is a mineralised vegetable washed out
of the limestones and the sulphur and salt are brought down by the
Jordan into a lake without issue I must therefore look upon the history
as a myth which may have served a double purpose The first would be to
deter the Jew from the Malthusian practices of his pagan predecessors
upon whom obloquy was thus cast so far resembling the scandalous and
absurd legend which explained the names of the children of Lot by Phein
and Thamma as Moab Muab the water or semen of the father and
Ammon as mothers son that is bastard The fable would also account
for the abnormal fissure containing the lower Jordan and the Dead Sea
which the late Sir R I Murchison used wrongheadedly to call a
Volcano of Depression this geological feature that cuts off the
riverbasin from its natural outlet the Gulf of Eloth Akabah must
date from myriads of years before there were Cities of the Plains But
the main object of the ancient lawgiver Osarsiph Moses or the Moseid
was doubtless to discountenance a perversion prejudicial to the increase
of population And he speaks with no uncertain voice Whoso lieth with a
beast shall surely be put to death Exod xxii  If a man lie with
mankind as he lieth with a woman both of them have committed an
abomination they shall surely be put to death their blood shall be
upon them Levit xx  where vv  threaten with death man and
woman who lie with beasts Again There shall be no whore of the
daughters of Israel nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel Deut xxii


The old commentators on the Sodommyth are most unsatisfactory eg
Parkhurst sv Kadesh From hence we may observe the peculiar
propriety of this punishment of Sodom and of the neighbouring cities By
their sodomitical impurities they meant to acknowledge the Heavens as
the cause of fruitfulness independently upon and in opposition to
Jehovah therefore Jehovah by raining upon them not genial showers
but brimstone from heaven not only destroyed the inhabitants but also
changed all that country which was before as the garden of God into
brimstone and salt that is not sown nor beareth neither any grass
groweth therein It must be owned that to this Pentapolis was dealt
very hard measure for religiously and diligently practising a popular
rite which a host of cities even in the present day as Naples and
Shiraz to mention no others affect for simple luxury and affect with
impunity The myth may probably reduce itself to very small proportions
a few Fellah villages destroyed by a storm like that which drove
Brennus from Delphi

The Hebrews entering Syria found it religionised by Assyria and
Babylonia whence Accadian Ishtar had passed west and had become
Ashtoreth Ashtaroth or Ashirah the Anaitis of Armenia the
Phnician Astarte and the Greek Aphrodite the great Moongoddess
who is queen of Heaven and Love In another phase she was Venus Mylitta
 the Procreatrix in Chaldaic Mauludat and in Arabic Moawallidah she
who bringeth forth She was worshipped by men habited as women and vice
vers for which reason in the Torah Deut xx  the sexes are
forbidden to change dress The male prostitutes were called Kadesh the
holy the women being Kadeshah and doubtless gave themselves up to
great excesses Eusebius De bit Const iii c  describes a school
of impurity at Aphac where women and men who were not men practised
all manner of abominations in honour of the Demon Venus Here the
Phrygian symbolism of Kybele and Attis Atys had become the Syrian
Baal Tammuz and Astarte and the Grecian Diona and Adonis the
anthropomorphic forms of the two greater lights The site Apheca now
Wady alAfik on the route from Bayrut to the Cedars is a glen of wild
and wondrous beauty fitting framework for the loves of goddess and
demigod and the ruins of the temple destroyed by Constantine contrast
with Natures work the glorious fountain splendidior vitro which
feeds the River Ibrahim and still at times Adonis runs purple to the
sea

The Phnicians spread this androgynic worship over Greece We find the
consecrated servants and votaries of Corinthian Aphrodite called
Hierodouli Strabo viii  who aided the ten thousand courtesans in
gracing the Venustemple from this excessive luxury arose the proverb
popularised by Horace One of the headquarters of the cult was Cyprus
where as Servius relates Ad n ii  stood the simulacre of a
bearded Aphrodite with feminine body and costume sceptered and mitred
like a man The sexes when worshipping it exchanged habits and here the
virginity was offered in sacrifice Herodotus i c  describes this
defloration at Babylon but sees only the shameful part of the custom
which was a mere consecration of a tribal rite Everywhere girls before
marriage belong either to the father or to the clan and thus the maiden
paid the debt due to the public before becoming private property as a
wife The same usage prevailed in ancient Armenia and in parts of
Ethiopia and Herodotus tells us that a practice very much like the
Babylonian is found also in certain parts of the Island of Cyprus it
is noticed by Justin xviii c  and probably it explains the Succoth
Benoth or Damsels booths which the Babylonians transplanted to the
cities of Samaria The Jews seem very successfully to have copied
the abominations of their pagan neighbours even in the matter of the
dog In the reign of wicked Rehoboam BC  There were also
sodomites in the land and they did according to all the abominations of
the nations which the Lord cast out before the children of Israel 
Kings xiv  The scandal was abated by zealous King Asa BC 
whose grandmother was highpriestess of Priapus princeps in sacris
Priapi he took away the sodomites out of the land  Kings xv 
Yet the prophets were loud in their complaints especially the socalled
Isaiah BC  except the Lord of Hosts had left to us a very small
remnant we should have been as Sodom i  and strong measures were
required from good King Josiah BC  who amongst other things
brake down the houses of the sodomites that were by the house of the
Lord where the women wove hangings for the grove  Kings xxiii

Syria has not forgotten her old praxis At Damascus I found some
noteworthy cases amongst the religious of the great Amawi Mosque As for
the Druses we have Burckhardts authority Travels in Syria etc p
 unnatural propensities are very common amongst them

The Sotadic Zone covers the whole of Asia Minor and Mesopotamia now
occupied by the unspeakable Turk a race of born pederasts and in the
former region we first notice a peculiarity of the feminine figure the
mamm inclinat jacentes et pannos which prevails over all this part
of the belt Whilst the women to the North and South have with local
exceptions the mamm stantes of the European virgin those of
Turkey Persia Afghanistan and Kashmir lose all the fine curves of the
bosom sometimes even before the first child and after it the
hemispheres take the form of bags This cannot result from climate only
the women of Marathland inhabiting a damper and hotter region than
Kashmir are noted for fine firm breasts even after parturition Le Vice
of course prevails more in the cities and towns of Asiatic Turkey than
in the villages yet even these are infected while the nomad Turcomans
contrast badly in this point with the Gypsies those Badawin of India
The Kurd population is of Iranian origin which means that the evil is
deeply rooted I have noted in The Nights that the great and glorious
Saladin was a habitual pederast The Armenians as their national
character is will prostitute themselves for gain but prefer women to
boys Georgia supplied Turkey with catamites whilst Circassia sent
concubines In Mesopotamia the barbarous invader has almost obliterated
the ancient civilisation which is antedated only by the Nilotic the
mysteries of old Babylon nowhere survive save in certain obscure tribes
like the Mandans the Devilworshippers and the Alilhi Entering
Persia we find the reverse of Armenia and despite Herodotus I believe
that Iran borrowed her pathologic love from the peoples of the
TigrisEuphrates Valley and not from the then insignificant Greeks But
whatever may be its origin the corruption is now bred in the bone It
begins in boyhood and many Persians account for it by paternal severity
Youths arrived at puberty find none of the facilities with which Europe
supplies fornication Onanism is to a certain extent discouraged by
circumcision and meddling with the fathers slavegirls and concubines
would be risking cruel punishment if not death Hence they use each
other by turns a puerile practice known as AlishTakish the Lat
facere vicibus or mutuum facere Temperament media and atavism
recommend the custom to the general and after marrying and begetting
heirs Paterfamilias returns to the Ganymede Hence all the odes of
Hafiz are addressed to youths as proved by such Arabic exclamations as
Afka llah  Allah assain thee masculine the object is often
fanciful but it would be held coarse and immodest to address an
imaginary girl An illustration of the penchant is told at Shiraz
concerning a certain Mujtahid the head of the Shiah creed
corresponding with a princearchbishop in Europe A friend once said to
him There is a question I would fain address to your Eminence but I
lack the daring to do so Ask and fear not replied the Divine It
is this O Mujtahid Figure thee in a garden of roses and hyacinths with
the evening breeze waving the cypressheads a fair youth of twenty
sitting by thy side and the assurance of perfect privacy What prithee
would be the result The holy man bowed the chin of doubt upon the
collar of meditation and too honest to lie presently whispered
Allah defend me from such temptation of Satan Yet even in Persia men
have not been wanting who have done their utmost to uproot the Vice in
the same Shiraz they speak of a father who finding his son in flagrant
delict put him to death like Brutus or Lynch of Galway Such isolated
cases however can effect nothing Chardin tells us that houses of male
prostitution were common in Persia whilst those of women were unknown
the same is the case in the present day and the boys are prepared with
extreme care by diet baths depilation unguents and a host of artists
in cosmetics Le Vice is looked upon at most as a peccadillo and
its mention crops up in every jestbook When the Isfahan man mocked
Shaykh Saadi by comparing the bald pates of Shirazian elders to the
bottom of a lot a brass cup with a widenecked opening used in the
Hammam the witty poet turned its aperture upwards and thereto likened
the wellabused podex of an Isfahani youth Another favourite piece of
Shirazian chaff is to declare that when an Isfahan father would set up
his son in business he provides him with a pound of rice meaning that
he can sell the result as compost for the kitchengarden and with the
price buy another meal hence the saying Khakhipi kh  the soil at
the lettuceroot The Isfahanis retort with the name of a station or
haltingplace between the two cities where under pretence of making
travellers stow away their ridinggear many a Shirzi had been raped
hence Zn o takalt t bibar  carry within saddle and saddlecloth
A favourite Persian punishment for strangers caught in the Harem or
Gynceum is to strip and throw them and expose them to the embraces of
the grooms and negroslaves I once asked a Shirazi how penetration was
possible if the patient resisted with all the force of the sphincter
muscle he smiled and said Ah we Persians know a trick to get over
that we apply a sharpened tentpeg to the crupperbone os coccygis
and knock till he opens A wellknown missionary to the East during the
last generation was subjected to this gross insult by one of the Persian
Princegovernors whom he had infuriated by his conversionmania in his
memoirs he alludes to it by mentioning his dishonoured person but
English readers cannot comprehend the full significance of the
confession About the same time Shaykh Nasr Governor of Bushire a man
famed for facetious blackguardism used to invite European youngsters
serving in the Bombay Marine and ply them with liquor till they were
insensible Next morning the middies mostly complained that the
champagne had caused a curious irritation and soreness in la
parteposte The same Eastern Scrogin would ask his guests if they had
ever seen a mancannon damitop and on their replying in the
negative a greybeard slave was dragged in blaspheming and struggling
with all his strength He was presently placed on all fours and firmly
held by the extremities his bagtrousers were let down and a dozen
peppercorns were inserted ano suo the target was a sheet of paper held
at a reasonable distance the match was applied by a pinch of cayenne in
the nostrils the sneeze started the grapeshot and the number of hits on
the butt decided the bets We can hardly wonder at the loose conduct of
Persian women perpetually mortified by marital pederasty During the
unhappy campaign of  in which with the exception of a few
brilliant skirmishes we gained no glory Sir James Outram and the
Bombay army showing how badly they could work there was a formal
outburst of the Harems and even women of princely birth could not be
kept out of the officers quarters

The cities of Afghanistan and Sind are thoroughly saturated with Persian
vice and the people sing

 Kadrikus Aughn dnad kadrikunr Kbuli
 The worth of coynte the Afghan knows Cabul prefers the other
    chose

The Afghans are commercial travellers on a large scale and each caravan
is accompanied by a number of boys and lads almost in womans attire
with kohld eyes and rouged cheeks long tresses and hennad fingers and
toes riding luxuriously in Kajwas or camelpanniers they are called
Kchi safari or travelling wives and the husbands trudge patiently by
their sides In Afghanistan also a frantic debauchery broke out amongst
the women when they found incubi who were not pederasts and the scandal
was not the most insignificant cause of the general rising at Cabul
Nov  and the slaughter of Macnaghten Burnes and other British
officers

Resuming our way Eastward we find the Sikhs and the Moslems of the
Panjab much addicted to Le Vice although the Himalayan tribes to the
north and those lying south the Rjputs and Maraths ignore it The
same may be said of the Kashmirians who add another Kappa to the tria
Kakista Kappadocians Kretans and Kilicians the proverb says

       Agar kahtimardum uftad az n sih jins kam gr

M Louis Daville describes the infamies of Lahore and Lakhnau where he
found men dressed as women with flowing locks under crowns of flowers
imitating the feminine walk and gestures voice and fashion of speech

Jacquemonts Journal de Voyage describes the pederasty of Ranjt Singh
the Lion of the Panjb and his pathic Gulb Singh whom the English
inflicted upon Cashmir as ruler by way of paying for his treason Yet
the Hindus I repeat hold pederasty in abhorrence and are as much
scandalised by being called Gndmr anusbeater or Gnd anuser as
Englishmen would be During the years  my regiment almost all
Hindu Sepoys of the Bombay Presidency was stationed at a purgatory
called Bandar Ghrr a sandy flat with a scatter of
verdigrisgreen milkbush some forty miles north of Karchi the
headquarters The dirty heap of mudandmat hovels which represented
the adjacent native village could not supply a single woman yet only
one case of pederasty came to light and that after a tragical fashion
some years afterwards A young Brahman had connection with a soldier
comrade of low caste and this had continued till in an unhappy hour
the Pariah patient ventured to become the agent The latter in Arab
AlFil  the doer is not an object of contempt like AlMafl  the
done and the highcaste sepoy stung by remorse and revenge loaded
his musket and deliberately shot his paramour He was hanged by court
martial at Hyderabad and when his last wishes were asked he begged in
vain to be suspended by the feet the idea being that his soul polluted
by exiting below the waist would be doomed to endless transmigrations
through the lowest forms of life

Beyond India I have stated the Sotadic Zone begins to broaden out
embracing all China Turkistan and Japan The Chinese as far as we know
them in the great cities are omnivorous and omnifutuentes they are the
chosen people of debauchery and their systematic bestiality with ducks
goats and other animals is equalled only by their pederasty Kmpfer
and Orlof Tore Voyage en Chine notice the public houses for boys and
youths in China and Japan Mirabeau LAnandryne describes the
tribadism of their women in hammocks When Pekin was plundered the
Harems contained a number of balls a little larger than the old
musketbullet made of thin silver with a loose pellet of brass inside
somewhat like a grelot these articles were placed by the women
between the labia and an upanddown movement on the bed gave a pleasant
titillation when nothing better was to be procured They have every
artifice of luxury aphrodisiacs erotic perfumes and singular
applications Such are the pills which dissolved in water and applied
to the glans penis cause it to throb and swell so according to Amerigo
Vespucci American women could artificially increase the size of their
husbands parts The Chinese bracelet of caoutchouc studded with
points now takes the place of the Herisson or Annulus hirsutus
which was bound between the glans and prepuce Of the penis succedaneus
that imitation of the Arbor vit or Soter Kosmou which the Latins
called phallus and fascinum the French godemich and the Italians
passatempo and diletto whence our dildo every kind abounds varying
from a stuffed French letter to a cone of ribbed horn which looks like
an instrument of torture For the use of men they have the
merkin a heartshaped article of thin skin stuffed with cotton
and slit with an artificial vagina two tapes at the top and one below
lash it to the back of a chair The erotic literature of the Chinese and
Japanese is highly developed and their illustrations are often facetious
as well as obscene All are familiar with that of the strong man who by
a blow with his enormous phallus shivers a copper pot and the ludicrous
contrast of the hugemembered wights who land in the Isle of Women and
presently escape from it wrinkled and shrivelled true Domine
Dolittles Of Turkistan we know little but what we know confirms my
statement Mr Schuyler in his Turkistan i  offers an illustration

 They are addicted to Sodomie or Buggerie The learned casuist
Dr Thomas Sanchez the Spaniard had says Mirabeau in Kadhsch to
decide a difficult question concerning the sinfulness of a peculiar
erotic perversion The Jesuits brought home from Manilla a tailed man
whose moveable prolongation of the os coccygis measured from  to 
inches he had placed himself between two women enjoying one naturally
while the other used his tail as a penis succedaneus The verdict was
incomplete sodomy and simple fornication For the islands north of
Japan the Sodomitical Sea and the nayle of tynne thrust through
the prepuce to prevent sodomy see Lib ii chap  of Master Thomas
Caudishs Circumnavigation and vol vi of Pinkertons Geography
translated by Walckenaer

Passing over to America we find that the Sotadic Zone contains the whole
hemisphere from Behrings Straits to Magellans This prevalence of
mollities astonishes the anthropologist who is apt to consider
pederasty the growth of luxury and the especial product of great and
civilised cities unnecessary and therefore unknown to simple savagery
where the births of both sexes are about equal and female infanticide is
not practised In many parts of the New World this perversion was
accompanied by another depravity of tasteconfirmed cannibalism
The forests and campos abounded in game from the deer to the
pheasantlike penelope and the seas and rivers produced an unfailing
supply of excellent fish and shellfish yet the Brazilian Tupis
preferred the meat of man to every other food

A glance at Mr Bancroft proves the abnormal development of sodomy
amongst the savages and barbarians of the New World Even his
halffrozen Hyperboreans possess all the passions which are supposed to
develop most freely under a milder temperature i  The
voluptuousness and polygamy of the North American Indians under a
temperature of almost perpetual winter is far greater than that of the
most sensual tropical nations Martins Brit Colonies iii  I can
quote only a few of the most remarkable instances Of the Koniagas of
Kadiak Island and the Thinkleets we read i  The most repugnant
of all their practices is that of male concubinage A Kadiak mother will
select her handsomest and most promising boy and dress and rear him as
a girl teaching him only domestic duties keeping him at womens work
associating him with women and girls in order to render his effeminacy
complete Arriving at the age of ten or fifteen years he is married to
some wealthy man who regards such a companion as a great acquisition
These male concubines are called Achnutschik or Schopans the
authorities quoted being Holmberg Langsdorff Billing Choris
Lisiansky and Marchand The same is the case in Nutka Sound and the
Aleutian Islands where male concubinage obtains throughout but not to
the same extent as amongst the Koniagas The objects of unnatural
affection have their beards carefully plucked out as soon as the
facehair begins to grow and their chins are tattooed like those of the
women In California the first missionaries found the same practice the
youths being called Joya Bancroft i  and authorities Palon
Crespi Boscana Mofras Torquemada Duflot and Fages The Comanches
unite incest with sodomy i  In New Mexico according to Arlegui
Ribas and other authors male concubinage prevails to a great extent
these loathsome semblances of humanity whom to call beastly were a
slander upon beasts dress themselves in the clothes and perform the
functions of women the use of weapons being denied them i 
Pederasty was systematically practised by the peoples of Cueba Careta
and other parts of Central America The Caciques and some of the headmen
kept harems of youths who as soon as destined for the unclean office
were dressed as women They went by the name of Camayoas and were hated
and detested by the goodwives i  Of the Nahua nations Father
Pierre de Gand alias de Musa writes Un certain nombre de prtres

the Mayas of Yucatan Las Casas declares that the great prevalence of
unnatural lust made parents anxious to see their progeny wedded as
soon as possible Kingsboroughs Mex Ant viii  In Vera Paz a
god called by some Chin and by others Cavial and Maran taught it by
committing the act with another god Some fathers gave their sons a boy
to use as a woman and if any other approached this pathic he was
treated as an adulterer In Yucatan images were found by Bernal Diaz
proving the sodomitical propensities of the people Bancroft v  De
Pauw Recherches Philosophiques sur les Amricains London  has
much to say about the subject in Mexico generally in the northern
provinces men married youths who dressed like women were forbidden to
carry arms According to Gomara there were at Tamalipas houses of male
prostitution and from Diaz and others we gather that the pecado
nefando was the rule Both in Mexico and in Peru it might have caused
if it did not justify the cruelties of the Conquistadores Pederasty
was also general throughout Nicaragua and the early explorers found it
amongst the indigenes of Panama

We have authentic details concerning Le Vice in Peru and its adjacent
lands beginning with Cieza de Leon who must be read in the original or
in the translated extracts of Purchas vol v  etc not in the
cruelly castrated form preferred by the Council of the Hakluyt Society
Speaking of the New Granada Indians he tells us that at Old Port Porto
Viejo and Puna the Deuill so farre prevayled in their beastly
Deuotions that there were Boyes consecrated to serue in the Temple and
at the times of their Sacrifices and Solemne Feasts the Lords and
principal men abused them to that detestable filthinesse ie
performed their peculiar worship Generally in the hillcountries the
Devil under the show of holiness had introduced the practice for
every temple or chief house of adoration kept one or two men or more
which were attired like women even from the time of their childhood
and spake like them imitating them in everything with these under
pretext of holiness and religion their principal men on principal days
had commerce Speaking of the arrival of the Giants at Point Santa
Elena Cieza says chap lii they were detested by the natives
because in using their women they killed them and their men also in
another way All the natives declare that God brought upon them a
punishment proportioned to the enormity of their offence When they were
engaged together in their accursed intercourse a fearful and terrible
fire came down from Heaven with a great noise out of the midst of which
there issued a shining Angel with a glittering sword wherewith at one
blow they were all killed and the fire consumed them There
remained a few bones and skulls which God allowed to bide unconsumed by
the fire as a memorial of this punishment In the Hakluyt Societys
bowdlerisation we read of the Tumbez Islanders being very vicious many
of them committing the abominable offence p  also If by the
advice of the Devil any Indian commit the abominable crime it is
thought little of and they call him a woman In chapters lii and
lviii we find exceptions The Indians of Huancabamba although so near
the peoples of Puerto Viejo and Guayaquil do not commit the abominable
sin and the Serranos or island mountaineers as sorcerers and
magicians inferior to the coast peoples were not so much addicted to
sodomy

The Royal Commentaries of the Yncas show that the evil was of a
comparatively modern growth In the early period of Peruvian history the
people considered the crime unspeakable if a Cuzco Indian not of
Yncarial blood angrily addressed the term pederast to another he was
held infamous for many days One of the generals having reported to the
Ynca Ccapacc Yupanqui that there were some sodomites not in all the
valleys but one here and one there nor was it a habit of all the
inhabitants but only of certain persons who practised it privately the
ruler ordered that the criminals should be publicly burnt alive and
their houses crops and trees destroyed moreover to show his
abomination he commanded that the whole village should so be treated if
one man fell into this habit Lib iii cap  Elsewhere we learn
There were sodomites in some provinces though not openly nor
universally but some particular men and in secret In some parts they
had them in their temples because the Devil persuaded them that the
Gods took great delight in such people and thus the Devil acted as a
traitor to remove the veil of shame that the Gentiles felt for this
crime and to accustom them to commit it in public and in common

During the times of the Conquistadores male concubinage had become the
rule throughout Peru At Cuzco we are told by Nuno de Guzman in 
The last which was taken and which fought most couragiously was a man
in the habite of a woman which confessed that from a childe he had
gotten his liuing by that filthinesse for which I caused him to be
burned V F Lopez draws a frightful picture of pathologic love
in Peru Under the reigns which followed that of IntiKapak Ccapacc
Amauri the country was attacked by invaders of a giant race coming from
the sea they practised pederasty after a fashion so shameless that the
conquered tribes were compelled to fly p  Under the preYncarial
Amauta or priestly dynasty Peru had lapsed into savagery and the kings
of Cuzco preserved only the name Toutes ces hontes et toutes ces
misres provenaient de deux vices infmes la bestialit et la sodomie

I have remarked that the Tupi races of the Brazil were infamous for
cannibalism and sodomy nor could the latter be only racial as proved by
the fact that colonists of pure Lusitanian blood followed in the path of
the savages Sr Antonio Augusto da Costa Aguiar is outspoken upon
this point A crime which in England leads to the gallows and which is
the very measure of abject depravity passes with impunity amongst us by
the participating in it of almost all or of many de quasi todos ou de
muitos Ah if the wrath of Heaven were to fall by way of punishing
such crimes delictos more than one city of this Empire more than a
dozen would pass into the category of the Sodoms and Gomorrahs p
 Till late years pederasty in the Brazil was looked upon as a
peccadillo the European immigrants following the practice of the wild
men who were naked but not as Columbus said clothed in innocence
One of Her Majestys Consuls used to tell a tale of the hilarity
provoked in a fashionable assembly by the open declaration of a young
gentleman that his mulattopatient had suddenly turned upon him
insisting upon becoming agent Now however under the influences of
improved education and respect for the public opinion of Europe
pathologic love amongst the LusoBrazilians has been reduced to the
normal limits

Outside the Sotadic Zone I have said Le Vice is sporadic not endemic
yet the physical and moral effect of great cities where puberty they
say is induced earlier than in country sites has been the same in most
lands causing modesty to decay and pederasty to flourish The Badawi
Arab is wholly pure of Le Vice yet San the capital of AlYaman and
other centres of population have long been and still are thoroughly
infected History tells us of Z Shantir tyrant of Arabia Felix in
AD  who used to entice young men into his palace and cause them
after use to be cast out of the windows this unkindly ruler was at last
poinarded by the youth Zerash known from his long ringlets as Z
Nows The negro race is mostly untainted by sodomy and tribadism Yet
Joan dos Sanctos found in Cacongo of West Africa certain Chibudi
which are men attyred like women and behaue themselves womanly ashamed
to be called men are also married to men and esteem that vnnaturale
damnation an honor Madagascar also delighted in dancing and singing
boys dressed as girls In the Empire of Dahomey I noted a corps of
prostitutes kept for the use of the Amazonsoldieresses

North of the Sotadic Zone we find local but notable instances Master
Christopher Burrough describes on the western side of the Volga a
very fine stone castle called by the name Oueak and adioyning to the
same a Towne called by the Russes Sodom    which was swallowed
into the earth by the iustice of God for the wickednesse of the
people Again although as a rule Christianity has steadily opposed
pathologic love both in writing and preaching there have been
remarkable exceptions Perhaps the most curious idea was that of certain
medical writers in the middle ages Usus et amplexus pueri bene
temperatus salutaris medicina Tardieu Bayle notices under Vayer
the infamous book of Giovanni della Casa Archbishop of Benevento De
laudibus Sodomi vulgarly known as Capitolo del Forno The same
writer refers under Sixte iv to the report that the Dominican Order
which systematically decried Le Vice had presented a request to the
Cardinal di Santa Lucia that sodomy might be lawful during three months
per annum June to August and that the Cardinal had underwritten the
petition Be it done as they demand Hence the Fda Venus of Battista
Mantovano Bayle rejects the history for a curious reason venery being
colder in summer than in winter and quotes the proverb Aux mois qui
nont pas d R peu embrasser et bien boire But in the case of a
celibate priesthood such scandals are inevitable witness the famous
Jesuit epitaph Cigt un Jsuite etc

In our modern capitals London Berlin and Paris for instance the Vice
seems subject to periodical outbreaks For many years also England
sent her pederasts to Italy and especially to Naples whence originated
the term Il vizio Inglese It would be invidious to detail the
scandals which of late years have startled the public in London and
Dublin for these the curious will consult the police reports Berlin
despite her strong flavour of Phariseeism Puritanism and Chauvinism in
religion manners and morals is not a whit better than her neighbours
Dr Gaspar a wellknown authority on the subject adduces many
interesting cases especially an old Count Cajus and his six accomplices
Amongst his many correspondents one suggested to him that not only Plato
and Julius Csar but also Winckelmann and Platen  belonged to the
Society and he had found it flourishing in Palermo the Louvre the
Scottish Highlands and St Petersburg to name only a few places
Frederick the Great is said to have addressed these words to his nephew
Je puis vous assurer par mon exprience personnelle que ce plaisir
est peu agrable  cultiver This suggests the popular anecdote of
Voltaire and the Englishman who agreed upon an experience and found it
far from satisfactory A few days afterwards the latter informed the
Sage of Ferney that he had tried it again and provoked the exclamation
Once a philospher twice a sodomite The last revival of the kind in
Germany is a society at Frankfort and its neighbourhood selfstyled Les
Cravates Noires in opposition I suppose to Les Cravates Blanches of A
Belot

Paris is by no means more depraved than Berlin and London but whilst
the latter hushes up the scandal Frenchmen do not hence we see a more
copious account of it submitted to the public For France of the xviith
century consult the Histoire de la Prostitution chez tous les Peuples
du Monde and La France devenue Italienne a treatise which generally
follows LHistoire Amoureuse des Gaules by Bussy Comte de
Rabutin The headquarters of male prostitution were then in the
Champ Flory ie Champ de Flore the privileged rendezvous of low
courtesans In the xviiith century quand le Franais  tte folle as
Voltaire sings invented the term Pch philosophique there was a
temporary recrudescence and after the death of Pidauzet de Mairobert
March  his Apologie de la Secte Anandryne was published in
LEspion Anglais In those days the Alle des Veuves in the Champs
Elysees had a fief reserv des Ebugorsveuve in the language of
Sodom being the matresse en titre the favourite youth

The Restoration and the Empire made the police more vigilant in matters
of politics than of morals The favourite club which had its mot de
passe was in the Rue Doyenne old quarter St Thomas des Louvre and
the house was a htel of the xviith century Two streetdoors on the
right for the male gynceum and the left for the female opened at 
pm in winter and  pm in summer A decoylad charmingly dressed in
womens clothes with big haunches and small waist promenaded outside
and this continued till  when the police put down the house

Under Louis Philippe the conquest of Algiers had evil results
according to the Marquis de Boissy He complained without ambages of
murs Arabes in French regiments and declared that the result of the
African wars was an ffrayable dbordement pdrastique even as the
vrole resulted from the Italian campaigns of that age of passion the
xvith century From the military the flau spread to civilian society
and the Vice took such expansion and intensity that it may be said to
have been democratised in cities and large towns at least so we gather
from the Dossier des Agissements des Pdrastes A general gathering of
La Sainte Congrgation des glorieux Pdrastes was held in the old
Petite Rue des Marais where after the theatre many resorted under
pretext of making water They ranged themselves along the walls of a
vast garden and exposed their podices bourgeois richards and nobles
came with full purses touched the part which most attracted them and
were duly followed by it At the Alle des Veuves the crowd was
dangerous from  to  pm no policeman or ronde de nuit dared venture
in it cords were stretched from tree to tree and armed guards drove
away strangers amongst whom they say was once Victor Hugo This
nuisance was at length suppressed by the municipal administration

The Empire did not improve morals Balls of sodomites were held at No 
Place de la Madeleine where on Jan   some one hundred and fifty
men met all so well dressed as women that even the landlord did not
recognise them There was also a club for sotadic debauchery called the
Cent Gardes and the Dragons de lImpratrice They copied the
imperial toilette and kept it in the general wardrobe hence faire
lImpratrice meant to be used carnally The site a splendid hotel in
the Alle des Veuves was discovered by the ProcureurGnral who
registered all the names but as these belonged to not a few senators
and dignitaries the Emperor wisely quashed proceedings The club was
broken up on July   During the same year La Petite Revue edited
by M Loredan Larchy son of the General printed an article Les
chapps de Sodome it discusses the letter of M Castagnary to the
Progrs de Lyons and declares that the Vice had been adopted by
plusieurs corps de troupes For its latest developments as regards the
chantage of the tantes pathics the reader will consult the last
issues of Dr Tardieus wellknown tudes He declares that the
servantclass is most infected and that the Vice is commonest between
the ages of fifteen and twentyfive

The pederasty of The Nights may briefly be distributed into three
categories The first is the funny form as the unseemly practical joke
of masterful Queen Budr vol iii  and the not less hardi jest
of the slaveprincess Zumurrud vol iv  The second is in the
grimmest and most earnest phase of the perversion for instance where
Abu Nowas debauches the three youths vol v  whilst in the
third form it is wisely and learnedly discussed to be severely blamed
by the Shaykhah or Reverend Woman vol v 

To conclude this part of my subject the claircissement des obscnits
Many readers will regret the absence from The Nights of that modesty
which distinguishes Amadis de Gaul whose author when leaving a man
and a maid together says And nothing shall be here related for these
and suchlike things which are conformable neither to good conscience nor
nature man ought in reason lightly to pass over holding them in slight
esteem as they deserve Nor have we less respect for Palmerin of
England who after a risqu scene declares Herein is no offence offered
to the wise by wanton speeches or encouragement to the loose by
lascivious matter But these are not oriental ideas and we must een
take the Eastern as we find him He still holds Naturalia non sunt
turpia together with Mundis omnia munda and as Bacon assures us
the mixture of a lie doth add to pleasure so the Arab enjoys the
startling and lively contrast of extreme virtue and horrible vice placed
in juxtaposition

Those who have read through these ten volumes will agree with me that
the proportion of offensive matter bears a very small ratio to the mass
of the work In an age saturated with cant and hypocrisy here and there
a venal pen will mourn over the Pornography of The Nights dwell upon
the Ethics of Dirt and the Garbage of the Brothel and will lament
the wanton dissemination  of ancient and filthy fiction This
selfconstituted Censor morum reads Aristophanes and Plato Horace and
Virgil perhaps even Martial and Petronius because veiled in the
decent obscurity of a learned language he allows men Latin loqui but
he is scandalised at stumblingblocks much less important in plain
English To be consistent he must begin by bowdlerising not only the
classics with which boys and youths minds and memories are soaked and
saturated at schools and colleges but also Boccaccio and Chaucer
Shakespeare and Rabelais Burton Sterne Swift and a long list of works
which are yearly reprinted and republished without a word of protest
Lastly why does not this inconsistent puritan purge the Old Testament
of its allusions to human ordure and the pudenda to carnal copulation
and impudent whoredom to adultery and fornication to onanism sodomy
and bestiality But this he will not do the whited sepulchre To the
interested critic of the Edinburgh Review No  of July  I
return my warmest thanks for his direct and deliberate falsehoodslies
are onelegged and shortlived and venom evaporates It appears to
me that when I show to such men so respectable and so impure a
landscape of magnificent prospects whose vistas are adorned with every
charm of nature and art they point their unclean noses at a little heap
of muck here and there lying in a fieldcorner


                                   V
            ON THE PROSERHYME AND THE POETRY OF THE NIGHTS


                             ATHE SAJA

According to promise in my Foreword p xiv I here proceed to offer a
few observations concerning the Saja or rhymed prose and the Shir or
measured sentence that is the verse of The Nights The former has in
composition metrical or unmetrical three distinct forms Saja
mutawzi parallel the most common is when the ending words of
sentences agree in measure assonance and final letter in fact our full
rhyme next is Saja mutarraf the affluent when the periods
hemistichs or couplets end in words whose terminal letters correspond
although differing in measure and number and thirdly Saja muwzanah
equilibrium is applied to the balance which affects words
corresponding in measure but differing in final letters

AlSaja the fine style or style fleuri also termed AlBada or
euphuism is the basis of all Arabic euphony The whole of the Koran is
written in it and the same is the case with the Makmt of AlHariri
and the prime masterpieces of rhetorical composition without it no
translation of the Holy Book can be satisfactory or final and where it
is not the Assemblies become the prose of prose Thus universally used
the assonance has necessarily been abused and its excess has given rise
to the saying AlSaja fajaprose rhymes a pest English translators
have unwisely I think agreed in rejecting it while Germans have not
Mr Preston assures us that rhyming prose is extremely ungraceful in
English and introduces an air of flippancy this was certainly not the
case with Friedrich Rckerts version of the great original and I see
no reason why it should be so or become so in our tongue Torrens Pref
p vii declares that the effect of the irregular sentence with the
iteration of a jingling rhyme is not pleasant in our language he
therefore systematically neglects it and gives his style the semblance
of being scamped with the object of saving study and trouble Mr
Payne ix  deems it an excrescence born of the excessive
facilities for rhyme afforded by the language and of Eastern delight
in antithesis of all kinds whether of sound or of thought and aiming
elaborately at grace of style he omits it wholly even in the proverbs

The weight of authority was against me but my plan compelled me to
disregard it The dilemma was simply either to use the Saja or to
follow Mr Paynes method and arrange the disjecta membra of the
original in their natural order that is to remodel the text Intending
to produce a faithful copy of the Arabic I was compelled to adopt the
former and still hold it to be the better alternative Moreover I
question Mr Paynes dictum ix  that the Sejaform is utterly
foreign to the genius of English prose and that its preservation would
be fatal to all vigour and harmony of style The English translator of
Palmerin of England Anthony Munday attempted it in places with great
success as I have before noted vol viii  and my late friend
Edward Eastwick made artistic use of it in his Gulistan Had I rejected
the Cadence of the cooingdove because unEnglish I should have
adopted the balanced periods of the Anglican marriage service or
the essentially English system of alliteration requiring some such
artful aid to distinguish from the vulgar recitative style the elevated
and classical tirades in The Nights My attempt has found with reviewers
more favour than I expected and a kindly critic writes of it These
melodious fragments these little eddies of song set like gems in the
prose have a charming effect on the ear They come as dulcet surprises
and mostly recur in highlywrought situations or they are used to
convey a vivid sense of something exquisite in nature or art Their
introduction seems due to whim or caprice but really it arises from a
profound study of the situation as if the Taleteller felt suddenly
compelled to break into the rhythmic strain


                             BTHE VERSE

The Shir or metrical part of The Nights is considerable amounting to
not less than ten thousand lines and these I could not but render in
rhyme or rather in monorhyme This portion has been a bugbear to
translators De Sacy noticed the difficulty of the task p  Lane
held the poetry untranslatable because abounding in the figure Tajns
our paronomasia or paragram of which there are seven distinct
varieties not to speak of other rhetorical flourishes He
therefore omitted the greater part of the verse as tedious and through
the loss of measure and rhyme generally intolerable to the reader He
proved his position by the bald literalism of the passages which he
rendered in truly prosaic prose and succeeded in changing the facies and
presentment of the work For the Shir like the Saja is not
introduced arbitrarily and its unequal distribution throughout The
Nights may be accounted for by rule of art Some tales like Omar bin
alNuman and Tawaddud contain very little because the theme is
historical or realistic whilst in stories of love and courtship as
that of Roseinhood the proportion may rise to onefifth of the whole
And this is true to nature Love as Addison said makes even the
mechanic the British mechanic poetical and Joe Hume of material
memory once fought a duel about a fair object of dispute

Before discussing the verse of The Nights it may be advisable to enlarge
a little upon the prosody of the Arabs We know nothing of the origin of
their poetry which is lost in the depths of antiquity and the oldest
bards of whom we have any remains belong to the famous epoch of the war
AlBass which would place them about AD  Moreover when the Muse
of Arabia first shows she is not only fully developed and mature she
has lost all her first youth her beaut du diable and she is assuming
the characteristics of an age beyond middle age No one can study the
earliest poetry without perceiving that it results from the cultivation
of centuries and that it has already assumed that artificial type and
conventional process of treatment which presages inevitable decay Its
noblest period is included in the century preceding the Apostolate of
Mohammed and the oldest of that epoch is the prince of Arab songsters
Imr alKays The Wandering King The Christian Fathers
characteristically termed poetry Vinum Dmonorum The stricter Moslems
called their bards enemies of Allah and when the Prophet who hated
verse and could not even quote it correctly was asked who was the best
poet of the Peninsula he answered that the Man of AlKays ie the
worshipper of the Priapusidol would usher them all into Hell Here he
only echoed the general verdict of his countrymen who loved poetry and
as a rule despised poets The earliest complete pieces of any volume
and substance saved from the wreck of old Arabic literature and familiar
in our day are the seven Kasdahs purposeodes or tendenceelegies
which are popularly known as the Gilded or the Suspended Poems and in
all of these we find with an elaboration of material and formal art
which can go no further a subjectmatter of trite imagery and stock
ideas which suggest a long ascending line of model ancestors and
predecessors

Scholars are agreed upon the fact that many of the earliest and best
Arab poets were as Mohammed boasted himself unalphabetic or
rather could neither read nor write They addressed the ear and the
mind not the eye They spoke verse learning it by rote and dictating
it to the Rwi and this reciter again transmitted it to the musician
whose pipe or zither accompanied the minstrels song In fact the
general practice of writing began only at the end of the first century
after The Flight

The rude and primitive measure of Arab song upon which the most
complicated system of metres subsequently arose was called AlRajaz
literally the trembling because it reminded the highly imaginative
hearer of a pregnant shecamels weak and tottering steps This was the
carol of the cameldriver the lovers lay and the warriors chaunt of
the heroic ages and its simple unconstrained flow adapted it well for
extempore effusions Its merits and demerits have been extensively
discussed amongst Arab grammarians and many noticing that it was not
originally divided into hemistichs make an essential difference between
the Shir who speaks poetry and the Rjiz who speaks Rajaz It
consisted to describe it technically of iambic dipodia     the
first three syllables being optionally long or short It can generally
be read like our iambs and being familiar is pleasant to the English
ear The dipodia are repeated either twice or thrice in the former case
Rajaz is held by some authorities as AlAkhfash Sad ibn Msadah to
be mere prose Although Labd and Antar composed in iambics the first
Ksdah or regular poem in Rajaz was by AlAghlab alAjibi temp
Mohammed the Alfyahgrammar of Ibn Mlik is in Rajaz Muzdawij the
hemistichs rhyming and the assonance being confined to the couplet
AlHariri also affects Rajaz in the third and fifth Assemblies So far
Arabic metre is true to Nature in impassioned speech the movement of
language is iambic we say I will I will not I will

For many generations the Sons of the Desert were satisfied with Natures
teaching the fine perceptions and the nicely trained ear of the bard
needing no aid from art But in time came the inevitable prosodist under
the formidable name of Abu Abd alRahmn alKhall i Ahmad i Amr
i Tamm alFarhidi of the Farhid sept alAzdi of the Azd clan
alYahmadi of the Yahmad tribe popularly known as AlKhall ibn Ahmad
alBasri of Bassorah where he died t  scanning verses they say
in AH    Ibn Khallikn relates i  on the authority
of Hamzah alIsfahni how this father of Arabic grammar and discoverer
of the rules of prosody invented the science as he walked past a
coppersmiths shop on hearing the strokes of a hammer upon a metal
basin two objects devoid of any quality which could serve as a proof
and an illustration of anything else than their own form and shape and
incapable of leading to any other knowledge than that of their own
nature According to others he was passing through the Fullers
Bazar at Basrah when his ear was struck by the Dakdak   and the
Dakakdakak   of the workmen In these two onomatopoetics we
trace the expression which characterises the Arab tongue all syllables
are composed of consonant and vowel the latter long or short as B and
B or of a vowelled consonant followed by a consonant as Bal Bau 

The grammarian true to the traditions of his craft which looks for all
poetry to the Badawi adopted for metrical details the language of
the Desert The distich which amongst Arabs is looked upon as one line
he named Bayt nightingplace tent or house and the hemistich
Misrah the one leaf of a folding door To this scenic simile all
the parts of the verse were more or less adapted The metres our feet
were called Arkn the stakes and stays of the tent the syllables
were Usl or roots divided into three kinds the first or Sabab the
tentrope is composed of two letters a vowelled and a quiescent
consonant as Lam The Watad or tentpeg of three letters is of
two varieties the Majm or united a foot in which the two first
consonants are moved by vowels and the last is jazmated or made
quiescent by apocope as Lakad and the Mafrk or disunited when the
two moved consonants are separated by one jazmated as Kabla And
lastly the Fsilah or intervening space applied to the main pole of
the tent consists of four letters

The metres were called Buhr or seas plur of Bahr also meaning the
space within the tentwalls the equivoque alluding to pearls and other
treasures of the deep AlKhalil the systematiser found in general use
only five Dirah circles classes or groups of metre and he
characterised the harmonious and stately measures all built upon the
original Rajaz as AlTawl the long AlKmil the complete
AlWfir the copious AlBast the extended and AlKhaff the
light These embrace all the Muallakt and the Hamsah the great
Anthology of Ab Tammm but the crave for variety and the extension of
foreign intercourse had multiplied wants and AlKhalil deduced from the
original five Dirah fifteen to which AlAkhfash ob AD  added
a sixteenth AlKhabab The Persians extended the number to nineteen
the first four were peculiarly Arab the fourteenth the fifteenth and
seventeenth peculiarly Persian and all the rest were Arab and
Persian

Arabic metre so far resembles that of Greece and Rome that the value of
syllables depends upon the quantity or position of their consonants
not upon accent as in English and the NeoLatin tongues AlKhalil was
doubtless familiar with the classic prosody of Europe but he rejected it
as unsuited to the genius of Arabic and like a true Eastern Gelehrte he
adopted a process devised by himself Instead of scansion by pyrrhics
and spondees iambs and trochees anapaests and similar simplifications
he invented a system of weights wuzn Of these there are nine
memorial words used as quantitive signs all built upon the root fal
which has rendered such notable service to Arabic and Hebrew
grammar and varying from the simple fal in Persian fal  
to the complicated Mutafilun      anapaest  iamb Thus the
prosodist would scan the Shahnmeh of Firdausi as

                   Falun falun falun fal

                                   

These weights also show another peculiarity of Arabic verse In English
we have few if any spondees the Arabic contains about three longs to
one short hence its gravity stateliness and dignity But these longs
again are peculiar and sometimes strike the European ear as shorts
thus adding a difficulty for those who would represent Oriental metres
by western feet ictus and accent German Arabists can register an
occasional success in such attempts Englishmen none My late friend
Professor Palmer of Cambridge tried the tour de force of dancing on one
leg instead of two and notably failed Mr Lyall also strove to imitate
Arabic metre and produced only prose bewitched Mr Payne appears
to me to have wasted trouble in observing the exterior form of the
stanza the movement of the rhyme and as far as possible the identity
in number of the syllables composing the beits There is only one part
of his admirable version concerning which I have heard competent readers
complain and that is the metrical because here and there it sounds
strange to their ears

I have already stated my conviction that there are two and only two ways
of translating Arabic poetry into English One is to represent it by
good heroic or lyric verse as did Sir William Jones the other is to
render it after French fashion by measured and balanced Prose the
little sister of Poetry It is thus and thus only that we can preserve
the peculiar cachet of the original This oldworld Oriental song is
spiritstirring as a blast of that dread horn albeit the words be
thin It is heady as the Golden Wine of Libanus to the tongue water
and brandy to the brainthe clean contrary of our nineteenth century
effusions Technically speaking it can be vehicled only by the verse of
the old English ballad or by the prose of the Book of Job And Badawi
poetry is a perfect expositor of Badawi life especially in the good and
gladsome old Pagan days ere AlIslam like the creed which it abolished
overcast the minds of men with its dull grey pall of realistic
superstition They combined to form a marvellous picturethose contrasts
of splendour and squalor amongst the sons of the sand Under airs pure
as ther golden and ultramarine above and melting over the horizon into
a diaphanous green which suggested a reflection of Kaf that unseen
mountainwall of emerald the socalled Desert changed face twice a
year now brown and dry as summerdust then green as Hope beautified
with infinite verdure and broad sheetings of rainwater The vernal and
autumnal shiftings of camp disruptions of homesteads and partings of
kith and kin friends and lovers made the life manysided as it was
vigorous and noble the outcome of hardy frames strong minds and
spirits breathing the very essence of liberty and independence The day
began with the dawndrink generous wine bought with shining ore
poured into the crystal goblet from the leather bottle swinging before
the cooling breeze The rest was spent in the practice of weapons in
the favourite arrowgame known as AlMaysar gambling which at least had
the merit of feeding the poor in racing for which the Badawin had a
mania and in the chase the foray and the fray which formed the serious
business of his life And how picturesque the hunting scenes the
greyhound like the mare of purest blood the falcon cast at francolin
and coney the gazelle standing at gaze the desert ass scudding over
the groundwaves the wild cows or bovine antelopes browsing with their
calves and the ostrichchickens flocking round the parent bird The
Musmarah or nighttalk round the campfire was enlivened by the
lutegirl and the gleeman whom the austere Prophet described as roving
distraught in every vale and whose motto in Horatian vein was Today
we shall drink tomorrow be sober wine this day that day work
Regularly once a year during the three peaceful months when war and
even blood revenge were held sacrilegious the tribes met at Ukdh
Ocaz and other fairsteads where they held high festival and the bards
strave in song and prided themselves upon doing honour to women and to
the successful warriors of their tribe Brief the object of Arab life
was to beto be free to be brave to be wise while the endeavours of
other peoples was and is to haveto have wealth to have knowledge to
have a name and while moderns make their epitome of life to be to do
and to suffer Lastly the Arabs end was honourable as his life was
stirring few Badawin had the crowning misfortune of dying the
strawdeath

The poetical forms in The Nights are as followsThe Misrah or
hemistich is half the Bayt which for want of a better word I have
rendered couplet this however though formally separated in MSS is
looked upon as one line one verse hence a word can be divided the
former part pertaining to the first and the latter to the second moiety
of the distich As the Arabs ignore blank verse when we come upon a
rhymeless couplet we know that it is an extract from a longer
composition in monorhyme The Kitah is a fragment either an occasional
piece or more frequently a portion of a Ghazal ode or Kasdah elegy
other than the Matl the initial Bayt with rhyming distichs The Ghazal
and Kasdah differ mainly in length the former is popularly limited to
eighteen couplets the latter begins at fifteen and is of indefinite
number Both are built upon monorhyme which appears twice in the first
couplet and ends all the others eg aa  ba  ca etc nor may the
same assonance be repeated unless at least seven couplets intervene In
the best poets as in the old classic verse of France the sense must be
completed in one couplet and not run on to a second and as the parts
cohere very loosely separate quotation can generally be made without
injuring their proper effect A favourite form is the Rub or
quatrain made familiar to English ears by Mr Fitzgeralds masterly
adaptation of OmariKhayym the movement is generally aa  ba but it
also appears as ab  cb in which case it is a Kitah or fragment The
Murabb tetrastichs or fourfold song occurs once only in The Nights
vol i  it is a succession of double Bayts or of fourlined
stanzas rhyming aa  bc  dc  ec in strict form the first three
hemistichs rhyme with one another only independently of the rest of the
poem and the fourth with that of every other stanza eg aa  ab 
cb  db The Mukhammas cinquains or pentastichs Night cmlxiv
represents a stanza of two distichs and a hemistich in monorhyme the
fifth line being the bob or burden each succeeding stanza affects a
new rhyme except in the fifth line eg aaaab  ccccb  ddddb and
so forth The Muwwl is a simple popular song in four to six lines
specimens of it are given in the Egyptian grammar of my friend the late
Dr Wilhelm Spitta The Muwashshah or ornamented verse has two
main divisions one applies to our acrostics in which the initials form
a word or words the other is a kind of Musaddas or sextines which
occurs once only in The Nights cmlxxxvii It consists of three
couplets or sixline strophes all the hemistichs of the first are in
monorhyme in the second and following stanzas the three first
hemistichs take a new rhyme but the fourth resumes the assonance of the
first set and is followed by the third couplet of No  serving as bob
or refrain eg aaaaaa  bbbaaa  cccaaa and so forth It is the
most complicated of all the measures and is held to be of Morisco or
HispanoMoorish origin

Mr Lane Lex lays down on the lines of Ibn Khallikan i  etc
and other representative literati as our sole authorities for pure
Arabic the precedence in following order First of all ranks the Jhili
Ignoramus of The Ignorance the    these pagans
left hemistichs couplets pieces and elegies which once composed a
large corpus and which is now mostly forgotten Hammd alRwiyah the
Reciter a man of Persian descent ob AH    who first
collected the Muallakt once recited by rote in a sance before Caliph
AlWalid two thousand poems of prMohammedan bards After the
Jhili stands the Mukhadram or Muhadrim the Spurious because half
Pagan half Moslem who flourished either immediately before or soon
after the preaching of Mohammed The Islmi or fullblooded Moslem at
the end of the first century AH   began the process of
corruption in language and lastly he was followed by the Muwallad of
the second century who fused Arabic with nonArabic and in whom purity
of diction disappeared

I have noticed   A that the versical portion of The Nights may be
distributed into three categories First are the olden poems which are
held classical by all modern Arabs then comes the medival poetry the
effusions of that brilliant throng which adorned the splendid Court of
Harun alRashid and which ended with AlHarri ob AH  and
lastly are the various pices de circonstance suggested to editors or
scribes by the occasion It is not my object to enter upon the
historical part of the subject a mere sketch would have neither value
nor interest whilst a finished picture would lead too far I must be
contented to notice a few of the most famous names

Of the prislamites we have di bin Zayd alIbadi the celebrated poet
of Ibn Kkallikn i  Nbighat the fullgrown alZubyni who
flourished at the Court of AlNuman in AD  and whose poem is
compared with the Suspendeds and AlMutalammis the
pertinacious satirist friend and intimate with Tarafah of the Prize
Poem About Mohammeds day we find Imr alKays with whom poetry
began to end with Z alRummah Amr bin Mdi Karab alZubaydi Labd
Kab ibn Zuhayr the father one of the Muallakahpoets and the son
author of the Burdah or Mantlepoem see vol iv  and Abbs bin
Mirds who lampooned the Prophet and had his tongue cut out ie
received a double share of booty from Ali In the days of Caliph Omar we
have Alkamah bin Oltha followed by Jaml bin Mamar of the Banu Ozrah
ob AH  who loved Azz Then came AlKuthayyir the dwarf
ironic the lover of Buthaynah who was so lean that birds might be
cut to bits with her bones the latter was also a poetess Ibn Khall
i  like Hind bint alNuman who made herself so disagreeable to
AlHajjj ob AH  Jarr alKhatafah the noblest of the Islami
poets in the first century is noticed at full length by Ibn Khallikan
i  together with his rival in poetry and debauchery Ab Firs
Hammm or Homaym bin Ghalib alFarazdak the Tammi the Ommiade poet
without whose verse half Arabic would be lost he exchanged
satires with Jarr and died forty days before him AH  Another
contemporary forming the poetical triumvirate of the period was the
debauched Christian poet AlAkhtal alTaghlibi They were followed by
AlAhwas alAnsri whose witty lampoons banished him to Dahlak Island in
the Red Sea ob AH    by Bashshr ibn Burd and by Ynus ibn
Habib ob AH 

The wellknown names of the Haruncycle are AlAsmai rhetorician and
poet whose epic with Antar for hero is not forgotten ob AH 
Isaac of Mosul Ishak bin Ibrahim of Persian origin AlUtbi the
Poet ob AH  Abu alAbbs alRakshi Abu alAtahiyah the
lover of Otbah Muslim bin alWald alAnsari Ab Tammm of Tay
compiler of the Hamsah ob AH  a Muwallad of the first class
says Ibn Khallikan i  the famous or infamous Abu Nows Abu
Musab Ahmad ibn Ali who died in AH  the satirist Dibil
alKhuz ob AH  and a host of others quos nunc perscribere
longum est They were followed by AlBohtori the Poet ob AH 
the royal author Abdullah ibn alMutazz ob AH  Ibn Abbd the
Sahib ob AH  Mansr alHallj the martyred Sufi the Sahib ibn
Abbad Abu Faras alHamdni ob AH  AlNmi ob AH  who
had many encounters with that model Chauvinist AlMutanabbi nicknamed
AlMutanabbih the wideawake killed AH  AlManzi of

AH  AlHarri the model rhetorician ob AH  AlHjiri
alIrbili of Arbela ob AH  Bah alDin alSinjari ob AH
 AlKtib or the Scribe ob AH  Abdun alAndalsi the
Spaniard our xiith century and about the same time AlNwaji author
of the Halbat alKumayt or Racecourse of the Bayhorsepoetical slang
for wine

Of the third category the pices doccasion little need be said I may
refer readers to my notes on the doggrels in vol ii    
  and  in vol v  and in vol viii 

Having a mortal aversion to the details of Arabic prosody I have
persuaded my friend Dr Steingass to undertake in the following pages
the subject as far as concerns the poetry of The Nights He has been
kind enough to collaborate with me from the beginning and to his minute
lexicographical knowledge I am deeply indebted for discovering not a few
blemishes which would have been nuts to the critic The learned
Arabists notes will be highly interesting to students mine  V are
intended to give a superficial and popular idea of the Arabs
versemechanism

The principle of Arabic Prosody called Arz pattern standard or
Ilm alArz science of the Arz in so far resembles that of
classical poetry as it chiefly rests on metrical weight not on accent
or in other words a verse is measured by short and long quantities
while the accent only regulates its rhythm In Greek and Latin however
the quantity of the syllables depends on their vowels which may be
either naturally short or long or become long by position ie if
followed by two or more consonants We all remember from our schooldays
what a fine string of rules had to be committed to and kept in memory
before we were able to scan a Latin or Greek verse without breaking its
neck by tripping over false quantities In Arabic on the other hand
the answer to the question what is metrically long or short is
exceedingly simple and flows with stringent cogency from the nature of
the Arabic Alphabet This strictly speaking knows only consonants
Harf pl Hurf The vowels which are required in order to articulate
the consonants were at first not represented in writing at all They
had to be supplied by the reader and are not improperly called
motions Harakt because they move or lead on as it were one letter
to another They are three in number a Fathah i Kasrah u
Zammah originally sounded as the corresponding English vowels in bat
bit and butt respectively but in certain cases modifying their
pronunciation under the influence of a neighbouring consonant When the
necessity made itself felt to represent them in writing especially for
the sake of fixing the correct reading of the Koran they were rendered
by additional signs placed above or beneath the consonant after which
they are pronounced in a similar way as it is done in some systems of
English shorthand A consonant followed by a short vowel is called a
moved letter Muharrakah a consonant without such vowel is called
resting or quiescent Skinah and can stand only at the end of a
syllable or word

And now we are able to formulate the one simple rule which determines
the prosodical quantity in Arabic any moved letter as ta li mu is
counted short any moved letter followed by a quiescent one as taf
lun mus ie any closed syllable beginning and terminating with a
consonant and having a short vowel between forms a long quantity This
is certainly a relief in comparison with the numerous rules of classical
Prosody proved by not a few exceptions which for instance in Dr
Smiths elementary Latin Grammar fill eight closely printed pages

Before I proceed to show how from the prosodical unities the moved and
the quiescent letter first the metrical elements then the feet and
lastly the metres are built up it will be necessary to obviate a few
misunderstandings to which our mode of transliterating Arabic into the
Roman character might give rise

The line

     Love in my heart they lit and went their ways vol i 

runs in Arabic

         Akm alwajda f kalb wa sr Mac Ed i 

Here according to our ideas the word akm would begin with a short
vowel a and contain two long vowels  and  according to Arabic views
neither is the case The word begins with Alif and its second
syllable k closes in Alif after Fathah a in the same way as the
third syllable m closes in the letter Ww w after Zammah u

The question therefore arises what is Alif It is the first of the
twentyeight Arabic letters and has through the medium of the Greek
Alpha nominally entered into our alphabet where it now plays rather a
misleading part Curiously enough however Greek itself has preserved
for us the key to the real nature of the letter In  the initial a
is preceded by the socalled spiritus lenis  a sign which must be
placed in front or at the top of any vowel beginning a Greek word and
which represents that slight aspiration or soft breathing almost
involuntarily uttered when we try to pronounce a vowel by itself We
need not go far to find how deeply rooted this tendency is and to what
exaggerations it will sometimes lead Witness the gentleman who after
mentioning that he had been visiting his favourite haunts on the
scenes of his early life was sympathetically asked how the dear old
ladies were This spiritus lenis is the silent h of the French homme
and the English honour corresponding exactly to the Arabic Hamzah
whose mere prop the Alif is when it stands at the beginning of a word
a native Arabic Dictionary does not begin with Bb alAlif Gate or
Chapter of the Alif but with Bb alHamzah What the Greeks call Alpha
and have transmitted to us as a name for the vowel a is in fact nothing
else but the Arabic HamzahAlif  moved by Fathah ie bearing
the sign  for a at the top  just as it might have the sign
Zammah  superscribed to express u  or the sign Kasrah 
subjoined to represent i  In each case the HamzahAlif although
scarcely audible to our ear is the real letter and might fitly be
rendered in transliteration by the abovementioned silent h wherever we
make an Arabic word begin with a vowel not preceded by any other sign
This latter restriction refers to the sign  which in Sir Richard
Burtons translation of The Nights as frequently in books published in
this country is used to represent the Arabic letter  in whose very
name Ayn it occurs The Ayn is described as produced by a smart
compression of the upper part of the windpipe and forcible emission of
breath imparting a guttural tinge to a following or preceding
vowelsound but it is by no means a mere guttural vowel as Professor
Palmer styles it For Europeans who do not belong to the Israelitic
dispensation as well as for Turks and Persians its exact pronunciation
is most difficult if not impossible to acquire

In reading Arabic from transliteration for the purpose of scanning
poetry we have therefore in the first instance to keep in mind that no
Arabic word or syllable can begin with a vowel Where our mode of
rendering Arabic in the Roman character would make this appear to be the
case either Hamzah silent h or Ayn represented by the sign  is
the real initial and the only element to be taken in account as a
letter It follows as a selfevident corollary that wherever a single
consonant stands between two vowels it never closes the previous
syllable but always opens the next one Our word Akm for instance
can only be divided into the syllables A properly Hakm never
into Akm or Akm

It has been stated above that the syllable k is closed by the letter
Alif after Fathah in the same way as the syllable m is closed by the
letter Ww and I may add now as the word f is closed by the letter Y
y To make this perfectly clear I must repeat that the Arabic
Alphabet as it was originally written deals only with consonants The
signs for the short vowelsounds were added later for a special purpose
and are generally not represented even in printed books eg in the
various editions of The Nights where only quotations from the Koran or
poetical passages are provided with the vowelpoints But among those
consonants there are three called weak letters Hurf alillah which
have a particular organic affinity to these vowelsounds the guttural
Hamzah which is akin to a the palatal Y which is related to i and
the labial Ww which is homogeneous with u Where any of the weak
letters follows a vowel of its own class either at the end of a word or
being itself followed by another consonant it draws out or lengthens
the preceding vowel and is in this sense called a letter of prolongation
Harf alMadd Thus bearing in mind that the Hamzah is in reality a
silent h the syllable k might be written kah similarly to the German
word sah where the h is not pronounced either but imparts a
lengthened sound to the a In like manner m and f are written in
Arabic muw and fiy respectively and form long quantities not because
they contain a vowel long by nature but because their initial
Muharrakah is followed by a Skinah exactly as in the previously
mentioned syllables taf lun mus In the Roman transliteration
Akm forms a word of five letters two of which are consonants and
three vowels in Arabic it represents the combination Hakahmuw
consisting also of five letters but all consonants the intervening
vowels being expressed in writing either merely by superadded external
signs or more frequently not at all Metrically it represents one short
and two long quantities    forming in Latin a trisyllabic foot
called Bacchus and in Arabic a quinqueliteral Rukn pillar or Juz
part portion the technical designation for which we shall introduce
presently

There is one important remark more to be made with regard to the Hamzah
at the beginning of a word it is either conjunctive Hamzat alWasl or
disjunctive Hamzat al Kat The difference is best illustrated by
reference to the French socalled aspirated h as compared with the
above mentioned silent h If the latter as initial of a noun is
preceded by the article the article loses its vowel and ignoring the
silent h altogether is read with the following noun almost as one word
le homme becomes lhomme pronounced lomme as le ami becomes lami
This resembles very closely the Arabic Hamzah Wasl If on the other
hand a French word begins with an aspirated h as for instance hros
the article does not drop its vowel before the noun nor is the h
sounded as in the English word hero but the effect of the aspirate is
simply to keep the two vowel sounds apart so as to pronounce le ros
with a slight hiatus between and this is exactly what happens in the
case of the Arabic Hamzah Kat

With regard to the Wasl however Arabic goes a step further than
French In the French example quoted above we have seen it is the
silent h and the preceding vowel which are eliminated in Arabic both
the Hamzah and its own Harakah ie the short vowel following it
are supplanted by their antecedent Another example will make this
clear The most common instance of the Hamzah Wasl is the article al
for hal  the Hebrew hal where it is moved by Fathah But it has
this sound only at the beginning of a sentence or speech as in
Alhamdu at the head of the Fatihah or in Allhu at the beginning
of the third Surah If the two words stand in grammatical connection as
in the sentence Praise be to God we cannot say AlHamdu liAllhi
but the junction Wasl between the dative particle li and the noun
which it governs must take place According to the French principle
this junction would be effected at the cost of the preceding element and
li Allhi would become lAllh in Arabic on the contrary the
kasrated l of the particle takes the place of the following fathated
Hamzah and we read li llhi instead Proceeding in the Fatihah we meet
with the verse Iyyka nabudu wa iyyka nastanu Thee do we worship
and of Thee do we ask aid Here the Hamzah of iyyka properly hiyyka
with silent h is disjunctive and therefore its pronunciation remains
the same at the beginning and in the middle of the sentence or to put
it differently instead of coalescing with the preceding wa into
wayyka the two words are kept separate by the Hamzah reading wa
iyyka just as it was the case with the French Le hros

If the conjunctive Hamzah is preceded by a quiescent letter this takes
generally Kasrah Tlat alLaylah the night was longsome would
become Tlati lLaylah If however the quiescent letter is one of
prolongation it mostly drops out altogether and the Harakah of the
next preceding letter becomes the connecting vowel between the two
words which in our parlance would mean that the endvowel of the first
word is shortened before the elided initial of the second Thus f
albayti in the house which in Arabic is written fiy halbayti
and which we transliterate f lbayti is in poetry read filbayti
where we must remember that the syllable fil in spite of its short
vowel represents a long quantity because it consists of a moved letter
followed by a quiescent one Fl would be overlong and could according
to Arabic prosody stand only in certain cases at the end of a verse
ie in pause where a natural tendency prevails to prolong a sound

The attentive reader will now be able to fix the prosodical value of the
line quoted above with unerring security For metrical purposes it
syllabifies into Akmulvajda f kalb wa sr containing three
short and eight long quantities The initial unaccented a is short for
the same reason why the syllables da and wa are so that is because it
corresponds to an Arabic letter the Hamzah or silent h moved by
Fathah The syllables k f b s r are long for the same reason
why the syllables mul waj kal are so that is because the accent in
the transliteration corresponds to a quiescent Arabic letter following
a moved one The same simple criterion applies to the whole list in
which I give in alphabetical order the first lines and the metre of all
the poetical pieces contained in the Mac edition and which will be
found at the end of this volume

The prosodical unities then in Arabic are the moved and the quiescent
letter and we are now going to show how they combine into metrical
elements feet and metres

i The metrical elements Usl are

 The Sabab which consists of two letters and is either khaff
light or sakl heavy A moved letter followed by a quiescent ie
a closed syllable like the aforementioned taf lun mus to which we
may now add f  fah   iy   uw form a Sabab khaff
corresponding to the classical long quantity  Two moved letters in
succession like muta ala constitute a Sabab sakl for which the
classical name would be Pyrrhic   As in Latin and Greek they are
equal in weight and can frequently interchange that is to say the
Sabab khaff can be evolved into a sakl by moving its second Harf or
the latter contracted into the former by making its second letter
quiescent

 The Watad consisting of three letters one of which is quiescent
If the quiescent follows the two moved ones the Watad is called majm
collected or joined as fa  fauw maf  mafah ilun and it
corresponds to the classical Iambus   If on the contrary the
quiescent intervenes or separates between the two moved letters as in
fi  fahi ltu  lahtu tafi the Watad is called mafrk
separated and has its classical equivalent in the Trochee  

 The Fsilah containing four letters ie three moved ones
followed by a quiescent and which in fact is only a shorter name for
a Sabab sakl followed by a Sabab khaff as muta  f or ala  tun
both of the measure of the classical Anapaest   

ii These three elements the Sabab Watad and Fsilah combine further
into feet Arkn pl of Rukn or Ajz pl of Juz two words explained
supra p  The technical terms by which the feet are named are
derivatives of the root fal to do which as the student will remember
serves in Arabic Grammar to form the Auzn or weights in accordance
with which words are derived from roots It consists of the three
letters F f Ayn  Lm l and like any other Arabic root
cannot strictly speaking be pronounced for the introduction of any
vowelsound would make it cease to be a root and change it into an
individual word The above fal for instance where the initial F is
moved by Fathah a is the Infinitive or verbal noun to do doing
If the Ayn also is moved by Fathah we obtain faal meaning in
colloquial Arabic he did the classical or literary form would be
faala Pronouncing the first letter with Zammah u the second with
Kasrah i ie fuil we say it was done classically fuila
Many more forms are derived by prefixing inserting or subjoining
certain additional letters called Hurf alZiydah letters of increase
to the original radicals fil for instance with an Alif of
prolongation in the first syllable means doer mafl  mafuwl
where the quiescent F is preceded by a fathated Mm m and the
zammated Ayn followed by a lengthening Waw means done Mufalah
where in addition to a prefixed and inserted letter the feminine
termination ah is subjoined after the Lm means to do a thing
reciprocally Since these and similar changes are with unvarying
regularity applicable to all roots the grammarians use the derivatives
of Fal as modelforms for the corresponding derivations of any other
root whose letters are in this case called its F Ayn and Lm From a
root eg which has Kf k for its first letter or F T t for
its second letter or Ayn and B b for its third letter or Lm

 fal would be katb  to write writing
 faal would be katab  he wrote
 fuil would be kutib  it was written
 fil would be ktib  writer scribe
 mafl would be maktb  written letter
 mufalah would be muktabah  to write reciprocally correspondence

The advantage of this system is evident It enables the student who has
once grasped the original meaning of a root to form scores of words
himself and in his readings to understand hundreds nay thousands of
words without recourse to the Dictionary as soon as he has learned to
distinguish their radical letters from the letters of increase and
recognises in them a familiar root We cannot wonder therefore that
the inventor of Arabic Prosody readily availed himself of the same plan
for his own ends The Tafl as it is here called that is the
representation of the metrical feet by current derivatives of fal has
in this case of course nothing to do with the etymological meaning of
those typical forms But it proves none the less useful in another
direction in simply naming a particular foot it shows at the same time
its prosodical measure and character as will now be explained in
detail

We have seen supra p  that the word Akm consists of a short
syllable followed by two long ones    and consequently forms a
foot which the classics would call Bacchus In Latin there is no
connection between this name and the metrical value of the foot we must
learn both by heart But if we are told that its Tafl in Arabic is
Falun we understand at once that it is composed of the Watad majm
fa   and the Sabab khaff lun  and as the Watad contains
three the Sabab two letters it forms a quinqueliteral foot or Juz
khams

In combining into feet the Watad has the precedence over the Sabab and
the Fsilah and again the Watad majm over the Watad mafrk Hence the
Prosodists distinguish between Ajz aslyah or primary feet from Asl
root in which this precedence is observed and jz faryah or
secondary feet from Far  branch in which it is reversed The former
are four in number

 Falun consisting as we have just seen of a Watad majm followed
by a Sabab khaff  the Latin Bacchus   

 Maflun ie Watad majm followed by two Sabab khaff  the
Latin Epitritus primus    

 Mufalatun ie Watad majm followed by Fsilah  the Latin
Iambus followed by Anapaest     

 Filtun ie Watad mafrk followed by two Sabab khaff  the
Latin Epitritus secundus    

The number of the secondary feet increases to six for as No  and 
contain two Sabab they branch out into two derived feet each
according to both Sabab or only one changing place with regard to the
Watad They are

 Filun ie Sabab khaff followed by Watad majm  the Latin
Creticus    The primary Falun becomes by transposition
Lunfa To bring this into conformity with a current derivative of
fal the initial Sabab must be made to contain the first letter of the
root and the Watad the two remaining ones in their proper order F is
therefore substituted for lun and ilun for fa forming together the
above Filun By similar substitutions which it would be tedious to
specify in each separate case Maflun becomes

 Mustafilun for lunmaf ie two Sabab khaff followed by
Watad majm  the Latin Epitritus tertius     or

 Filtun for Lunmaf ie Watad majm between two Sabab
khaff  the Latin Epitritus secundus    

 Mutafilun for Alatunmuf the reversed Mufalatun ie
Fsilah followed by Watad majm  the Latin Anapaest succeeded by
Iambus      The last two secondary feet are transpositions of
No  Fi ltun namely

 Mafltu for Ltunfi ie two Sabab khaff followed by
Watad mafrk  the Latin Epitritus quartus    

 Mustafilun for Tunfil ie Watad mafrk between two
Sabab khaff  the Latin Epitritus tertius    

The branchfoot Filun No  like its root Falun No  is
quinqueliteral All other feet primary or secondary consist
necessarily of seven letters as they contain a triliteral Watad see
supra i  with either two biliteral Sabab khaff i  or a
quadriliteral Fsilah i  They are therefore called Sab  seven
lettered

iii The same principle of the Watad taking precedence over Sabab and
Fsilah rules the arrangement of the Arabic metres which are divided
into five circles Dawir pl of Dirah so called for reasons
presently to be explained The first is named

A Dirat alMukhtalif circle of the varied metre because it is
composed of feet of various length the fivelettered Falun supra ii
 and the sevenlettered Maflun ii  with their secondaries
Filun Mustafilun and Filtun ii  and it comprises three
Buhr or metres pl of Bahr sea the Tawl Madd and Bast

 AlTawl consisting of twice

                Falun Maflun Falun Maflun

the classical scheme for which would be

                                   

If we transfer the Watad Fa from the beginning of the line to the end
it would read

Lunmaf Lunfa Lunmaf Lunfa which after the substitutions
indicated above ii  and  becomes

 AlMadd consisting of twice

                Filtun Filun Filtun Filun

which may be represented by the classical scheme

                                   

If again returning to the Tawl we make the break after the Watad of
the second foot we obtain the line

lunfa Lunmaf lunfau Lunmaf and as metrically lunfa
two Sabab followed by Watad and Lunmaf one Sabab followed by Watad
are  lunmaf and Lunfa respectively their Tafil is effected by
the same substitutions as in ii  and  and they become

 Bast consisting of twice

              Mustafilun Filun Mustafilun Filun

in conformity with the classical scheme

                                   

Thus one metre evolves from another by a kind of rotation which
suggested to the Prosodists an ingenious device of representing them by
circles hence the name Dirah round the circumference of which on the
outside the complete Tafl of the original metre is written while each
moved letter is faced by a small loop each quiescent by a small
vertical stroke inside the circle Then in the case of this
present Dirat alMukhtalif for instance the loop corresponding to the
initial f of the first Falun is marked as the beginning of the Tawl
that corresponding to its l of the Sabab lun as the beginning of the
Madid and that corresponding to the Ayn of the next Maflun as the
beginning of the Bast The same process applies to all the following
circles but our limited space compels us simply to enumerate them
together with their Buhr without further reference to the mode of
their evolution

Illustration

B Dairat alMtalif circle of the agreeing metre so called because
all its feet agree in length consisting of seven letters each It
contains

             Mufalatun Mufalatun Mufalatun ii

Its Buhr are

E Dirat alMuttafik circle of the concordant metre so called for
the same reason why circle B is called the agreeing ie because
the feet all harmonise in length being here however quinqueliteral

Ilm alArz assigns to it only one metre

 AlMutakrib twice

                Falun Falun Falun Falun ii

The feet and metres as given above are however to a certain extent
merely theoretical in practice the former admit of numerous licenses
and the latter of variations brought about by modification or partial
suppression of the feet final in a verse An Arabic poem Kasdah or if
numbering less than ten couplets Katah consists of Bayts or couplets
bound together by a continuous rhyme which connects the first two lines
and is repeated at the end of every second line throughout the poem The
last foot of every odd line is called Arz fem in contradistinction
of Arz in the sense of Prosody which is masc pl Airiz that of
every even line is called Zarb pl Azrub and the remaining feet may be
termed Hashw stuffing although in stricter parlance a further
distinction is made between the first foot of every odd and even line
as well

Now with regard to the Hashw on the one hand and the Aruz and Zarb on
the other the changes which the normal feet undergo are of two kinds
Zuhf deviation and Illah defect Zuhf applies as a rule
occasionally and optionally to the second letter of a Sabab in those
feet which compose the Hashw or bodypart of a verse making a long
syllable short by suppressing its quiescent final or contracting two
short quantities in a long one by rendering quiescent a moved letter
which stands second in a Sabab sakl In Mustafilun ii      
for instance the s of the first syllable or the f of the second or
both may be dropped and it will become accordingly Mutafilun by
substitution Mafilun     or Mustailun by substitution
Muftailun     or Mutailun by substitution Failatun   
 This means that wherever the foot Mustafilun occurs in the
Hashw of a poem we can represent it by the scheme     ie the
Epitritus tertius can by poetical license change into Diiambus
Choriambus or Paeon quartus In Mufalatun ii        and
Mutafilun ii        again the Sabab ala and muta may
become khaff by suppression of their final Harakah and thus turn into
Mufaltun by substitution Maflun ii       and
Mutfilun by substitution Mustafilun ii       as above In
other words the two feet correspond to the schemes       and   
   where a Spondee can take the place of the Anapaest after or
before the Iambus respectively

Illah the second way of modifying the primitive or normal feet
applies to both Sabab and Watad but only in the Aruz and Zarb of a
couplet being at the same time constant and obligatory Besides the
changes already mentioned it consists in adding one or two letters to a
Sabab or Watad or curtailing them more or less even to cutting them
off altogether We cannot here exhaust this matter any more than those
touched upon until now but must be satisfied with an example or two to
show the proceeding in general and indicate its object

We have seen that the metre Bast consists of the two lines

               Mustafilun Filun Mustafilun Filun
               Mustafilun Filun Mustafilun Filun

This complete form however is not in use amongst Arab poets If by the
Zuhf Khabn here acting as Illah the Alif in the final Filun is
suppressed changing it into Failun    it becomes the first
Aruz called makhbnah of the Bast the first Zarb of which is
obtained by submitting the final Filun of the second line to the same
process A second Zarb results if in Filun the final n of the Watad
ilun is cut off and the preceding l made quiescent by the Illah Kat
thus giving Fil and by substitution Falun   Thus the formula
becomes

               Mustafilun Filun Mustafilun  Failun

               Mustafilun Filun Mustafilun   Failun
                                                 Falun

As in the Hashw ie the first three feet of each line the Khabn can
likewise be applied to the medial Filun and for Mustafilun the
poetical licenses explained above may be introduced this first Arz
or Class of the Bast with its two Zarb or subdivisions will be
represented by the scheme

                                      
                                   

                                         
                                   

that is to say in the first subdivision of this form of the Bast both
lines of each couplet end with an Anapaest and every second line of the
other subdivision terminates in a Spondee

The Bast has four more Ariz three called majzah because each line
is shortened by a Juz or foot one called mashtrah halved because
the number of feet is reduced from four to two and we may here notice
that the former kind of lessening the number of feet is frequent with
the hexametrical circles B C D while the latter kind can naturally
only occur in those circles whose couplet forms an octameter A E
Besides being majzah the second Aruz is sahhah perfect consisting
of the normal foot Mustafilun It has three Azrub  Mustafiln  
  with an overlong final syllable see supra p  produced by the
Illah Tazyl ie addition of a quiescent letter at the end
Mustafilunn by substitution Mustafiln  Mustafilun like the
Aruz  Maflun    produced by the Illah Kat see the
preceding page Mustafilun by dropping the final n and making the l
quiescent becomes Mustafil and by substitution Maflun Hence the
formula is

                 Mustafilun Filun Mustafilun
                                          Mustafiln
                     Mustafilun Filun  Mustafilun
                                          Maflun

which with its allowable licenses may be represented by the scheme

                                   
                                   
                                         
                                           
                                       
                                
                                          

The above will suffice to illustrate the general method of the
Prosodists and we must refer the reader for the remaining classes and
subdivisions of the Bast as well as the other metres to more special
treatises on the subject to which this Essay is intended merely as an
introduction with a view to facilitate the first steps of the student
in an important but I fear somewhat neglected field of Arabic learning

If we now turn to the poetical pieces contained in The Nights we find
that out of the fifteen metres known to alKhall or the sixteen of
later Prosodists instances of thirteen occur in the Mac N edition
but in vastly different proportions The total number amounts to 
pieces some however repeated several times out of which 
belong to the first two circles leaving only  for the remaining
three The same disproportionality obtains with regard to the metres of
each circle The Mukhtalif is represented by  instances of Tawl and
 of Bast against  of Madd the Mutalif by  instances of Kmil
against  of Wfir the Mujtalab by  instances of Ramal and  of
Rajaz against  of Hazaj the Mushtabih by  instances of Khaff and 
of Sar against  of Munsarih and  of Mujtass and lastly the
Muttafik by  instances of Mutakrib Neither the Mutadrak E  nor
the Muzri and Muktazib D   are met with

Finally it remains for me to quote a couplet of each metre showing how
to scan them and what relation they bear to the theoretical formulas
exhibited on p  to p 

It is characteristic for the preponderance of the Tawl over all the
other metres that the first four lines with which my alphabetical list
begins are written in it One of these belongs to a poem which has for
its author Bah alDn Zuhayr born AD  at Mekkah or in its
vicinity ob  at Cairo and is to be found in full in Professor
Palmers edition of his works p  Sir Richard Burton translates the
first Bayt vol i 

 An I quit Cairo and her pleasances  Where can I hope to find so
    gladsome ways

Professor Palmer renders it

               Must I leave Egypt where such joys abound
                   What place can ever charm me so again

In Arabic it scans

                                     
               Aarhalu an Misrin wa tbi namihi
                                     
               Faayyu maknin badah liya shiku

In referring to iii A I p  it will be seen that in the Hashw
Falun    has become Falu    by a Zuhf called Kabz
suppression of the fifth letter of a foot if it is quiescent and that
in the Arz and Zarb Maflun     has changed into Mafilun 
   by the same Zuhf acting as Illah The latter alteration shows
the couplet to be of the second Zarb of the first Arz of the Tawl If
the second line did terminate in Maflun as in the original scheme
it would be the first Zarb of the same Arz if it did end in Falun
   or Mafl    it would represent the third or fourth
subdivision of this first class respectively The Tawl has one other
Arz Falun with a twofold Zarb either Falun also or Mafilun

The first instance of the Bast occurring in The Nights are the lines
translated vol i p 

 Containeth Time a twain of days this of blessing that of bane  And
    holdeth Life a twain of halves this of pleasure that of pain

In Arabic Mac N i 

                              
             AlDahru yaumni z amnun wa z hazaru
                              
             Wa lAyshu shatrni z safwun wa z kadaru

Turning back to p  where the Arz and Azrub of the Bast are
shown the student will have no difficulty to recognise the Bayt as one
belonging to the first Zarb of the first Arz

As an example of the Madd we quote the original of the lines vol v


 I had a heart and with it lived my life  Twas seared with fire and
    burnt with lovinglowe

They read in Arabic

                                 
                     Kna l kalbun ashu bihi
                                
                     Faktaw bilnri wahtarak

If we compare this with the formula iii A  p  we find that
either line of the couplet is shortened by a foot it is therefore
majz The first Arz of this abbreviated metre is Filtun    
and is called sahhah perfect because it consists of the normal third
foot In the second Arz Filtun loses its end syllable tun by the
Illah Hafz suppression of a final Sabab khaff and becomes Fil 
  for which Filun is substituted Shortening the first syllable of
Filun ie eliminating the Alif by Khabn we obtain the third Arz
Failun    as that of the present lines which has two Azrub
Failun like the Arz and Falun   here again by Khabn further
reduced to Faal  

Ishak of Mosul who improvises the piece calls it so difficult and so
rare that it went nigh to deaden the quick and to quicken the dead
indeed the native poets consider the metre Madd as the most difficult
of all and it is scarcely ever attempted by later writers This
accounts for its rare occurrence in The Nights where only two more
instances are to be found Mac N ii  and iii 

The second and third circle will best be spoken of together as the
Wfir and Kmil have a natural affinity to the Hazaj and Rajaz Let us
revert to the line

                                 
                    Akm lwajda f kalb wa sr

Translated as it were into the language of the Prosodists it will be

                   Maflun Maflun Falun

and this standing by itself might prima facie be taken for a line of
the Hazaj iii C  with the third Maflun shortened by Hafz see
above into Maf for which Falun would be substituted We have seen
p  that and how the foot Mufalatun can change into Maflun
and if in any poem which otherwise would belong to the metre Hazaj the
former measure appears even in one foot only along with the latter it
is considered to be the original measure and the poem counts no longer
as Hazaj but as Wfir In the piece now under consideration it is the
second Bayt where the characteristic foot of the Wfir first appears

                               
                 Naat annlrubu wa skinh

                                
                 Wa kad bauda lmazru fal mazru

Anglic vol iii 

 Far lies the camp and those who camp therein  Far is her tentshrine
    where I neer shall tent

It must however be remarked that the Hazaj is not in use as a
hexameter but only with an Arz majzah or shortened by one foot
Hence it is only in the second Arz of the Wfir which is likewise
majzah that the ambiguity as to the real nature of the metre can
arise and the isolated couplet

                                 
                    Yardu lmaru an yut munhu

                                 
                    Wa yab llhu ill m yurdu

 Man wills his wish to him accorded be  But Allah naught accords save
    what he wills vol iv 

being hexametrical forms undoubtedly part of a poem in Wfir although
it does not contain the foot Mufalatun at all Thus the solitary
instance of Hazaj in The Nights is Ab Nuws abomination beginning
with

                      
             Fal tasau il ghayr

                      
             Faind madinu lkhayri Mac N ii 

 Steer ye your steps to none but me  Who have a mine of luxury vol v
    

If in the second Arz of the Wfir Maflun     is further
shortened to Mafilun     the metre resembles the second Arz
of Rajaz where as we have seen the latter foot can by license take
the place of the normal Mustafilun    

The Kmil bears a similar relation to the Rajaz as the Wfir bears to
the Hazaj By way of illustration we quote from Mac N ii  the first
two Bayts of a little poem taken from the rd Assembly of AlHariri

                               
                Y khtiba lduny ldaniyyati innah

                               
                Sharaku lrad wa karratu lakdri

                              
                Drun mat m azhakat f yaumih

                             
                Abkat ghadan budan lah min dri

In Sir Richard Burtons translation vol iii 

 O thou who woost a World unworthy learn  Tis house of evils tis
    Perditions net
 A house where whoso laughs this day shall weep  The next then perish
    house of fume and fret

The Arz of the first couplet is Mutafilun assigning the piece to
the first or perfect sahhah class of the Kmil In the Hashw of the
opening line and in that of the whole second Bayt this normal
Mutafilun has by license become Mustafilun and the same change has
taken place in the Arz of the second couplet for it is a peculiarity
which this metre shares with a few others to allow certain alterations
of the kind Zuhf in the Arz and Zarb as well as in the Hashw This
class has three subdivisions the Zarb of the first is Mutafilun like
the Arz the Zarb of the second is Faaltun     a substitution
for Mutafil which latter is obtained from Mutafilun by suppressing
the final n and rendering the l quiescent the Zarb of the third is
Falun   for Mtf derived from Mutafilun by cutting off the
Watad ilun and dropping the medial a of the remaining Mutaf

If we make the Ayn of the second Zarb Faaltun also quiescent by the
permitted Zuhf Izmr it changes into Faltun by substitution
Maflun    which terminates the rhyming lines of the foregoing
quotation Consequently the two couplets taken together belong to the
second Zarb of the first Arz of the Kmil and the metre of the poem
with its licenses may be represented by the scheme

                                              
                                  

                                              
                                   

Taken isolated on the other hand the second Bayt might be of the metre
Rajaz whose first Arz Mustafilun has two Azrub one equal to the
Arz the other Maflun as above but here substituted for Mustafil
after applying the Illah Kat see p  to Mustafilun If this were
the metre of the poem throughout the scheme with the licenses peculiar
to the Rajaz would be

                                           
                                     

                                            
                                      

The pith of AlHariris Assembly is that the knight errant not to say
the arrant wight of the Romance Ab Sayd of Sarj accuses before the
Wli of Baghdad his pretended pupil in reality his son to have
appropriated a poem of his by lopping off two feet of every Bayt If
this is done in the quoted lines they read

                               
                      Y khtiba lduny ldaniy

                                 
                      Yati innah sharaku lrad

                               
                      Drun mat m azhakat

                               
                      F yaumih abkat ghad

with a different rhyme and of a different variation of metre The
amputated piece belongs to the fourth Zarb of the third Aruz of Kmil
and its second couplet tallies with the second subdivision of the second
class of Rajaz

The Rajaz a iambic metre pure and simple is the most popular because
the easiest in which even the Prophet was caught napping sometimes at
the dangerous risk of following the perilous leadership of Imru lKays
It is the metre of improvisation of ditties and of numerous didactic
poems In the latter case when the composition is called Urjzah the
two lines of every Bayt rhyme and each Bayt has a rhyme of its own
This is the form in which for instance Ibn Mliks Alfyah is written
as well as the remarkable grammatical work of the modern native scholar
Nasf alYazij of which a notice will be found in Chenerys
Introduction to his Translation of AlHariri

While the Hazaj and Rajaz connect the third circle with the first and
second the Ramal forms the link between the third and fourth Dirah
Its measure Filtun     and the reversal of it Mafltu   
 affect the trochaic rhythm as opposed to the iambic of the two
firstnamed metres The iambic movement has a ring of gladness about it
the trochaic a wail of sadness the former resembles a nimble
pedestrian striding apace with an elastic step and a cheerful heart
the latter is like a man toiling along on the desert path where his
foot is ever and anon sliding back in the burning sand Raml whence
probably the name of the metre Both combined in regular alternation
impart an agitated character to the verse admirably fit to express the
conflicting emotions of a passionstirred mind

Examples of these more or less plaintive and pathetic metres are
numerous in the Tale of Uns alWujd and the Wazirs Daughter which
being throughout a story of love as has been noted vol v  abounds
in verse and in particular contains ten out of the thirtytwo
instances of Ramal occurring in The Nights We quote

Ramal first Zarb of the first Arz Mac N ii 

              
 Inna li lbulbuli sautan f lsahar

              
 Ashghala lshika an husni lwatar

 The Bulbuls note whenas dawn is nigh  Tells the lover from strains of
    strings to fly vol v 

Sar second Zarb of the first Arz Mac N ii 

              
 Wa fkhitin kad kla f nauhihi

              
 Y Diman shukran al balwat

 I heard a ringdove chanting soft and plaintively  I thank Thee O
    Eternal for this misery vol v 

Khaff full or perfect form sahh both in Zarb and Arz Mac N
ii 

               
 Y liman ashtak lgharma llaz b

               
 Wa shujn wa furkat an habb

 O to whom now of my desire complaining sore shall I  Bewail my parting
    from my fere compelld thus to fly vol v 

Mujtass the only Arz majzah sahhah ie shortened by one foot
and perfect with equal Zarb Mac N ii 

              
     Rudd alayya habb

              
     L hajatan l bimlin

     To me restore my dear  I want not wealth untold vol v 

As an instance of the Munsarih I give the second occurring in The
Nights because it affords me an opportunity to show the student how
useful a knowledge of the laws of Prosody frequently proves for
ascertaining the correct reading of a text Mac N i  we find the
line

                                 
                   Arbaatun m jtamaat kattu iz

This would be Rajaz with the license Muftailun for Mustafilun But the
following lines of the fragment evince that the metre is Munsarih
hence a clerical error must lurk somewhere in the second foot In fact
on page  of the same volume we find the piece repeated and here the
first couplet reads

               
 Arbaatun m jtamana kattu siw

               
 Al az mujhat wa safki dam

 Four things which neer conjoin unless it be  To storm my vitals and to
    shed my blood vol iii 

The Mutakrib the last of the metres employed in The Nights has gained
a truly historical importance by the part which it plays in Persian
literature In the form of trimetrical doublelines with a several
rhyme for each couplet it has become the Nibelungen stanza of the
Persian epos Firdauss immortal Book of Kings and Nizmis
Iskandernmah are written in it not to mention a host of Masnawis in
which Sufic mysticism combats Mohammedan orthodoxy On account of its
warlike and heroical character therefore I choose for an example the
knightly Jamrakns challenge to the single fight in which he conquers
his scarcely less valiant adversary Kaurajan Mac N iii 

                                 
                   An lJamraknu kawiyyn ljanni

                                 
                   Jamu lfawrisi takhsh kitl

Here the third syllable of the second foot in each line is shortened by
license and the final Kasrah of the first line standing in pause is
long the metre being the full form of the Mutakrib as exhibited p
 iii E i If we suppress the Kasrah of alJanni which is also
allowable in pause and make the second line to rhyme with the first
saying for instance

                                
                   An lJamraknu kawiyyu ljann

                                
                   Layaksh kitl shiju lzamn

we obtain the powerful and melodious metre in which the Shhnmah sings
of Rustams lofty deeds of the tender love of Rdabah and the tragic
downfall of Siyawush

Shall I confess that in writing the foregoing pages it has been my
ambition to become a conqueror in a modest way myself to conquer I
mean the prejudice frequently entertained and shared even by my
accomplished countryman Rckert that Arabic Prosody is a clumsy and
repulsive doctrine I have tried to show that it springs naturally from
the character of the language and intimately connected as it is with
the grammatical system of the Arabs it appears to me quite worthy of
the acumen of a people to whom amongst other things we owe the
invention of Algebra the steppingstone of our whole modern system of
Mathematics I cannot refrain therefore from concluding with a little
anecdote anent alKhall which Ibn Khallikn tells in the following
words His son went one day into the room where his father was and on
finding him scanning a piece of poetry by the rules of prosody he ran
out and told the people that his father had lost his wits They went in
immediately and related to alKhall what they had heard on which he
addressed his son in these terms

Had you known what I was saying you would have excused me and had you
known what you said I should have blamed you But you did not
understand me so you blamed me and I knew that you were ignorant so I
pardoned you


                                LEnvoi

Here end to my sorrow the labours of a quartercentury and here I must
perforce say with the poets Poet

             Behold I see the haven nigh at hand
             To which I mean my wearie course to bend
             Vere the main shete and bear up with the land
             The which afore is fairly to be kend

Nothing of importance now indeed remains for me but briefly to estimate
the character of my work and to take cordial leave of my readers
thanking them for the interest they have accorded to these volumes and
for enabling me thus successfully to complete the decade

Without pudor malus or overdiffidence I would claim to have fulfilled
the promise contained in my Foreword The anthropological notes and
notelets which not only illustrate and read between the lines of the
text but assist the student of Moslem life and of AraboEgyptian
manners customs and language in a multitude of matters shunned by
books form a repertory of Eastern knowledge in its esoteric phase
sexual as well as social

To assert that such lore is unnecessary is to state as every traveller
knows an absurdum Few phenomena are more startling than the vision
of a venerable infant who has lived half his long life in the midst of
the wildest anthropological vagaries and monstrosities and yet who
absolutely ignores all that India or Burmah enacts under his very eyes
This is crass ignorance not the naive innocence of Saint Francis who
seeing a man and a maid in a dark corner raised his hands to Heaven and
thanked the Lord that there was still in the world so much of Christian
Charity

Against such lack of knowledge my notes are a protest and I may claim
success despite the difficulty of the task A traveller familiar with
Syria and Palestine Herr Landberg writes La plume refuserait son
service la langue serait insuffisante si celui qui connat la vie de
tous les jours des Orientaux surtout des classes leves voulait la
devoiler LEurope est bien loin den avoir la moindre ide

In this matter I have done my best at a time too when the hapless
English traveller is expected to write like a young lady for young
ladies and never to notice what underlies the most superficial stratum
And I also maintain that the free treatment of topics usually tabood
and held to be alektaunknown and unfitted for publicitywill be a
national benefit to an Empire of Opinion whose very basis and
buttresses are a thorough knowledge by the rulers of the ruled Men have
been crowned with gold in the Capitol for lesser services rendered to
the Respublica

That the work contains errors shortcomings and many a lapsus I am the
first and foremost to declare Yet in justice to myself I must also
notice that the macul are few and far between even the most unfriendly
and interested critics have failed to point out an abnormal number of
slips And before pronouncing the Vos plaudite or as Easterns more
politely say I implore that my poor name may be raised aloft on the
tongue of praise let me invoke the fair field and courteous favour
which the Persian poet expected from his readers

                            
                            

           Veil it an fault thou find nor jibe nor jeer
           None may be found of faults and failings clear

  The fox and the jackal are confounded by the Arabic dialects not by
  the Persian whose Rubh can never be mistaken for Shaghl
  Salab among the Semites is locally applied to either beast and we
  can distinguish the two only by the fox being solitary and rapacious
  and the jackal gregarious and a carrioneater In all Hindu tales the
  jackal seems to be an awkward substitute for the Grecian and classical
  fox the Giddar or Kol Canis aureus being by no means sly and

  by is found in the Khirad Afroz i  and in the AnwariSuhayli
  chapt i and gave rise to the Persian proverb What has a monkey
  to do with carpentering It is curious to compare the Hindu with the
  Arabic work whose resemblances are as remarkable as their differences
  while even more notable is their correspondence in impressionising the
  reader The Thaumaturgy of both is the same the Indian is profuse in
  demonology and witchcraft in transformation and restoration in
  monsters as windmen firemen and watermen in airgoing elephants
  and flying horses i  in the wishing cow divine goats and
  laughing fishes i  and in the speciosa miracula of magic
  weapons He delights in fearful battles i  fought with the same
  weapons as the Moslem and rewards his heroes with a turband of
  honour i  in lieu of a robe There is a quaint family likeness
  arising from similar stages and states of society the city is adorned
  for gladness men carry money in a robecorner and exclaim Ha good
  for Good by Allah lovers die with exemplary facility the
  softsided ladies drink spirits i  and princesses get drunk i
   whilst the Eunuch the Hetaira and the bawd Kuttini play the
  same preponderating parts as in The Nights Our Brahman is strong in
  lovemaking he complains of the pains of separation in this
  phenomenal universe he revels in youth twinbrother to mirth and
  beauty which has illuminating powers he foully reviles old age and he
  alternately praises and abuses the sex concerning which more
  presently He delights in truisms the fashion of contemporary Europe
  see Palmerin of England chapt vii such as It is the fashion of
  the heart to receive pleasure from those things which ought to give
  it etc etc What is there the wise cannot understand and so forth
  He is liberal in trite reflections and frigid conceits i   
    in fact everywhere and his puns run through whole lines
  this in fine Sanskrit style is inevitable Yet some of his expressions
  are admirably terse and telling eg Ascending the swing of Doubt
  Bound together lovers by the leash of gazing Two babes looking like
  Misery and Poverty Old Age seized me by the chin A lake first
  assay of the Creators skill A vow difficult as standing on a
  swordedge My vital spirits boiled with the fire of woe Transparent
  as a good mans heart There was a certain convent full of fools
  Dazed with scripturereading The stones could not help laughing at
  him The Moon kissed the laughing forehead of the East She was like a
  wave of the Sea of Loves insolence ii  a wave of the Sea of
  Beauty tossed up by the breeze of Youth The King played dice he
  loved slavegirls he told lies he sat up o nights he waxed wroth
  without reason he took wealth wrongously he despised the good and
  honoured the bad i  with many choice bits of the same kind
  Like the Arab the Indian is profuse in personification but the
  doctrine of preexistence of incarnation and emanation and an
  excessive spiritualism ever aiming at the infinite makes his imagery
  run mad Thus we have Immoral Conduct embodied the God of Death
  Science the Svargaheaven Evening Untimeliness and the
  Earthbride while the Ace and Deuce of dice are turned into a brace
  of Demons There is also that grotesqueness which the French detect
  even in Shakespeare eg She drank in his ambrosial form with
  thirsty eyes like partridges i  and it often results from the
  comparison of incompatibles eg a row of birds likened to a garden
  of nymphs and from forced allegories the favourite figure of
  contemporary Europe Again the rhetorical Hindu style differs greatly
  from the sobriety directness and simplicity of the Arab whose motto
  is Brevity combined with precision except where the latter falls into
  fine writing And finally there is a something in the atmosphere
  of these Tales which is unfamiliar to the West and which makes them
  as more than one has remarked to me very hard reading

  work he entitled it Hazr o yek Ruz  Thousand and One Days and in

Footnote 

  This author however when hazarding a change of style which is I
  think regretable has shown abundant art by filling up the frequent
  deficiencies of the text after the fashion of Baron McGuckin de Slane
  in Ibn Khallikan As regards the tout ensemble of his work a noble
  piece of English my opinion will ever be that expressed in my
  Foreword A carping critic has remarked that the translator as may
  be seen in every page is no Arabic scholar If I be a judge the
  reverse is the case the brilliant and beautiful version thus traduced
  is almost entirely free from the blemishes and carelessness which
  disfigure Lanes and thus it is far more faithful to the original
  But it is no secret that on the staff of that journal the translator
  of Villon has sundry enemies vrais diables enjuppons who take
  every opportunity of girding at him because he does not belong to the
  clique and because he does good work when theirs is mostly sham The
  sole fault I find with Mr Payne is that his severe grace of style
  treats an unclassical work as a classic when the romantic and
  irregular would have been a more appropriate garb But this is a mere
  matter of private judgment

  There are a few but only a few frightful exceptions to this rule

  The word should have been Arianism This heresy of the early
  Christians was much aided by the Discipline of the Secret supposed
  to be of apostolic origin which concealed from neophytes catechumens
  and penitents all the higher mysteries like the Trinity the
  Incarnation the Metastoicheiosis transubstantiation the Real
  Presence the Eucharist and the Seven Sacraments when Arnobius could
  ask Quid Deo cum vino est and when Justin fearing the charge of
  Polytheism could expressly declare the inferior nature of the Son to
  the Father Hence the creed was appropriately called Symbol ie
  Sign of the Secret This mental reservation lasted till the Edict of
  Toleration issued by Constantine in the fourth century held
  Christianity secure when divulging her mysteries and it allowed
  Arianism to become the popular creed

  The beginning of which I date from the Hijrah lit  the separation
  popularly The Flight Stating the case broadly it has become the
  practice of modern writers to look upon Mohammed as an honest
  enthusiast at Meccah and an unscrupulous despot at AlMedinah a view
  which appears to me eminently unsound and unfair In a private station
  the Meccan Prophet was famed as a good citizen teste his title
  AlAmn  the Trusty But when driven from his home by the pagan
  faction he became de facto as de jure a king nay a royal pontiff
  and the preacher was merged in the Conqueror of his foes and the
  Commander of the Faithful His rule like that of all Eastern rulers
  was stained with blood but assuming as true all the crimes and
  cruelties with which Christians charge him and which Moslems confess
  they were mere blots upon a glorious and enthusiastic life ending in
  a most exemplary death compared with the tissue of horrors and havock
  which the Law and the Prophets attribute to Moses to Joshua to
  Samuel and to the patriarchs and prophets by express commandment of
  Jehovah

  however is used in the case of AlIslam And now that he might not
  stand in awe of his wives any longer down comes a revelation says
  Ockley in his bluff and homely style which admits such phrases as
  the imposter has the impudence to say But why in common honesty
  refuse to the Koran the concessions freely made to the Torah It is a

  Plato Symp is probably mystical when he accounts for such passions

  primitive man prefers men and the primitive woman women Cest beau
  butis it true The idea was probably derived from Egypt which
  supplied the Hebrews with androgynic humanity and thence it passed to
  extreme India where Shiva as Ardhanr was male on one side and
  female on the other side of the body combining paternal and maternal
  qualities and functions The first creation of humans Gen i  was

  the term bugiardoliar Bougre and Bougrerie date Littr from the

  A friend learned in these matters supplies me with the following list

  Of this peculiar character Ibn Khallikan remarks ii  There were
  four poets whose works clearly contraried their character Abu
  alAtahyah wrote pious poems himself being an atheist Ab Hukaymas
  verses proved his impotence yet he was more salacious than a hegoat
  Mohammed ibn Hzim praised contentment yet he was greedier than a
  dog and Ab Nows hymned the joys of sodomy yet he was more
  passionate for women than a baboon

Footnote 

  A virulently and unjustly abusive critique never yet injured its
  object in fact it is generally the greatest favour an authors
  unfriends can bestow upon him But to notice in a popular Review books
  which have been printed and not published is hardly in accordance with
  the established courtesies of literature At the end of my work I
  propose to write a paper The Reviewer Reviewed which will amongst
  other things explain the motif of the writer of the critique and the
  editor of the Edinburgh

  For instance I M  take thee N  to my wedded wife  to have and

  of course a defect in prose style In that delightful old French the
  Saja frequently appeared when attention was solicited for the titles
  of books eg Le Romant de la Rose ou tout lart damours est
  enclose

Footnote 

  See Gladwin loc cit p  it also is  alliteration Ibn Khall ii
  

Footnote 

  He called himself Nabiyun umm  illiterate prophet but only his
  most ignorant followers believe that he was unable to read and write
  His last words accepted by all traditionists were Aatn dawta wa
  kalam bring me inkcase and pen upon which the Shiah or Persian
  sectaries base not without probability a theory that Mohammed
  intended to write down the name of Ali as his Caliph or successor when
  Omar suspecting the intention exclaimed The Prophet is delirious
  have we not the Koran thus impiously preventing the precaution
  However that may be the legend proves that Mohammed could read and
  write even when not under inspiration The vulgar idea would arise
  from a pious intent to add miracle to the miraculous style of the
  Koran

Footnote 

  I cannot but vehemently suspect that this legend was taken from much
  older traditions We have Jubal the semimythical who by the
  different falls of his hammer on the anvil discovered by the ear the
  first rude music that pleased the antediluvian fathers Then came
  Pythagoras of whom Macrobius lib ii relates how this
  GrcoEgyptian philosopher passing by a smithy observed that the
  sounds were grave or acute according to the weights of the hammers
  and he ascertained by experiment that such was the case when different
  weights were hung by strings of the same size The next discovery was
  that two strings of the same substance and tension the one being
  double the length of the other gave the diapasoninterval or an
  eighth and the same was effected from two strings of similar length
  and size the one having four times the tension of the other
  Belonging to the same cycle of inventionanecdotes are Galileos
  discovery of the pendulum by the lustre of the Pisan Duomo and the
  kettlelid the falling apple and the copper hook which inspired Watt
  Newton and Galvani

Footnote 

  To what an absurd point this has been carried we may learn from Ibn
  Khallikn i  A poet addressing a single individual does not say
  My friend or My friends but My two friends in the dual
  because a Badawi required a pair of companions one to tend the
  sheep and the other to pasture the camels

  Clarke Prosodia Arabica and to Dr Steingasss notes infra

Footnote 

  The Hebrew grammarians of the Middle Ages wisely copied their Arab
  cousins by turning Fala into Pael and so forth

Footnote 

  Mr Lyall whose Ancient Arabic Poetry Williams and Norgate 
  I reviewed in The Academy of Oct   did the absolute reverse
  of what is required he preserved the metre and sacrificed the rhyme
  even when it naturally suggested itself For instance in the last four
  lines of No xli what would be easier than to write

  Ah sweet and soft wi thee her ways bethink thee well The day shall
     be
  When some one favoured as thyself shall find her fair and fain and
     free
  And if she swear that parting neer shall break her word of constancy

  deficient The most notable point in Arabic verse is its savage
  satire the language of excited destructiveness which characterises
  the Badawi he is keen for satire as a thirsty man for water and
  half his poetry seems to consist of foul innuendo of lampoons and of
  gross personal abuse

  If the letter preceding Ww or Y is moved by Fathah they produce the

Footnote 

  For the explanation of this name and those of the following terms see
  Terminal Essay p 

Footnote 

  This Fsilah is more accurately called sughr the smaller one there
  is another Fsilah kubr the greater consisting of four moved
  letters followed by a quiescent or of a Sabab sakl followed by a
  Watad majm But it occurs only as a variation of a normal foot not
  as an integral element in its composition and consequently no mention
  of it was needed in the text

Footnote 

  It is important to keep in mind that the seemingly identical feet 
  and   and  are distinguished by the relative positions of the
  constituting elements in either pair For as it will be seen that
  Sabab and Watad are subject to different kinds of alterations it is
  evident that the effect of such alteration upon a foot will vary if
  Sabab and Watad occupy different places with regard to each other

Footnote 

  ie vertical to the circumference

Footnote 

  This would be a Fsilah kubr spoken of in the note p 

Footnote 

  In pause that is at the end of a line a short vowel counts either as
  long or is dropped according to the exigencies of the metre In the
  Hashw the u or i of the pronominal affix for the third person sing
  masc and the final u of the enlarged pronominal plural forms humu
  and kumu may be either short or long according to the same
  exigencies The endvowel of the pronoun of the first person an I
  is generally read short although it is written with Alif

Footnote 

  On p  the word akm as read by itself was identified with the
  foot Falun Here it must be read together with the following
  syllable as akmulwaj which is Maflun

Footnote 

  Prof Palmer p  of his Grammar identifies this form of the
  Wfir when every Mufalatun of the Hashw has become Maflun with
  the second form of the Rajaz It should be Hazaj Professor Palmer was
  misled it seems by an evident misprint in one of his authorities

I make no apology for the number and extent of bibliographical and other
lists given in this Appendix they may cumber the book but they are
necessary to complete my design This has been to supply throughout the
ten volumes the young Arabist and student of Orientalism and
Anthropology with such assistance as I can render him and it is my
conviction that if with the aid of this version he will master the
original text of the Thousand Nights and a Night he will find himself
at home amongst educated men in Egypt and Syria Najd and Mesopotamia
and be able to converse with them like a gentleman not as too often
happens in AngloIndia like a Ghorwl groom With this object he
will learn by heart what instinct and inclination suggest of the
proverbs and instances the verses the jeux desprit and especially the
Koranic citations scattered about the text and my indices will enable
him to hunt up the tale or the verses which he may require for quotation
even when writing an ordinary letter to a native correspondent Thus
he will be spared the wasted labour of wading through volumes in order
to pick up a line

 CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS AND
  THEIR IMITATIONS WITH A TABLE SHOWING THE CONTENTS OF THE PRINCIPAL
               EDITIONS AND TRANSLATIONS OF THE NIGHTS

                             BY W F KIRBY

 Author of EdDimiryaht an Oriental Romance The New Arabian Nights
                                   c

The European editions of the Thousand and One Nights even excluding the
hundreds of popular editions which have nothing specially noticeable
about them are very numerous and the following Notes must I am fully
aware be incomplete though they will perhaps be found useful to
persons interested in the subject Although I believe that editions of
most of the English French and German versions of any importance have
passed through my hands I have not had an opportunity of comparing many
in other languages some of which at least may be independent editions
not derived from Galland The imitations and adaptations of The Nights
are perhaps more numerous than the editions of The Nights themselves
if we exclude mere reprints of Galland and many of them are even more
difficult of access

In the following Notes I have sometimes referred to tales by their
numbers in the Table


                    GALLANDS MS AND TRANSLATION

The first MS of The Nights known in Europe was brought to Paris by
Galland at the close of the th century and his translation was
published in Paris in twelve small volumes under the title of Les
Mille et une Nuit Contes Arabes traduits en Francois par M Galland
These volumes appeared at intervals between  and  Galland
himself died in  and it is uncertain how far he was responsible for
the latter part of the work Only the first six of the twelve vols are
divided into Nights vol  completing the story of Camaralzaman and
ending with Night  The Voyages of Sindbad are not found in Gallands
MS though he has intercalated them as Nights  between Nos  and
 It should be mentioned however that in some texts Bresl for
instance No  is placed much earlier in the series than in others

The stories in Gallands last six vols may be divided into two classes
viz those known to occur in genuine texts of The Nights and those
which do not To the first category belong Nos     and 
and some even of these are not found in Gallands own MS but were
derived by him from other sources The remaining tales Nos  do
not really belong to The Nights and strange to say although they are
certainly genuine Oriental tales the actual originals have never been
found I am inclined to think that Galland may perhaps have written
and adapted them from his recollection of stories which he himself heard
related during his own residence in the East especially as most of
these tales appear to be derived rather from Persian or Turkish than
from Arabian sources

The following Preface appeared in vol  which I translate from
Talanders German edition as the original is not before me

The two stories with which the eighth volume concludes do not properly
belong to the Thousand and One Nights They were added and printed
without the previous knowledge of the translator who had not the
slightest idea of the trick that had been played upon him until the
eighth volume was actually on sale The reader must not therefore be
surprised that the story of the Sleeper Awakened which commences vol
 is written as if Scheherazade had related it immediately after the
story of Ganem which forms the greater part of vol  Care will be
taken to omit these two stories in a new edition as not belonging to
the work

It is perhaps not to be wondered at that when the new edition was
actually published subsequently to Gallands death the condemned
stories were retained and the preface withdrawn though No  still
reads as if it followed No 

The information I have been able to collect respecting the disputed
tales is very slight I once saw a MS advertised in an auction
catalogue I think that of the library of the late Prof H H Wilson
as containing two of Gallands doubtful tales but which they were was
not stated The fourth and last volume of the MS used by Galland is
lost but it is almost certain that it did not contain any of these
tales compare Payne ix  note

The story of Zeyn Alasnam No  is derived from the same source as
that of the Fourth Durwesh in the wellknown Hindustani readingbook
the Bagh o Bahar If it is based upon this Galland has greatly altered
and improved it and has given it the whole colouring of a European
moral fairy tale

The story of Ali Baba No  is I have been told a Chinese tale It
occurs under the title of the Two Brothers and the Fortynine Dragons in
Geldarts Modern Greek Tales It has also been stated that the late
Prof Palmer met with a very similar story among the Arabs of Sinai
Payne ix 

The story of Sidi Nouman No b may have been based partly upon the
Third Shaykhs Story No c which Galland omits The feast of the
Ghools is I believe Greek or Turkish rather than Arabic in
character as vampires personified plague and similar horrors are much
commoner in the folklore of the former peoples

Many incidents of the doubtful as well as of the genuine tales are
common in European folklore versions of Nos  and  for instance
occur in Grimms Kinder und Hausmrchen and some of the doubtful tales
have their analogues in Scotts MS as will be noticed in due course

I have not seen Gallands original edition in  vols but the
StadtBibliothek of FrankfortonMain contains a copy published at La
Haye in  vols with frontispieces made up of two or more editions
as follows

Vol i ed   vols ii iii iv ed   vols v vi
viii ed   vol vii ed   vols ix to xi ed not
noted  and vol xii ed not noted 

The discrepancies in the dates of the various volumes looks as Mr
Clouston has suggested as if separate volumes were reprinted as
required independently of the others This might account for vols v
vi and viii of the fifth edition having been apparently reprinted
before vols ii iii and iv

The oldest French version in the British Museum consists of the first
eight vols published at La Haye and likewise made up of different
editions as follows

i ed   ii iii iv ed   v vi ed   vii
ed   viii suivant la copie imprime  Paris 

Most French editions old and new contain Gallands Dedication 
Madame Madame la Marquise dO Dame du Palais de Madame la Duchesse de
Bourgogne followed by an Avertissement In addition to these the La
Haye copies have Fontenelles Approbation prefixed to several volumes
but in slightly different words and bearing different dates December
th  vol i April th  vol vi and October th 
vol vii This is according to the British Museum copy I did not
examine the Frankfort copy with reference to the Approbation The
Approbation is translated in full in the old English version as follows
I have read by Order of my Lord Chancellor this Manuscript wherein I
find nothing that ought to hinder its being Printed And I am of opinion
that the Publick will be very well pleased with the Perusal of these
Oriental Stories Paris th December  apparently a misprint for
 Signed FONTENELLE

In the Paris edition of  vide infr Galland says in his
Dedication Il a fallu le faire venir de Syrie et mettre en Franois
le premier volume que voici de quatre seulement qui mont t envoyez
So also in a Paris edition in eight vols mo of  but in the
La Haye issue of  we read not quatre but six volumes The old
German edition of Talander vide infr does not contain Gallands
Dedication Epitre or Avertissement

The earliest French editions were generally in  vols or six I
possess a copy of a sixvolume edition published at Paris in  It
may be the second as the titlepage designates it as nouvelle edition
corrige

Gallands work was speedily translated into various European languages
and even now forms the original of all the numerous popular editions
The earliest English editions were in six volumes corresponding to the
first six of Galland and ending with the story of Camaralzaman nor was
it till nearly the end of the th century that the remaining half of
the work was translated into English The date of appearance of the
first edition is unknown to bibliographers Lowndes quotes an edition of
 as the oldest but the British Museum contains a set of six vols
made up of portions of the second third and fourth editions as
follows

Vols i ii ed   vols iii iv ed   and vols v vi
ed  

Here likewise the separate volumes seem to have been reprinted
independently of each other and it is not unlikely that the English
translation may have closely followed the French publication being
issued volume by volume as the French appeared as far as vol vi The
titlepage of this old edition is very quaint

ArabianNights Entertainments consisting of One thousand and one
Stories told by the Sultaness of the Indies to divert the Sultan from
the Execution of a Bloody Vow he had made to marry a Lady every day
and have her head cut off next Morning to avenge himself for the
Disloyalty of the first Sultaness also containing a better account of
the Customs Manners and Religion of the Eastern Nations viz Tartars
Persians and Indians than is to be met with in any Author hitherto
published Translated into French from the Arabian MSS by Mr Galland
of the Royal Academy and now done into English Printed for Andrew Bell
at the Cross Keys and Bible in Cornhill

The British Museum has an edition in to published in  in farthing
numbers every Monday Wednesday and Friday It extends to  numbers
forming five volumes

The various editions of the old English version appear to be rare and
the set in the British Museum is very poor The oldest edition which I
have seen containing the latter half of Gallands version is called the
th edition and was published in London in four volumes in 
Curiously enough the th edition also containing the conclusion
was published at Edinburgh in three volumes in  Perhaps it is a
reprint of a London edition published before that of  The Scotch
appear to have been fond of The Nights as there are many Scotch
editions both of The Nights and the imitations

Revised or annotated editions by Piguenit  vols London  and
Gough  vols Edinburgh  may deserve a passing notice

A new translation of Galland by Rev E Forster in five vols to
with engravings from pictures by Robert Smirke RA appeared in 
and now commands a higher price than any other edition of Galland A new
edition in vo appeared in  Most of the recent popular English
versions are based either upon Forsters or Scotts

Another translation from Galland by G S Beaumont four vols vo
appeared in  Lowndes writes Wiliam Beaumont

Among the various popular editions of later date we may mention an
edition in two vols vo published at Liverpool  and containing
Cazottes Continuation an edition published by Griffin and Co in
 to which Beckfords Vathek is appended an edition arranged for
the perusal of youthful readers by the Hon Mrs Sugden Whittaker 
Co  and Five Favourite Tales from The Arabian Nights in words
of one syllable by A  E Warner Lewis 

Some of the English editions of Galland aim at originality by arranging
the tales in a different order The cheap edition published by Dicks in
 is one instance

An English version of Galland was published at Lucknow in four vols
vo in 

I should perhaps mention that I have not noticed De Sacys Mille et
une Nuit because it is simply a new edition of Galland and I have not
seen either Destains French edition mentioned by Sir R F Burton
nor Cardonnes Continuation mentioned in Cabinet des Fes xxxvii p
 As Cardonne died in  his Continuation if genuine would be
the earliest of all

The oldest German version by Talander seems to have appeared in
volumes as the French was issued and these volumes were certainly
reprinted when required without indication of separate editions but in
slightly varied style and with alteration of dates The old German
version is said to be rarer than the French It is in twelve partssome
however being double The set before me is clearly made up of different
reprints and the first titlepage is as follows Die Tausend und eine
Nacht worinnen seltzame Arabische Historien und wunderbare
Begebenheiten benebst artigen LiebesIntriguen auch Sitten und
Gewohnheiten der Morgenlnder auf sehr anmuthige Weise erzehlet werden
Erstlich vom Hrn Galland der Knigl Academie Mitgliede aus der
Arabischen Sprache in die Franzsische und aus selbiger anitzo ins
Deutsche bersetzt Erster und Anderer Theil Mit der Vorrede Herrn
Talanders Leipzig Verlegts Moritz Georg Weidmann Sr Knigl Maj in
Hohlen und Churfrstl Durchl zu Sachsen Buchhndler Anno 
Talanders Preface relates chiefly to the importance of the work as
illustrative of Arabian manners and customs c It is dated from
Liegnitz den  Sept Anno  which fixes the approximate date of
publication of the first part of this translation Vols i and ii of
my set double vol with frontispiece are dated  and have
Talanders preface vols iii and iv divided but consecutively
paged and with only one titlepage and frontispiece and reprint of
Talanders preface are dated  vols v and vi same remarks
except that Talanders preface is here dated  are dated  vol
vii no frontispiece preface dated  is dated  vol  no
frontispiece nor preface nor does Talanders name appear on the
titlepage is dated  vols ix and x divided but consecutively
paged and with only one titlepage and frontispiece Talanders name
and preface do not appear but Gallands preface to vol ix already
mentioned is prefixed are dated  and vols xi and xii same
remarks but no preface are dated 

Gallands notes are translated but not his preface and dedication

There is a later German translation  vols vo Bremen  by
J H Voss the author of the standard German translation of Homer

The British Museum has just acquired a Portuguese translation of
Galland in  volumes As Mil e uma Noites Contos Arabes published
by Ernesto Chardron Editor Porto e Braga 

There are two editions of a modern Greek work in the British Museum
 and  published at Venice  in three small volumes
The first volume contains Galland Nos  of the table and vols ii
and iii chiefly contain the Thousand and One Days It is apparently
translated from some Italian work

Several editions in Italian Mille ed una Notte have appeared at Naples
and Milan they are said by Sir R F Burton to be mere reprints of
Galland

There are also several in Dutch one of which by C Van der Post in
 vols vo published at Utrecht in  purports I believe to be a
translation from the Arabic and has been reprinted several times The
Dutch editions are usually entitled Arabische Vertellinge A Danish
edition appeared at Copenhagen in  under the title of Prindsesses
Schehezerade Fortllinger eller de saakatle Tusende og een Nat Udgivna
paa Dansk vid Heelegaan Another by Rasmassen was commenced in 
and a third Danish work probably founded on the Thousand and One
Nights and published in  bears the title Digt og Eventyr fra
Osterland af arabiska og persischen utrykta kilder

I have seen none of these Italian Dutch or Danish editions but there
is little doubt that most if not all are derived from Gallands work

The following is the title of a Javanese version derived from one of
the Dutch editions and published at Leyden in  Eenige
Vertellingen uit de Arabisch duizend en n Nacht Naar de Nederduitsche
vertaling in het Javaansch vertaald door WinterRoorda

Mr A G Ellis has shown me an edition of Gallands Aladdin No 
in Malay by M Van der Lawan  printed in Batavia AD 


   CAZOTTES CONTINUATION AND THE COMPOSITE EDITIONS OF THE ARABIAN
                                NIGHTS

We shall speak elsewhere of the Cabinet des Fes but the last four
volumes of this great collection  to  published at Geneva from
 to  contain a work entitled Les Veilles du Sultan Schahriar
avec la Sultane Scheherazade histoires incroyables amusantes et
morales traduites de larabe par M Cazotte et D Chavis Faisant suite
aux Mille et une Nuits Some copies bear the abridged title of La
suite des Mille et une Nuits Contes Arabes traduits par Dom Chavis et
M Cazotte

This collection of tales was pronounced to be spurious by many critics
and even has been styled a barefaced forgery by a writer in the
Edinburgh Review of July  It is however certain that the
greater part if not all of these tales are founded on genuine Eastern
sources though very few have any real claim to be regarded as actually
part of the Thousand and One Nights

Translations of the originals of most of these tales have been published
by Caussin de Perceval and Gauttier and a comparison clearly shows the
great extent to which Chavis and Cazotte have altered amplified and in
a literary sense improved their materials

It is rather surprising that no recent edition of this work seems to
have been issued perhaps owing to the persistent doubts cast upon its
authenticity only a few of the tales and those not the best having
appeared in different collections My friend Mr A G Ellis himself
an Oriental scholar has remarked to me that he considers these tales as
good as the old Arabian Nights and I quite agree with him that Chavis
and Cazottes Continuation is well worthy of republication in its
entirety

The following are the principal tales comprised in this collection
those included in our Table from later authors being indicated

 The Robber Caliph or the Adventures of Haroun Alraschid with the
Princess of Persia and the beautiful Zutulbe No 

 The Power of Destiny being the History of the Journey of Giafar to
Damas containing the Adventures of Chelih and his Family No 

 History of Halechalbe and the Unknown Lady No c

 Story of Xailoun the Idiot

 The Adventures of Simoustapha and the Princess Ilsetilsone No


 History of Alibengiad Sultan of Herak and of the False Birds of
Paradise

 History of Sinkarib and his Two Viziers No 

 History of the Family of the Schebandad of Surat

 Story of Bohetzad and his Ten Viziers No 

 Story of Habib and DorathilGoase No 

 History of the Maugraby or the Magician

Of these Nos    and  only are not positively known in the
original No  is interesting as it is the seed from which Southeys
Thalaba the Destroyer was derived

On the word Maugraby which means simply Moor Cazotte has the following
curious note Ce mot signifie barbare barbaresque plus proprement On
jure encore par lui en Provence en Languedoc et en Gascogne Maugraby
ou ailleurs en France Meugrebleu

The Domdaniel where Zatanai held his court with Maugraby and his
pupilmagicians is described as being under the sea near Tunis In
Weils story of Joodar and Mahmood No  the magician Mahmood is
always called the Moor of Tunis

No   our No c contains the additional incident of the door
opened only once a year which occurs in our No a aa

Moore probably took the name Namouna from Cazottes No  in which it
occurs In the same story we find a curious name of a Jinniyah
Setelpedour Can it be a corruption of Sitt El Budoor

For further remarks on Cazottes Continuation compare Russells History
of Aleppo i p  and Russell and Scott Ouseleys Oriental
Collections i pp   ii p  and the Gentlemans Magazine
for February 

An English version under the title Arabian Tales or a Continuation of
the Arabian Nights Entertainments translated by Robert Heron was
published in Edinburgh in  in  vols and in London in  in 
vols It was reprinted in Webers Tales of the East Edinburgh 
and as already mentioned is included in an edition of the Arabian
Nights published in Liverpool in 

A German translation forms vols  to  of the Blaue Bibliothek
published in Gotha in  and  and the British Museum possesses
vols  and  of a Russian edition published at Moscow in  and
 which is erroneously entered in the catalogue as the Arabian
Nights in Russian

Respecting the work of Chavis and Cazotte Sir R F Burton remarks
Dom Dennis Chavis was a Syrian priest of the order of Saint Bazil who
was invited to Paris by the learned minister Baron Arteuil and he was
assisted by M Cazotte a French author then well known but wholly
ignorant of Arabic These tales are evidently derived from native
sources the story of Bohetzad King Bakhtiyar and his Ten Wazirs is
taken bodily from the Bres Edit not so but the original Arabic had
long been known in the French libraries As regards the style and
treatment it is sufficient to say that the authors outGallanded
Galland while Heron exaggerates every fault of his original

The first enlarged edition of Galland in French was published by Caussin
de Perceval at Paris in  vols vo  In addition to Gallands
version he added four tales Nos a   and  with which he
had been furnished by Von Hammer He also added a series of tales
derived from MSS in the Parisian libraries most of which correspond to
those of Cazotte

The most important of the later French editions was published by E
Gauttier in  vols in  it contains much new matter At the end
the editor gives a list of all the tales which he includes with
arguments He has rather oddly distributed his material so as to make
only  nights The full contents are given in our Table the following
points require more special notice Vol i Gauttier omits the Third
Shaykhs story No c on account of its indecency although it is
really no worse than any other story in The Nights In the story of the
Fisherman he has fallen into a very curious series of errors He has
misunderstood King Yunans reference to King Sindbad Burton i p 
to refer to the Book of Sindibad No  and has confounded it with
the story of the Forty Vazirs which he says exists in Arabic as well as
in Turkish Of this latter therefore he gives an imperfect version
embedded in the story of King Yunan No a Here it may be observed
that another imperfect French version of the Forty Vazirs had previously
been published by Petis de la Croix under the title of Turkish Tales A
complete German version by Dr Walter F A Behrnauer was published at
Leipzig in  and an English version by Mr E J W Gibb has

Vol ii After No  Gauttier places versions of Nos  and  by
Langls The Mock Caliph is here called AlyChah The other three tales
given by Caussin de Perceval from Von Hammers MSS are omitted by
Gauttier Vol v after No  concludes with two additional tales
Nos h and  from Scotts version But the titles are changed
No h being called the Story of the Young Prince and the Green Bird
and No  the Story of Mahmood although there is another story of
Mahmood in vol i  No m included as part of the Forty Vazirs

Vol vi includes the Ten Vazirs No  derived however not from
the Arabic but from the Persian Bakhtyar Nameh Three of the
subordinate tales in the Arabic version are wanting in Gauttiers and
another is transferred to his vol vii but he includes one the King
and Queen of Abyssinia No  which appears to be wanting in the
Arabic The remainder of the volume contains tales from Scotts version
the title of Mazin of Khorassaun No  being altered to the Story of
Azem and the Queen of the Genii

Vol vii contains a series of tales of which different versions of six
only Nos      and  were previously published
Though these have no claim to be considered part of The Nights they are
of sufficient interest to receive a passing mention especially as
Gauttiers edition seems not to have been consulted by any later writer
on The Nights except Habicht who based his own edition mainly upon it
Those peculiar to Gauttiers edition are therefore briefly noticed

Princess Ameny No A princess who leaves home disguised as a
man and delivers another princess from a black slave The episode
b is a story of enchantment similar to Nos ac

Aly Djohary No Story of a young mans expedition in search of a
magical remedy

The Princes of Cochin China No The princes travel in search of
their sister who is married to a Jinni who is under the curse of
Solomon The second succeeds in breaking the spell and thus rescues
both his brother his sister and the Jinni by killing a bird to which
the destiny of the last is attached This incident is common in
fiction we find it in the genuine Nights in Nos a and 

The Wife with Two Husbands No A wellknown Eastern story it
may be found in Wells Mehemet the Kurd pp  taken from the
Forty Vazirs Compare Gibbs the th Vazirs Story pp 

The Favourite No One of the ordinary tales of a man smuggled
into a royal harem in a chest compare Nos b and 

Youssouf and the Indian Merchant No Story of a ruined man
travelling to regain his fortune

Prince Benazir No Story of a Prince promised at his birth and
afterwards given up by his parents to an evil Jinni whom he ultimately
destroys Such promises especially as here in cases of difficult
labour are extremely common in folktales the idea probably originated
in the dedication of a child to the Gods Gauttier thinks that this
story may have suggested that of Maugraby to Cazotte but it appears to
me rather doubtful whether it is quite elaborate enough for Cazotte to
have used it in this manner

Selim Sultan of Egypt No This and its subordinate tales
chiefly relate to unfaithful wives that of Adileh No b is
curious she is restored to life by Jesus whom Gauttier from motives
of religious delicacy turns into a Jinni to console her disconsolate
husband and immediately betrays the latter These tales are apparently
from the Forty Vazirs cf Gibbs the th Vazirs Story pp  
our No  and the Sixth Vazirs Story pp   No b

The bulk of the tales in Gauttiers vol vii are derived from
posthumous MSS of M Langls and several have never been published in
English Gauttiers version of Heycar No  was contributed by M
Agoub

The best known modern German version Tausend und Eine Nacht Arabische
Erzahlungen Deutsch von Max Habicht Fr H von der Hagen und Carl
Schall Breslau  vols mo is mainly based upon Gauttiers edition
but with extensive additions chiefly derived from the Breslau text An
important feature of this version is that it includes translations of
the prefaces of the various editions used by the editors and therefore
supplies a good deal of information not always easily accessible
elsewhere There are often brief notes at the end of the volumes

The fifth edition of Habichts version is before me dated  but the
preface to vol i is dated  which maybe taken to represent the
approximate date of its first publication The following points in the
various vols may be specially noticed

Vol i commences with the preface of the German editor setting forth
the object and scope of his edition and the prefaces of Gauttier and
Galland follow No c omitted by Gauttier is inserted in its place
Vols ii and iii No  notes chiefly from Langls are appended
to the Voyages of Sindbad and the destinations of the first six are
given as follows

   I Voyage to Sumatra

  II Voyage to Ceylon

 III Voyage to Selahath

  IV Voyage to the Sunda Islands

   V Voyage to the Sunda Islands

  VI Voyage to Zeilan

Vol v contains an unimportant notice from Galland with additional
remarks by the German editors respecting the division of the work into
Nights

Vol vi contains another unimportant preface respecting Nos  and


Vol x Here the preface is of more importance relating to the contents
of the volume and especially to the Ten Vazirs No 

Vol xi contains tales from Scott The preface contains a full account
of his MSS and the tales published in his vol vi This preface is
taken partly from Ouseleys Oriental Collections and partly from
Scotts own preface

Vol xii contains tales from Gauttier vol vii The preface gives the
full contents of Clarkes and Von Hammers MSS

Vol xiii includes Caussin de Percevals Preface the remaining tales
from Gauttiers vol vii ending with Night  and four tales from
Caussin which Gauttier omits Nos a   and 

Vols xiv and xv extending from Night  to Night  consist of
tales from the Breslau edition to which a short preface signed by Dr
Max Habicht is prefixed The first of these tales is a fragment of the
important Romance of Seyf Zul Yesn so often referred to by Lane which
seems to have been mixed with Habichts MS of The Nights by mistake
Compare Payne Tales iii 

In this fragment we have several incidents resembling The Nights there
is a statue which sounds an alarm when an enemy enters a city cf Nos
 and  Seyf himself is converted to the faith of Abraham and
enters a city where a book written by Japhet is preserved The text of
this story has lately been published and Sir R F Burton informs me
that he thinks he has seen a complete version in some European language
but I have not succeeded in obtaining any particulars concerning it

On account of the interest and importance of the work I append to this
section an English version of the fragment translated into German by
Habicht From the extreme simplicity of the style which I have
preserved I suspect that the translation is considerably abridged

There is an Icelandic version of The Nights sund og ein Nott
Arabiskar Sgur Kaupmannahfn   vols roy vo which contains
Gallands tales and a selection of others distributed into 
Nights and apparently taken chiefly from Gauttier but with the
addition of two or three which seem to be borrowed from Lane Nos a
  c It is possibly derived immediately from some Danish
edition

There is one popular English version which may fairly be called a
composite edition but it is not based upon Gauttier This is the
Select Library Edition Arabian Nights Entertainments selected and
revised for general use To which are added other specimens of Eastern
Romance London James Burns   vols

It contains the following tales from The Nights Nos    
       a c    

No  is called the City of Silence instead of the City of Brass and
is certainly based partly upon Lane In No  Manar Al Sana is called
Nur Al Nissa One story The Wicked Dervise is taken from Dows
Persian Tales of Inatulla another The Enchanters or the Story of
Misnar is taken from the Tales of the Genii Four other tales
Jalaladdeen of Bagdad The two Talismans The Story of Haschem
and Jussof the Merchant of Balsora clearly German imitations are
said to be translated from the German of Grimm and there are two
others Abdullah and Balsora and The King and his Servant the
origin of which I do not recognise although I think I have read the
last before

Grimms story of Haschem concludes with the heros promotion to the
post of Grand Vizier to Haroun AlRashid in consequence of the desire
of the aged Giafar to end his days in peaceful retirement The
principal incident in Jalaladdeen is that of the Old Woman in the
Chest borrowed from the wellknown story of the Merchant Abudah in the
Tales of the Genii and it is thus an imitation of an imitation


 THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE STORY OF SAIF ZUL YEZN ZUL YAZAN ACCORDING
                     TO HABICHTS GERMAN VERSION

In very ancient times long before the age of Mohammed there lived a
King of Yemen named Zul Yezn He was a Himyarite of the race of Fubbaa
Tabb and had large armies and a great capital His Minister was
named Yottreb Yathrab  Medinat and was well skilled in the knowledge
of the ancients He once had a vision in which the name of the Prophet
was revealed to him with the announcement of his mission in later
times and he was also informed that he would be the last of the
Prophets In consequence of this vision he believed in the Prophet
before his advent but he concealed his faith One day the King held a
review of his troops and was delighted with their number and handsome
appearance He said to the Wazir Is there any person on earth whose
power can compare with mine O yes answered the Wazir there is
King BaalBeg whose troops fill the deserts and the cultivated lands
the plains and the valleys I must make war upon him then exclaimed
the King and destroy his power He immediately ordered the army to
prepare to march and after a few days the drums and trumpets were
heard The King and his Wazir set forth in magnificent array and after
a rapid march they arrived before the holy city Medina which may God
keep in high renown The Wazir then said to the King Here is the holy
house of God and the place of great ceremonies No one should enter
here who is not perfectly pure and with head and feet bare Pass around
it with your companions according to the custom of the Arabs The King
was so pleased with the place that he determined to destroy it to carry
the stones to his own country and to rebuild it there that the Arabs
might come to him on pilgrimage and that he might thus exalt himself
above all Kings He pondered over this plan all night but next morning
he found his body fearfully swollen He immediately sent for his Wazir
and lamented over his misfortune This is a judgment sent upon you
replied the Wazir by the Lord of this house If you alter your
intention of destroying the temple you will be healed at once The
King gave up his project and soon found himself cured Soon afterwards
he said to himself This misfortune happened to me at night and left
me next day of its own accord but I will certainly destroy the house
But next morning his face was so covered with open ulcers that he could
no longer be recognised The Wazir then approached him and said O
King renounce your intention for it would be rebellion against the
Lord of Heaven and Earth who can destroy every one who opposes him
When the King heard this he reflected awhile and said What would you
wish me to do The Wazir replied Cover the house with carpets from
Yemen The King resolved to do this and when night came he retired to
rest He then saw an apparition which ordered him not to march further
into the country of King BaalBeg but to turn towards Abyssinia and
Nigritia adding Remain there and choose it as thy residence and
assuredly one of thy race will arise through whom the threat of Noah
shall be fulfilled When the King awoke next morning he related this to
the Wazir who advised him to use his own judgment about it The King
immediately gave orders to march The army set forth and after ten days
they arrived at a country the soil of which seemed to consist of chalk
for it appeared quite white The Wazir Yottreb then went to the King and
requested his permission to found a city here for his people Why so
asked the King Because replied the Wazir this will one day be the
place of Refuge of the Prophet Mohammed who will be sent at the end of
time The King then gave his consent and Yottreb immediately summoned
architects and surveyors who dug out the ground and reared the walls
and erected beautiful palaces They did not desist from the work until
the Wazir ordered a number of his people to remove to this city with
their families This was done and their posterity inhabit the city to
this day He then gave them a scroll and said He who comes to you as
a fugitive to this house will be the ruler of this city He then called
the city Yottreb after his own name and the scroll descended from
father to son till the Apostle of God arrived as a fugitive from Mecca
when the inhabitants went out to meet him and presented him with it
They afterwards became his auxiliaries and were known as the Ansar But
we must now return to King Zul Yezn He marched several days towards
Abyssinia and at last arrived in a beautiful and fertile country where
he informed his Wazir that he would like to build a city for his
subjects He gave the necessary orders which were diligently executed
canals were dug and the surrounding country cultivated and the city was
named Medinat ElHamra the Red At last the news reached the King of
Abyssinia whose name was Saif ArRaad Thundersword and whose
capital was called Medinat adDurr the Rich in Houses Part of this
city was built on solid land and the other was built in the sea This
prince could bring an army of  men into the field and his
authority extended to the extremity of the then known world When he was
informed of the invasion of Zul Yezn he summoned his two Wazirs who
were named Sikra Divas and ArRyf The latter was well versed in ancient
books in which he had discovered that God would one day send a Prophet
who would be the last of the series He believed this himself but
concealed it from the Abyssinians who were still worshippers of Saturn
When the Wazirs came before the King he said to them See how the
Arabs are advancing against us I must fight them Sikra Divas opposed
this design fearing lest the threat of Noah should be fulfilled I
would rather advise you said he to make the King a present and to
send with it the most beautiful maiden in your palace But give her
poison secretly and instruct her to poison the King when she is alone
with him If he is once dead his army will retire without a battle
The King adopted this advice and prepared rich presents and summoned a
beautiful girl whose artfulness and malice were well known Her name
was Kamrya Moonlight The King said to her I have resolved to send
you as a present for a secret object I will give you poison and when
you are alone with the Prince to whom I will send you drop it into his
cup and let him take it As soon as he is dead his army will leave us
in peace Very well my master replied the girl I will accomplish
your wish He then sent her with the other presents and a letter to the
city of Zul Yezn But the Wazir ArRyf had scarcely left the Kings
presence when he wrote a letter and commanded a slave to carry it to
Zul Yezn If you can give it to him before the arrival of the
slavegirl added he I will give you your freedom The slave made
all possible haste to the Arab King but yet the presents arrived before
him A chamberlain went to the King and informed him that a messenger
had arrived at the gate with presents from the King of Abyssinia and
requested permission to enter Zul Yezn immediately ordered that he
should be admitted and the presents and the maiden were at once
delivered to him When he saw her he was astonished at her beauty and
was greatly delighted He immediately ordered her to be conveyed to his
palace and was very soon overcome with love for her He was just about
to dissolve the assembly to visit Kamrya when the Wazir Yottreb
detained him saying Delay a while O King for I fear there is some
treachery hidden behind this present The Abyssinians hate the Arabs
exceedingly but are unwilling to make war with them lest the threat of
Noah should be fulfilled It happened one day that Noah was sleeping
when intoxicated with wine and the wind uncovered him His son Ham
laughed and did not cover him but his other son Seth sic came
forward and covered him up When Noah awoke he exclaimed to Ham May
God blacken thy face But to Seth he said May God make the posterity
of thy brother the servants of thine until the day of Resurrection
This is the threat which they dread as the posterity of Ham While the
King was still conversing with his Wazir the Chamberlain announced the
arrival of a messenger with a letter He was immediately admitted and
delivered the letter which was read by the Wazir Yottreb ArRyf had
written Be on your guard against Kamrya O King for she hath poison
with her and is ordered to kill you when she is alone with you The
King now began loudly to praise the acuteness of his Wazir and went
immediately to Kamrya with his drawn sword When he entered she rose
and kissed the ground but he exclaimed You have come here to poison
me She was confounded and took out the poison and handed it to the
King full of artifice and thinking If I tell him the truth he will
have a better opinion of me and if he confides in me I can kill him in
some other manner than with this poison It fell out as she expected
for the King loved her gave her authority over his palace and his
female slaves and found himself very happy in her possession But she
herself found her life so pleasant that although King ArRaad
frequently sent to ask her why she had not fulfilled her commission she
always answered Wait a little I am seeking an opportunity for the
King is very suspicious Some time passed over and at length she
became pregnant Six months afterwards Zul Yezn fell ill and as his
sickness increased he assembled the chief men of his Court informed
them of the condition of Kamrya and after commending her to their
protection he ordered that if she bore a son he should succeed him
They promised to fulfil his commands and a few days afterwards Zul Yezn
died Kamrya now governed the country till she brought forth a son He
was a child of uncommon beauty and had a small mole on his cheek When
she saw the child she envied him and said to herself What shall he
take away the kingdom from me No it shall never be and from this
time forward she determined to put him to death After forty days the
people requested to see their King She showed him to them and seated
him on the throne of the kingdom whereupon they did homage to him and
then dispersed His mother took him back into the Palace but her envy
increased so much that she had already grasped a sword to kill him when
her nurse entered and asked what she was going to do I am about to
kill him answered she Have you not reflected said the nurse that
if you kill him the people will revolt and may kill you also Let me
kill him persisted she for even should they kill me too I should at
least be released from my envy Do not act thus warned the nurse
or you may repent it when repentance cannot help you It must be
done said Kamrya Nay then said the nurse if it cannot be
avoided let him at least be cast into the desert and if he lives so
much the better for him but if he dies you are rid of him for ever
She followed this advice and set out on the way at night time with the
child and halted at a distance of four days journey when she sat down
under a tree in the desert She took him on her lap and suckled him
once more and then laid him on a bed putting a purse under his head
containing a thousand gold pieces and many jewels Whoever finds him
said she may use the money to bring him up and thus she left him

It happened by the gracious decree of God that hunters who were chasing
gazelles surprised a female with a fawn the former took to flight and
the hunters carried off the little one When the mother returned from
the pasture and found her fawn gone she traversed the desert in all
directions in search of it and at length the crying of the deserted
child attracted her She lay down by the child and the child sucked
her The gazelle left him again to go to graze but always returned to
the little one when she was satisfied This went on till it pleased God
that she should fall into the net of a hunter But she became enraged
tore the net and fled The hunter pursued her and overtook her when
she reached the child and was about to give him suck But the arrival
of the hunter compelled the gazelle to take to flight and the child
began to cry because he was not yet satisfied The hunter was
astonished at the sight and when he lifted the child up he saw the
purse under his head and a string of jewels round his neck He
immediately took the child with him and went to a town belonging to an
Abyssinian king named Afrakh who was a dependent of King Saif ArRaad
He handed over the child to him saying that he had found it in the lair
of a gazelle When the King took the child into his care it smiled at
him and God awakened a feeling of love towards him in the Kings heart
and he then noticed the mole on his cheek But when his Wazir Sikar
Diun the brother of Sikar Divas who was Wazir to King Saif ArRaad
entered and saw the child God filled his heart with hate towards him
Do not believe what this man told you he said when the King told him
the wonderful story of the discovery it can only be the child of a
mother who has come by it wrongly and has abandoned it in the desert
and it would be better to kill it I cannot easily consent to this
said the King But he had hardly spoken when the palace was filled with
sounds of rejoicing and he was informed that his wife had just been
safely delivered of a child On this news he took the boy on his arm
and went to his wife and found that the newborn child was a girl and
that she had a red mole on her cheek He wondered when he saw this and
said to Sikar Diun See how beautiful they are But when the Wazir saw
it he slapped his face and cast his cap on the ground exclaiming
Should these two moles unite I prophesy the downfall of Abyssinia for
they presage a great calamity It would be better to kill either the boy
or your daughter I will kill neither of them replied the King for
they have been guilty of no crime He immediately provided nurses for
the two children naming his daughter Shama Mole and the boy
Wakhs El Fellat Lonely one or Desert and he reared them in
separate apartments that they might not see each other When they were
ten years old Wakhs El Fellat grew very strong and soon became a
practised horseman and surpassed all his companions in this
accomplishment and in feats of arms But when he was fifteen he was so
superior to all others that Sikar Diun threatened the King that he
would warn King Saif ArRaad that he was nurturing his enemy in his
house if he did not immediately banish him from the country and this
threat caused King Afrakh great alarm It happened that he had a
general who was called Gharag El Shaker Treesplitter because he was
accustomed to hurl his javelin at trees and thus to cleave them
asunder He had a fortress three days journey from the town and the
King said to him Take Wakhs El Fellat to your castle and never let
him return to this neighbourhood He added privately Look well after
him and preserve him from all injury and have him instructed in all
accomplishments The general withdrew and took the boy with him to his
castle and instructed him thoroughly in all accomplishments and
sciences One day he said to him One warlike exercise is still unknown
to you What is that said Wakhs El Fellat Come and see for
yourself replied he The general then took him to a place where
several trees were growing which were so thick that a man could not
embrace the trunk He then took his javelin hurled it at one of them
and split the trunk Wakhs El Fellat then asked for the javelin and
performed the same feat to the astonishment of his instructor Woe to
thee exclaimed he for I perceive that you are the man through whom
the threat of Noah will be fulfilled against us Fly and never let
yourself be seen again in our country or I will kill you Wakhs El
Fellat then left the town not knowing where to go He subsisted for
three days on the plants of the earth and at last he arrived at a town
encircled by high walls the gates of which were closed The inhabitants
were clothed in black and uttered cries of lamentation In the
foreground he saw a bridal tent and a tent of mourning This was the
city of King Afrakh who had reared him and the cause of the mourning of
the inhabitants was as follows Sikar Diun was very angry that the King
had refused to follow his advice and put the boy to death and had left
the town to visit one of his friends who was a magician to whom he
related the whole story What do you propose to do now asked the
magician I will attempt to bring about a separation between him and
his daughter said the Wazir I will assist you was the answer of
the magician He immediately made the necessary preparations and
summoned an evil Jinni named Mukhtatif Ravisher who inquired What do
you require of me Go quickly to the city of King Afrakh and contrive
that the inhabitants shall leave it In that age men had intercourse
with the more powerful Jinn and each attained their ends by means of
the other The Jinn did not withdraw themselves till after the advent of
the Prophet The Magician continued When the inhabitants have left the
city they will ask you what you want Then say Bring me out Shama
the daughter of your King adorned with all her jewels and I will come
tomorrow and carry her away But if you refuse I will destroy your
city and destroy you all together When Mukhtatif heard the words of
this priest of magis he did as he was commanded and rushed to the
city When Sikar Diun saw this he returned to King Afrakh to see what
would happen but he had scarcely arrived when the voice of Mukhtatif
resounded above the city The inhabitants went to the King and said
You have heard what is commanded and if you do not yield willingly
you will be obliged to do so by force The King then went weeping to
the mother of the Princess and informed her of the calamity She could
scarcely contain herself for despair and all in the palace wept at
parting from the Princess Meantime Shama was richly attired torn from
her parents and hurried to the bridal tent before the town to be
carried away by the evil Jinni The inhabitants were all assembled on
the walls of the city weeping It was just at this moment that Wakhs El
Fellat arrived from the desert and entered the tent to see what was
going on When King Afrakh who was also on the wall saw him he cried
out to him but he did not listen and dismounted fastened his horse to
a tentstake and entered Here he beheld a maiden of extraordinary
beauty and perfection but she was weeping While he was completely
bewildered by her beauty she was no less struck by his appearance Who
art thou said the maiden to him Tell me rather who art thou
returned he I am Shama the daughter of King Afrakh Thou art
Shama he exclaimed and I am Wakhs El Fellat who was reared by thy
father When they were thus acquainted they sat down together to talk
over their affairs and she took this opportunity of telling him what
had passed with the Jinni and how he was coming to carry her away O
you shall see how I will deal with him answered he but at this moment
the evil Jinni approached and his wings darkened the sun The
inhabitants uttered a terrible cry and the Jinni darted upon the tent
and was about to raise it when he saw a man there talking to the
daughter of the King Woe to thee O son of earth he exclaimed What
authority have you to sit by my betrothed When Wakhs El Fellat saw the
terrible form of the Jinni a shudder came over him and he cried to God
for aid He immediately drew his sword and struck at the Jinni who had
just extended his right hand to seize him and the blow was so violent
that it struck off the hand What you would kill me exclaimed
Mukhtatif and he took up his hand put it under his arm and flew away
Upon this there was a loud cry of joy from the walls of the city The
gates were thrown open and King Afrakh approached companied by a crowd
of people with musical instruments playing joyful music and Wakhs El
Fellat was invested with robes of honour but when Sikar Diun saw it it
was gall to him The King prepared an apartment expressly for Wakhs El
Fellat and while Shama returned to her palace he gave a great feast in
honour of her deliverance from the fiend After seven days had passed
Shama went to Wakhs El Fellat and said to him Ask me of my father
tomorrow for you have rescued me and he will not be able to refuse
you He consented very willingly and went to the King early next
morning The King gave him a very favourable reception and seated him
with him on the throne but Wakhs El Fellat had not courage to prefer
his suit and left him after a short interview He had not long returned
to his own room when Shama entered saluted him and asked Why did
you not demand me I was too bashful he replied Lay this feeling
aside returned she and demand me Well I will certainly do so
tomorrow answered he Thereupon she left him and returned to her own
apartment Early next morning Wakhs El Fellat went again to the King
who gave him a friendly reception and made him sit with him But he was
still unable to prefer his suit and returned to his own room Soon
after Shama came to him and said How long is this bashfulness to last
Take courage and if not request some one else to speak for you She
then left him and next morning he repeated his visit to the King What
is your request asked the latter I am come as a suitor said Wakhs
El Fellat and ask the hand of your noble daughter Shama When Sikar
Diun heard this he slapped his face What is the matter with you
asked the King This is what I have foreseen answered he for if
these two moles unite the destruction of Abyssinia is accomplished
How can I refuse him replied the King when he has just delivered
her from the fiend Tell him answered Sikar Diun that you must
consult with your Wazir The King then turned to Wakhs El Fellat and
said My son your request is granted as far as I am concerned but I
leave my Wazir to arrange it with you so you must consult him about
it Wakhs El Fellat immediately turned to the Wazir and repeated his
request to him Sikar Diun answered him in a friendly manner The
affair is as good as arranged no one else is suited for the Kings
daughter but you know that the daughters of the Kings require a dowry
Ask what you please returned Wakhs El Fellat We do not ask you for
money or moneys worth said the Wazir but for the head of a man
named Sudun the Ethiopian Where can I find him said the prince
The Wazir replied He is said to dwell in the fortress of Reg three
days journey from here But what if I fail to bring the head of
Sudun asked he But you will have it returned the Wazir and after
this understanding the audience ceased and each returned to his
dwelling

Now this Sudun had built his fortress on the summit of a high hill It
was very secure and he defended it with the edge of the sword It was
his usual resort from whence he sallied forth on plundering
expeditions and rendered the roads unsafe At length the news of him
reached King Saif ArRaad who sent against him three thousand men but
he routed and destroyed them all Upon this the King sent a larger
number against him who experienced the same fate He then despatched a
third army upon which Sudun fortified himself afresh and reared the
walls of his fortress so high that an eagle could scarcely pass them We
will now return to Shama who went to Wakhs El Fellat and reproached
him with the conditions he had agreed to and added It would be better
for you to leave this place and take me with you and we will put
ourselves under the protection of some powerful king God forbid
replied he that I should take you with me in so dishonourable a
manner As he still positively refused to consent she grew angry and
left him Wakhs El Fellat lay down to rest but he could not sleep So
he rose up mounted his horse and rode away at midnight and in the
morning he met a horseman who stationed himself in his path but who was
so completely armed that his face was concealed When Wakhs El Fellat
saw him he cried to him Who are you and where are you going But
instead of replying he pressed upon him and aimed a blow which Wakhs
El Fellat successfully parried A fight then commenced between them
which lasted till nearly evening At last the difference in their
strength became perceptible and Wakhs El Fellet struck his adversary so
violent a blow with his javelin that his horse fell to the ground He
then dismounted and was about to slay him when the horseman cried to
him Do not kill me O brave warrior or you will repent when
repentance will no more avail you Tell me who you are returned
Wakhs El Fellat I am Shama the daughter of King Afrakh replied the
horseman Why have you acted thus asked he I wished to try whether
you would be able to hold your own against Suduns people she replied
I have tried you now and found you so valiant that I fear no longer on
your account Take me with you O hero God forbid that I should do
so he returned what would Sikar Diun and the others say They would
say that if Shama had not been with him he would never have been able
to prevail against Sudun She then raised her eyes to heaven and said
O God permit him to fall into some danger from which I alone may
deliver him Upon this Wakhs El Fellat pursued his journey without
giving any attention to her words On the third day he arrived at the
valley where the fortress of Sudun was situated when he began to work
his way along behind the trees and towards evening he arrived at the
fortress itself which he found to be surrounded with a moat and the
gates were closed He was still undecided what course to take when he
heard the sound of an approaching caravan and he hid himself in the
fosse of the fortress to watch it He then saw that it was driven
forward by a large body of men and that the merchants were bound on
their mules When they arrived at the castle they knocked at the gate
and when the troop entered Wakhs El Fellat entered with them and they
unloaded the goods and bound the prisoners without noticing him When
the armed men had finished their work they ascended to the castle but
he remained below After a time he wished to follow them but when he
trod on the first step it gave way under him and a dagger flew out
which struck him in the groin Upon this his eyes filled with tears and
he already looked upon his destruction as certain when a form came
towards him from the entrance of the castle to deliver him and as it
drew nearer he perceived that it was Shama He was filled with
astonishment and cried out God has heard your prayer How did you
come here I followed your traces she replied till you entered the
castle when I imitated your example and mingled with the troops I
have now saved your life although you have refused to take me with you
but if you wish to advance further do not neglect to try whether each
step is fixed with the point of your sword He now again began to
ascend feeling the way before him and Shama followed till they
arrived at the last stair when they saw that the staircase ended in a
revolving wheel Spring higher advised Shama for I see a javelin
which magic art has placed here They sprang over it and pursued their
way till they reached a large anteroom lighted by a high cupola They
stopped here awhile and examined everything carefully At last they
approached the door of a room and on looking through the crevices they
saw about a hundred armed negroes among whom was a black slave who
looked as savage as a lion The room was lighted by wax candles placed
on gold and silver candlesticks At this moment the black said
Slaves what have you done with the prisoners belonging to the
caravan We have chained them up in the prison below and left them in
the safest place was the reply But he continued If one of them was
carelessly bound he might be able to release himself and the others
and to gain possession of the stairs Let one of you therefore go down
examine them carefully and tighten their bonds One of them therefore
came out and the two strangers hid themselves in the anteroom When he
had passed them Wakhs El Fellat stepped forward and pierced him through
with his sword Shama dragged his body aside and they both remained
quiet for a time But as the slave remained away from his companions too
long Sudun exclaimed Go and see why he does not return for I have
been in great alarm ever since we entered the castle today A second
then rose and took his sword and as he came into the anteroom Wakhs El
Fellat clove him in twain at one blow and Shama dragged his body also on
one side They again waited quietly for a time when Sudun said It
seems as if hunters are watching our slaves and are killing them one
after another A third then hastened out and Wakhs El Fellat struck
him such a blow that he fell dead to the ground and Shama dragged him
also away But as he likewise remained absent so long Sudun himself
stood up and all the others with him and he said Did I not warn and
caution you There is a singing in my ears and my heart trembles for
there must be people here who are watching our men He himself now came
out and the others followed him with lights and holding their hands on
their swords when one of the foremost suddenly stopped Why do you not
advance cried the others How shall I go forward said he when he
who has slain our friends stands before us This answer was repeated to
Sudun when he called on them in a voice of thunder to advance When he
heard this he forced his way through them till he perceived Wakhs El
Fellat Who are you Satan cried he and who brought you here I
came here replied he to cut off your head and destroy your memory
Have you any bloodfeud against me asked Sudun or any offence to
revenge upon me I have no enmity against you in my heart said Wakhs
El Fellat and you have never injured me but I have asked Shama in
marriage of her father and he has demanded of me your head as a
condition Be on your guard that you may not say I acted foully towards
you Madman cried Sudun I challenge you to a duel Will you fight
inside or outside the fortress I leave that to you returned Wakhs
El Fellat Well then await me here was the reply Sudun then went
in clothed himself in gilded armour girt on a sawlike sword and came
out holding a shining club in his hand He was so enraged that he knew
not what to say and at once attacked Wakhs El Fellat who threw himself
on his adversary like a raging lion and they fought together like
hungry wolves but both despaired of victory The swords spake a hard
language on the shields and each of the combatants wished that he had
never been born When this desperate fight had lasted a long time Shama
was greatly troubled lest Sudun should prove victorious So she seized a
dagger and struck at Sudun wounding the nerves of his hand so that he
dropped his sword while she exclaimed to Wakhs El Fellat Make an end
of him No replied Wakhs El Fellat I will make him my prisoner
for he is a brave and valiant man With whom are you speaking asked
Sudun With Shama answered he What said Sudun did she come with
you Yes replied he Then let her come before me She came
forward and Sudun said Is the world too narrow for your father that
he could demand nothing as your dowry but my head This was his
desire answered she Wakhs El Fellat then said Take your sword and
defend yourself for I will not fight with you now that it has fallen
out of your hand But Sudun replied I will not fight with you for I
am wounded so take my head and go in peace with your bride He then
sat down and bowed his head If you speak truly said Wakhs El Fellat
separate yourself from your people Why so Because I fear lest
they may surround me and compel me to fight with them and there is no
need for me to shed their blood Sudun then left the castle bowed his
head and said Finish your work But Wakhs El Fellat said If you
speak truth come with me across the fosse of the castle into the open
ground He did so carefully barring the castle behind him and said
Now take my head

When the slaves saw this they mounted the walls and wept and lamented
But Shama cried out Take his head and let us hasten our return before
morning dawns What said Wakhs El Fellat should I kill so brave a
man in so treacherous a manner when he is so noble and magnanimous He
then went up to Sudun kissed his head and said Rise up O warrior of
the age for you and your companions are safe from me They now all
embraced each other and made an offensive and defensive compact Take
me with you alive O brave man said Sudun and hand me over to the
King as his daughters dowry If he consents well but if not take my
head and woo your wife God forbid said Wakhs El Fellat that I
should act thus after your magnanimity Rather return to the castle and
assure your companions of your safety All this passed under the eyes
of the other armed men They rejoiced at the knightly conduct of both
and now came down fell at the feet of Sudun and embraced him They then
did the same to Wakhs El Fellat whose hands they kissed and loaded him
with praises After this they all returned to the castle and agreed to
set out presently They took with them whatever treasures there were
and Wakhs El Fellat commanded them to release the prisoners and restore
them their goods They now all mounted their horses and journeyed to the
country of King Afrakh greatly rejoiced at the mutual love of the
warriors When they approached the town Shama parted from them that
nothing should be known of her absence in the company During this time
King Afrakh and Sikar Diun had amused themselves with hunting jesting
and sporting and sent out scouts daily to look for Wakhs El Fellat
What can have become of him said the King once to Sikar Diun Sudun
has certainly killed him replied the latter and you will never see
him again While they were thus talking they observed a great cloud of
dust and as it drew nearer they could see the armed men more
distinctly The company was led by a black knight by whose side rode a
younger white horseman When the King saw this he exclaimed Wakhs El
Fellat has returned in company with Sudun and his host Wait a
little replied Sikar Diun till we are certain of it But when they
drew nearer and they could doubt no longer Sikar Diun mounted his
horse and fled accompanied by the King and his followers till they
reached the town and barred the gates They then watched from the
walls to see what would happen When they saw that the strangers
dismounted and pitched tents the King thought it was a good sign He
therefore ordered the town to be decorated and the gates to be opened
and rode out attended by a considerable escort and approached the
tents The other party now mounted their horses to go to meet them When
they approached each other King Afrakh was about to dismount but Wakhs
ElFellat would not allow it and the King embraced him and
congratulated him on his safety He then saluted Sudun also but the
latter did not return his salutation He invited him to enter the town
but he declined as did Wakhs El Fellat likewise who did not wish to
part from his companions The King returned accompanied only by his own
people and prepared the best reception for the newcomers On the
following morning the King held a general council at which Sikar Diun
appeared greatly depressed Did I not warn you beforehand said he to
the King what you now see for yourself of this evildoer Did we not
send him to bring the head of Sudun and he returns with him safe and
sound and on the best of terms while our hearts are oppressed with
anxiety You may be right replied the King but what are we to do
now

This conversation was interrupted by a tumult caused by the arrival of
Wakhs El Fellat and Sudun who came to pay their respects to the King
The King invited them to sit down but Sudun remained standing and when
he asked him again he replied You craven was the world too narrow
for you that you desired my head as your daughters dowry Sit down
said the King for I know that you are angry How can I sit down
returned Sudun when you have ordered my death God forbid that I
should act so unjustly said the King it was Sikar Diun What
said he do you accuse me of such an action in my presence Did you
not make this condition with Wakhs El Fellat said the King and send
him on his errand Sikar Diun then turned to Sudun and said Sit
down brave warrior for we only did so from love to you that we might
be able to make a treaty with you and that you might join our company
After this answer Sudun concealed his anger and sat down Refreshments
were now brought in and after partaking of them Wakhs El Fellat and
Sudun returned to their tents Several days passed in this manner and
at length Sudun said to Wakhs El Fellat O my master it is time for
you to demand Shama in marriage now you have won her with the edge of
the sword You have fulfilled their conditions long since by bringing
them my head but you have made no further progress at present Ask for
her once more and if they will not give her up I will fall upon them
with the sword and we will carry Shama off and then lay waste the
city I will demand her as my wife again tomorrow replied the
other When he went to the palace next day he found the King and all
the court assembled When they saw him they all rose from their seats
and when they sat down again he alone remained standing Why do you
not sit down said the King for all your wishes are now fulfilled
I have still to ask for Shama he replied You know returned the
King that ever since her birth I have allowed Sikar Diun to make all
arrangements for her He now turned to Sikar Diun who replied in a
friendly tone She is yours for you have fulfilled the conditions and
you have only now to give her ornaments What kind of ornaments
asked he Instead of ornaments replied the traitor we desire to
receive a book containing the history of the Nile If you bring it us
she is wholly yours but if not there is no marriage to be thought of
Where is it to be found I cannot tell you myself Well then
returned Wakhs El Fellat if I do not bring you the book Shama is lost
to me all present are witnesses to this He went out with these words
pushing his way through the crowded assembly and Sudun behind him till
they reached their tents Why did you promise that said Sudun let
us rather overcome them with the sword and take Shama from them Not
so replied Wakhs El Fellat I will only possess her honourably And
yet you do not even know how to find the book said Sudun rather
listen to my advice retire to my fortress and leave me in their
power I would never act thus said Wakhs El Fellat though I should
suffer death After these and similar speeches supper was brought in
and each retired to his sleeping apartment But Wakhs El Fellat had
scarcely entered his room when Shama came in What have you done said
she and what engagement have you undertaken How can you fulfil this
condition Do you not see that their only object is to destroy you or
at least to get rid of you I have come to warn you again and I say to
you once more take me with you to Suduns castle where we can live at
peace and do not act as they tell you I will carry out my
engagement he replied I will not possess you like a coward even
though I should be cut to pieces with swords Upon this Shama was
angry and left him while he lay down to rest but could not sleep He
therefore rose up saddled and mounted his horse and rode away without
knowing where abandoning himself wholly to the will of God He wandered
about thus for several days until he reached a lonely tower He knocked
at the door and a voice answered Welcome O thou who hast separated
thyself from thy companions enter without fear O brave Saif son of
Zul Yezn When he pushed the door it opened and his eyes beheld a
noble and venerable old man from whose appearance it was at once
obvious that he busied himself with the strictest life and fear of God
Welcome cried he again if you had travelled from east to west you
would have found no one who could show you how to obtain the book you
seek as well as I can for I have dwelt here awaiting your arrival for
sixty years But that was before I was born said Wakhs El Fellat to
himself He then asked aloud By what name did you address me just
now O Saif answered the old man that is your true name for you
are a sword Saf to the Abyssinians but whom do you worship O my
master was the reply the Abyssinians worship Saturn Sukhal but I
am in perplexity and know not whom to worship My son replied the
old man worship Him who has reared the heavens over us without
pillars and who has rested the earth on water the only and eternal
God the Lord who is only and alone to be reverenced I worship Him and
none other beside him for I follow the religion of Abraham What is
your name asked Wakhs El Fellat I am called Shaikh Gyat What
declaration must I make he asked the old man to embrace your
religion Say There is no God but God and Abraham is the Friend of
God If you make this profession you will be numbered among the
believers He at once repeated the formula and Shaikh Gyat was much
pleased and devoted the night to teaching him the history of Abraham
and his religion and the forms of worship Towards morning he said O
my son whenever you advance to battle say God is great grant me
victory O God and destroy the infidels and help will be near you
Now pursue your journey but leave your horse here until your return
Enter the valley before you under the protection of God and after
three days you will meet some one who will aid you Wakhs El Fellat set
out on that road and after three days he met a horseman who saluted
him and exclaimed Welcome Saif Zul Yezn for you bring happiness to
this neighbourhood Saif returned his salutation and asked How do
you know me and how do you know my name I am not a brave or renowned
warrior was the answer but one of the maidens of this country and my
mother taught me your name What is your name and that of your
mother My mothers name is Alka answered she and I am called
Taka When he heard this he was greatly rejoiced for he remembered
that Shaikh Gyat had said to him O thou whose destiny will be decided
by Alka and Taka O noble virgin said he where is your mother
Alka Look round she replied and he saw a very large and lofty city
at some distance Know said she that  experienced philosophers
dwell in that city My mother Alka is their superior and directs all
their affairs and actions She knew that you would come to this
neighbourhood in search of a book concerning the Nile which was written
by Japhet the son of Noah and she wishes you to attain your end by her
means She also informed me of your coming and promised me to you
saying You shall have no other husband but him We expected you
today and she sent me to meet you adding Warn him not to enter the
town by daylight or it will be his destruction Wait here therefore
till nightfall and only approach the city after dark Turn to the right
along the wall and stand still when you reach the third tower where we
will await you As soon as we see you we will throw you a rope bind it
round your waist and we will draw you up The rest will be easy But
why need you give yourselves all this trouble said Saif Zul Yezn
Know replied she that the inhabitants of this city have been
informed of your approaching arrival by their books and are aware that
you are about to carry away their book which they hold in superstitious
reverence On the first day of each month they repair to the building
where it is preserved and they adore it and seek counsel from it
respecting their affairs They have also a king whose name is Kamrun
When they knew that you were coming for the book they constructed a
talisman against you They have made a copper statue and fixed a brazen
horn in its hand and have stationed it at the gate of the city If you
enter the statue will sound the horn and it will only do so upon your
arrival They would then seize you and put you to death On this account
we desire to baffle their wisdom by drawing you up to the walls of the
city at another place May God reward you a thousandfold replied he
but go now and announce my arrival to your mother She went away and
he approached the city in the darkness of night and turned towards the
third tower on the right where he found Alka and Taka When they
recognised him they immediately threw him the rope which he fastened
about him When he was drawn up they descended from the wall and were
about to proceed to Alkas house when the talisman suddenly acted and
the statue blew the horn loudly Hasten to our house cried Alka and
they succeeded in reaching it safely and barred the doors when the
noise increased The whole population of the city rose up and the
streets were filled What is this disturbance about asked Saif This
is all due replied Alka to the alarm sounded by the statue because
you have entered the town There will be a great meeting held tomorrow
where all the wise men will assemble to attempt to discover the
whereabouts of the intruder but by Gods help I will guide them wrong
and confuse their counsels Go to our neighbour the fisherman added
she to her daughter and see what he has caught She went and brought
news that he had taken a large fish of the size of a man Take this
piece of gold said her mother and bring us the fish and when she
did so she told her to clean it which was done Food was then brought
in and they ate and talked The night passed quietly but on the
following morning Alka ordered Saif Zul Yezn to undress and to hide in
the skin of the fish She put her mouth to the mouth of the fish and
took a long rope which she fastened under Saifs armpits She then let
him down into a deep well and fastened him there saying Remain here
till I come back She then left him and went to the great hall of the
King where the divan was already assembled and the King had taken his
seat on the throne All rose up when she entered and when she had
seated herself the King said to her O mother did you not hear the
blast of the horn yesterday and why did you not come out with us I
did hear it she replied but I did not heed it But you know said
he that the sound can only be heard upon the arrival of the stranger
who desires to take the book I know it O King but permit me to
choose forty men from among those assembled here She did so and
selected ten from among the forty again She then said to them Take a
Trakhtramml sandboard on which the Arabs practise geomancy and
notation and look and search They did so but had scarcely finished
when they looked at each other in amazement They destroyed their
calculation and began a second and confused this too and began a
third upon which they became quite confounded What are you doing
there asked the King at last You go on working and obliterating your
work what have you discovered O King replied they we find that
the stranger has entered the town but not by any gate He appears to
have passed in between Heaven and earth like a bird After this a fish
swallowed him and carried him down into some dark water Are you
fools asked the King angrily and turning to Alka continued Have
you ever seen a man flying between Heaven and earth and afterwards
swallowed by a fish which descends with him into dark water O King
replied she I always forbid the wise men to eat heavy food for it
disturbs their understanding and weakens their penetration but they
will not heed me At this the King was angry and immediately drove
them from the hall But Alka said It will be plain tomorrow what has
happened She left the hall and when she reached home she drew Saif
Zul Yezn out of the well and he dressed himself again They sat down
and Alka said I have succeeded in confounding their deliberations
today and there will be a great assembly tomorrow when I must hide
you in a still more outoftheway place After this they supped and
went to rest Next morning Alka called her daughter and said Bring me
the gazelle When it was brought her she said Bring me the wings of
an eagle Taka gave them to her and she bound them on the back of the
gazelle She then took a pair of compasses which she fixed in the
ceiling of the room She next took two other pairs of compasses and
tied one between the fore feet and the other between the hind feet of
the gazelle She then tied a rope to the compasses in the roof and the
two ends to the other pairs But she made Saif Zul Yezn lie down in such
a position that his head was between the feet of the gazelle She then
said to him Remain here till I come back and went to the King with
whom she found a very numerous assemblage of the wise men As soon as
she entered the King made her sit beside him on the throne O my
mother Alka he said I could not close an eye last night from anxiety
concerning yesterdays events Have you no wise men returned she
who eat the bread of the divan She then turned to them saying
Select the wisest among you and they chose the wisest among them She
ordered them to take the sandboard again but they became so confused
that they were obliged to begin again three times from the beginning
What do you discover said the King angrily O our master replied
they he whom we seek has been carried away by a beast of the desert
which is flying with him between Heaven and earth How is this said
the King to Alka have you ever seen anything like it He seized his
sword in a rage and three fled and he killed four of the others When
Alka went home she released Saif and told him what had happened Next
morning Alka took the gazelle and slaughtered it in a copper kettle
She then took a golden mortar and reversed it over it and said to Saif
Zul Yezn Sit on this mortar till I come back She then went to the
divan and chose out six wise men who again took the sandboard and
began again three times over in confusion Alas said the King in
anger What misfortune do you perceive O our master they exclaimed
in consternation our understanding is confused for we see him sitting
on a golden mountain which is in the midst of a sea of blood
surrounded by a copper wall The King was enraged and broke up the
assembly saying O Alka I will now depend on you alone Tomorrow I
will attempt to show you the stranger she replied When she came home
she related to Saif what had happened and said I shall know by
tomorrow what to tell the King to engage his attention and prevent him
from pursuing you Next morning she found Taka speaking to Saif Zul
Yezn alone and she asked her What does he wish Mother replied
Taka he wishes to go to the Kings palace to see him and the divan
What you wish shall be done said she to Saif but you must not
speak He assented to the condition and she dressed him as her
attendant gave him a sandboard and went with him to the King who said
to her I could not sleep at all last night for thinking of the
stranger for whom we are seeking Now that the affair is in my hands
returned she you will find me a sufficient protection against him
She immediately ordered Saif to give her the sandboard She took it and
when she had made her calculations she said joyfully to the King O my
lord I can give you the welcome news of the flight of the stranger
owing to his dread of you and your revenge When the King heard this
he rent his clothes slapped his face and said He would not have
departed without having taken the book I cannot see if he has taken
anything replied she This is the first of the month said the King
come and let us see if it is missing He then went with a large
company to the building where the book was kept Alka turned away from
the King for a moment to say to Saif Do not enter with us for if you
enter the case will open of itself and the book will fall into your
hands This would at once betray you and you would be seized and put to
death and all my labour would have been in vain She then left him
and rejoined the King When they reached the building the doors were
opened and when the King entered they found the book They immediately
paid it the customary honours and protracted this species of worship
while Saif stood at the door debating with himself whether to enter or
not At last his impatience overcame him and he entered and at the
same instant the casket was broken to pieces and the book fell out The
King then ordered all to stand up and the book rolled to Saif Zul Yezn
Upon this all drew their swords and rushed upon him Saif drew his
sword also and cried God is great as Shaikh Gyat had taught him He
continued to fight and defend himself and struggled to reach the door
The entire town arose in tumult to pursue him when he stumbled over a
dead body and was seized Let me not see his face cried the King
but throw him into the mine This mine was eighty yards deep and had
not been opened for sixty years It was closed by a heavy leaden cover
which they replaced after they had loaded him with chains and thrown
him in Saif sat there in the darkness greatly troubled and lamenting
his condition to Him who never sleeps Suddenly a side wall of the mine
opened and a figure came forth which approached and called him by his
name Who are you asked Saif I am a woman named Akissa and inhabit
the mountain where the Nile rises We are a nation who hold the faith of
Abraham A very pious man lives below us in a beautiful palace But an
evil Jinni named Mukhtatif lived near us also who loved me and
demanded me in marriage of my father He consented from fear but I was
unwilling to marry an evil being who was a worshipper of fire How can
you promise me in marriage to an infidel said I to my father I shall
thereby escape his malice myself replied he I went out and wept and
complained to the pious man about the affair Do you know who will kill
him said he to me and I answered No I will direct you to him who
has cut off his hand said he His name is Saif Zul Yezn and he is
now in the city of King Kamrun in the mine Thereupon he brought me to
you and I come as you see me to guide you to my country that you may
kill Mukhtatif and free the earth from his wickedness She then moved
him and shook him and all his chains fell off She lifted him on her
shoulders and carried him to the palace of the Shaikh who was named
Abbas Salam Here he heard a voice crying Enter Saif Zul Yezn He
did so and found a grave and venerable old man who gave him a very
friendly reception saying Wait till tomorrow when Akissa will come
to guide you to the castle of Mukhtatif He remained with him for the
night and when Akissa arrived next morning the old man told her to
hasten that the world might be soon rid of the monster They then left
this venerable man and when they had walked awhile Akissa said to
Saif Look before you He did so and perceived a black mass at some
distance This is the castle of the evildoer said she but I cannot
advance a step further than this Saif therefore pursued his way alone
and when he came near the castle he walked round it to look for the
entrance As he was noticing the extraordinary height of the castle
which was founded on the earth but appeared to overtop the clouds he
saw a window open and several people looked out who pointed at him
with their fingers exclaiming That is he that is he They threw him
a rope which they directed him to bind round him They drew him up by
it when he found himself in the presence of three hundred and sixty
damsels who saluted him by his name

                                              

                    Here Habichts fragment ends


                    SCOTTS MSS AND TRANSLATIONS

In  Jonathan Scott LLD published a volume of Tales Anecdotes
and Letters translated from the Arabic and Persian based upon a
fragmentary MS procured by J Anderson in Bengal which included the
commencement of the work Nos  in  Nights two tales not divided
into Nights Nos  and  and No 

Scotts work includes these two new tales since republished by Kirby
and Clouston with the addition of various anecdotes c derived from
other sources The Story of the Labourer and the Chair has points of
resemblance to that of Malek and the Princess Chirine Shirin in the
Thousand and One Days and also to that of Tuhfet El Culoub No a
in the Breslau Edition The additional tales in this MS and vol of
translations are marked A under Scott in our Tables Scott published
the following specimens text and translation in Ouseleys Oriental
Collections  and following years No m i pp  and
Introduction ii pp   The contents are fully given in
Ouseley vol ii pp  

Scott afterwards acquired an approximately complete MS in  vols
written in  which was brought from Turkey by E Wortley Montague
Scott published a table of contents Ouseley ii pp  in which
however the titles of some few of the shorter tales which he
afterwards translated from it are omitted while the titles of others
are differently translated Thus Greece of the Table becomes Yemen
in the translation and labourer becomes sharper As a specimen he
subsequently printed the text and translation of No  Ouseley ii
pp 

This MS which differs very much from all others known is now in the
Bodleian Library at Oxford

In  Scott published an edition of the Arabian Nights
Entertainments in  vols vol  containing a long introduction and
vol  including a series of new tales from the Oxford MS There is a
small paper edition and also a large paper edition the latter with
frontispieces It had originally been Scotts intention to retranslate
the MS but he appears to have found it beyond his powers He therefore
contented himself with reediting Galland altering little except the
spelling of the names and saying that Gallands version is in the main
so correct that it would be useless repetition to go over the work
afresh Although he says that he found many of the tales both immoral
and puerile he translated most of those near the beginning and omitted
much more including several harmless and interesting tales such as No
 towards the end of his MS than near the beginning The greater
part of Scotts additional tales published in vol  are included in
the composite French and German editions of Gauttier and Habicht but
except Nos   and  republished in my New Arabian Nights
they have not been reprinted in England being omitted in all the many
popular versions which are professedly based upon Scott even in the
edition in  vols published in  which reprints Scotts Preface

The edition of  was published about the same time as one of the
latest reissues of Lanes Thousand and One Nights and the Saturday
Review of Nov   p  published an article on the Arabian
Nights containing the following amusing passage Then Jonathan Scott
LLD Oxon assures the world that he intended to retranslate the tales
given by Galland but he found Galland so adequate on the whole that he
gave up the idea and now reprints Galland with etchings by M Lalauze
giving a French view of Arab life Why Jonathan Scott LLD should
have thought to better Galland while Mr Lanes version is in
existence and has just been reprinted it is impossible to say

The most interesting of Scotts additional tales with reference to
ordinary editions of The Nights are as follows

No b is a variant of No 

No c is a variant of c in which the wife instead of the husband
acts the part of a jealous tyrant Compare Cazottes story of
Halechalbe

No e Here we have a reference to the Nesns which only appears
once in the ordinary versions of The Nights No b Burton v p


No b is a variant of No 

No c This relates to a bird similar to that in the Jealous Sisters
No  and includes a variant of ba

No h Another story of enchanted birds The prince who seeks them
encounters an Oone under similar circumstances to those under which
Princess Parizade No  encounters the old durwesh The description
is hardly that of a Marid with which I imagine the Ons are wrongly
identified

No  contains the nucleus of the famous story of Aladdin No 

No  is similar to No  but we have again the well incident of
No ba and the exposure of the children as in No 

No  Very similar to Hasan of Bassorah No  As Sir R F
Burton vol viii p  note has called in question my
identification of the Islands of WkWk with the Aru Islands near New
Guinea I will quote here the passages from Mr A R Wallaces Malay
Archipelago chap  on which I based itThe trees frequented by the
birds are very lofty One day I got under a tree where a number of
the Great Paradise birds were assembled but they were high up in the
thickest of the foliage and flying and jumping about so continually
that I could get no good view of them Their voice is most
extraordinary At early morn before the sun has risen we hear a loud
cry of Wawkwawkwawk wkwkwk which resounds through the forest
changing its direction continually This is the Great Bird of Paradise
going to seek his breakfast The birds had now commenced what the
people here call their sacaleli or dancingparties in certain trees
in the forest which are not fruittrees as I at first imagined but
which have an immense head of spreading branches and large but scattered
leaves giving a clear space for the birds to play and exhibit their
plumes On one of these trees a dozen or twenty fullplumaged male birds
assemble together raise up their wings stretch out their necks and
elevate their exquisite plumes keeping them in a continual vibration
Between whiles they fly across from branch to branch in great
excitement so that the whole tree is filled with waving plumes in every
variety of attitude and motion

No bc appears to be nearly the same as No 

No  is a variant of No q


                         WEILS TRANSLATION

The only approximately complete original German translation is Tausend
und eine Nacht Arabische Erzhlungen Zum Erstenmale aus dem Urtexte
vollstndig und treu bersetzt von Dr Gustav Weil four vols
Stuttgart The first edition was in roy vo and was published at
Stuttgart and Pforzheim in  the last volume I have not seen
it is wanting in the copy in the British Museum This edition is divided
into Nights and includes No b In the later editions which are in
small square vo but profusely illustrated like the larger one this
story is omitted except No m which the French editors include with
it though Gallands doubtful stories are retained and there is no
division into Nights The work has been reprinted several times and the
edition quoted in our Table is described as Zweiter Abdruck der dritten
vollstandig umgearbeiteten mit Anmerkungen und mit einer Einleitung
versehenen Auflage 

Weil has not stated from what sources he drew his work except that No
 is taken from a MS in the Ducal Library at Gotha This is
unfortunate as his version of the great transformation scene in No b
Burton vol i pp   agrees more closely with Galland than
with any other original version In other passages as when speaking of
the punishment of Aziz No a aa Weil seems to have borrowed an
expression from Lane who writes a cruel wound Weil saying a severe
schwere wound

Whereas Weil gives the only German version known to me of No  though
considerably abridged he omits many tales contained in Zinserling and
Habicht but whether because his own work was already too bulky or
because his original MSS did not contain them I do not know probably
the first supposition is correct for in any case it was open to him to
have translated them from the printed texts to which he refers in his
Preface

Two important stories Nos  and  are not found in any other
version but as they are translated in my New Arabian Nights I need
not discuss them here I will however quote a passage from the story
of Judar and Mahmood which I omitted because it is not required by the
context and because I thought it a little out of place in a book
published in a juvenile series It is interesting from its analogy to
the story of Semele

When King Kashuk a jinni is about to marry the daughter of King
Shamkoor we read New Arabian Nights p  Shamkoor immediately
summoned my father and said Take my daughter for you have won her
heart He immediately provided an outfit for his daughter and when it
was completed my father and his bride rode away on horseback while the
trousseau of the Princess followed on three hundred camels The passage
proceeds the narrator being Daruma the offspring of the marriage
When my father had returned home and was desirous of celebrating his
marriage his Wazir Kandarin said to him Your wife will be destroyed
if you touch her for you are created of fire and she is created of
earth which the fire devours You will then bewail her death when it is
too late Tomorrow continued he I will bring you an ointment with
which you must rub both her and yourself and you may then live long and
happily together On the following day he brought him a white ointment
and my father anointed himself and his bride with it and consummated
his marriage without danger

I may add that this is the only omission of the smallest consequence in
my rendering of either story

I have heard from more than one source that a complete German
translation of The Nights was published and suppressed but I have not
been able to discover the name of the author the date or any other
particulars relating to the subject


       VON HAMMERS MS AND THE TRANSLATIONS DERIVED FROM IT

Several complete copies of The Nights were obtained by Europeans about
the close of the last or the beginning of the present century and one
of these in  vols fell into the hands of the great German
Orientalist Joseph von Hammer This MS agrees closely with the printed
Bul and Mac texts as well as with Dr Clarkes MS though the names
of the tales sometimes vary a little One story The two Wazirs given
in Von Hammers list as inedited no doubt by an oversight is evidently
No  which bears a similar title in Torrens One title Al Kavi a
story which Von Hammer says was published in Mag Encycl and in
English probably by Scott in Ouseleys Oriental Collections vide ante
p  puzzled me for some time but from its position and the title I
think I have identified it as No  and have entered it as such No
a in this as well as in several other MSS bears the title of the Two
Lovers or of the Lover and the Beloved

Von Hammer made a French translation of the unpublished tales which he
lent to Caussin de Perceval who extracted from it four tales only Nos
a   and  and only acknowledged his obligations in a general
way to a distinguished Orientalist whose name he pointedly suppressed
Von Hammer naturally indignant reclaimed his MS and had it
translated into German by Zinserling He then sent the French MS to De
Sacy in whose hands it remained for some time although he does not
appear to have made any use of it when it was despatched to England for
publication but the courier lost it on the journey and it was never
recovered

Zinserlings translation was published under the title Der Tausend und
einen Nacht noch nicht bersetzte Mhrchen Erzhlungen und Anekdoten
zum erstenmale aus dem Arabischen ins Franzsische bersetzt von Joseph
von Hammer und aus dem Franzsischen ins Deutsche von Aug E
Zinserling Professor  vols Stuttgart and Tbingen  The
introductory matter is of considerable importance and includes notices
of  different MSS and a list of contents of Von Hammers MS The
tales begin with No  Nos  being omitted because Von Hammer was
informed that they were about to be published in France This possibly
refers to Asselan Riches Scharkan published in  The tales and
anecdotes in this edition follow the order of The Nights No  is
incomplete Zinserling giving only the commencement and two other tales
Nos b and  are related in such a confused manner as to be
unintelligible the former from transposition perhaps in the sheets of
the original MS and the latter from errors and omissions On the other
hand some of the tales No  for instance are comparatively full
and accurate

A selection from the longer tales was published in English in  vols in
 under the title of New Arabian Nights Entertainments selected
from the original Oriental MS by Jos von Hammer and now first
translated into English by the Rev George Lamb I have only to remark
that No b is here detached from its connection with No  and is
given an independent existence

A complete French retranslation of Zinserlings work also in  vols
by G S Trbutien Contes indits des Mille et une Nuits was published
in Paris in  but in this edition the long tales are placed first
and all the anecdotes are placed together last

The various MSS mentioned by Von Hammer are as follows

    I Gallands MS in Paris

   II Another Paris MS containing  Nights No  is specially
       noticed as occurring in it This seems to be the same as a MS
       subsequently mentioned by Von Hammer as consulted by Habicht

  III Scotts MS Wortley Montague

   IV Scotts MS Anderson

    V Dr Russells MS from Aleppo  Nights

   VI Sir W Jones MS from which Richardson extracted No ee for
       his grammar

  VII A MS at Vienna  Nights

 VIII MS in Italinskis collection

   IX Clarkes MS

    X An Egyptian MS at Marseilles

   XI Von Hammers MS

  XII Habichts MS  Bres text

 XIII Caussins MS

  XIV De Sacys MS

   XV One or more MSS in the Vatican


                  TRANSLATIONS OF THE PRINTED TEXTS

These are noticed by Sir R F Burton in his Foreword vol  pp
xixiii and consequently can be passed over with a brief mention
here

Torrens edition vol  extends to the end of Night  Burton in p


Lanes translation originally appeared in monthly halfcrown parts from
 to  It is obvious that he felt himself terribly restricted in
space for the third volume although much thicker than the others is
not only almost destitute of notes towards the end but the author is
compelled to grasp at every excuse to omit tales even excluding No
 which he himself considered one of the most entertaining tales in
the work chap xxix note  on account of its resemblance to Nos
b and d Part of the matter in Lanes own earlier notes is apparently
derived from No a which he probably did not at first intend to
omit Sir R F Burton has taken  vols to cover the same ground which
Lane has squeezed into his vol  But it is only fair to Lane to remark
that in such cases the publisher is usually far more to blame than the
author

In  appeared a popular edition of Lane entitled The Thousand and
One Nights or the Arabian Nights Entertainments translated and
arranged for family reading with explanatory notes Second edition
Here Gallands old spelling is restored and the explanatory notes
ostentatiously mentioned on the title page are entirely omitted This
edition was in  vols I have seen a copy dated  and think I have
heard of an issue in  vol and there is an American reprint in  vols
The English issue was ultimately withdrawn from circulation in
consequence of Lanes protests Mr S L Pooles Life of E W Lane
p  It contains the woodcut of the Flying Couch which is wanting in
the later editions of the genuine work but not Gallands doubtful
tales as Poole asserts

Several editions of the original work edited by Messrs E S and S L
Poole have appeared at intervals from  to  They differ little
from the original edition except in their slightly smaller size

The short tales included in Lanes notes were published separately as
one of Knights Weekly Volumes in  under the title of Arabian
Tales and Anecdotes being a selection from the notes to the new
translation of the Thousand and One Nights by E W Lane Esq

Finally in  Mr Stanley Lane Poole published a classified and
arranged edition of Lanes notes under the title of Arabian Society in
the Middle Ages

Mr John Paynes version of the Mac edition was issued in  vols by
the Villon Society to subscribers only It appeared from  to 
and only  copies were printed Judging from the original prospectus
it seems to have been the authors intention to have completed the work
in  vols and to have devoted vol  to Gallands doubtful tales but
as they are omitted he must have found that the work ran to a greater
length than he had anticipated and that space failed him He published
some preliminary papers on the Nights in the New Quarterly Magazine for
January and April 

Mr Payne subsequently issued Tales from the Arabic of the Breslau and
Calcutta  editions of the Thousand Nights and One Night not
occurring in the other printed texts of the work Three vols London
 Of this work issued like the other by the Villon Society to
subscribers only  copies were printed besides  on large paper
The third volume includes indices of all the tales in the four principal
printed texts

Finally we have Sir R F Burtons translation now in its entirety
before his subscribers It is restricted to  copies Why not
 The five supplementary vols are to include tales wanting in the
Mac edition but found in other texts printed and MS while Lady
Burtons popular edition will allow of the free circulation of Sir R F
Burtons work among all classes of the reading public


                    COLLECTIONS OF SELECTED TALES

There are many volumes of selections derived from Galland but these
hardly require mention the following may be noticed as derived from
other sources

 Caliphs and Sultans being tales omitted in the usual editions of the
Arabian Nights Entertainments Rewritten and rearranged by Sylvanus
Hanley FLS etc London  nd edition 

Consists of portions of tales chiefly selected from Scott Lamb Chavis
and Cazotte Trbutien and Lane much abridged and frequently strung
together as follows

Kalfahs Translated from the Arabic and annotated by Mrs Godfrey

by her from this source

story by Addison in the Spectator No  Nov   after
Galland There is good reason to suppose that this is subsequent to the
first English edition which however Addison does not mention There
is also an English version in Faris little Arabic Grammar London

                        SINDBAD THE SEAMAN

This is the proper place to call attention to a work specially relating
to this story Remarks on the Arabian Nights Entertainments in which
the origin of Sindbads Voyages and other Oriental Fictions is
particularly described By Richard Hole LLD London  pp iv


It is an old book but may still be consulted with advantage

There are two important critical editions of No  one in French and
one in German

                  THE CRAFT AND MALICE OF WOMEN

The literature of this cluster of tales would require a volume in
itself and I cannot do better than refer to Mr W A Cloustons Book
of Sindibad vo Glasgow  for further information This book
though privately printed and limited to  copies is not uncommon

This collection of tales has also been frequently reprinted separately

Clouston issued a privatelyprinted edition in 

The following versions have come under my notice

already been noticed ante p 


TRANSLATIONS OF COGNATE ORIENTAL ROMANCES ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE NIGHTS


                LES MILLE ET UN JOURS CONTES PERSANES

In imitation of the Arabian Nights was composed a Persian collection
entitled Hazr Yek Rz    or the Thousand and One Days of
which Petis de la Croix published a French rendering in  which
was done into English by Dr King and published in  vols with the
Turkish Tales  Forty Vezirs as early as  and subsequently by
Ambrose Phillips in  Clouston in litt Here and
occasionally elsewhere I have quoted from some MSS notes on The Nights
by Mr W A Clouston which Sir R F Burton kindly permitted me to
inspect Mr Clouston then quotes Cazottes Preface not in my edition
of the Thousand and One Days according to which the book was written
by the celebrated Dervis Mocls Mukhlis chief of the Sofis Sufis of
Ispahan founded upon certain Indian comedies Petis de la Croix was on
friendly terms with Mukhlis who allowed him to take a copy of his work
in  during his residence in Ispahan I find these statements
confirmed in the Cabinet des Fes xxxvii pp    and in
Webers Tales of the East i pp xxxvi xxxxii

The framework of the story is the same as Nos a and  a Princess
who conceives an aversion to men from dreaming of the selfdevotion of a
doe and the indifference and selfishness of a stag Mr Clouston refers
to Nakhshabs Tt Nma No  of Kders abridgment and  of India
Office MS  whence he thinks it probable that Mukhlis may have
taken the tale But the tale itself is repeated over and over again in
many Arabic Persian and Turkish collections in fact there are few of
commoner occurrence

The tales are told by the nurse in order to overcome the aversion of the
Princess to men They are as follows

Introduction and Conclusion Story of the Princess of Cashmir

   Story of Aboulcassem Bafry

   Story of King Ruzvanchad and the Princess Cheheristani

      a Story of the young King of Thibet and the Princess of the

     Story of Repsima

This work has many times been reprinted in France where it holds a
place only second to The Nights

Sir R F Burton remarks concerning the Persian and Turkish Tales of
Petis de la Crois the latter of which form part of the Forty Vazirs
No  Both are weak and servile imitations of Galland by an
Orientalist who knew nothing of the East In one passage in the story of
Fadlallah we read of Le Sacrifice du Mont Arafte which seems to
have become a fixture in the European brain I found the work easy
writing and exceedingly hard reading

The following tales require a passing notice

 Story of Aboulcassem BafryA story of concealed treasure it has
also some resemblance to No 

 Ruzvanchad and CheheristaniCheheristani is a jinniyah who is
pursued by the King under the form of a white doe marries him and
becomes the mother of Balkis the Queen of Sheba She exacts a promise
from him never to rebuke her for any of her actions he breaks it and
she leaves him for a time

a The Young King of ThibetTwo imposters obtain magic rings by
which they can assume the shapes of other persons

a b The Vazir CaverchaThis is one of Scotts stories No  of
our Table It goes back at least as far as the Ring of Polycrates It
is the th Vezirs Story in Mr Gibbs Forty Vezirs pp 

 Prince CalafThis story is well known and is sometimes played as
a comedy The Princess Turandot puts riddles to her suitors and beheads
them if they fail to answer

b Story of Prince SeyfelMoloukThis story is perhaps an older
version than that which appears in The Nights No a It is placed
long after the time of Solomon Saad is devoured by ants and when Seyf
enters the palace of Malika  Daulet Khatoon the jinni surprises
them and is overpowered by Seyfs ring He then informs him of the
death of Saad and that Bedy alJemal was one of the mistresses of
Solomon and has also long been dead

b Malek and ChirineResembles No  Malek passes himself off as
the Prophet Mohammed burns his box not chair with fireworks on his
weddingday and is thus prevented from ever returning to the Princess

f Adventures of AboulfawarisRomantic travels resembling Nos a
and 

 AntarThis is the most famous of the Badawi romances It resembles
No  in several particulars but is destitute of supernaturalism An
English abridgment in  vols was published in  and the substance
of vol  had appeared as a fragment in the previous year under the
title of Antar a Bedoueen Romance translated from the Arabic by
Terrick Hamilton Esq Oriental Secretary to the British Embassy at
Constantinople I have also seen vol  of a French translation
published about  and extending to the death of Shas

A romantic story of Arab chivalry less overloaded with supernaturalism

an account of a magical city much resembling the City of Brass No 
and defended by similar talismans

 MEHEMET THE KURD and other tales from Eastern sources by Charles
Wells Turkish Prizeman of Kings College London and Member of the
Royal Asiatic Society London 

The first story taken from an Arabic MS is a narrative of a handsome
simpleminded man with whom Princesses fall in love and who is raised
to a mighty throne by their enchantments Some of the early incidents
are not unlike those in the wellknown German story of Lucky Hans Hans
im Glck In one place there is an enchanted garden where Princesses
disport themselves in featherdresses as in No  c and where
magic apples grow Note that apples are always held in extraordinary
estimation in The Nights cf Nos  and  Among the shorter stories
we find No h a version of Nos a and  probably that referred
to by Mr Clouston as in the Tuti Nama a story The Prince Tailor
resembling No  No  and one or two other tales not connected
with The Nights Most of Wells shorter tales are evidently taken from
the Forty Vezirs

 THE STORY OF JEWAD a Romance by Al Azz Efendi the Cretan
Translated from the Turkish by E J W Gibb MRAS c Glasgow


A modern Turkish work written in AH   It contains the
following tales


                          THE STORY OF JEWAD

 The Story of EbAlSn

 The Story of Monia Emn

 The Story of FerahNz the daughter of the King of China

  a The Story of Khoja Abdullah

 The Story told by Jewd to Iklilul Mulk

  a The Story of Shbr and Hum

  c The Story of Ghazanfer and Rhila

 The Story of Qara Khan

The following deserve notice from our present point of view

The Story of JewdHere we have magical illusions as in Nos  and
a Such narratives are common in the East Lane Nights ch i note
 is inclined to attribute such illusions to the influence of drugs
but the narratives seem rather to point to socalled electrobiology or
the Scotch Glamour such influences as is notorious acting far more
strongly upon Orientals than upon Europeans

 The Story of Monia Emn corresponds to the Story of Naerdan and
Guzulbec in Caylus Oriental Tales A story of magical illusions

 The Story of Ferah NzHere again we have a variant of Nos a and


a Khoja AbdultabThis is a version of the Story of Aboulcassem in
the Thousand and One Days

a Shbr and HumThe commencement of this story might have
suggested to Southey the adventures of Thalaba and Oneida in the Gardens
of Aloadin the remainder appears to be taken from the Story of the
young King of Thibet in the Thousand and One Days

 Qara KhanThe principal part of this story is borrowed from the
First Voyage of Aboulfawaris in the Thousand and One Days it has some
resemblance to the story of the Mountain of Loadstone in No c

 TUTINAMA I could hardly pass over the famous Persian and Turkish
ParrotBook quite without notice but its tales have rarely any direct
connection with those in The Nights and I have not attempted to go into
its very extensive bibliography


                           DR CLARKES MS

Dr Edward Daniel Clarke has given an account of an important MS nearly
agreeing with Bul and Mac which he purchased in Egypt in his
Travels in various countries of Europe Asia and Africa Part ii
Greece Egypt and the Holy Land Section i  App iii pp
 Unfortunately this MS was afterwards so damaged by water
during a shipwreck that it was rendered totally illegible The list of
tales as will be seen by the numbers in brackets which correspond to
our Table as far as the identifications are safe will show the
approximate contents of the MS but the list which is translated into
German by Habicht in the preface to his vol  was evidently compiled
carelessly by a person nearly ignorant of Arabic perhaps with the aid
of an interpreter Maltese or other and seems to abound with the most
absurd mistakes The full text of Clarkes App iii is as follows
List of One Hundred and Seventytwo Tales contained in a manuscript
copy of The Alif Lila va Lilin or Arabian Nights as it was
procured by the Author in Egypt

NBThe Arabic words mentioned in this list are given as they appeared
to be pronounced in English characters and of course therefore
adapted to English pronunciation

The number of tales amounts to  but one tale is supposed to occupy
many nights in the recital so that the whole number is divided into
One Thousand and One Nights It rarely happens that any two copies
of the Alif Lila va Lilin resemble each other This title is bestowed
upon any collection of Eastern tales divided into the same number of
parts The compilation depends upon the taste the caprice and the
opportunities of the scribe or the commands of his employer Certain
popular stories are common to almost all copies of the Arabian Nights
but almost every collection contains some tales which are not found in
every other Much depends upon the locality of the scribe The popular
stories of Egypt will be found to differ materially from those of
Constantinople A nephew of the late Wortley Montague living in
Rosetta had a copy of the Arabian Nights and upon comparing the two
manuscripts it appeared that out of the  tales here enumerated only
 were found in his manuscript In order to mark therefore the
stories which were common to the two manuscripts an asterisk has been
prefixed to the thirtyseven tales which appeared in both copies

IMITATIONS AND MISCELLANEOUS WORKS HAVING MORE OR LESS CONNECTION WITH
                              THE NIGHTS

The success of Gallands work led to the appearance of numerous works
more or less resembling it chiefly in England and France Similar
imitations though now less numerous have continued to appear down to
the present day

The most important of the older works of this class were published in
French in the Cabinet des Fes Amsterdam and Geneva  
vols in English in Tales of the East comprising the most popular
Romances of Oriental origin and the best imitations by European
authors with new translations and additional tales never before
published to which is prefixed an introductory dissertation containing
an account of each work and of its author or translator By Henry Weber
Esq Edinburgh   vols and in German in Tausend und ein Tag
Morgenlndische Erzhlungen aus dem Persisch Turkisch und Arabisch
nach Petis de la Croix Galland Cardonne Chavis und Cazotte dem
Grafen Caylus und Anderer bersetzt von F H von der Hagen
Prenzlau   vols In the Cabinet des Fes I find a
reference to an older collection of tales partly Oriental called the
Bibliothque des Fes et des Gnies by the Abb de la Porte which I
have not seen but which is in part incorporated in the Cabinet It
formed only  vols mo and was published in 

The examination of these tales is difficult for they comprise several
classes not always clearly defined

 Satires on The Nights themselves eg the Tales of the Count of
Hamilton

 Satires in an Oriental garb eg Beckfords Vathek

 Moral tales in an Oriental garb eg Mrs Sheridans Nourjahad

 Fantastic tales with nothing Oriental about them but the name eg
Stevensons New Arabian Nights

 Imitations pure and simple eg G Merediths Shaving of Shagpat

 Imitations more or less founded on genuine Oriental sources eg
the Tales of the Comte de Caylus

 Genuine Oriental Tales eg Mille et une Jours translated by
Petis de la Croix

Most of the tales belonging to Class  and some of those belonging to
Class  have been treated of in previous sections The remaining tales
and imitations will generally need only a very brief notice sometimes
only the title and the indication of the class to which they belong We
will begin with an enumeration of the Oriental contents of the Cabinet
des Fes adding W i ii and iii to show which are included in
Webers Tales of the East

Weber also includes in his vol ii Nos a   and  after
Caussin de Perceval

  The Adventures of Abdallah the Son of Hanif Class  or 

Originally published in  attributed to M de Bignon a young Abb
A series of romantic travels in which Eastern and Western fiction is
mixed for instance we have the story of the Rosetree which so far as
I know has nothing Oriental about it

 The Voyages of Zulma in Fairy Land Class 

European fairy tales with nothing Oriental about them but the names of
persons and places The work is unfinished

  The Tales of Bidpai translated by Galland are Indian and
therefore need no further notice here

 Chinese Tartarian and Mogul Tales Class 

Published in  and later by Thomas Simon Gueulette

Concerning these tales Mr Clouston remarks in litt Much of the
groundwork of these clever imitations of the Arabian Nights has been
directly or indirectly derived from Eastern sources for instance in
the socalled Tartar tales the adventures of the Young Calender find
parallels  in the wellknown Bidpai tale of the Brhman the
Sharpers and the Goat Kalila and Dimna Pnchatantra Hitopadesa c
and  in the worldwide story of the Farmer who outwitted the Six Men
Indian Antiquary vol  of which there are many versions current in
Europe such as the Norse tale of Big Peter and Little Peter the Danish
tale of Great Claus and Little Claus the German tale Grimm of the
Little Farmer the Irish tale of Little Fairy Samuel Lovers collection
of Irish Fairy Legends and Stories four Gaelic versions in Campbells
Popular Tales of the West Highlands a Kabail version in Rivires
French collection Contes populaires Kabylies Uncle Capriano in
Cranes recently published Italian Popular Tales and a Latin medival
version written probably in the th century in which the hero is
called Unibos because he had only one cow

 Oriental Tales Class 

Mr Clouston observes Appeared in  and on the title page are
said to have been translated from MSS in the Royal French Library The
stories are however largely the composition of De Caylus himself and
those elements of them which are traceable to Asiatic sources have been
considerably Frenchified

Nevertheless they are not without interest and are nearly all of
obviously Oriental origin One of the stories is a fantastic account of
the Birth of Mahomet including romantic travels largely borrowed from
No a Another story is a version of that of the Seven Sleepers
Other noteworthy tales are the story of the Dervish Abounader which
resembles Nos  and d and the story of Naerdan and Guzulbec
which is a tale of magical illusions similar to that of Monia Emin in
the Turkish story of Jewad

The Count de Caylus was the author of various European as well as
Oriental fairy tales Of his Oriental collection Sir R F Burton
remarksThe stories are not Eastern but Western fairy tales proper
with kings and queens giants and dwarfs and fairies good and bad
Barbets act as body guard and army Written in good old style and
free language such as for instance son ptenlaire with here and
there a touch of salt humour as in Rosanie Charmante reine car on na
jamais parl autrement  une reine quel que laide quelle ait t

  Tales of the Genii Class 

Written in the middle of the last century by Rev James Ridley but
purporting to be translated from the Persian of Horam the son of Asmar
by Sir Charles Morell

These tales have been reprinted many times but it is very doubtful if
they are based on any genuine Oriental sources The amount of Oriental
colouring may be guessed from the story of Urad who having consented to
become the bride of a Sultan on condition that he should dismiss all his
concubines and make her his sole queen like Harald Harfagr on his
marriage with Ragnhilda is presented to his loving subjects as their
Sultna

 Adventures of Zeloide and Amanzarifdine Indian Tales by M de
Moncrif Class 

Ordinary European Fairy Tales with the scene laid in the East

 Nourjahad by Mrs Sheridan Class 

An unworthy favourite is reformed by a course of practical moral lessons
conveyed by the Sultan through supposed supernatural agencies Mr
Clouston regards it as one of the very best of the imitations of
Eastern fiction The plot is ingeniously conceived and well wrought out
and the interest never flags throughout

 Pajons Oriental Tales Class  These demand no special notice

In addition to the above the following Oriental works are mentioned in
the Cabinet des Fes but not reprinted

a copy of an earlier edition of the same work Contes Orientaux tirs

taille douce  la Haye   vols mo polished calf gilt gilt
edges arms in gilt on the sides

The Preface says M Petit et M Galland nont en aucune connaissance

The Tales are from the MSS and translations sent by those despatched
by the French Ministers to Constantinople to learn Arabic c and so
become fit to act as Dragomans and Interpreters to the French Embassy

There is a copy of this work in the British Museum it proves as I
expected to be the series of tales subsequently attributed to the Count
de Caylus

In addition to the above the following of which I can only give the
names are mentioned in the Cabinet des Fes but not reprinted

The remaining imitations c known to me I shall place roughly in
chronological order premising that I fear the list must be very
incomplete and that I have met with very few except in English and
French


                               AFRENCH

 Zadig ou la Destine par Voltaire probably partakes of
classes  and  said to be partly based on Gueulettes Soires
Bretonnes published in  The latter is included in Cabinet des
Fes Vol 

 Vathek an Arabian Tale by William Beckford I include this book
here because it was written and first published in French Its
popularity was once very great and it contains some effective passages
though it belongs to Class  and is rather a parody than an imitation
of Oriental fiction The Caliph Vathek after committing many crimes at
the instance of his mother the witch Carathis in order to propitiate
Eblis finally starts on an expedition to Istakar On the way he
seduces Nourounihar the beautiful daughter of the Emir Fakreddin and
carries her with him to the Palace of Eblis where they are condemned to
wander eternally with their hearts surrounded with flames

This idea which is certainly not Oriental so far as I know took the
fancy of Byron who was a great admirer of Vathek and he has mixed it
with genuine Oriental features in a powerful passage in the Giaour
beginning

                 But thou false Infidel shalt writhe
                 Beneath avenging Monkirs scythe
                 And from its torment scape alone
                 To wander round lost Eblis throne
                 And fire unquenched unquenchable
                 Around within thy heart shall dwell
                 Nor ear can hear nor tongue can tell
                 The tortures of that inward hell c

How errors relative to Eastern matters are perpetuated is illustrated by
the fact that I have seen these lines quoted in some modern
philosophical work as descriptive of the hell in which the Mahommedans
believe

Southey in Thalaba b  speaks of the Sarsar the Icy Wind of
Death an expression which he probably borrowed from Vathek

 The Count of Hamiltons Fairy Tales Class There is an English
translation among Bohns Extra Volumes written shortly after the first
publication of Gallands work

 Les Mille et un Fadaises par Cazotte Class  I have not seen
them

 La Mille et deuxime Nuit par Theophilus Gautier Paris 
Probably Class  or  I have not seen it


                              BENGLISH

 The Vision of Mirza Addison in the Spectator Class 

 The Story of Amurath Class  I do not know the author I read it
in a juvenile book published about the end of last century entitled the
Pleasing Instructor

 The Persian Tales of Inatulla of Delhi Published in  by
Colonel Alexander Dow at Edinburgh A French translation appeared at
Amsterdam in two vols and in Paris in one vol  Class  Chiefly
founded on a wellknown Persian work of which a more correct though
still incomplete version was published in  vols by Jonathan Scott in
 under the title of Bahar Danush or Garden of Knowledge

 Rasselas by Samuel Johnson Class  Too well known to need
comment

 Almoran and Hamet by Dr Hawksworth Class  Very popular at the
beginning of the present century but now forgotten

 Oriental Fairy Tales London  Class  A series of very
pretty fairy tales by an anonymous author in which the scene is laid
in the East especially Egypt

 The Shaving of Shagpat by George Meredith London  Class
 I prefer this to most other imitations of an Oriental tale

 The Thousand and One Humbugs Classes  and  Published in
Household Words vol xi  pp   
Parodies on Nos   d and e f

 Eastern Tales by many storytellers Compiled and edited from
ancient and modern authors by Mrs Valentine author of Sea Fights and
Land Battles c Chandos Classics

In her preface the authoress states that the tales are gathered from
both ancient and modern French Italian and English sources

Contains  tales some genuine others imitations One Alischar and
Smaragdine is a genuine story of The Nights No  of our Table and
is probably taken from Trbutien Three tales Jalaladeen Haschem
and Jussuf are Grimms imitations taken probably from the composite
English edition of  and with the same illustrations The Seven
Sleepers and the Four Talismans are from the Count de Caylus
tales Halechalbe and Bohetzad our No  are from Chavis and
Cazotte The Enchanters and Urad are from the Tales of the Genii
and The Pantofles is the well known story of the miser Casem and his
slippers but I know not where it first appeared The remaining three
tales are unknown to me and as I have seen no volume of Italian
Oriental tales some no doubt are derived from the Italian sources of
which the authoress spoke They are the following The Prince and the
Lions The City of the Demons a Jewish story purporting to have been
written in England and Sadik Beg

 New Arabian Nights by R L Stevenson London 

 More New Arabian Nights The Dynamiter By R L Stevenson and
Vander Grift London  Class 

Of these tales Sir R F Burton observes The only visible connection
with the old Nights is in the habit of seeking adventures under a
disguise The method is to make the main idea possible and the details
extravagant In another New Arabian Nights the joint production of
MM Brookfield Besant and Pollock the reverse treatment is affected
the leading idea being grotesque and impossible and the details
accurate and lifelike


                               CGERMAN

It is quite possible that there are many imitations in German but I
have not met with them I can only mention one or two tales by Hauff
the Caliph turned Stork and the Adventures of Said a story called
Ali and Gulhindi by what author I do not now remember and some
imitations said to be by Grimm already mentioned in reference to the
English composite edition of  They are all European fairy tales in
an Eastern dress


                             CONCLUSION

Among books specially interesting to the student of The Nights I may
mention Weils Biblische Legenden der Muselmnner aus arabischen
Quellen zusammengetragen und mit jdischen Sagen verglichen
FrankfortonMain  An anonymous English translation appeared in
 under the title of The Bible the Koran and the Talmud and it
also formed one of the sources from which the Rev S BaringGould
compiled his Legends of Old Testament Characters  vols  The
late Prof Palmers Life of Haroun AlRaschid London  is not
much more than a brief popular sketch

The references to The Nights in English and other European literatures
are innumerable but I cannot refrain from quoting Mark Twains
identification of Henry the Eighth with Shahryar Huckleberry Finn
chap xxiii

Why you ought to see old Henry the Eighth when he was in bloom He
was a blossom He used to marry a new wife every day and chop off her
head next morning And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was
ordering up eggs Fetch up Nell Gwynne he says They fetch her up
Next morning Chop off her head And they chop it off Fetch up Jane
Shore he says and up she comes Next morning Chop off her head
And they chop it off Ring up Fair Rosamun Fair Rosamun answers the
bell Next morning Chop off her head And he made every one of them
tell him a tale every night and he kept that up till he had hogged a
thousand and one tales that way and then he put them all in a book and
called it Domesday Bookwhich was a good name and stated the case You
dont know kings Jim but I know them and this old rip of corn is one
of the cleanest Ive struck in history Well Henry he takes a notion
he wants to get up some trouble with this country How does he do
itgive noticegive the country a show No All of a sudden he heaves
all the tea in Boston Harbour overboard and whacks out a declaration of
independence and dares them to come on That was his stylehe never
give anybody a chance He had suspicions of his father the Duke of
Wellington Well what did he doask him to show up Nodrownded him in
a butt of mamsey like a cat Spose people left money laying around
where he waswhat did he do He collared it Spose he contracted to do a
thing and you paid him and didnt set down there and see that he done
itwhat did he do He always done the other thing Spose he opened his
mouthwhat then If he didnt shut it up powerful quick hed lose a lie
every time Thats the kind of a bug Henry was

volunteer support

necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition
