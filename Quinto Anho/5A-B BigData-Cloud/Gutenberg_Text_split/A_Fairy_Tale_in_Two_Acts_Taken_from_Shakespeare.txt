ACT I SCENE I

SCENE a Room in Quinces House


Enter Quince Snug Bottom Flute Snowt and Starveling

QUINCE

Is all our company here

Bot You were best to call them generally man by man according to
the scrip

Quin Here is the scrowl of every mans name which is thought
fit through all Athens to play in our interlude before the Duke and
Dutchess on his wedding day at night

Bot First good Peter Quince say what the play treats on then
read the names of the actors and so grow on to a point

Quin Marry our play is the most lamentable comedy and most cruel
death of Pyramus and Thisby

Bot A very good piece of work I assure you and a merry Now good
Peter Quince call forth your actors by the scrowl Masters spread
yourselves

Quin Answer as I call you Nick Bottom the weaver

Bot Ready Name what part I am for and proceed

Quin You Nick Bottom are set down for Pyramus

Bot What is Pyramus a lover or a tyrant

Quin A lover that kills himself most gallantly for love

Bot That will ask some tears in the true performing of it If I
do it let the audience look to their eyes I will move storms I will
condole in some measure To the rest yet my chief humour is for a
tyrant I could play Ercles rarely or a part to tear a cat in To
make all split the raging rocks and shivering shocks shall break the
locks of prisongates and Phibbus carr shall shine from far and make
and mar the foolish fates This was lofty Now name the rest of
the players This is Ercles vein a tyrants vein a lover is more
condoling

Quin Francis Flute the bellowsmender

Flu Here Peter Quince

Quin Flute you must take Thisby on you

Flu What is Thisby a wandring knight

Quin It is the Lady that Pyramus must love

Flu Nay faith let not me play a woman I have a beard coming

Quin Thats all one you shall play it in a mask and you may speak
small as you will

Bot An I may hide my face let me play Thisby too Ill speak in a
monstrous little voice Thisne Thisne ah Pyramus my lover dear thy
Thisby dear and lady dear

joiner you the Lions part I hope there is a play fitted

Snug Have you the Lions part written Pray you if it be give it
me for I am slow of study

Quin You may do it extempore for it is nothing but roaring

Bot Let me play the Lion too I will roar that I will do any mans
heart good to hear me I will roar that I will make the Duke say let
him roar again let him roar again

Quin If you should do it too terribly you would fright the
Dutchess and the Ladies that they would shriek and that were enough
to hang us all

All That would hang us every mothers son

Bot I grant you friends if you should fright the Ladies out of
their wits they would have no more discretion but to hang us but
I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
sucking dove I will roar you an twere any nightingale

Quin You can play no part but Pyramus for Pyramus is a sweet facd
man a proper man as one shall see in a summers day a most lovely
gentlemanlike man therefore you must needs play Pyramus

in

will play barefacd But masters here are your parts and I am to
intreat you request you and desire you to con them by tomorrow
night and meet me in the palacewood a mile without the town by
moonlight there we will rehearse for if we meet in the city we
shall be dogd with company and our devices known In the mean time
I will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants I pray you
fail me not

Bot We will meet and there we may rehearse more obscenely and
courageously Take pains be perfect adieu

Quin At the Dukes oak we meet

Bot But hold ye hold ye neighbours are your voices in order and

SONGfor Epilogue

By Quince Bottom Snug Flute Starveling Snout

Quin   Most noble Duke to us be kind
      Be you and all your courtiers blind
      That you may not our errors find
        But smile upon our sport
      For we are simple actors all
      Some fat some lean some short some tall
      Our pride is great our merit small
        Will that pray do at court

II

Starv   O would the Duke and Dutchess smile
       The court would do the same awhile
       But call us after low and vile
         And that way make their sport
       Nay would you still more pastime make
       And at poor we your purses shake
       Whateer you give well gladly take
         For that will do at court

Bot Well said my boys my hearts Sing but like nightingales thus
when you come to your misrepresentation and we are made for ever you
rogues so steal a way now to your homes without inspection meet me
at the Dukes oakby moon lightmums the word

All Mum

Exeunt all stealing out




SCENE a Wood


Enter a Fairy at one Door and Puck or Robingoodfellow at
another

Puck How now Spirit whither wander you

st Fai Over hill over dale
Through bush through brier
Over park over pale
Through flood through fire
I do wander every where
Swifter than the moons sphere
And I serve the Fairy Queen
To dew her orbs upon the green
I must go seek some dewdrops here
And hang a pearl in every cowslips ear

AIR

  Kingcup daffodil and rose
  Shall the fairy wreath compose
  Beauty sweetness and delight
  Crown our revels of the night
  Lightly trip it oer the green
  Where the Fairy ring is seen
  So no step of earthly tread
  Shall of end our Ladys head

  Virtue sometimes droops her wing
  Beauties bee may lose her sting
  Fairy land can both combine
  Roses with the eglantine
  Lightly be your measures seen
  Deftly footed oer the green
  Nor a spectres baleful head
  Peep at our nocturnal tread

Farewel thou lob of spirits Ill be gone
Our Queen and all her Elves come here anon

Puck The King doth keep his revels here tonight
Take heed the Queen come not within his sight
For they do square that all their Elves for fear
Creep into acorncups and hide them there

st Fai But why is Oberon so fell and wrath

Puck Because that she as her attendant hath
A lovely boy stoln from an Indian King
And she perforce withholds the changling
Tho jealous Oberon woud have the child
Knight of his train to trace the forests wild

st Fai Or I mistake your shape and making quite
Or else you are that shrewd and knavish Sprite
Calld Robingoodfellow

Puck Thou speakst aright
I am that merry wandrer of the night
I jest to Oberon and make him smile
Oft lurk in gossips bowl and her beguile
In very likeness of a roasted crab
And when she drinks against her lips I bob
And on her witherd dewlap pour the ale
The wisest aunt telling the saddest tale
Sometime for threefoot stool mistaketh me
Then slip I from her bum down topples she
And rails or cries and falls into a cough
And then the whole choir hold their hips and loffe

AIR

st Fai   Yes yes I know you you are he
           That frighten all the villagree
           Skim milk and labour in the quern
           And bootless make the huswife churn
           Or make the drink to bear no barm
           Laughing at their loss and harm
           But call you Robin and sweet Puck
           You do their work and bring good luck

           Yes you are that unlucky Sprite
           Like Willawhisp a wandring light
           Through ditch thro bog who lead astray
           Benighted swains who lose their way
           You pinch the slattern black and blue
           You silver drop in huswifes shoe
           For call you Robin and sweet Puck
           You do their work and bring good luck

Puck But make room Fairy here comes Oberon

st Fai And here my mistress Would that he were gone

Enter Oberon King of Fairies at one door with his train and the
Queen at another with hers

Ob Ill met by moonlight proud Titania

Queen What jealous Oberon Fairy skip hence
I have forsworn his bed and Company

Ob Tarry rash wanton Am not I thy Lord

Queen Then I must be thy Lady Why art thou here
Come from the farthest steep of India
But that forsooth the bouncing Amazon
Your buskind mistress and your warrior love
To Theseus must be wedded and you come
To give their bed joy and prosperity

Ob How canst thou thus for shame Titania
Glance at my credit with Hippolita
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus
Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
From Perigune whom he ravished
And make him with fair Egle break his faith
With Ariadne and Antiopa

Queen These are the forgeries of jealousy
And never since that middle summers spring
Met we on hill in dale forest or mead
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind
But with thy brawls thou hast disturbd our sport
The spring the summer
The chiding autumn angry winter change
Their wonted liveries and the amazed world
By their increase now knows not which is which
And this same progeny of evil comes
From our debate from our dissention
We are their parents and original

Ob Do you amend it then it lies in you
Why should Titania cross her Oberon
I do but beg a little changling boy
To be my henchman

Queen Set your heart at rest
The Fairyland buys not the child of me
His mother was a votress of my order
And in the spiced Indian air by night
Full often she hath gossipt by my side
And sat with me on Neptunes yellow sands
Marking th embarked traders of the flood
When we have laught to see the sails conceive
And grow bigbellied with the wanton wind
Which she with pretty and with swimming gait
Would imitate and sail upon the land
To fetch me trifles and return again
As from a voyage rich with merchandize
But she being mortal of that boy did die
And for her sake I do rear up her boy
And for her sake I will not part with him

Ob How long within this wood intend you stay

Queen Perchance till after Theseus weddingday
If you will patiently dance in our round
And see our moonlight revels go with us
If not shun me and I will spare your haunts

Ob Give me that boy and Ill go with thee

Queen Not for thy Fairy kingdom

AIR DUET

Queen   Away away
       I will not stay
         But fly from rage and thee

King    Begone begone
       Youll feel anon
         What tis to injure me

Queen   Away false man
       Do all you can
         I scorn your jealous rage

King    We will not part
       Take you my heart
         Give me your favourite page

Queen Ill keep my page

King   And I my rage
        Nor shall you injure me

Queen   Away away
       I will not stay
         But fly from rage and thee

Both  Away away c Exe Queen c

Ob Well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove
Till I torment thee for this injury
My gentle Puck come hither
There is a flowr the herb I shewd thee once
The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid
Will make a man or woman madly doat
Upon the next live creature that it sees
Fetch me that herb and be thou here again
Ere the leviathan can swim a league

Puck Ill put a girdle round about the earth
In forty minutes   Exit

Ob Having once this juice
Ill watch Titania when she is asleep
And drop the liquor of it in her eye
The next thing which she waking looks upon
Be it on bear lion wolf bull ape or monkey
She shall pursue it with the soul of love
And ere I take this charm off from her sight
As I can take it with another herb
Ill make her render up her page to me Exit

        Neer bends where we do walk




SCENE The Wood


Queen Now for the third part of a minute hence

Oberon squeeses the Juice of the Flower on the Queens Eyes

Ob What thou seest when thou dost wake

Pard or boar with bristled hair
In thy eye what shall appear
When thou wakst it is thy dear
Wake when some vile thing is near Exit Ob

AIR

st Fai Such the force of Magic Powr
         Of the juice of this small flower
         It shall jaundice so her sight
         Foul shall be fair and black seem white
         Then shall dreams and all their train
         Fill with Fantasies her brain
         Then no more her darling joy
         Shell resign her changeling boy

Exeunt

tyring house and we will do it in action as we will do it before the
Duke

Bot Peter Quince

Quin What sayst thou Bully Bottom

Bot There are things in this Comedy of Pyramus and Thisby that
will never please First Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself
which the Ladies cannot abide How answer you that

Snout Byrlaken a parlous fear

Starv I believe we must leave the killing out when all is done

Bot Not a whit I have a device to make all well write me a
prologue and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with
our swords and that Pyramus is not killd indeed and for more better
assurance tell them that I Pyramus am not Pyramus but Bottom the
weaver this will put them out of fear

Quin Well we will have such a prologue and it shall be written in
eight and six

Bot No make it two more let it be written in eight and eight

Snout Will not the Ladies be afraid of the Lion

Starv I fear it I promise you

Bot Masters you ought to consider with yourselves to bring in
heaven shield us a Lion among Ladies is a most dreadful thing for
there is not a more fearful wildfowl than your Lion living and we
ought to look to it

Snout Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a Lion

Bot Nay you must name his name and half his face must be seen
through the lions neck and he himself must speak through saying
thus or to the same defect Ladies or fair Ladies I would wish you
or I would request you or I would intreat you not to fear not to
tremble my life for yours if you think I come hither as a lion it
were pity of my life no I am no such thing I am a man as other men
are and there indeed let him name his name and tell them plainly He
is Snug the Joiner

Quin Well it shall be so but there is two hard things that
is to bring the moonlight into a chamber for you know Pyramus and
Thisby met by moonlight

Snug Doth the moon shine that night we play our play

Bot A kalendar a kalendar look into the almanack find out
moonshine find out moonshine

Quin Yes it doth shine that night

Bot Why then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window
where we play open and the moon may shine in at the casement

Quin Ay or else one must come in with a bush of throns and a
lanthern and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person of
moonshine Then there is another thing we must have a wall in
the great chamber for Pyramus and Thisby says the story did talk
through the chink of a wall

Snug You can never bring in a wall What say you Bottom

Bot Some man or other must present wall and let him have some
plaster or some loome or some roughcast about him to signify
wall Or let him hold his fingers thus and through the cranny shall
Pyramus and Thisby whisper

Quin If that may be then all is well Come sit down every
mothers son and rehearse your parts Pyramus you begin and when
you have spoken your speech enter into that brake and so every one
according to his cue

Enter Puck

Puck What hempen homespuns have we swaggering
here so near the cradle of the Fairy Queen
What a play towrd Ill be an auditor
An actor too perhaps if I see cause

Quin Speak Pyramus Thisby stand forth

Pyr Thisby the flower of odious savours sweet

Quin Odours odours

Pyr Odours savours sweet
So doth thy breath my dearest Thisby dear
But hark a voice Stay thou but here a while
And byandby I will to thee appear

Puck A stranger Pyramus than eer playd here
                    Aside
Now for a storm to drive these patches hence
       He waves his wand Thunder and Lightning

Quin O monstrous O strange We are haunted
Pray masters fly masters help

Exeunt Clowns

Puck Ill follow you Ill lead you about a round
  Thro bog thro bush thro brake thro briar
Sometimes a horse Ill be sometimes a hound
  A hog a headless bear sometimes a fire
And neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burn
Like horse hound hog bear fire at every turn

Exit

Enter Bottom

Bot Why do they let a little thunder frighten them away But I will
not stir from this place do what they can I will walk up and down
here and I will sing that they shall hear I am not afraid

Sings

AIR

  The ouselcock so black of hue
    With orangetawny bill
  The throstle with his note so true
    The wren with little quill

Queen What angel wakes me from my flowry bed

Bot Sings   The finch the sparrow and the lark
                  The plainsong cuckow grey
                Whose note full many a man doth mark
                  And dares not answer nay

Queen I pray thee gentle mortal sing again
Mine ear is much enamourd of thy note
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape
On the first view to say to swear I love thee

Bot Methinks mistress you should have little reason for that and
yet to say the truth reason and love keep little company together
nowadays The more the pity that some honest neighbours will not
make them friends Nay I can gleek upon occasion

Queen Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful

Bot Not so neither But if I had wit enough to get out of this
wood I have enough to serve mine own turn

Queen Out of this wood do not desire to go
Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no
I am a spirit of no common rate
The summer still doth tend upon my state
And I do love thee therefore go with me
Ill give thee Fairies to attend on thee
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep
And sing while thou on pressed flowrs doth sleep
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
That thou shalt like an airy Spirit go
Peaseblossom Cob Moth Mustardseed

Enter Peaseblossom Cobweb Moth Mustardseed Four Fairies

Pease Ready

Cob And I

Moth And I

Must And I Where shall we go

Queen Be kind and courteous to this Gentleman
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes
Feed him with apricots and dewberries
With purple grapes green figs and mulberries
The honeybags steal from the humble bees
And for nighttapers crop their waxen thighs
And light them at the fiery glowworms eyes
To have my love tobed and to arise
Nod to him Elves and do him courtesies

Pease Hail mortal hail

Cob Hail

Moth Hail

Queen Come wait upon him lead him to my bowr
  The moon methinks looks with a watry eye
And when she weeps weep evry little flower
  Lamenting some enforced chastity
Tie up my loves tongue bring him silently Exeunt




SCENE Another part of the Wood


Enter Oberon

Ob I wonder if Titania be awakd
Then what it was that next came in her eye
Which she must doat on in extremity

Enter Puck

Here comes my messenger how now mad sprite
What nightrule now about this haunted grove

Puck My mistress with a mortal is in love

Ob This falls out well and fortunate in truth
Now to my Queen and beg her Indian youth
And then I will her charmed eye release
From mortals view and all things shall be peace
Away away make no delay
We may effect this business yet ere day Exit Puck

  We will go through field and town
  We will trip it up and down

Exit Oberon

Bot I have a reasonable good ear in music

DUET By st and d Fairy

  Welcome welcome to this place
    Favorite of the Fairy Queen
  Zephyrs play around his face
    Wash ye dews his graceful mien

  Pluck the wings from butterflies
  To fan the moonbeams from his eyes
  Round him in eternal spring
  Grashoppers and crickets sing

  By the spangled starlight sheen
  Natures joy he walks the green
  Sweet voice fine shape and graceful mien
  Speak him thine O Fairy Queen

Queen Or say sweet love what thou desirst to eat
I have a ventrous Fairy that shall seek
The squirrels hoard and fetch thee new nuts

Bot I pray you let none of your people stir me I have an
exposition of sleep come upon me

Queen Sleep thou and I will wind thee in my arms
Fairies begone and be always away
So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
Gently entwist
O how I love thee how I doat on thee They sleep

Enter Puck at one door Oberon and st Fairy at another

Ob Welcome good Robin Seest thou this sweet sight
Her dotage now I do begin to pity
For meeting her of late behind the wood
I then did ask of her her changeling child
Which strait she gave me wherefore Ill undo
This hateful imperfection of her eyes
              He strokes her eyes with the flower
Now Fairy sing the charm

AIR

st Fai   Flower of this purple dye
           Hit with cupids archery
           Sink in apple of her eye
           When her lord she doth espy
           Let him shine as gloriously
           As the Phoebus of the sky
           When thou wakst if he be by
           Beg of him for remedy   Exit Fairy

Now my Titania wake you my sweet queen

Queen My Oberon What visions have I seen
Methought I was enamourd of a mortal

Ob There lies your love

Queen How came these things to pass
O how mine eyes do loath this visage now

Ob Silence awhile Robin remove the man
And you mean while Titania music call
And strike more dead than common deep his senses

Queen Musick ho musick such as charmeth sleep

AIR

  d Fai Orpheus with his lute made trees
  And the mountain tops that freeze
    Bow themselves when he did sing
  To his musick plants and flowers
  Ever spring as sun and showers
    There had made a lasting spring
  During this song the body is removed

Ob Come my Queen take hand with me
Now thou and I are new in amity

AIR

d Fai Sigh no more lady sigh no more
  Be not inconstant ever
One foot on sea and one on shore
  You can be happy never  Lark sings

Puck Fairy king attend and mark
I do hear the morning lark

Ob Then my Queen in silence sad
Trip we after the nights shade
We the globe can compass soon
Swifter than the wandring moon

Queen Come my lord and in our flight
Tell me how it came this night
That I sleeping here was found
With yon mortal on the ground

A Dance of Fairies
