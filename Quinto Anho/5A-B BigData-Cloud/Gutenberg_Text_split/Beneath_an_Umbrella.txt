                       BENEATH AN UMBRELLA

                     By Nathaniel Hawthorne



Pleasant is a rainy winters day within doors  The best study for
such a day or the best amusementcall it which you willis a
book of travels describing scenes the most unlike that  sombre one
which is mistily presented through the windows I have experienced
that fancy is then most successful in imparting distinct shapes and
vivid colors to  the objects which the author has spread upon his
page  and that his words become magic spells to summon up a  thousand
varied pictures  Strange landscapes glimmer through the familiar
walls of the room and outlandish  figures thrust themselves almost
within the sacred precincts of the hearth  Small as my chamber is it
has space enough to contain the oceanlike circumference  of an
Arabian desert its parched sands tracked by  the long line of a
caravan with the camels patiently  journeying through the heavy
sunshine Though my ceiling be not lofty yet I can pile up the
mountains of  Central Asia beneath it till their summits shine far
above the clouds of the middle atmosphere  And with  my humble
means a wealth that is not taxable I can transport hither the
magnificent merchandise of an Oriental bazaar and call a crowd of
purchasers from distant countries to pay a fair profit for the
precious articles which are displayed on all sides  True it is
however that amid the bustle of traffic or whatever else may seem to
be going on around me the raindrops will occasionally be heard to
patter against my windowpanes which look forth upon one of the
quietest streets in a New England town  After a time too the
visions vanish and will not appear again at my bidding  Then it
being nightfall a gloomy sense of unreality depresses my spirits and
impels me to venture out before the clock shall strike bedtime to
satisfy myself that the world is not entirely made up of such shadowy
materials as have busied me throughout the day  A dreamer may dwell
so long among fantasies that the things without him will seem as
unreal as those within

When eve has fairly set in therefore I sally forth tightly
buttoning my shaggy overcoat and hoisting my umbrella the silken
dome of which immediately resounds with the heavy drumming of the
invisible raindrops  Pausing on the lowest doorstep I contrast the
warmth and cheerfulness of my deserted fireside with the drear
obscurity and chill discomfort into which I am about to plunge  Now
come fearful auguries innumerable as the drops of rain  Did not my
manhood cry shame upon me I should turn back within doors resume my
elbowchair my slippers and my book pass such an evening of
sluggish enjoyment as the day has been and go to bed inglorious  The
same shivering reluctance no doubt has quelled for a moment the
adventurous spirit of many a traveller when his feet which were
destined to measure the earth around were leaving their last tracks
in the homepaths

In my own case poor human nature may be allowed a few misgivings  I
look upward and discern no sky not even an unfathomable void but
only a black impenetrable nothingness as though heaven and all its
lights were blotted from the system of the universe  It is as if
nature were dead and the world had put on black and the clouds were
weeping for her  With their tears upon my cheek I turn my eyes
earthward but find little consolation here below  A lamp is burning
dimly at the distant corner and throws just enough of light along the
street to show and exaggerate by so faintly showing the perils and
difficulties which beset my path  Yonder dingily white remnant of a
huge snowbankwhich will yet cumber the sidewalk till the latter
days of Marchover or through that wintry waste must I stride
onward  Beyond lies a certain Slough of Despond a concoction of mud
and liquid filth ankledeep legdeep neckdeepin a word of
unknown bottom on which the lamplight does not even glimmer but which
I have occasionally watched in the gradual growth of its horrors
from morn till nightfall Should I flounder into its depths farewell
to upper earth  And hark how roughly resounds the roaring of a
stream the turbulent career of which is partially reddened by the
gleam of the lamp but elsewhere brawls noisily through the densest
gloom  O should I be swept away in fording that impetuous and
unclean torrent the coroner will have a job with an unfortunate
gentleman who would fain end his troubles anywhere but in a mudpuddle

Pshaw  I will linger not another instant at arms length from these
dim terrors which grow more obscurely formidable the longer I delay
to grapple with them  Now for the onset  And to with little damage
save a dash of rain in the fact and breast a splash of mud high up
the pantaloons and the left boot full of icecold water behold me at
the corner of the street  The lamp throws down a circle of red light
around me and twinkling onward from corner to corner I discern other
beacons marshalling my way to a brighter scene  But this is alone
some and dreary spot The tall edifices bid gloomy defiance to the
storm with their blinds all closed even as a man winks when he faces
a spattering gust  How loudly tinkles the collected rain down the tin
spouts The puffs of wind are boisterous and seem to assail me from
various quarters at once  I have often observed that this corner is a
haunt and loiteringplace for those winds which have no work to do
upon the deep dashing ships against our ironbound shores nor in the
forest tearing up the sylvan giants with half a rood of soil at their
vast roots  Here they amuse themselves with lesser freaks of
mischief  See at this moment how they assail yonder poor woman who
is passing just within the verge of the lamplight  One blast
struggles for her umbrella and turns it wrong side outward another
whisks the cape of her cloak across her eyes while a third takes most
unwarrantable liberties with the lower part of her attire  Happily
the good dame is no gossamer but a figure of rotundity and fleshly
substance else would these aerial tormentors whirl her aloft like a
witch upon a broomstick and set her down doubtless in the filthiest
kennel hereabout

From hence I tread upon firm pavements into the centre of the town
Here there is almost as brilliant an illumination as when some great
victory has been won either on the battlefield or at the polls  Two
rows of shops with windows down nearly to the ground cast a glow
from side to side while the black night hangs overhead like a canopy
and thus keeps the splendor from diffusing itself away  The wet
sidewalks gleam with a broad sheet of red light  The raindrops
glitter as if the sky were pouring down rubies  The spouts gush with
fire  Methinks the scene is an emblem of the deceptive glare which
mortals throw around their footsteps in the moral world thus
bedazzling themselves till they forget the impenetrable obscurity
that hems them in and that can be dispelled only by radiance from
above And after all it is a cheerless scene and cheerless are the
wanderers in it  Here comes one who has so long been familiar with
tempestuous weather that he takes the bluster of the storm for a
friendly greeting as if it should say  How fare ye brother
He is a retired seacaptain wrapped in some nameless garment of the
peajacket order and is now laying his course towards the Marine
Insurance Office there to spin yarns of gale and shipwreck with a
crew of old seadogs like himself  The blast will put in its word
among their hoarse voices and be understood by all of them  Next I
meet an unhappy slipshod gentleman with a cloak flung hastily over
his shoulders running a race with boisterous winds and striving to
glide between the drops of rain  Some domestic emergency or other has
blown this miserable man from his warm fireside in quest of a doctor
See that little vagabondhow carelessly he has taken his stand right
underneath a spout while staring at some object of curiosity in a
shopwindow  Surely the rain is his native element he must have
fallen with it from the clouds as frogs are supposed to do

Here is a picture and a pretty one  A young man and a girl both
enveloped in cloaks and huddled beneath the scanty protection of a
cotton umbrella  She wears rubber overshoes but he is in his
dancingpumps and they are on their way no doubt to sonic
cotillonparty or subscriptionball at a dollar a head refreshments
included  Thus they struggle against the gloomy tempest lured onward
by a vision of festal splendor But ah a most lamentable disaster
Bewildered by the red blue and yellow meteors in an apothecarys
window they have stepped upon a slippery remnant of ice and are
precipitated into a confluence of swollen floods at the corner of two
streets Luckless lovers  Were it my nature to be other than a
lookeron in life I would attempt your rescue  Since that may not
be I vow should you be drowned to weave such a pathetic story of
your fate as shall call forth tears enough to drown you both anew
Do ye touch bottom my young friends  Yes they emerge like a
waternymph and a river deity and paddle hand in hand out of the depths
of the dark pool  They hurry homeward dripping disconsolate abashed
but with love too warm to be chilled by the cold water  They have
stood a test which proves too strong for many  Faithful though over
head and ears in trouble

Onward I go deriving a sympathetic joy or sorrow from the varied
aspect of mortal affairs even as my figure catches a gleam from the
lighted windows or is blackened by an interval of darkness Not that
mine is altogether a chameleon spirit with no hue of its own  Now I
pass into a more retired street where the dwellings of wealth and
poverty are intermingled presenting a range of strongly contrasted
pictures  Here too may be found the golden mean  Through yonder
casement I discern a family circlethe grandmother the parents and
the childrenall flickering shadowlike in the glow of a woodfire
Bluster fierce blast and beat thou wintry rain against the
windowpanes  Ye cannot damp the enjoyment of that fireside Surely
my fate is hard that I should be wandering homeless here taking to
my bosom night and storm and solitude instead of wife and children
Peace murmurer  Doubt not that darker guests are sitting round the
hearth though the warm blaze hides all but blissful images  Well
here is still a brighter scene A stately mansion illuminated for a
ball with cutglass chandeliers and alabaster lamps in every room
and sunny landscapes hanging round the walls  See a coach has
stopped whence emerges a slender beauty who canopied by two
umbrellas glides within the portal and vanishes amid lightsome
thrills of music  Will she ever feel the nightwind and the rain
Perhapsperhaps  And will Death and Sorrow ever enter that proud
mansion  As surely as the dancers will be gay within its halls
tonight  Such thoughts sadden yet satisfy my heart for they teach me
that the poor man in his mean weatherbeaten hovel without a fire
to cheer him may call the rich his brother brethren by Sorrow who
must be an inmate of both their householdsbrethren by Death who
will lead them both to other homes

Onward still onward I plunge into the night  Now have I reached the
utmost limits of the town where the last lamp struggles feebly with
the darkness like the farthest star that stands sentinel on the
borders of uncreated space  It is strange what sensations of
sublimity may spring from a very humble source  Such are suggested by
this hollow roar of a subterranean cataract where the mighty stream
of a kennel precipitates itself beneath an iron grate and is seen no
more on earth  Listen awhile to its voice of mystery and fancy will
magnify it till you start and smile at the illusion  And now another
soundthe rumbling of wheelsas the mailcoach outward bound
rolls heavily off the pavements and splashes through the mud and
water of the road  All night long the poor passengers will be tossed
to and fro between drowsy watch and troubled sleep and will dream of
their own quiet beds and awake to find themselves still jolting
onward  Happier my lot who will straightway hie me to my familiar
room and toast myself comfortably before the fire musing and
fitfully dozing and fancying a strangeness in such sights as all may
see  But first let me gaze at this solitary figure who comes
hitherward with a tin lantern which throws the circular pattern of
its punched holes on the ground about him He passes fearlessly into
the unknown gloom whither I will not follow him

This figure shall supply me with a moral wherewith for lack of a
more appropriate one I may wind up my sketch  He fears not to tread
the dreary path before him because his lantern which was kindled at
the fireside of his home will light him back to that same fireside
again  And thus we nightwanderers through a stormy and dismal
world if we bear the lamp of Faith enkindled at a celestial fire it
will surely lead us home to that Heaven whence its radiance was
borrowed
