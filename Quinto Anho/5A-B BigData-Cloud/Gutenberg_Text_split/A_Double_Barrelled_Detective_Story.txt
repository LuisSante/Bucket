A DOUBLE BARRELLED DETECTIVE STORY

By Mark Twain




PART I

     We ought never to do wrong when people are looking




I

The first scene is in the country in Virginia the time  There
has been a wedding between a handsome young man of slender means and
a rich young girla case of love at first sight and a precipitate
marriage a marriage bitterly opposed by the girls widowed father

Jacob Fuller the bridegroom is twentysix years old is of an old but
unconsidered family which had by compulsion emigrated from Sedgemoor
and for King Jamess purses profit so everybody saidsome maliciously
the rest merely because they believed it The bride is nineteen and
beautiful She is intense highstrung romantic immeasurably proud of
her Cavalier blood and passionate in her love for her young husband
For its sake she braved her fathers displeasure endured his
reproaches listened with loyalty unshaken to his warning predictions
and went from his house without his blessing proud and happy in the
proofs she was thus giving of the quality of the affection which had
made its home in her heart

The morning after the marriage there was a sad surprise for her Her
husband put aside her proffered caresses and said

Sit down I have something to say to you I loved you That was
before I asked your father to give you to me His refusal is not my
grievanceI could have endured that But the things he said of me to
youthat is a different matter Thereyou neednt speak I know quite
well what they were I got them from authentic sources Among other
things he said that my character was written in my face that I was
treacherous a dissembler a coward and a brute without sense of
pity or compassion the Sedgemoor trademark he called itand
whitesleeve badge Any other man in my place would have gone to his
house and shot him down like a dog I wanted to do it and was minded
to do it but a better thought came to me to put him to shame to break
his heart to kill him by inches How to do it Through my treatment
of you his idol I would marry you and thenHave patience You will
see

From that moment onward for three months the young wife suffered all
the humiliations all the insults all the miseries that the diligent
and inventive mind of the husband could contrive save physical injuries
only Her strong pride stood by her and she kept the secret of her
troubles Now and then the husband said Why dont you go to your
father and tell him Then he invented new tortures applied them and
asked again She always answered He shall never know by my mouth and
taunted him with his origin said she was the lawful slave of a scion of
slaves and must obey and wouldup to that point but no further he
could kill her if he liked but he could not break her it was not in
the Sedgemoor breed to do it At the end of the three months he said
with a dark significance in his manner I have tried all things but
oneand waited for her reply Try that she said and curled her lip
in mockery

That night he rose at midnight and put on his clothes then said to her

Get up and dress

She obeyedas always without a word He led her half a mile from the
house and proceeded to lash her to a tree by the side of the public
road and succeeded she screaming and struggling He gagged her then
struck her across the face with his cowhide and set his bloodhounds
on her They tore the clothes off her and she was naked He called the
dogs off and said

You will be foundby the passing public They will be dropping along
about three hours from now and will spread the newsdo you hear
Goodby You have seen the last of me

He went away then She moaned to herself

I shall bear a childto him God grant it may be a boy

The farmers released her byandbyand spread the news which was
natural They raised the country with lynching intentions but the bird
had flown The young wife shut herself up in her fathers house he shut
himself up with her and thenceforth would see no one His pride was
broken and his heart so he wasted away day by day and even his
daughter rejoiced when death relieved him

Then she sold the estate and disappeared




II

In  a young woman was living in a modest house near a secluded New
England village with no company but a little boy about five years old
She did her own work she discouraged acquaintanceships and had none
The butcher the baker and the others that served her could tell the
villagers nothing about her further than that her name was Stillman and
that she called the child Archy Whence she came they had not been able
to find out but they said she talked like a Southerner The child had
no playmates and no comrade and no teacher but the mother She
taught him diligently and intelligently and was satisfied with the
resultseven a little proud of them One day Archy said

Mamma am I different from other children

Well I suppose not Why

There was a child going along out there and asked me if the postman had
been by and I said yes and she said how long since I saw him and I
said I hadnt seen him at all and she said how did I know hed been by
then and I said because I smelt his track on the sidewalk and she said
I was a durn fool and made a mouth at me What did she do that for

The young woman turned white and said to herself Its a birthmark
The gift of the bloodhound is in him She snatched the boy to her
breast and hugged him passionately saying God has appointed the way
 Her eyes were burning with a fierce light and her breath came short and
quick with excitement She said to herself The puzzle is solved now
many a time it has been a mystery to me the impossible things the child
has done in the dark but it is all clear to me now

She set him in his small chair and said

Wait a little till I come dear then we will talk about the matter

She went up to her room and took from her dressingtable several small
articles and put them out of sight a nailfile on the floor under the
bed a pair of nailscissors under the bureau a small ivory paperknife
under the wardrobe Then she returned and said

There I have left some things which I ought to have brought down She
named them and said Run up and bring them dear

The child hurried away on his errand and was soon back again with the
things

Did you have any difficulty dear

No mamma I only went where you went

During his absence she had stepped to the bookcase taken several books
from the bottom shelf opened each passed her hand over a page noting
its number in her memory then restored them to their places Now she
said

I have been doing something while you have been gone Archy Do you
think you can find out what it was

The boy went to the bookcase and got out the books that had been
touched and opened them at the pages which had been stroked

The mother took him in her lap and said

I will answer your question now dear I have found out that in one way
you are quite different from other people You can see in the dark
you can smell what other people cannot you have the talents of a
bloodhound They are good and valuable things to have but you must keep
the matter a secret If people found it out they would speak of you
as an odd child a strange child and children would be disagreeable to
you and give you nicknames In this world one must be like everybody
else if he doesnt want to provoke scorn or envy or jealousy It is a
great and fine distinction which has been born to you and I am glad
but you will keep it a secret for mammas sake wont you

The child promised without understanding

All the rest of the day the mothers brain was busy with excited
thinkings with plans projects schemes each and all of them uncanny
grim and dark Yet they lit up her face lit it with a fell light
of their own lit it with vague fires of hell She was in a fever of
unrest she could not sit stand read sew there was no relief for
her but in movement She tested her boys gift in twenty ways and kept
saying to herself all the time with her mind in the past He broke my
fathers heart and night and day all these years I have tried and all
in vain to think out a way to break his I have found it nowI have
found it now

When night fell the demon of unrest still possessed her She went on
with her tests with a candle she traversed the house from garret to
cellar hiding pins needles thimbles spools under pillows under
carpets in cracks in the walls under the coal in the bin then sent
the little fellow in the dark to find them which he did and was happy
and proud when she praised him and smothered him with caresses

From this time forward life took on a new complexion for her She said
The future is secureI can wait and enjoy the waiting The most
of her lost interests revived She took up music again and languages
drawing painting and the other longdiscarded delights of her
maidenhood She was happy once more and felt again the zest of life
As the years drifted by she watched the development of her boy and was
contented with it Not altogether but nearly that The soft side of his
heart was larger than the other side of it It was his only defect in
her eyes But she considered that his love for her and worship of
her made up for it He was a good haterthat was well but it was a
question if the materials of his hatreds were of as tough and enduring a
quality as those of his friendshipsand that was not so well


The years drifted on Archy was become a handsome shapely athletic
youth courteous dignified companionable pleasant in his ways and
looking perhaps a trifle older than he was which was sixteen One
evening his mother said she had something of grave importance to say to
him adding that he was old enough to hear it now and old enough and
possessed of character enough and stability enough to carry out a stern
plan which she had been for years contriving and maturing Then she told
him her bitter story in all its naked atrociousness For a while the
boy was paralyzed then he said

I understand We are Southerners and by our custom and nature there is
but one atonement I will search him out and kill him

Kill him No Death is release emancipation death is a favor Do I
owe him favors You must not hurt a hair of his head

The boy was lost in thought awhile then he said

You are all the world to me and your desire is my law and my pleasure
Tell me what to do and I will do it

The mothers eyes beamed with satisfaction and she said

You will go and find him I have known his hidingplace for eleven
years it cost me five years and more of inquiry and much money to
locate it He is a quartzminer in Colorado and welltodo He lives
in Denver His name is Jacob Fuller Thereit is the first time I have
spoken it since that unforgettable night Think That name could have
been yours if I had not saved you that shame and furnished you a cleaner
one You will drive him from that place you will hunt him down and
drive him again and yet again and again and again persistently
relentlessly poisoning his life filling it with mysterious terrors
loading it with weariness and misery making him wish for death and
that he had a suicides courage you will make of him another Wandering
Jew he shall know no rest any more no peace of mind no placid sleep
you shall shadow him cling to him persecute him till you break his
heart as he broke my fathers and mine

I will obey mother

I believe it my child The preparations are all made everything is
ready Here is a letter of credit spend freely there is no lack of
money At times you may need disguises I have provided them also some
other conveniences She took from the drawer of the typewritertable
several squares of paper They all bore these typewritten words

                            REWARD

It is believed that a certain man who is wanted in an Eastern state is
sojourning here In  in the night he tied his young wife to a tree
by the public road cut her across the face with a cowhide and made his
dogs tear her clothes from her leaving her naked He left her there
and fled the country A bloodrelative of hers has searched for him for
seventeen years Address  Postoffice The above
reward will be paid in cash to the person who will furnish the seeker
in a personal interview the criminals address

When you have found him and acquainted yourself with his scent you
will go in the night and placard one of these upon the building
he occupies and another one upon the postoffice or in some other
prominent place It will be the talk of the region At first you must
give him several days in which to force a sale of his belongings at
something approaching their value We will ruin him byandby but
gradually we must not impoverish him at once for that could bring him
to despair and injure his health possibly kill him

She took three or four more typewritten forms from the
drawerduplicatesand read one

      
     To Jacob Fuller

You have days in which to settle your affairs You will not
be disturbed during that limit which will expire at  M on
the of You must then MOVE ON If you are still in the
place after the named hour I will placard you on all the dead walls
detailing your crime once more and adding the date also the scene of
it with all names concerned including your own Have no fear of bodily
injuryit will in no circumstances ever be inflicted upon you You
brought misery upon an old man and ruined his life and broke his heart
What he suffered you are to suffer

You will add no signature He must receive this before he learns of the
rewardplacardbefore he rises in the morninglest he lose his head
and fly the place penniless

I shall not forget

You will need to use these forms only in the beginningonce may be
enough Afterward when you are ready for him to vanish out of a place
see that he gets a copy of this form which merely says

              MOVE ON  You have  days

He will obey That is sure

Extracts from letters to the mother

DENVER April  
I have now been living several days in the same hotel with Jacob Fuller
I have his scent I could track him through ten divisions of infantry
and find him I have often been near him and heard him talk He owns a
good mine and has a fair income from it but he is not rich He learned
mining in a good wayby working at it for wages He is a cheerful
creature and his fortythree years sit lightly upon him he could pass
for a younger mansay thirtysix or thirtyseven He has never married
againpasses himself off for a widower He stands well is liked is
popular and has many friends Even I feel a drawing toward himthe
paternal blood in me making its claim How blind and unreasoning and
arbitrary are some of the laws of naturethe most of them in fact
My task is become hard nowyou realize it you comprehend and make
allowancesand the fire of it has cooled more than I like to confess
to myself But I will carry it out Even with the pleasure paled the
duty remains and I will not spare him

And for my help a sharp resentment rises in me when I reflect that he
who committed that odious crime is the only one who has not suffered by
it The lesson of it has manifestly reformed his character and in
the change he is happy He the guilty party is absolved from
all suffering you the innocent are borne down with it But be
comfortedhe shall harvest his share


SILVER GULCH May 
I placarded Form No  at midnight of April  an hour later I slipped
Form No  under his chamber door notifying him to leave Denver at or
before  the night of the th

Some late bird of a reporter stole one of my placards then hunted the
town over and found the other one and stole that In this manner he
accomplished what the profession call a scoopthat is he got a
valuable item and saw to it that no other paper got it And so his
paperthe principal one in the townhad it in glaring type on the
editorial page in the morning followed by a Vesuvian opinion of our
wretch a column long which wound up by adding a thousand dollars to our
reward on the papers account The journals out here know how to do the
noble thingwhen theres business in it

At breakfast I occupied my usual seatselected because it afforded a
view of papa Fullers face and was near enough for me to hear the talk
that went on at his table Seventyfive or a hundred people were in the
room and all discussing that item and saying they hoped the seeker
would find that rascal and remove the pollution of his presence from the
townwith a rail or a bullet or something

When Fuller came in he had the Notice to Leavefolded upin one hand
and the newspaper in the other and it gave me more than half a pang to
see him His cheerfulness was all gone and he looked old and pinched
and ashy And thenonly think of the things he had to listen to Mamma
he heard his own unsuspecting friends describe him with epithets and
characterizations drawn from the very dictionaries and phrasebooks of
Satans own authorized editions down below And more than that he had
to agree with the verdicts and applaud them His applause tasted bitter
in his mouth though he could not disguise that from me and it was
observable that his appetite was gone he only nibbled he couldnt eat
Finally a man said

It is quite likely that that relative is in the room and hearing what
this town thinks of that unspeakable scoundrel I hope so

Ah dear it was pitiful the way Fuller winced and glanced around
scared He couldnt endure any more and got up and left

During several days he gave out that he had bought a mine in Mexico and
wanted to sell out and go down there as soon as he could and give the
property his personal attention He played his cards well said he would
take a quarter in cash the rest in safe notes but that as he
greatly needed money on account of his new purchase he would diminish
his terms for cash in full He sold out for  And then what do
you think he did He asked for greenbacks and took them saying the
man in Mexico was a NewEnglander with a head full of crotchets and
preferred greenbacks to gold or drafts People thought it queer since a
draft on New York could produce greenbacks quite conveniently There was
talk of this odd thing but only for a day that is as long as any topic
lasts in Denver

I was watching all the time As soon as the sale was completed and the
money paidwhich was on the thI began to stick to Fullers track
without dropping it for a moment That nightno th for it was a
little past midnightI tracked him to his room which was four doors
from mine in the same hall then I went back and put on my muddy
daylaborer disguise darkened my complexion and sat down in my room in
the gloom with a gripsack handy with a change in it and my door ajar
For I suspected that the bird would take wing now In half an hour an
old woman passed by carrying a grip I caught the familiar whiff and
followed with my grip for it was Fuller He left the hotel by a side
entrance and at the corner he turned up an unfrequented street and
walked three blocks in a light rain and a heavy darkness and got into
a twohorse hack which of course was waiting for him by appointment
I took a seat uninvited on the trunk platform behind and we drove
briskly off We drove ten miles and the hack stopped at a way station
and was discharged Fuller got out and took a seat on a barrow under
the awning as far as he could get from the light I went inside and
watched the ticketoffice Fuller bought no ticket I bought none
Presently the train came along and he boarded a car I entered the same
car at the other end and came down the aisle and took the seat behind
him When he paid the conductor and named his objective point I dropped
back several seats while the conductor was changing a bill and when he
came to me I paid to the same placeabout a hundred miles westward

From that time for a week on end he led me a dance He travelled here and
there and yonderalways on a general westward trendbut he was not a
woman after the first day He was a laborer like myself and wore bushy
false whiskers His outfit was perfect and he could do the character
without thinking about it for he had served the trade for wages His
nearest friend could not have recognized him At last he located himself
here the obscurest little mountain camp in Montana he has a shanty
and goes out prospecting daily is gone all day and avoids society
I am living at a miners boardinghouse and it is an awful place the
bunks the food the dirteverything

We have been here four weeks and in that time I have seen him but
once but every night I go over his track and post myself As soon as he
engaged a shanty here I went to a town fifty miles away and telegraphed
that Denver hotel to keep my baggage till I should send for it I need
nothing here but a change of army shirts and I brought that with me


SILVER GULCH June 

The Denver episode has never found its way here I think I know the
most of the men in camp and they have never referred to it at least
in my hearing Fuller doubtless feels quite safe in these conditions He
has located a claim two miles away in an outoftheway place in the
mountains it promises very well and he is working it diligently Ah
but the change in him He never smiles and he keeps quite to himself
consorting with no onehe who was so fond of company and so cheery
only two months ago I have seen him passing along several times
recentlydrooping forlorn the spring gone from his step a pathetic
figure He calls himself David Wilson

I can trust him to remain here until we disturb him Since you insist I
will banish him again but I do not see how he can be unhappier than he
already is I will go hack to Denver and treat myself to a little season
of comfort and edible food and endurable beds and bodily decency
then I will fetch my things and notify poor papa Wilson to move on


DENVER June 

They miss him here They all hope he is prospering in Mexico and they
do not say it just with their mouths but out of their hearts You know
you can always tell I am loitering here overlong I confess it But if
you were in my place you would have charity for me Yes I know what you
will say and you are right if I were in your place and carried your
scalding memories in my heart

I will take the night train back tomorrow


DENVER June 

God forgive us mother we are hunting the wrong man I have not slept
any all night I am now awaiting at dawn for the morning trainand
how the minutes drag how they drag

This Jacob Fuller is a cousin of the guilty one How stupid we have been
not to reflect that the guilty one would never again wear his own name
after that fiendish deed The Denver Fuller is four years younger than
the other one he came here a young widower in  aged twentyonea
year before you were married and the documents to prove it are
innumerable Last night I talked with familiar friends of his who have
known him from the day of his arrival I said nothing but a few days
from now I will land him in this town again with the loss upon his mine
made good and there will be a banquet and a torchlight procession
and there will not be any expense on anybody but me Do you call this
gush I am only a boy as you well know it is my privilege Byandby
I shall not be a boy any more


SILVER GULCH July 

Mother he is gone Gone and left no trace The scent was cold when I
came Today I am out of bed for the first time since I wish I were not
a boy then I could stand shocks better They all think he went west
I start tonight in a wagontwo or three hours of that then I get a
train I dont know where Im going but I must go to try to keep still
would be torture

Of course he has effaced himself with a new name and a disguise This
means that I may have to search the whole globe to find him Indeed it
is what I expect Do you see mother It is I that am the Wandering Jew
The irony of it We arranged that for another

Think of the difficulties And there would be none if I only could
advertise for him But if there is any way to do it that would not
frighten him I have not been able to think it out and I have tried
till my brains are addled If the gentleman who lately bought a mine
in Mexico and sold one in Denver will send his address to to whom
mother it will be explained to him that it was all a mistake his
forgiveness will be asked and full reparation made for a loss which he
sustained in a certain matter Do you see He would think it a trap
Well any one would If I should say It is now known that he was not
the man wanted but another mana man who once bore the same name but
discarded it for good reasonswould that answer But the Denver people
would wake up then and say Oho and they would remember about the
suspicious greenbacks and say Why did he run away if he wasnt the
right manit is too thin If I failed to find him he would be ruined
therethere where there is no taint upon him now You have a better
head than mine Help me

I have one clue and only one I know his handwriting If he puts his
new false name upon a hotel register and does not disguise it too much
it will be valuable to me if I ever run across it


SAN FRANCISCO June  

You already know how well I have searched the states from Colorado to
the Pacific and how nearly I came to getting him once Well I have had
another close miss It was here yesterday I struck his trail hot on
the street and followed it on a run to a cheap hotel That was a costly
mistake a dog would have gone the other way But I am only part dog
and can get very humanly stupid when excited He had been stopping in
that house ten days I almost know now that he stops long nowhere
the past six or eight months but is restless and has to keep moving I
understand that feeling and I know what it is to feel it He still uses
the name he had registered when I came so near catching him nine months
agoJames Walker doubtless the same he adopted when he fled from
Silver Gulch An unpretending man and has small taste for fancy names
I recognized the hand easily through its slight disguise A square man
and not good at shams and pretenses

They said he was just gone on a journey left no address didnt say
where he was going looked frightened when asked to leave his address
had no baggage but a cheap valise carried it off on foota stingy old
person and not much loss to the house Old I suppose he is now I
hardly heard I was there but a moment I rushed along his trail and
it led me to a wharf Mother the smoke of the steamer he had taken was
just fading out on the horizon I should have saved half an hour if I
had gone in the right direction at first I could have taken a fast tug
and should have stood a chance of catching that vessel She is bound for
Melbourne


HOPE CANYON CALIFORNIA October  

You have a right to complain A letter a year is a paucity I freely
acknowledge it but how can one write when there is nothing to write
about but failures No one can keep it up it breaks the heart

I told youit seems ages ago nowhow I missed him at Melbourne and
then chased him all over Australasia for months on end

Well then after that I followed him to India almost saw him in
Bombay traced him all aroundto Baroda RawalPindi Lucknow Lahore
Cawnpore Allahabad Calcutta Madrasoh everywhere week after week
month after month through the dust and swelteralways approximately on
his track sometimes close upon him yet never catching him And down to
Ceylon and then toNever mind byandby I will write it all out

I chased him home to California and down to Mexico and back again to
California Since then I have been hunting him about the state from the
first of last January down to a month ago I feel almost sure he is not
far from Hope Canyon I traced him to a point thirty miles from here
but there I lost the trail some one gave him a lift in a wagon I
suppose

I am taking a rest nowmodified by searchings for the lost trail
I was tired to death mother and lowspirited and sometimes coming
uncomfortably near to losing hope but the miners in this little camp
are good fellows and I am used to their sort this long time back and
their breezy ways freshen a person up and make him forget his troubles
I have been here a month I am cabining with a young fellow named
Sammy Hillyer about twentyfive the only son of his motherlike
meand loves her dearly and writes to her every weekpart of which
is like me He is a timid body and in the matter of intellectwell
he cannot be depended upon to set a river on fire but no matter he is
well liked he is good and fine and it is meat and bread and rest and
luxury to sit and talk with him and have a comradeship again I wish
James Walker could have it He had friends he liked company That
brings up that picture of him the time that I saw him last The pathos
of it It comes before me often and often At that very time poor
thing I was girding up my conscience to make him move on again

Hillyers heart is better than mine better than anybodys in the
community I suppose for he is the one friend of the black sheep of the
campFlint Bucknerand the only man Flint ever talks with or allows to
talk with him He says he knows Flints history and that it is trouble
that has made him what he is and so one ought to be as charitable
toward him as one can Now none but a pretty large heart could find
space to accommodate a lodger like Flint Buckner from all I hear about
him outside I think that this one detail will give you a better idea of
Sammys character than any laboredout description I could furnish you
of him In one of our talks he said something about like this Flint is
a kinsman of mine and he pours out all his troubles to meempties his
breast from time to time or I reckon it would burst There couldnt be
any unhappier man Archy Stillman his life had been made up of misery
of mindhe isnt near as old as he looks He has lost the feel of
reposefulness and peaceoh years and years ago He doesnt know what
good luck isnever has had any often says he wishes he was in the
other hell he is so tired of this one




IV


     No real gentleman will tell the naked truth
     in the presence of ladies

It was a crisp and spicy morning in early October The lilacs and
laburnums lit with the gloryfires of autumn hung burning and flashing
in the upper air a fairy bridge provided by kind Nature for the
wingless wild things that have their homes in the treetops and would
visit together the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and
yellow flames in brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of
the woodland the sensuous fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers
rose upon the swooning atmosphere far in the empty sky a solitary
oesophagus slept upon motionless wing everywhere brooded stillness
serenity and the peace of God

October is the time Hope Canyon is the place a silvermining
camp away down in the Esmeralda region It is a secluded spot high and
remote recent as to discovery thought by its occupants to be rich in
metala year or twos prospecting will decide that matter one way or
the other For inhabitants the camp has about two hundred miners one
white woman and child several Chinese washermen five squaws and a
dozen vagrant buck Indians in rabbitskin robes battered plug hats and
tincan necklaces There are no mills as yet there is no church no
newspaper The camp has existed but two years it has made no big
strike the world is ignorant of its name and place

On both sides of the canyon the mountains rise walllike three thousand
feet and the long spiral of straggling huts down in its narrow bottom
gets a kiss from the sun only once a day when he sails over at noon
The village is a couple of miles long the cabins stand well apart from
each other The tavern is the only frame housethe only house one
might say It occupies a central position and is the evening resort of
the population They drink there and play sevenup and dominoes also
billiards for there is a table crossed all over with torn places
repaired with courtplaster there are some cues but no leathers some
chipped balls which clatter when they run and do not slow up gradually
but stop suddenly and sit down there is part of a cube of chalk
with a projecting jag of flint in it and the man who can score six on a
single break can set up the drinks at the bars expense

Flint Buckners cabin was the last one of the village going south
his silverclaim was at the other end of the village northward and a
little beyond the last hut in that direction He was a sour creature
unsociable and had no companionships People who had tried to get
acquainted with him had regretted it and dropped him His history was
not known Some believed that Sammy Hillyer knew it others said no If
asked Hillyer said no he was not acquainted with it Flint had a meek
English youth of sixteen or seventeen with him whom he treated roughly
both in public and in private and of course this lad was applied to for
information but with no success Fetlock Jonesthe name of the
youthsaid that Flint picked him up on a prospecting tramp and as he
had neither home nor friends in America he had found it wise to stay
and take Buckners hard usage for the sake of the salary which was
bacon and beans Further than this he could offer no testimony

Fetlock had been in this slavery for a month now and under his meek
exterior he was slowly consuming to a cinder with the insults and
humiliations which his master had put upon him For the meek suffer
bitterly from these hurts more bitterly perhaps than do the manlier
sort who can burst out and get relief with words or blows when the
limit of endurance has been reached Goodhearted people wanted to help
Fetlock out of his trouble and tried to get him to leave Buckner but
the boy showed fright at the thought and said he dasnt Pat Riley
urged him and said

You leave the damned hunks and come with me dont you be afraid Ill
take care of him

The boy thanked him with tears in his eyes but shuddered and said he
dasnt risk it he said Flint would catch him alone some time in the
night and thenOh it makes me sick Mr Riley to think of it

Others said Run away from him well stake you skip out for the coast
some night But all these suggestions failed he said Flint would hunt
him down and fetch him back just for meanness

The people could not understand this The boys miseries went steadily
on week after week It is quite likely that the people would have
understood if they had known how he was employing his spare time He
slept in an outcabin near Flints and there nights he nursed his
bruises and his humiliations and studied and studied over a single
problemhow he could murder Flint Buckner and not be found out It
was the only joy he had in life these hours were the only ones in
the twentyfour which he looked forward to with eagerness and spent in
happiness

He thought of poison Nothat would not serve the inquest would reveal
where it was procured and who had procured it He thought of a shot
in the back in a lonely place when Flint would be homewardbound at
midnighthis unvarying hour for the trip Nosomebody might be near
and catch him He thought of stabbing him in his sleep Nohe might
strike an inefficient blow and Flint would seize him He examined a
hundred different waysnone of them would answer for in even the very
obscurest and secretest of them there was always the fatal defect of a
risk a chance a possibility that he might be found out He would have
none of that

But he was patient endlessly patient There was no hurry he said to
himself He would never leave Flint till he left him a corpse there was
no hurryhe would find the way It was somewhere and he would endure
shame and pain and misery until he found it Yes somewhere there was
a way which would leave not a trace not even the faintest clue to the
murdererthere was no hurryhe would find that way and thenoh
then it would just be good to be alive Meantime he would diligently
keep up his reputation for meekness and also as always theretofore he
would allow no one to hear him say a resentful or offensive thing about
his oppressor

Two days before the beforementioned October morning Flint had bought
some things and he and Fetlock had brought them home to Flints cabin
a fresh box of candles which they put in the corner a tin can of
blastingpowder which they placed upon the candlebox a keg of
blastingpowder which they placed under Flints bunk a huge coil of
fuse which they hung on a peg Fetlock reasoned that Flints mining
operations had outgrown the pick and that blasting was about to begin
now He had seen blasting done and he had a notion of the process but
he had never helped in it His conjecture was rightblastingtime had
come In the morning the pair carried fuse drills and the powdercan
to the shaft it was now eight feet deep and to get into it and out of
it a short ladder was used They descended and by command Fetlock held
the drillwithout any instructions as to the right way to hold itand
Flint proceeded to strike The sledge came down the drill sprang out of
Fetlocks hand almost as a matter of course

You mangy son of a nigger is that any way to hold a drill Pick it up
Stand it up Therehold fast Dyou Ill teach you

At the end of an hour the drilling was finished

Now then charge it

The boy started to pour in the powder

Idiot

A heavy bat on the jaw laid the lad out

Get up You cant lie snivelling there Now then stick in the fuse
first Now put in the powder Hold on hold on Are you going to fill
the hole all up Of all the sapheaded milksops IPut in some dirt Put
in some gravel Tamp it down Hold on hold on Oh great Scott get
out of the way He snatched the iron and tamped the charge himself
meantime cursing and blaspheming like a fiend Then he fired the fuse
climbed out of the shaft and ran fifty yards away Fetlock following
They stood waiting a few minutes then a great volume of smoke and rocks
burst high into the air with a thunderous explosion after a little
there was a shower of descending stones then all was serene again

I wish to God youd been in it remarked the master

They went down the shaft cleaned it out drilled another hole and put
in another charge

Look here How much fuse are you proposing to waste Dont you know how
to time a fuse

No sir

You dont Well if you dont beat anything I ever saw

He climbed out of the shaft and spoke down

Well idiot are you going to be all day Cut the fuse and light it

The trembling creature began

If you please sir I

You talk back to me Cut it and light it

The boy cut and lit

Gerreat Scott a oneminute fuse I wish you were in

In his rage he snatched the ladder out of the shaft and ran The boy was
aghast

Oh my God Help Help Oh save me he implored Oh what can I do
What can I do

He backed against the wall as tightly as he could the sputtering fuse
frightened the voice out of him his breath stood still he stood gazing
and impotent in two seconds three seconds four he would be flying
toward the sky torn to fragments Then he had an inspiration He sprang
at the fuse severed the inch of it that was left above ground and was
saved

He sank down limp and half lifeless with fright his strength all gone
but he muttered with a deep joy

He has learnt me I knew there was a way if I would wait

After a matter of five minutes Buckner stole to the shaft looking
worried and uneasy and peered down into it He took in the situation
he saw what had happened He lowered the ladder and the boy dragged
himself weakly up it He was very white His appearance added something
to Buckners uncomfortable state and he said with a show of regret and
sympathy which sat upon him awkwardly from lack of practice

It was an accident you know Dont say anything about it to anybody
I was excited and didnt notice what I was doing Youre not looking
well youve worked enough for today go down to my cabin and eat what
you want and rest Its just an accident you know on account of my
being excited

It scared me said the lad as he started away but I learnt
something so I dont mind it

Damned easy to please muttered Buckner following him with his eye
I wonder if hell tell Mightnt he I wish it had killed him

The boy took no advantage of his holiday in the matter of resting he
employed it in work eager and feverish and happy work A thick growth
of chaparral extended down the mountainside clear to Flints cabin
the most of Fetlocks labor was done in the dark intricacies of that
stubborn growth the rest of it was done in his own shanty At last all
was complete and he said

If hes got any suspicions that Im going to tell on him he wont keep
them long tomorrow He will see that I am the same milksop as I always
wasall day and the next And the day after tomorrow night there ll
be an end of him nobody will ever guess who finished him up nor how it
was done He dropped me the idea his own self and thats odd




V

The next day came and went

It is now almost midnight and in five minutes the new morning will
begin The scene is in the tavern billiardroom Rough men in rough
clothing slouchhats breeches stuffed into boottops some with vests
none with coats are grouped about the boileriron stove which has
ruddy cheeks and is distributing a grateful warmth the billiardballs
are clacking there is no other soundthat is within the wind is
fitfully moaning without The men look bored also expectant A hulking
broadshouldered miner of middle age with grizzled whiskers and an
unfriendly eye set in an unsociable face rises slips a coil of fuse
upon his arm gathers up some other personal properties and departs
without word or greeting to anybody It is Flint Buckner As the door
closes behind him a buzz of talk breaks out

The regularest man that ever was said Jake Parker the blacksmith
you can tell when its twelve just by him leaving without looking at
your Waterbury

And its the only virtue hes got as fur as I know said Peter Hawes
miner

Hes just a blight on this society said WellsFargos man Ferguson
If I was running this shop Id make him say something some time
or other or vamos the ranch This with a suggestive glance at the
barkeeper who did not choose to see it since the man under discussion
was a good customer and went home pretty well set up every night with
refreshments furnished from the bar

Say said Ham Sandwich miner does any of you boys ever recollect of
him asking you to take a drink

Him Flint Buckner Oh Laura

This sarcastic rejoinder came in a spontaneous general outburst in one
form of words or another from the crowd After a brief silence Pat
Riley miner said

Hes the puzzle that cuss And his boys another one I cant make
them out

Nor anybody else said Ham Sandwich and if they are puzzles how
are you going to rank up that other one When it comes to A  rightdown
solid mysteriousness he lays over both of them Easydont he

You bet

Everybody said it Every man but one He was the newcomerPeterson He
ordered the drinks all round and asked who No  might be All answered
at once Archy Stillman

Is he a mystery asked Peterson

Is he a mystery Is Archy Stillman a mystery said WellsFargos man
Ferguson Why the fourth dimensions foolishness to him

For Ferguson was learned

Peterson wanted to hear all about him everybody wanted to tell him
everybody began But Billy Stevens the barkeeper called the house to
order and said one at a time was best He distributed the drinks and
appointed Ferguson to lead Ferguson said

Well hes a boy And that is just about all we know about him You can
pump him till you are tired it aint any use you wont get anything
At least about his intentions or line of business or where hes from
and such things as that And as for getting at the nature and getup of
his main big chief mystery why hell just change the subject
thats all You can guess till youre black in the faceits your
privilegebut suppose you do where do you arrive at Nowhere as near
as I can make out

What is his big chief one

Sight maybe Hearing maybe Instinct maybe Magic maybe Take your
choicegrownups twentyfive children and servants half price Now
Ill tell you what he can do You can start here and just disappear
you can go and hide wherever you want to I dont care where it is nor
how farand hell go straight and put his finger on you

You dont mean it

I just do though Weathers nothing to himelemental conditions is
nothing to himhe dont even take notice of them

Oh come Dark Rain Snow Hey

Its all the same to him He dont give a damn

Oh sayincluding fog peraps

Fog hes got an eye t can plunk through it like a bullet

Now boys honor bright whats he giving me

Its a fact they all shouted Go on WellsFargo

Well sir you can leave him here chatting with the boys and you can
slip out and go to any cabin in this camp and open a bookyes sir a
dozen of themand take the page in your memory and hell start out and
go straight to that cabin and open every one of them books at the right
page and call it off and never make a mistake

He must be the devil

More than one has thought it Now Ill tell you a perfectly wonderful
thing that he done The other night he

There was a sudden great murmur of sounds outside the door flew open
and an excited crowd burst in with the camps one white woman in the
lead and crying

My child my child shes lost and gone For the love of God help me to
find Archy Stillman weve hunted everywhere

Said the barkeeper

Sit down sit down Mrs Hogan and dont worry He asked for a bed
three hours ago tuckered out tramping the trails the way hes always
doing and went upstairs Ham Sandwich run up and roust him out hes
in No 

The youth was soon downstairs and ready He asked Mrs Hogan for
particulars

Bless you dear there aint any I wish there was I put her to sleep
at seven in the evening and when I went in there an hour ago to go to
bed myself she was gone I rushed for your cabin dear and you wasnt
there and Ive hunted for you ever since at every cabin down the
gulch and now Ive come up again and Im that distracted and scared
and heartbroke but thanks to God Ive found you at last dear heart
and youll find my child Come on come quick

Move right along Im with you madam Go to your cabin first

The whole company streamed out to join the hunt All the southern half
of the village was up a hundred men strong and waiting outside a
vague dark mass sprinkled with twinkling lanterns The mass fell into
columns by threes and fours to accommodate itself to the narrow road
and strode briskly along southward in the wake of the leaders In a few
minutes the Hogan cabin was reached

Theres the bunk said Mrs Hogan theres where she was its where
I laid her at seven oclock but where she is now God only knows

Hand me a lantern said Archy He set it on the hard earth floor
and knelt by it pretending to examine the ground closely Heres her
track he said touching the ground here and there and yonder with his
finger Do you see

Several of the company dropped upon their knees and did their best
to see One or two thought they discerned something like a track the
others shook their heads and confessed that the smooth hard surface had
no marks upon it which their eyes were sharp enough to discover One
said Maybe a childs foot could make a mark on it but I dont see
how

Young Stillman stepped outside held the light to the ground turned
leftward and moved three steps closely examining then said Ive got
the directioncome along take the lantern somebody

He strode off swiftly southward the files following swaying and
bending in and out with the deep curves of the gorge Thus a mile and
the mouth of the gorge was reached before them stretched the sagebrush
plain dim vast and vague Stillman called a halt saying We mustnt
start wrong now we must take the direction again

He took a lantern and examined the ground for a matter of twenty yards
then said Come on its all right and gave up the lantern In and
out among the sagebushes he marched a quarter of a mile bearing
gradually to the right then took a new direction and made another
great semicircle then changed again and moved due west nearly half a
mileand stopped

She gave it up here poor little chap Hold the lantern You can see
where she sat

But this was in a slick alkali flat which was surfaced like steel and
no person in the party was quite hardy enough to claim an eyesight that
could detect the track of a cushion on a veneer like that The bereaved
mother fell upon her knees and kissed the spot lamenting

But where is she then some one said She didnt stay here We can
see that much anyway

Stillman moved about in a circle around the place with the lantern
pretending to hunt for tracks

Well he said presently in an annoyed tone I dont understand it
 He examined again No use She was herethats certain she never
walked away from hereand thats certain Its a puzzle I cant make
it out

The mother lost heart then

Oh my God oh blessed Virgin some flying beast has got her Ill
never see her again

Ah dont give up said Archy Well find herdont give up

God bless you for the words Archy Stillman and she seized his hand
and kissed it fervently

Peterson the newcomer whispered satirically in Fergusons ear

Wonderful performance to find this place wasnt it Hardly worth
while to come so far though any other supposititious place would have
answered just as wellhey

Ferguson was not pleased with the innuendo He said with some warmth

Do you mean to insinuate that the child hasnt been here I tell you
the child has been here Now if you want to get yourself into as tidy a
little fuss as

All right sang out Stillman Come everybody and look at this It
was right under our noses all the time and we didnt see it

There was a general plunge for the ground at the place where the child
was alleged to have rested and many eyes tried hard and hopefully to
see the thing that Archys finger was resting upon There was a pause
then a severalbarrelled sigh of disappointment Pat Riley and Ham
Sandwich said in the one breath

What is it Archy Theres nothing here

Nothing Do you call that nothing and he swiftly traced upon the
ground a form with his finger Theredont you recognize it now Its
Injun Billys track Hes got the child

God be praised from the mother

Take away the lantern Ive got the direction Follow

He started on a run racing in and out among the sagebushes a matter
of three hundred yards and disappeared over a sandwave the others
struggled after him caught him up and found him waiting Ten steps
away was a little wickieup a dim and formless shelter of rags and old
horseblankets a dull light showing through its chinks

You lead Mrs Hogan said the lad Its your privilege to be first

All followed the sprint she made for the wickieup and saw with her the
picture its interior afforded Injun Billy was sitting on the ground
the child was asleep beside him The mother hugged it with a wild
embrace which included Archy Stillman the grateful tears running
down her face and in a choked and broken voice she poured out a golden
stream of that wealth of worshiping endearments which has its home in
full richness nowhere but in the Irish heart

I find her bymeby it is ten oclock Billy explained She sleep out
yonder vey tiredface wet been cryin spose fetch her home feed
her she heap much hungrygo sleep gin

In her limitless gratitude the happy mother waived rank and hugged him
too calling him the angel of God in disguise And he probably was
in disguise if he was that kind of an official He was dressed for the
character

At half past one in the morning the procession burst into the village
singing When Johnny Comes Marching Home waving its lanterns and
swallowing the drinks that were brought out all along its course It
concentrated at the tavern and made a night of what was left of the
morning





PART II




I

The next afternoon the village was electrified with an immense
sensation A grave and dignified foreigner of distinguished bearing and
appearance had arrived at the tavern and entered this formidable name
upon the register

SHERLOCK HOLMES

The news buzzed from cabin to cabin from claim to claim tools were
dropped and the town swarmed toward the center of interest A man
passing out at the northern end of the village shouted it to Pat Riley
whose claim was the next one to Flint Buckners At that time Fetlock
Jones seemed to turn sick He muttered to himself

Uncle Sherlock The mean luck of itthat he should come just
when He dropped into a reverie and presently said to himself But
whats the use of being afraid of him Anybody that knows him the way
I do knows he cant detect a crime except where he plans it all out
beforehand and arranges the clues and hires some fellow to commit it
according to instructions Now there aint going to be any clues
this timeso what show has he got None at all No sir everythings
ready If I was to risk putting it off No I wont run any risk like
that Flint Buckner goes out of this world tonight for sure Then
another trouble presented itself Uncle Sherlock ll be wanting to talk
home matters with me this evening and how am I going to get rid of him
for Ive got to be at my cabin a minute or two about eight oclock
 This was an awkward matter and cost him much thought But he found a
way to beat the difficulty Well go for a walk and Ill leave him in
the road a minute so that he wont see what it is I do the best way to
throw a detective off the track anyway is to have him along when you
are preparing the thing Yes thats the safestIll take him with me


Meantime the road in front of the tavern was blocked with villagers
waiting and hoping for a glimpse of the great man But he kept his room
and did not appear None but Ferguson Jake Parker the blacksmith and
Ham Sandwich had any luck These enthusiastic admirers of the great
scientific detective hired the taverns detainedbaggage lockup which
looked into the detectives room across a little alleyway ten or twelve
feet wide ambushed themselves in it and cut some peepholes in the
windowblind Mr Holmess blinds were down but byandby he raised
them It gave the spies a hairlifting but pleasurable thrill to find
themselves face to face with the Extraordinary Man who had filled
the world with the fame of his more than human ingenuities There he
satnot a myth not a shadow but real alive compact of substance
and almost within touching distance with the hand

Look at that head said Ferguson in an awed voice By gracious
thats a head

You bet said the blacksmith with deep reverence Look at his nose
look at his eyes Intellect Just a battery of it

And that paleness said Ham Sandwich Comes from thoughtthats what
it comes from Hell duffers like us dont know what real thought is

No more we dont said Ferguson What we take for thinking is just
blubberandslush

Right you are WellsFargo And look at that frownthats deep
thinkingaway down down forty fathom into the bowels of things Hes
on the track of something

Well he is and dont you forget it Saylook at that awful
gravitylook at that pallid solemnessthere aint any corpse can lay
over it

No sir not for dollars And its hisn by hereditary rights too
hes been dead four times aready and theres history for it Three
times natural once by accident Ive heard say he smells damp and cold
like a grave And he

Sh Watch him Therehes got his thumb on the bump on the near
corner of his forehead and his forefinger on the off one His
thinkworks is just agrinding now you bet your other shirt

Thats so And now hes gazing up toward heaven and stroking his
mustache slow and

Now he has rose up standing and is putting his clues together on his
left fingers with his right finger See he touches the forefingernow
middle fingernow ringfinger

Stuck

Look at him scowl He cant seem to make out that clue So he

See him smilelike a tigerand tally off the other fingers like
nothing Hes got it boys hes got it sure

Well I should say Id hate to be in that mans place that hes
after

Mr Holmes drew a table to the window sat down with his back to the
spies and proceeded to write The spies withdrew their eyes from the
peepholes lit their pipes and settled themselves for a comfortable
smoke and talk Ferguson said with conviction

Boys its no use talking hes a wonder Hes got the signs of it all
over him

You haint ever said a truer word than that WellsFargo said Jake
Parker Say wouldnt it a been nuts if hed abeen here last night

Oh by George but wouldnt it said Ferguson Then wed have seen
scientific work Intellectjust pure intellectaway up on the upper
levels dontchuknow Archy is all right and it dont become anybody to
belittle him I can tell you But his gift is only just eyesight sharp
as an owls as near as I can make it out just a grand natural animal
talent no more no less and prime as far as it goes but no intellect
in it and for awfulness and marvelousness no more to be compared to
what this man does thanthanWhy let me tell you what hed have done
Hed have stepped over to Hogans and glancedjust glanced thats
allat the premises and thats enough See everything Yes sir to
the last little detail and hell know more about that place than the
Hogans would know in seven years Next he would sit down on the bunk
just as cam and say to Mrs HoganSay Ham consider that you are
Mrs Hogan Ill ask the questions you answer them

All right go on

Six years old changes them this way and thatagain mumbles Five

he straightens up and gazes toward heaven and plows his hands through
his hairplows and plows muttering Damn that kip Then he stands up
and frowns and begins to tally off his clues on his fingersand gets
stuck at the ringfinger But only just a minutethen his face glares
all up in a smile like a house afire and he straightens up stately and
majestic and says to the crowd Take a lantern a couple of you and
go down to Injun Billys and fetch the childthe rest of you go long
home to bed goodnight madam goodnight gents And he bows like
the Matterhorn and pulls out for the tavern Thats his style and the
Onlyscientific intellectualall over in fifteen minutesno
poking around all over the sagebrush range an hour and a half in a
massmeeting crowd for him boysyou hear me

By Jackson its grand said Ham Sandwich WellsFargo youve got
him down to a dot He aint painted up any exacter to the life in the
books By George I can just see himcant you boys

You bet you Its just a photograft thats what it is

Ferguson was profoundly pleased with his success and grateful He sat
silently enjoying his happiness a little while then he murmured with a
deep awe in his voice

I wonder if God made him

There was no response for a moment then Ham Sandwich said reverently

Not all at one time I reckon




II

At eight oclock that evening two persons were groping their way past
Flint Buckners cabin in the frosty gloom They were Sherlock Holmes and
his nephew

Stop here in the road a moment uncle said Fetlock while I run to
my cabin I wont be gone a minute

He asked for somethingthe uncle furnished itthen he disappeared in
the darkness but soon returned and the talkingwalk was resumed By
nine oclock they had wandered back to the tavern They worked their
way through the billiardroom where a crowd had gathered in the hope
of getting a glimpse of the Extraordinary Man A royal cheer was raised
Mr Holmes acknowledged the compliment with a series of courtly bows
and as he was passing out his nephew said to the assemblage

Uncle Sherlocks got some work to do gentlemen that ll keep him till
twelve or one but hell be down again then or earlier if he can and
hopes some of youll be left to take a drink with him

By George hes just a duke boys Three cheers for Sherlock Holmes
the greatest man that ever lived shouted Ferguson Hip hip hip

Hurrah hurrah hurrah Tiger

The uproar shook the building so hearty was the feeling the boys put
into their welcome Upstairs the uncle reproached the nephew gently
saying

What did you get me into that engagement for

I reckon you dont want to be unpopular do you uncle Well then
dont you put on any exclusiveness in a miningcamp thats all The
boys admire you but if you was to leave without taking a drink with
them theyd set you down for a snob And besides you said you had home
talk enough in stock to keep us up and at it half the night

The boy was right and wisethe uncle acknowledged it The boy was wise
in another detail which he did not mentionexcept to himself Uncle
and the others will come handyin the way of nailing an alibi where it
cant be budged

He and his uncle talked diligently about three hours Then about
midnight Fetlock stepped downstairs and took a position in the dark
a dozen steps from the tavern and waited Five minutes later Flint
Buckner came rocking out of the billiardroom and almost brushed him as
he passed

Ive got him muttered the boy He continued to himself looking after
the shadowy form Goodbygoodby for good Flint Buckner you called
my mother awell never mind what its all right now youre taking
your last walk friend

He went musing back into the tavern From now till one is an hour
Well spend it with the boys its good for the alibi

He brought Sherlock Holmes to the billiardroom which was jammed with
eager and admiring miners the guest called the drinks and the fun
began Everybody was happy everybody was complimentary the ice
was soon broken songs anecdotes and more drinks followed and the
pregnant minutes flew At six minutes to one when the jollity was at
its highest

BOOM

There was silence instantly The deep sound came rolling and rumbling
from peak to peak up the gorge then died down and ceased The spell
broke then and the men made a rush for the door saying

Somethings blown up

Outside a voice in the darkness said Its away down the gorge I saw
the flash

The crowd poured down the canyonHolmes Fetlock Archy Stillman
everybody They made the mile in a few minutes By the light of a
lantern they found the smooth and solid dirt floor of Flint Buckners
cabin of the cabin itself not a vestige remained not a rag nor a
splinter Nor any sign of Flint Searchparties sought here and there
and yonder and presently a cry went up

Here he is

It was true Fifty yards down the gulch they had found himthat is
they had found a crushed and lifeless mass which represented him
Fetlock Jones hurried thither with the others and looked

The inquest was a fifteenminute affair Ham Sandwich foreman of the
jury handed up the verdict which was phrased with a certain unstudied
literary grace and closed with this finding to wit that deceased
came to his death by his own act or some other person or persons unknown
to this jury not leaving any family or similar effects behind but his
cabin which was blown away and God have mercy on his soul amen

Then the impatient jury rejoined the main crowd for the stormcentre
of interest was thereSherlock Holmes The miners stood silent and
reverent in a halfcircle inclosing a large vacant space which
included the front exposure of the site of the late premises In this
considerable space the Extraordinary Man was moving about attended by
his nephew with a lantern With a tape he took measurements of the cabin
site of the distance from the wall of chaparral to the road of the
height of the chaparral bushes also various other measurements He
gathered a rag here a splinter there and a pinch of earth yonder
inspected them profoundly and preserved them He took the lay of
the place with a pocketcompass allowing two seconds for magnetic
variation He took the time Pacific by his watch correcting it for
local time He paced off the distance from the cabin site to the corpse
and corrected that for tidal differentiation He took the altitude with
a pocketaneroid and the temperature with a pocketthermometer Finally
he said with a stately bow

It is finished Shall we return gentlemen

He took up the line of march for the tavern and the crowd fell into
his wake earnestly discussing and admiring the Extraordinary Man and
interlarding guesses as to the origin of the tragedy and who the author
of it might he

My but its grand luck having him herehey boys said Ferguson

Its the biggest thing of the century said Ham Sandwich It ll go
all over the world you mark my words

You bet said Jake Parker the blacksmith It ll boom this camp
Aint it so WellsFargo

Well as you want my opinionif its any sign of how I think about it
I can tell you this yesterday I was holding the Straight Flush claim at
two dollars a foot Id like to see the man that can get it at sixteen
today

Right you are WellsFargo Its the grandest luck a new camp ever
struck Say did you see him collar them little rags and dirt and
things What an eye He just cant overlook a cluetaint in him

Thats so And they wouldnt mean a thing to anybody else but to him
why theyre just a booklarge print at that

Sures youre born Them odds and ends have got their little old
secret and they think there aint anybody can pull it but land when
he sets his grip there theyve got to squeal and dont you forget it

Boys I aint sorry now that he wasnt here to roust out the child
this is a bigger thing by a long sight Yes sir and more tangled up
and scientific and intellectual

I reckon were all of us glad its turned out this way Glad George
it aint any name for it Dontchuknow Archy could ve learnt something
if hed had the nous to stand by and take notice of how that man works
the system But no he went poking up into the chaparral and just missed
the whole thing

Its true as gospel I seen it myself Well Archys young Hell know
better one of these days

Say boys who do you reckon done it

That was a difficult question and brought out a world of unsatisfying
conjecture Various men were mentioned as possibilities but one by one
they were discarded as not being eligible No one but young Hillyer had
been intimate with Flint Buckner no one had really had a quarrel
with him he had affronted every man who had tried to make up to him
although not quite offensively enough to require bloodshed There was
one name that was upon every tongue from the start but it was the last
to get utteranceFetlock Joness It was Pat Riley that mentioned it

Oh well the boys said of course weve all thought of him because
he had a million rights to kill Flint Buckner and it was just his plain
duty to do it But all the same theres two things we cant get around
for one thing he hasnt got the sand and for another he wasnt
anywhere near the place when it happened

I know it said Pat He was there in the billiardroom with us when
it happened

Yes and was there all the time for an hour before it happened

Its so And lucky for him too Hed have been suspected in a minute
if it hadnt been for that




III

The tavern diningroom had been cleared of all its furniture save one
sixfoot pine table and a chair This table was against one end of
the room the chair was on it Sherlock Holmes stately imposing
impressive sat in the chair The public stood The room was full The
tobaccosmoke was dense the stillness profound

The Extraordinary Man raised his hand to command additional silence
held it in the air a few moments then in brief crisp terms he put
forward question after question and noted the answers with Umums
 nods of the head and so on By this process he learned all about Flint
Buckner his character conduct and habits that the people were able
to tell him It thus transpired that the Extraordinary Mans nephew
was the only person in the camp who had a killinggrudge against Flint
Buckner Mr Holmes smiled compassionately upon the witness and asked
languidly

Do any of you gentlemen chance to know where the lad Fetlock Jones was
at the time of the explosion

A thunderous response followed

In the billiardroom of this house

Ah And had he just come in

Been there all of an hour

Ah It is aboutaboutwell about how far might it be to the scene of
the explosions

All of a mile

Ah It isnt much of an alibi tis true but

A stormburst of laughter mingled with shouts of By jiminy but hes
chainlightning and Aint you sorry you spoke Sandy shut off the
rest of the sentence and the crushed witness drooped his blushing face
in pathetic shame The inquisitor resumed

The lad Joness somewhat distant connection with the case laughter
having been disposed of let us now call the eyewitnesses of the
tragedy and listen to what they have to say

He got out his fragmentary clues and arranged them on a sheet of
cardboard on his knee The house held its breath and watched

We have the longitude and the latitude corrected for magnetic
variation and this gives us the exact location of the tragedy We
have the altitude the temperature and the degree of humidity
prevailinginestimably valuable since they enable us to estimate with
precision the degree of influence which they would exercise upon the
mood and disposition of the assassin at that time of the night

Buzz of admiration muttered remark By George but hes deep He
fingered his clues And now let us ask these mute witnesses to speak to
us

Here we have an empty linen shotbag What is its message This that
robbery was the motive not revenge What is its further message
This that the assassin was of inferior intelligenceshall we say
lightwitted or perhaps approaching that How do we know this Because
a person of sound intelligence would not have proposed to rob the man
Buckner who never had much money with him But the assassin might have
been a stranger Let the bag speak again I take from it this article
It is a bit of silverbearing quartz It is peculiar Examine it
pleaseyouand youand you Now pass it back please There is but
one lode on this coast which produces just that character and color of
quartz and that is a lode which crops out for nearly two miles on a
stretch and in my opinion is destined at no distant day to confer
upon its locality a globegirdling celebrity and upon its two hundred
owners riches beyond the dreams of avarice Name that lode please

The Consolidated Christian Science and Mary Ann was the prompt
response

A wild crash of hurrahs followed and every man reached for his
neighbors hand and wrung it with tears in his eyes and WellsFargo
Ferguson shouted The Straight Flush is on the lode and up she goes to
a hunched and fifty a footyou hear me

When quiet fell Mr Holmes resumed

We perceive then that three facts are established to wit the
assassin was approximately lightwitted he was not a stranger his
motive was robbery not revenge Let us proceed I hold in my hand a
small fragment of fuse with the recent smell of fire upon it What is
its testimony Taken with the corroborative evidence of the quartz
it reveals to us that the assassin was a miner What does it tell us
further This gentlemen that the assassination was consummated by
means of an explosive What else does it say This that the explosive
was located against the side of the cabin nearest the roadthe front
sidefor within six feet of that spot I found it

I hold in my fingers a burnt Swedish matchthe kind one rubs on a
safetybox I found it in the road six hundred and twentytwo feet from
the abolished cabin What does it say This that the train was fired
from that point What further does it tell us This that the assassin
was lefthanded How do I know this I should not be able to explain to
you gentlemen how I know it the signs being so subtle that only long
experience and deep study can enable one to detect them But the signs
are here and they are reinforced by a fact which you must have often
noticed in the great detective narrativesthat all assassins are
lefthanded

By Jackson thats so said Ham Sandwich bringing his great hand down
with a resounding slap upon his thigh blamed if I ever thought of it
before

Nor I Nor I cried several Oh there cant anything escape
himlook at his eye

Gentlemen distant as the murderer was from his doomed victim he did
not wholly escape injury This fragment of wood which I now exhibit to
you struck him It drew blood Wherever he is he bears the telltale
mark I picked it up where he stood when he fired the fatal train He
looked out over the house from his high perch and his countenance began
to darken he slowly raised his hand and pointed

There stands the assassin

For a moment the house was paralyzed with amazement then twenty voices
burst out with

Sammy Hillyer Oh hell no Him Its pure foolishness

Take care gentlemenbe not hasty Observehe has the bloodmark on
his brow

Hillyer turned white with fright He was near to crying He turned this
way and that appealing to every face for help and sympathy and held
out his supplicating hands toward Holmes and began to plead

Dont oh dont I never did it I give my word I never did it The
way I got this hurt on my forehead was

Arrest him constable cried Holmes I will swear out the warrant

The constable moved reluctantly forwardhesitatedstopped

Hillyer broke out with another appeal Oh Archy dont let them do it
it would kill mother You know how I got the hurt Tell them and save
me Archy save me

Stillman worked his way to the front and said

Yes Ill save you Dont be afraid Then he said to the house Never
mind how he got the hurt it hasnt anything to do with this case and
isnt of any consequence

God bless you Archy for a true friend

Hurrah for Archy Go in boy and play em a knockdown flush to their
two pair n a jack shouted the house pride in their home talent and
a patriotic sentiment of loyalty to it rising suddenly in the public
heart and changing the whole attitude of the situation

Young Stillman waited for the noise to cease then he said

I will ask Tom Jeffries to stand by that door yonder and Constable
Harris to stand by the other one here and not let anybody leave the
room

Said and done Go on old man

The criminal is present I believe I will show him to you before
long in case I am right in my guess Now I will tell you all about
the tragedy from start to finish The motive wasnt robbery it was
revenge The murderer wasnt lightwitted He didnt stand six hundred
and twentytwo feet away He didnt get hit with a piece of wood He
didnt place the explosive against the cabin He didnt bring a shotbag
with him and he wasnt lefthanded With the exception of these
errors the distinguished guests statement of the case is substantially
correct

A comfortable laugh rippled over the house friend nodded to friend as
much as to say Thats the word with the bark on it Good lad good
boy He aint lowering his flag any

The guests serenity was not disturbed Stillman resumed

I also have some witnesses and I will presently tell you where you
can find some more He held up a piece of coarse wire the crowd craned
their necks to see It has a smooth coating of melted tallow on it And
here is a candle which is burned halfway down The remaining half of it
has marks cut upon it an inch apart Soon I will tell you where I found
these things I will now put aside reasonings guesses the impressive
hitchings of odds and ends of clues together and the other showy
theatricals of the detective trade and tell you in a plain
straightforward way just how this dismal thing happened

He paused a moment for effectto allow silence and suspense to
intensify and concentrate the houses interest then he went on

The assassin studied out his plan with a good deal of pains It was a
good plan very ingenious and showed an intelligent mind not a feeble
one It was a plan which was well calculated to ward off all suspicion
from its inventor In the first place he marked a candle into spaces
an inch apart and lit it and timed it He found it took three hours to
burn four inches of it I tried it myself for half an hour awhile ago
upstairs here while the inquiry into Flint Buckners character and
ways was being conducted in this room and I arrived in that way at
the rate of a candles consumption when sheltered from the wind Having
proved his trial candles rate he blew it outI have already shown it
to youand put his inchmarks on a fresh one

He put the fresh one into a tin candlestick Then at the fivehour mark
he bored a hole through the candle with a redhot wire I have already
shown you the wire with a smooth coat of tallow on ittallow that had
been melted and had cooled

With laborvery hard labor I should sayhe struggled up through the
stiff chaparral that clothes the steep hillside back of Flint Buckners
place tugging an empty flourbarrel with him He placed it in that
absolutely secure hidingplace and in the bottom of it he set the
candlestick Then he measured off about thirtyfive feet of fusethe
barrels distance from the back of the cabin He bored a hole in the
side of the barrelhere is the large gimlet he did it with He went on
and finished his work and when it was done one end of the fuse was in
Buckners cabin and the other end with a notch chipped in it to expose
the powder was in the hole in the candletimed to blow the place up
at one oclock this morning provided the candle was lit about eight
oclock yesterday eveningwhich I am betting it wasand provided
there was an explosive in the cabin and connected with that end of the
fusewhich I am also betting there was though I cant prove it Boys
the barrel is there in the chaparral the candles remains are in it in
the tin stick the burntout fuse is in the gimlethole the other end
is down the hill where the late cabin stood I saw them all an hour
or two ago when the Professor here was measuring off unimplicated
vacancies and collecting relics that hadnt anything to do with the
case

He paused The house drew a long deep breath shook its strained cords
and muscles free and burst into cheers Dang him said Ham Sandwich
thats why he was snooping around in the chaparral instead of picking
up points out of the Pfessors game Looky herehe aint no fool
boys

No sir Why great Scott

But Stillman was resuming

While we were out yonder an hour or two ago the owner of the gimlet
and the trialcandle took them from a place where he had concealed
themit was not a good placeand carried them to what he probably
thought was a better one two hundred yards up in the pine woods and
hid them there covering them over with pine needles It was there that
I found them The gimlet exactly fits the hole in the barrel And now

The Extraordinary Man interrupted him He said sarcastically

We have had a very pretty fairy tale gentlemenvery pretty indeed
Now I would like to ask this young man a question or two

Some of the boys winced and Ferguson said

Im afraid Archys going to catch it now

The others lost their smiles and sobered down Mr Holmes said

Let us proceed to examine into this fairytale in a consecutive and
orderly wayby geometrical progression so to speaklinking detail
to detail in a steadily advancing and remorselessly consistent and
unassailable march upon this tinsel toyfortress of error the dream
fabric of a callowimagination To begin with young sir I desire to
ask you but three questions at presentat present Did I understand you
to say it was your opinion that the supposititious candle was lighted at
about eight oclock yesterday evening

Yes sirabout eight

Could you say exactly eight

Well no I couldnt be that exact

Um If a person had been passing along there just about that time he
would have been almost sure to encounter that assassin do you think

Yes I should think so

Thank you that is all For the present I say all for the present

Dern him hes laying for Archy said Ferguson

Its so said Ham Sandwich I dont like the look of it

Stillman said glancing at the guest I was along there myself at
half past eightno about nine

Indeed This is interestingthis is very interesting Perhaps you
encountered the assassin

No I encountered no one

Ah Thenif you will excuse the remarkI do not quite see the
relevancy of the information

It has none At present I say it has noneat present

He paused Presently he resumed I did not encounter the assassin but
I am on his track I am sure for I believe he is in this room I will
ask you all to pass one by one in front of mehere where there is a
good lightso that I can see your feet

A buzz of excitement swept the place and the march began the guest
looking on with an iron attempt at gravity which was not an unqualified
success Stillman stooped shaded his eyes with his hand and gazed
down intently at each pair of feet as it passed Fifty men tramped
monotonously bywith no result Sixty Seventy The thing was beginning
to look absurd The guest remarked with suave irony

Assassins appear to be scarce this evening

The house saw the humor if it and refreshed itself with a cordial
laugh Ten or twelve more candidates tramped byno danced by with
airy and ridiculous capers which convulsed the spectatorsthen suddenly
Stillman put out his hand and said

This is the assassin

Fetlock Jones by the great Sanhedrim roared the crowd and at once
let fly a pyrotechnic explosion and dazzle and confusion of stirring
remarks inspired by the situation

At the height of the turmoil the guest stretched out his hand
commanding peace The authority of a great name and a great personality
laid its mysterious compulsion upon the house and it obeyed Out of the
panting calm which succeeded the guest spoke saying with dignity and
feeling

This is serious It strikes at an innocent life Innocent beyond
suspicion Innocent beyond peradventure Hear me prove it observe how
simple a fact can brush out of existence this witless lie Listen My
friends that lad was never out of my sight yesterday evening at any
time

It made a deep impression Men turned their eyes upon Stillman with
grave inquiry in them His face brightened and he said

I knew there was another one He stepped briskly to the table and
glanced at the guests feet then up at his face and said You were
with him You were not fifty steps from him when he lit the candle
that byandby fired the powder Sensation And what is more you
furnished the matches yourself

Plainly the guest seemed hit it looked so to the public He opened his
mouth to speak the words did not come freely

Thiserthis is insanitythis

Stillman pressed his evident advantage home He held up a charred match

Here is one of them I found it in the barreland theres another one
there

The guest found his voice at once

Yesand put them there yourself

It was recognized a good shot Stillman retorted

It is waxa breed unknown to this camp I am ready to be searched for
the box Are you

The guest was staggered this timethe dullest eye could see it He
fumbled with his hands once or twice his lips moved but the words did
not come The house waited and watched in tense suspense the stillness
adding effect to the situation Presently Stillman said gently

We are waiting for your decision

There was silence again during several moments then the guest answered
in a low voice

I refuse to be searched

There was no noisy demonstration but all about the house one voice
after another muttered

That settles it Hes Archys meat

What to do now Nobody seemed to know It was an embarrassing situation
for the momentmerely of course because matters had taken such
a sudden and unexpected turn that these unpractised minds were not
prepared for it and had come to a standstill like a stopped clock
under the shock But after a little the machinery began to work again
tentatively and by twos and threes the men put their heads together and
privately buzzed over this and that and the other proposition One
of these propositions met with much favor it was to confer upon the
assassin a vote of thanks for removing Flint Buckner and let him go
But the cooler heads opposed it pointing out that addled brains in the
Eastern states would pronounce it a scandal and make no end of foolish
noise about it Finally the cool heads got the upper hand and obtained
general consent to a proposition of their own their leader then called
the house to order and stated itto this effect that Fetlock Jones be
jailed and put upon trial

The motion was carried Apparently there was nothing further to do now
and the people were glad for privately they were impatient to get out
and rush to the scene of the tragedy and see whether that barrel and
the other things were really there or not

But nothe breakup got a check The surprises were not over yet For
a while Fetlock Jones had been silently sobbing unnoticed in
the absorbing excitements which had been following one another so
persistently for some time but when his arrest and trial were decreed
he broke out despairingly and said

No its no use I dont want any jail I dont want any trial Ive
had all the hard luck I want and all the miseries Hang me now and let
me out It would all come out anywaythere couldnt anything save me
He has told it all just as if hed been with me and seen itI dont
know how he found out and youll find the barrel and things and then I
wouldnt have any chance any more I killed him and youd have done it
too if hed treated you like a dog and you only a boy and weak and
poor and not a friend to help you

And served him damned well right broke in Ham Sandwich Looky here
boys

From the constable Order Order gentlemen

A voice Did your uncle know what you was up to

No he didnt

Did he give you the matches sure enough

Yes he did but he didnt know what I wanted them for

When you was out on such a business as that how did you venture to
risk having him alongand him a detective Hows that

The boy hesitated fumbled with his buttons in an embarrassed way then
said shyly

I know about detectives on account of having them in the family and
if you dont want them to find out about a thing its best to have them
around when you do it

The cyclone of laughter which greeted this nave discharge of wisdom
did not modify the poor little waifs embarrassment in any large degree




IV

From a letter to Mrs Stillman dated merely Tuesday

Fetlock Jones was put under lock and key in an unoccupied log cabin
and left there to await his trial Constable Harris provided him with
a couple of days rations instructed him to keep a good guard over
himself and promised to look in on him as soon as further supplies
should be due

Next morning a score of us went with Hillyer out of friendship and
helped him bury his late relative the unlamented Buckner and I acted
as first assistant pallbearer Hillyer acting as chief Just as we had
finished our labors a ragged and melancholy stranger carrying an old
handbag limped by with his head down and I caught the scent I had
chased around the globe It was the odor of Paradise to my perishing
hope

In a moment I was at his side and had laid a gentle hand upon his
shoulder He slumped to the ground as if a stroke of lightning had
withered him in his tracks and as the boys came running he struggled to
his knees and put up his pleading hands to me and out of his chattering
jaws he begged me to persecute him no more and said

You have hunted me around the world Sherlock Holmes yet God is my
witness I have never done any man harm

A glance at his wild eyes showed us that he was insane That was my
work mother The tidings of your death can some day repeat the misery
I felt in that moment but nothing else can ever do it The boys lifted
him up and gathered about him and were full of pity of him and said
the gentlest and touchingest things to him and said cheer up and dont
be troubled he was among friends now and they would take care of him
and protect him and hang any man that laid a hand on him They are just
like so many mothers the rough miningcamp boys are when you wake up
the south side of their hearts yes and just like so many reckless and
unreasoning children when you wake up the opposite of that muscle They
did everything they could think of to comfort him but nothing succeeded
until WellsFargo Ferguson who is a clever strategist said

If its only Sherlock Holmes thats troubling you you neednt worry
any more

Why asked the forlorn lunatic eagerly

Because hes dead again

Dead Dead Oh dont trifle with a poor wreck like me Is he dead On
honor nowis he telling me true boys

True as youre standing there said Ham Sandwich and they all backed
up the statement in a body

They hung him in San Bernardino last week added Ferguson clinching
the matter whilst he was searching around after you Mistook him for
another man Theyre sorry but they cant help it now

Theyre abuilding him a monument said Ham Sandwich with the air of
a person who had contributed to it and knew

James Walker drew a deep sighevidently a sigh of reliefand said
nothing but his eyes lost something of their wildness his countenance
cleared visibly and its drawn look relaxed a little We all went to our
cabin and the boys cooked him the best dinner the camp could furnish
the materials for and while they were about it Hillyer and I outfitted
him from hat to shoeleather with new clothes of ours and made a comely
and presentable old gentleman of him Old is the right word and a
pity too old by the droop of him and the frost upon his hair and the
marks which sorrow and distress have left upon his face though he is
only in his prime in the matter of years While he ate we smoked and
chatted and when he was finishing he found his voice at last and of
his own accord broke out with his personal history I cannot furnish his
exact words but I will come as near it as I can


THE WRONG MANS STORY

It happened like this I was in Denver I had been there many years
sometimes I remember how many sometimes I dontbut it isnt any
matter All of a sudden I got a notice to leave or I would be exposed
for a horrible crime committed long beforeyears and years beforein
the East

I knew about that crime but I was not the criminal it was a cousin
of mine of the same name What should I better do My head was all
disordered by fear and I didnt know I was allowed very little
timeonly one day I think it was I would be ruined if I was
published and the people would lynch me and not believe what I said
It is always the way with lynchings when they find out it is a mistake
they are sorry but it is too latethe same as it was with Mr Holmes
you see So I said I would sell out and get money to live on and run
away until it blew over and I could come back with my proofs Then I
escaped in the night and went a long way off in the mountains somewhere
and lived disguised and had a false name

I got more and more troubled and worried and my troubles made me see
spirits and hear voices and I could not think straight and clear on any
subject but got confused and involved and had to give it up because
my head hurt so It got to be worse and worse more spirits and more
voices They were about me all the time at first only in the night
then in the day too They were always whispering around my bed and
plotting against me and it broke my sleep and kept me fagged out
because I got no good rest

And then came the worst One night the whispers said Well never
manage because we cant see him and so cant point him out to the
people

They sighed then one said We must bring Sherlock Holmes He can be
here in twelve days

They all agreed and whispered and jibbered with joy But my heart
broke for I had read about that man and knew what it would be to
have him upon my track with his superhuman penetration and tireless
energies

The spirits went away to fetch him and I got up at once in the middle
of the night and fled away carrying nothing but the handbag that had
my money in itthirty thousand dollars twothirds of it are in the bag
there yet It was forty days before that man caught up on my track
I just escaped From habit he had written his real name on a tavern
register but had scratched it out and written Dagget Barclay in the
place of it But fear gives you a watchful eye and keen and I read the
true name through the scratches and fled like a deer

He has hunted me all over this world for three years and a halfthe
Pacific states Australasia Indiaeverywhere you can think of then
back to Mexico and up to California again giving me hardly any rest
but that name on the registers always saved me and what is left of me
is alive yet And I am so tired A cruel time he has given me yet I
give you my honor I have never harmed him nor any man

That was the end of the story and it stirred those boys to bloodheat
be sure of it As for meeach word burnt a hole in me where it struck

We voted that the old man should bunk with us and be my guest and
Hillyers I shall keep my own counsel naturally but as soon as he is
well rested and nourished I shall take him to Denver and rehabilitate
his fortunes

The boys gave the old fellow the bonemashing goodfellowship handshake
of the mines and then scattered away to spread the news

At dawn next morning WellsFargo Ferguson and Ham Sandwich called us
softly out and said privately

That news about the way that old stranger has been treated has spread
all around and the camps are up They are piling in from everywhere
and are going to lynch the Pfessor Constable Harris is in a dead funk
and has telephoned the sheriff Come along

We started on a run The others were privileged to feel as they chose
but in my hearts privacy I hoped the sheriff would arrive in time for
I had small desire that Sherlock Holmes should hang for my deeds as you
can easily believe I had heard a good deal about the sheriff but for
reassurances sake I asked

Can he stop a mob

Can he stop a mob Can Jack Fairfax stop a mob Well I should smile
Exdesperadonineteen scalps on his string Can he Oh I say

As we tore up the gulch distant cries and shouts and yells rose faintly
on the still air and grew steadily in strength as we raced along Roar
after roar burst out stronger and stronger nearer and nearer and at
last when we closed up upon the multitude massed in the open area
in front of the tavern the crash of sound was deafening Some brutal
roughs from Dalys gorge had Holmes in their grip and he was the
calmest man there a contemptuous smile played about his lips and if
any fear of death was in his British heart his iron personality was
master of it and no sign of it was allowed to appear

Come to a vote men This from one of the Daly gang Shadbelly
Higgins Quick is it hang or shoot

Neither shouted one of his comrades Hell be alive again in a week
burnings the only permanency for him

The gangs from all the outlying camps burst out in a thundercrash of
approval and went struggling and surging toward the prisoner and
closed around him shouting Fire fires the ticket They dragged him
to the horsepost backed him against it chained him to it and piled
wood and pine cones around him waistdeep Still the strong face did not
blench and still the scornful smile played about the thin lips

A match fetch a match

Shadbelly struck it shaded it with his hand stooped and held it under
a pine cone A deep silence fell upon the mob The cone caught a tiny
flame flickered about it a moment or two I seemed to catch the sound of
distant hoofsit grew more distinctstill more and more distinct more
and more definite but the absorbed crowd did not appear to notice it
The match went out The man struck another stooped and again the flame
rose this time it took hold and began to spreadhere and there men
turned away their faces The executioner stood with the charred match in
his fingers watching his work The hoofbeats turned a projecting crag
and now they came thundering down upon us Almost the next moment there
was a shout

The sheriff

And straightway he came tearing into the midst stood his horse almost
on his hind feet and said

Fall back you guttersnipes

He was obeyed By all but their leader He stood his ground and his
hand went to his revolver The sheriff covered him promptly and said

Drop your hand you parlordesperado Kick the fire away Now unchain
the stranger

The parlordesperado obeyed Then the sheriff made a speech sitting his
horse at martial ease and not warming his words with any touch of fire
but delivering them in a measured and deliberate way and in a tone
which harmonized with their character and made them impressively
disrespectful

Youre a nice lotnow aint you Just about eligible to travel with
this bilk hereShadbelly Higginsthis loudmouthed sneak that shoots
people in the back and calls himself a desperado If theres anything I
do particularly despise its a lynching mob Ive never seen one that
had a man in it It has to tally up a hundred against one before it can
pump up pluck enough to tackle a sick tailor Its made up of cowards
and so is the community that breeds it and ninetynine times out of a
hundred the sheriffs another one He pausedapparently to turn that
last idea over in his mind and taste the juice of itthen he went
on The sheriff that lets a mob take a prisoner away from him is the
lowestdown coward there is By the statistics there was a hundred and
eightytwo of them drawing sneak pay in America last year By the
way its going pretty soon there ll be a new disease in the
doctorbookssheriff complaint That idea pleased himany one could
see it People will say Sheriff sick again Yes got the same
old thing And next there ll be a new title People wont say Hes
running for sheriff of Rapaho County for instance theyll say Hes
running for Coward of Rapaho Lord the idea of a grownup person being
afraid of a lynch mob

He turned an eye on the captive and said Stranger who are you and
what have you been doing

My name is Sherlock Holmes and I have not been doing anything

It was wonderful the impression which the sound of that name made on
the sheriff notwithstanding he must have come posted He spoke up with
feeling and said it was a blot on the country that a man whose marvelous
exploits had filled the world with their fame and their ingenuity and
whose histories of them had won every readers heart by the brilliancy
and charm of their literary setting should be visited under the Stars
and Stripes by an outrage like this He apologized in the name of the
whole nation and made Holmes a most handsome bow and told Constable
Harris to see him to his quarters and hold himself personally
responsible if he was molested again Then he turned to the mob and
said

Hunt your holes you scum which they did then he said Follow me
Shadbelly Ill take care of your case myself Nokeep your popgun
whenever I see the day that Ill be afraid to have you behind me with
that thing it ll be time for me to join last years hundred and
eightytwo and he rode off in a walk Shadbelly following

When we were on our way back to our cabin toward breakfasttime we
ran upon the news that Fetlock Jones had escaped from his lockup in the
night and is gone Nobody is sorry Let his uncle track him out if he
likes it is in his line the camp is not interested




V

Buckner His real name was Jacob Fuller There mother by help of me
