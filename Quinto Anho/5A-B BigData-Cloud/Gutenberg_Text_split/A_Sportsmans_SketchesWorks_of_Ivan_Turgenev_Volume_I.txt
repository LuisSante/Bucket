                           HOR AND KALINITCH


Anyone who has chanced to pass from the Bolhovsky district into the
Zhizdrinsky district must have been impressed by the striking
difference between the race of people in the province of Orel and the
population of the province of Kaluga The peasant of Orel is not tall
is bent in figure sullen and suspicious in his looks he lives in
wretched little hovels of aspenwood labours as a serf in the fields
and engages in no kind of trading is miserably fed and wears slippers
of bast the rentpaying peasant of Kaluga lives in roomy cottages of
pinewood he is tall bold and cheerful in his looks neat and clean
of countenance he carries on a trade in butter and tar and on
holidays he wears boots The village of the Orel province we are
speaking now of the eastern part of the province is usually situated
in the midst of ploughed fields near a watercourse which has been
converted into a filthy pool Except for a few of the
everaccommodating willows and two or three gaunt birchtrees you do
not see a tree for a mile round hut is huddled up against hut their
roofs covered with rotting thatch The villages of Kaluga on the
contrary are generally surrounded by forest the huts stand more
freely are more upright and have boarded roofs the gates fasten
closely the hedge is not broken down nor trailing about there are no
gaps to invite the visits of the passing pig And things are much
better in the Kaluga province for the sportsman In the Orel province
the last of the woods and copses will have disappeared five years
hence and there is no trace of moorland left in Kaluga on the
contrary the moors extend over tens the forest over hundreds of
miles and a splendid bird the grouse is still extant there there
are abundance of the friendly larger snipe and the loudclapping
partridge cheers and startles the sportsman and his dog by its abrupt
upward flight

On a visit to the Zhizdrinsky district in search of sport I met in the
fields a petty proprietor of the Kaluga province called Polutikin and
made his acquaintance He was an enthusiastic sportsman it follows
therefore that he was an excellent fellow He was liable indeed to a
few weaknesses he used for instance to pay his addresses to every
unmarried heiress in the province and when he had been refused her
hand and house brokenhearted he confided his sorrows to all his
friends and acquaintances and continued to shower offerings of sour
peaches and other raw produce from his garden upon the young ladys
relatives he was fond of repeating one and the same anecdote which
in spite of Mr Polutikins appreciation of its merits had certainly
never amused anyone he admired the works of Akim Nahimov and the novel
Pinna he stammered he called his dog Astronomer instead of
however said howsomever and had established in his household a
French system of cookery the secret of which consisted according to
his cooks interpretation in a complete transformation of the natural
taste of each dish in this artistes hands meat assumed the flavour
of fish fish of mushrooms macaroni of gunpowder to make up for this
not a single carrot went into the soup without taking the shape of a
rhombus or a trapeze But with the exception of these few and
insignificant failings Mr Polutikin was as has been said already an
excellent fellow

On the first day of my acquaintance with Mr Polutikin he invited me
to stay the night at his house

It will be five miles farther to my house he added its a long way
to walk let us first go to Hors The reader must excuse my omitting
his stammer

Who is Hor

A peasant of mine He is quite close by here

We went in that direction In a wellcultivated clearing in the middle
of the forest rose Hors solitary homestead It consisted of several
pinewood buildings enclosed by plank fences a porch ran along the
front of the principal building supported on slender posts We went
in We were met by a young lad of twenty tall and goodlooking

Ah Fedya is Hor at home Mr Polutikin asked him

No Hor has gone into town answered the lad smiling and showing a
row of snowwhite teeth You would like the little cart brought out

Yes my boy the little cart And bring us some kvas

We went into the cottage Not a single cheap glaring print was pasted
up on the clean boards of the walls in the corner before the heavy
holy picture in its silver setting a lamp was burning the table of
lindenwood had been lately planed and scrubbed between the joists and
in the cracks of the windowframes there were no lively Prussian
beetles running about nor gloomy cockroaches in hiding The young lad
soon reappeared with a great white pitcher filled with excellent kvas
a huge hunch of wheaten bread and a dozen salted cucumbers in a wooden
bowl He put all these provisions on the table and then leaning with
his back against the door began to gaze with a smiling face at us We
had not had time to finish eating our lunch when the cart was already
rattling before the doorstep We went out A curlyheaded rosycheeked
boy of fifteen was sitting in the cart as driver and with difficulty
holding in the wellfed piebald horse Round the cart stood six young
giants very like one another and Fedya

All of these Hors sons said Polutikin

These are all Horkies ie wild cats put in Fedya who had come
after us on to the step but thats not all of them Potap is in the
wood and Sidor has gone with old Hor to the town Look out Vasya he
went on turning to the coachman drive like the wind you are driving
the master Only mind what youre about over the ruts and easy a
little dont tip the cart over and upset the masters stomach

The other Horkies smiled at Fedyas sally Lift Astronomer in Mr
Polutikin called majestically Fedya not without amusement lifted the
dog who wore a forced smile into the air and laid her at the bottom
of the cart Vasya let the horse go We rolled away And here is my
countinghouse said Mr Polutikin suddenly to me pointing to a
little lowpitched house Shall we go in By all means It is no
longer used he observed going in still it is worth looking at
The countinghouse consisted of two empty rooms The caretaker a
oneeyed old man ran out of the yard Good day Minyaitch said Mr
Polutikin bring us some water The oneeyed old man disappeared and
at once returned with a bottle of water and two glasses Taste it
Polutikin said to me it is splendid spring water We drank off a
glass each while the old man bowed low Come now I think we can go
on said my new Friend In that countinghouse I sold the merchant
Alliluev four acres of forestland for a good price We took our seats
in the cart and in halfanhour we had reached the court of the
manorhouse

Tell me please I asked Polutikin at supper why does Hor live
apart from your other peasants

Well this is why he is a clever peasant Twentyfive years ago his
cottage was burnt down so he came up to my late father and said
Allow me Nikolai Kouzmitch says he to settle in your forest on
the bog I will pay you a good rent But what do you want to settle
on the bog for Oh I want to only your honour Nikolai Kouzmitch
be so good as not to claim any labour from me but fix a rent as you
think best Fifty roubles a year Very well But Ill have no
arrears mind Of course no arrears and so he settled on the bog
Since then they have called him Hor ie wild cat

Well and has he grown rich I inquired

Yes he has grown rich Now he pays me a round hundred for rent and I
shall raise it again I dare say I have said to him more than once
Buy your freedom Hor come buy your freedom  But he declares
the rogue that he cant has no money he says As though that were
likely

The next day directly after our morning tea we started out hunting
again As we were driving through the village Mr Polutikin ordered
the coachman to stop at a lowpitched cottage and called loudly
Kalinitch Coming your honour coming sounded a voice from the
yard I am tying on my shoes We went on at a walk outside the
village a man of about forty overtook us He was tall and thin with a
small and erect head It was Kalinitch His goodhumoured swarthy
face somewhat pitted with smallpox pleased me from the first glance
Kalinitch as I learnt afterwards went hunting every day with his
master carried his bag and sometimes also his gun noted where game
was to be found fetched water built shanties and gathered
strawberries and ran behind the droshky Mr Polutikin could not stir
a step without him Kalinitch was a man of the merriest and gentlest
disposition he was constantly singing to himself in a low voice and
looking carelessly about him He spoke a little through his nose with
a laughing twinkle in his light blue eyes and he had a habit of
plucking at his scanty wedgeshaped beard with his hand He walked not
rapidly but with long strides leaning lightly on a long thin staff
He addressed me more than once during the day and he waited on me
without obsequiousness but he looked after his master as if he were a
child When the unbearable heat drove us at midday to seek shelter he
took us to his beehouse in the very heart of the forest There
Kalinitch opened the little hut for us which was hung round with
bunches of dry scented herbs He made us comfortable on some dry hay
and then put a kind of bag of network over his head took a knife a
little pot and a smouldering stick and went to the hive to cut us out
some honeycomb We had a draught of spring water after the warm
transparent honey and then dropped asleep to the sound of the
monotonous humming of the bees and the rustling chatter of the leaves
A slight gust of wind awakened me I opened my eyes and saw
Kalinitch he was sitting on the threshold of the halfopened door
carving a spoon with his knife I gazed a long time admiring his face
as sweet and clear as an evening sky Mr Polutikin too woke up We did
not get up at once After our long walk and our deep sleep it was
pleasant to lie without moving in the hay we felt weary and languid in
body our faces were in a slight glow of warmth our eyes were closed
in delicious laziness At last we got up and set off on our wanderings
again till evening At supper I began again to talk of Hor and
Kalinitch Kalinitch is a good peasant Mr Polutikin told me he is
a willing and useful peasant he cant farm his land properly I am
always taking him away from it He goes out hunting every day with
me You can judge for yourself how his farming must fare

I agreed with him and we went to bed

The next day Mr Polutikin was obliged to go to town about some
business with his neighbour Pitchukoff This neighbour Pitchukoff had
ploughed over some land of Polutikins and had flogged a peasant woman
of his on this same piece of land I went out hunting alone and before
evening I turned into Hors house On the threshold of the cottage I
was met by an old manbald short broadshouldered and stoutHor
himself I looked with curiosity at the man The cut of his face
recalled Socrates there was the same high knobby forehead the same
little eyes the same snub nose We went into the cottage together The
same Fedya brought me some milk and black bread Hor sat down on a
bench and quietly stroking his curly beard entered into conversation
with me He seemed to know his own value he spoke and moved slowly
from time to time a chuckle came from between his long moustaches

We discussed the sowing the crops the peasants life He always
seemed to agree with me only afterwards I had a sense of awkwardness
and felt I was talking foolishly In this way our conversation was
rather curious Hor doubtless through caution expressed himself very
obscurely at times Here is a specimen of our talk

Tell me Hor I said to him why dont you buy your freedom from
your master

And what would I buy my freedom for Now I know my master and I know
my rent We have a good master

Its always better to be free I remarked Hor gave me a dubious look

Surely he said

Well then why dont you buy your freedom Hor shook his head

What would you have me buy it with your honour

Oh come now old man

If Hor were thrown among free men he continued in an undertone as
though to himself everyone without a beard would be a better man than
Hor

Then shave your beard

What is a beard a beard is grass one can cut it

Well then

But Hor will be a merchant straight away and merchants have a fine
life and they have beards

Why do you do a little trading too I asked him

We trade a little in a little butter and a little tar Would your
honour like the cart put to

Youre a close man and keep a tight rein on your tongue I thought to
myself No I said aloud I dont want the cart I shall want to be
near your homestead tomorrow and if you will let me I will stay the
night in your haybarn

You are very welcome But will you be comfortable in the barn I will
tell the women to lay a sheet and put you a pillow Hey girls he
cried getting up from his place here girls And you Fedya go
with them Women you know are foolish folk

A quarter of an hour later Fedya conducted me with a lantern to the
barn I threw myself down on the fragrant hay my dog curled himself up
at my feet Fedya wished me goodnight the door creaked and slammed
to For rather a long time I could not get to sleep A cow came up to
the door and breathed heavily twice the dog growled at her with
dignity a pig passed by grunting pensively a horse somewhere near
began to munch the hay and snort At last I fell asleep

At sunrise Fedya awakened me This brisk lively young man pleased me
and from what I could see he was old Hors favourite too They used
to banter one another in a very friendly way The old man came to meet
me Whether because I had spent the night under his roof or for some
other reason Hor certainly treated me far more cordially than the day
before

The samovar is ready he told me with a smile let us come and have
tea

We took our seats at the table A robustlooking peasant woman one of
his daughtersinlaw brought in a jug of milk All his sons came one
after another into the cottage

What a fine set of fellows you have I remarked to the old man

Yes he said breaking off a tiny piece of sugar with his teeth me
and my old woman have nothing to complain of seemingly

And do they all live with you

Yes they choose to themselves and so they live here

And are they all married

Heres one not married the scamp he answered pointing to Fedya
who was leaning as before against the door Vaska hes still too
young he can wait

And why should I get married retorted Fedya Im very well off as I
am What do I want a wife for To squabble with eh

Now then you  ah I know you you wear a silver ring Youd
always be after the girls up at the manor house Have done do for
shame the old man went on mimicking the servant girls Ah I know
you you whitehanded rascal

But whats the good of a peasant woman

A peasant womanis a labourer said Hor seriously she is the
peasants servant

And what do I want with a labourer

I dare say youd like to play with the fire and let others burn their
fingers we know the sort of chap you are

Well marry me then Well why dont you answer

There thats enough thats enough giddy pate You see were
disturbing the gentleman Ill marry you depend on it And you
your honour dont be vexed with him you see hes only a baby hes
not had time to get much sense

Fedya shook his head

Is Hor at home sounded a wellknown voice and Kalinitch came into
the cottage with a bunch of wild strawberries in his hands which he
had gathered for his friend Hor The old man gave him a warm welcome I
looked with surprise at Kalinitch I confess I had not expected such a
delicate attention on the part of a peasant

That day I started out to hunt four hours later than usual and the
following three days I spent at Hors My new friends interested me I
dont know how I had gained their confidence but they began to talk to
me without constraint The two friends were not at all alike Hor was a
positive practical man with a head for management a rationalist
Kalinitch on the other hand belonged to the order of idealists and
dreamers of romantic and enthusiastic spirits Hor had a grasp of
actualitythat is to say he looked ahead was saving a little money
kept on good terms with his master and the other authorities Kalinitch
wore shoes of bast and lived from hand to mouth Hor had reared a
large family who were obedient and united Kalinitch had once had a
wife whom he had been afraid of and he had had no children Hor took
a very critical view of Mr Polutikin Kalinitch revered his master
Hor loved Kalinitch and took protecting care of him Kalinitch loved
and respected Hor Hor spoke little chuckled and thought for himself
Kalinitch expressed himself with warmth though he had not the flow of
fine language of a smart factory hand But Kalinitch was endowed with
powers which even Hor recognised he could charm away haemorrhages
fits madness and worms his bees always did well he had a light
hand Hor asked him before me to introduce a newly bought horse to his
stable and with scrupulous gravity Kalinitch carried out the old
sceptics request Kalinitch was in closer contact with nature Hor
with men and society Kalinitch had no liking for argument and
believed in everything blindly Hor had reached even an ironical point
of view of life He had seen and experienced much and I learnt a good
deal from him For instance from his account I learnt that every year
before mowingtime a small peculiarlooking cart makes its appearance
in the villages In this cart sits a man in a long coat who sells
scythes He charges one rouble twentyfive copecksa rouble and a half
in notesfor ready money four roubles if he gives credit All the
peasants of course take the scythes from him on credit In two or
three weeks he reappears and asks for the money As the peasant has
only just cut his oats he is able to pay him he goes with the
merchant to the tavern and there the debt is settled Some landowners
conceived the idea of buying the scythes themselves for ready money and
letting the peasants have them on credit for the same price but the
peasants seemed dissatisfied even dejected they had deprived them of
the pleasure of tapping the scythe and listening to the ring of the
metal turning it over and over in their hands and telling the
scoundrelly citytrader twenty times over Eh my friend you wont
take me in with your scythe The same tricks are played over the sale
of sickles only with this difference that the women have a hand in
the business then and they sometimes drive the trader himself to the
necessityfor their good of courseof beating them But the women
suffer most illtreatment through the following circumstances
Contractors for the supply of stuff for paper factories employ for the
purchase of rags a special class of men who in some districts are
called eagles Such an eagle receives two hundred roubles in
banknotes from the merchant and starts off in search of his prey
But unlike the noble bird from whom he has derived his name he does
not swoop down openly and boldly upon it quite the contrary the
eagle has recourse to deceit and cunning He leaves his cart
somewhere in a thicket near the village and goes himself to the
backyards and backdoors like someone casually passing or simply a
tramp The women scent out his proximity and steal out to meet him The
bargain is hurriedly concluded For a few copper halfpence a woman
gives the eagle not only every useless rag she has but often even
her husbands shirt and her own petticoat Of late the women have
thought it profitable to steal even from themselves and to sell hemp
in the same waya great extension and improvement of the business for
the eagles To meet this however the peasants have grown more
cunning in their turn and on the slightest suspicion on the most
distant rumors of the approach of an eagle they have prompt and
sharp recourse to corrective and preventive measures And after all
wasnt it disgraceful To sell the hemp was the mens businessand
they certainly do sell itnot in the town they would have to drag it
there themselves but to traders who come for it who for want of
scales reckon forty handfuls to the poodand you know what a
Russians hand is and what it can hold especially when he tries his
best As I had had no experience and was not countrybred as they
say in Orel I heard plenty of such descriptions But Hor was not
always the narrator he questioned me too about many things He learned
that I had been in foreign parts and his curiosity was aroused
Kalinitch was not behind him in curiosity but he was more attracted by
descriptions of nature of mountains and waterfalls extraordinary
buildings and great towns Hor was interested in questions of
government and administration He went through everything in order
Well is that with them as it is with us or different Come tell
us your honour how is it Ah Lord thy will be done Kalinitch
would exclaim while I told my story Hor did not speak but frowned
with his bushy eyebrows only observing at times That wouldnt do for
us still its a good thingits right All his inquiries I cannot
recount and it is unnecessary but from our conversations I carried
away one conviction which my readers will certainly not anticipate 
the conviction that Peter the Great was preeminently a
RussianRussian above all in his reforms The Russian is so
convinced of his own strength and powers that he is not afraid of
putting himself to severe strain he takes little interest in his past
and looks boldly forward What is good he likes what is sensible he
will have and where it comes from he does not care His vigorous sense
is fond of ridiculing the thin theorising of the German but in Hors
words The Germans are curious folk and he was ready to learn from
them a little Thanks to his exceptional position his practical
independence Hor told me a great deal which you could not screw oras
the peasants saygrind with a grindstone out of any other man He
did in fact understand his position Talking with Hor I for the
first time listened to the simple wise discourse of the Russian
peasant His acquirements were in his own opinion wide enough but he
could not read though Kalinitch could That neerdoweel has
schoollearning observed Hor and his bees never die in the winter
But havent you had your children taught to read Hor was silent a
minute Fedya can read And the others The others cant And
why The old man made no answer and changed the subject However
sensible as he was he had many prejudices and crotchets He despised
women for instance from the depths of his soul and in his merry
moments he amused himself by jesting at their expense His wife was a
cross old woman who lay all day long on the stove incessantly
grumbling and scolding her sons paid no attention to her but she kept
her daughtersinlaw in the fear of God Very significantly the
motherinlaw sings in the Russian ballad What a son art thou to me
What a head of a household Thou dost not beat thy wife thou dost not
beat thy young wife I once attempted to intercede for the
daughtersinlaw and tried to rouse Hors sympathy but he met me with
the tranquil rejoinder Why did I want to trouble about such 
trifles let the women fight it out  If anything separates them it
only makes it worse  and its not worth dirtying ones hands over
Sometimes the spiteful old woman got down from the stove and called the
yard dog out of the hay crying Here here doggie and then beat it
on its thin back with the poker or she would stand in the porch and
snarl as Hor expressed it at everyone that passed She stood in awe
of her husband though and would return at his command to her place
on the stove It was specially curious to hear Hor and Kalinitch
dispute whenever Mr Polutikin was touched upon

There Hor do let him alone Kalinitch would say But why doesnt
he order some boots for you Hor retorted Eh boots what do I
want with boots I am a peasant Well so am I a peasant but look
And Hor lifted up his leg and showed Kalinitch a boot which looked as
if it had been cut out of a mammoths hide As if you were like one of
us replied Kalinitch Well at least he might pay for your bast
shoes you go out hunting with him you must use a pair a day He
does give me something for bast shoes Yes he gave you two coppers
last year

Kalinitch turned away in vexation but Hor went off into a chuckle
during which his little eyes completely disappeared

Kalinitch sang rather sweetly and played a little on the balalaca Hor
was never weary of listening to him all at once he would let his head
drop on one side and begin to chime in in a lugubrious voice He was
particularly fond of the song Ah my fate my fate Fedya never lost
an opportunity of making fun of his father saying What are you so
mournful about old man But Hor leaned his cheek on his hand covered
his eyes and continued to mourn over his fate Yet at other times
there could not be a more active man he was always busy over
somethingmending the cart patching up the fence looking after the
harness He did not insist on a very high degree of cleanliness
however and in answer to some remark of mine said once A cottage
ought to smell as if it were lived in

Look I answered how clean it is in Kalinitchs beehouse

The bees would not live there else your honour he said with a sigh

Tell me he asked me another time have you an estate of your own
Yes Far from here A hundred miles Do you live on your land
your honour Yes

But you like your gun best I dare say

Yes I must confess I do And you do well your honour shoot grouse
to your hearts content and change your bailiff pretty often

On the fourth day Mr Polutikin sent for me in the evening I was sorry
to part from the old man I took my seat with Kalinitch in the trap
Well goodbye Horgood luck to you I said goodbye Fedya

Goodbye your honour goodbye dont forget us We started there
was the first red glow of sunset It will be a fine day tomorrow I
remarked looking at the clear sky No it will rain Kalinitch
replied the ducks yonder are splashing and the scent of the grass is
strong We drove into the copse Kalinitch began singing in an
undertone as he was jolted up and down on the drivers seat and he
kept gazing and gazing at the sunset

The next day I left the hospitable roof of Mr Polutikin



                                   II

                     YERMOLA AND THE MILLERS WIFE


One evening I went with the huntsman Yermola standshooting  But
perhaps all my readers may not know what standshooting is I will
tell you

A quarter of an hour before sunset in springtime you go out into the
woods with your gun but without your dog You seek out a spot for
yourself on the outskirts of the forest take a look round examine
your caps and glance at your companion A quarter of an hour passes
the sun has set but it is still light in the forest the sky is clear
and transparent the birds are chattering and twittering the young
grass shines with the brilliance of emerald You wait Gradually the
recesses of the forest grow dark the bloodred glow of the evening sky
creeps slowly on to the roots and the trunks of the trees and keeps
rising higher and higher passes from the lower still almost leafless
branches to the motionless slumbering treetops And now even the
topmost branches are darkened the purple sky fades to darkblue The
forest fragrance grows stronger there is a scent of warmth and damp
earth the fluttering breeze dies away at your side The birds go to
sleepnot all at oncebut after their kinds first the finches are
hushed a few minutes later the warblers and after them the yellow
buntings In the forest it grows darker and darker The trees melt
together into great masses of blackness in the darkblue sky the first
stars come timidly out All the birds are asleep Only the redstarts
and the nuthatches are still chirping drowsily And now they too are
still The last echoing call of the peewit rings over our heads the
orioles melancholy cry sounds somewhere in the distance then the
nightingales first note Your heart is weary with suspense when
suddenlybut only sportsmen can understand mesuddenly in the deep
hush there is a peculiar croaking and whirring sound the measured
sweep of swift wings is heard and the snipe gracefully bending its
long beak sails smoothly down behind a dark bush to meet your shot

That is the meaning of standshooting And so I had gone out
standshooting with Yermola but excuse me reader I must first
introduce you to Yermola

Picture to yourself a tall gaunt man of fortyfive with a long thin
nose a narrow forehead little grey eyes a bristling head of hair
and thick sarcastic lips This man wore winter and summer alike a
yellow nankin coat of German cut but with a sash round the waist he
wore blue pantaloons and a cap of astrakhan presented to him in a
merry hour by a spendthrift landowner Two bags were fastened on to his
sash one in front skilfully tied into two halves for powder and for
shot the other behind for game wadding Yermola used to produce out
of his peculiar seemingly inexhaustible cap With the money he gained
by the game he sold he might easily have bought himself a
cartridgebox and powderflask but he never once even contemplated
such a purchase and continued to load his gun after his old fashion
exciting the admiration of all beholders by the skill with which he
avoided the risks of spilling or mixing his powder and shot His gun
was a singlebarrelled flintlock endowed moreover with a villainous
habit of kicking It was due to this that Yermolas right cheek was
permanently swollen to a larger size than the left How he ever
succeeded in hitting anything with this gun it would take a shrewd man
to discoverbut he did He had too a setterdog by name Valetka a
most extraordinary creature Yermola never fed him Me feed a dog
he reasoned why a dogs a clever beast he finds a living for
himself And certainly though Valetkas extreme thinness was a shock
even to an indifferent observer he still lived and had a long life
and in spite of his pitiable position he was not even once lost and
never showed an inclination to desert his master Once indeed in his
youth he had absented himself for two days on courting bent but this
folly was soon over with him Valetkas most noticeable peculiarity was
his impenetrable indifference to everything in the world If it were
not a dog I was speaking of I should have called him disillusioned
He usually sat with his cropped tail curled up under him scowling and
twitching at times and he never smiled It is well known that dogs
can smile and smile very sweetly He was exceedingly ugly and the
idle houseserfs never lost an opportunity of jeering cruelly at his
appearance but all these jeers and even blows Valetka bore with
astonishing indifference He was a source of special delight to the
cooks who would all leave their work at once and give him chase with
shouts and abuse whenever through a weakness not confined to dogs he
thrust his hungry nose through the halfopen door of the kitchen
tempting with its warmth and appetising smells He distinguished
himself by untiring energy in the chase and had a good scent but if
he chanced to overtake a slightly wounded hare he devoured it with
relish to the last bone somewhere in the cool shade under the green
bushes at a respectful distance from Yermola who was abusing him in
every known and unknown dialect Yermola belonged to one of my
neighbours a landowner of the old style Landowners of the old style
dont care for game and prefer the domestic fowl Only on
extraordinary occasions such as birthdays namedays and elections
the cooks of the oldfashioned landowners set to work to prepare some
longbeaked birds and falling into the state of frenzy peculiar to
Russians when they dont quite know what to do they concoct such
marvellous sauces for them that the guests examine the proffered dishes
curiously and attentively but rarely make up their minds to try them
Yermola was under orders to provide his masters kitchen with two
brace of grouse and partridges once a month But he might live where
and how he pleased They had given him up as a man of no use for work
of any kindbone lazy as the expression is among us in Orel Powder
and shot of course they did not provide him following precisely the
same principle in virtue of which he did not feed his dog Yermola was
a very strange kind of man heedless as a bird rather fond of talking
awkward and vacantlooking he was excessively fond of drink and never
could sit still long in walking he shambled along and rolled from
side to side and yet he got over fifty miles in the day with his
rolling shambling gait He exposed himself to the most varied
adventures spent the night in the marshes in trees on roofs or
under bridges more than once he had got shut up in lofts cellars or
barns he sometimes lost his gun his dog his most indispensable
garments got long and severe thrashings but he always returned home
after a little while in his clothes and with his gun and his dog One
could not call him a cheerful man though one almost always found him
in an even frame of mind he was looked on generally as an eccentric
Yermola liked a little chat with a good companion especially over a
glass but he would not stop long he would get up and go But where
the devil are you going Its dark out of doors To Tchaplino But
whats taking you to Tchaplino ten miles away I am going to stay
the night at Sophrons there But stay the night here No I
cant And Yermola with his Valetka would go off into the dark
night through woods and watercourses and the peasant Sophron very
likely did not let him into his place and even I am afraid gave him
a blow to teach him not to disturb honest folks But none could
compare with Yermola in skill in deepwater fishing in springtime in
catching crayfish with his hands in tracking game by scent in snaring
quails in training hawks in capturing the nightingales who had the
greatest variety of notes  One thing he could not do train a dog
he had not patience enough He had a wife too He went to see her once
a week She lived in a wretched tumbledown little hut and led a
handtomouth existence never knowing overnight whether she would have
food to eat on the morrow and in every way her lot was a pitiful one
Yermola who seemed such a careless and easygoing fellow treated his
wife with cruel harshness in his own house he assumed a stern and
menacing manner and his poor wife did everything she could to please
him trembled when he looked at her and spent her last farthing to buy
him vodka and when he stretched himself majestically on the stove and
fell into an heroic sleep she obsequiously covered him with a
sheepskin I happened myself more than once to catch an involuntary
look in him of a kind of savage ferocity I did not like the expression
of his face when he finished off a wounded bird with his teeth But
Yermola never remained more than a day at home and away from home he
was once more the same Yermolka ie the shootingcap as he was
called for a hundred miles round and as he sometimes called himself
The lowest houseserf was conscious of being superior to this
vagabondand perhaps this was precisely why they treated him with
friendliness the peasants at first amused themselves by chasing him
and driving him like a hare over the open country but afterwards they
left him in Gods hands and when once they recognised him as queer
they no longer tormented him and even gave him bread and entered into
talk with him This was the man I took as my huntsman and with him
I went standshooting to a great birchwood on the banks of the Ista

Many Russian rivers like the Volga have one bank rugged and
precipitous the other bounded by level meadows and so it is with the
Ista This small river winds extremely capriciously coils like a
snake and does not keep a straight course for halfamile together in
some places from the top of a sharp declivity one can see the river
for ten miles with its dykes its pools and mills and the gardens on
its banks shut in with willows and thick flowergardens There are
fish in the Ista in endless numbers especially roaches the peasants
take them in hot weather from under the bushes with their hands
little sandpipers flutter whistling along the stony banks which are
streaked with cold clear streams wild ducks dive in the middle of the
pools and look round warily in the coves under the overhanging cliffs
herons stand out in the shade We stood in ambush nearly an hour
killed two brace of wood snipe and as we wanted to try our luck again
at sunrise standshooting can be done as well in the early morning
we resolved to spend the night at the nearest mill We came out of the
wood and went down the slope The darkblue waters of the river ran
below the air was thick with the mists of night We knocked at the
gate The dogs began barking in the yard

Who is there asked a hoarse and sleepy voice

We are sportsmen let us stay the night There was no reply We will
pay

I will go and tell the masterSh Curse the dogs Go to the devil
with you

We listened as the workman went into the cottage he soon came back to
the gate No he said the master tells me not to let you in

Why not

He is afraid you are sportsmen you might set the mill on fire
youve firearms with you to be sure

But what nonsense

We had our mill on fire like that last year some fishdealers stayed
the night and they managed to set it on fire somehow

But my good friend we cant sleep in the open air

Thats your business He went away his boots clacking as he walked

Yermola promised him various unpleasant things in the future Let us
go to the village he brought out at last with a sigh But it was two
miles to the village

Let us stay the night here I said in the open airthe night is
warm the miller will let us have some straw if we pay for it

Yermola agreed without discussion We began again to knock

Well what do you want the workmans voice was heard again Ive
told you we cant

We explained to him what we wanted He went to consult the master of
the house and returned with him The little side gate creaked The
miller appeared a tall fatfaced man with a bullneck roundbellied
and corpulent He agreed to my proposal A hundred paces from the mill
there was a little outhouse open to the air on all sides They carried
straw and hay there for us the workman set a samovar down on the grass
near the river and squatting on his heels began to blow vigorously
into the pipe of it The embers glowed and threw a bright light on his
young face The miller ran to wake his wife and suggested at last that
I myself should sleep in the cottage but I preferred to remain in the
open air The millers wife brought us milk eggs potatoes and bread
Soon the samovar boiled and we began drinking tea A mist had risen
from the river there was no wind from all round came the cry of the
corncrake and faint sounds from the millwheels of drops that dripped
from the paddles and of water gurgling through the bars of the lock We
built a small fire on the ground While Yermola was baking the
potatoes in the embers I had time to fall into a doze I was waked by
a discreetlysubdued whispering near me I lifted my head before the
fire on a tub turned upside down the millers wife sat talking to my
huntsman By her dress her movements and her manner of speaking I
had already recognised that she had been in domestic service and was
neither peasant nor citybred but now for the first time I got a clear
view of her features She looked about thirty her thin pale face
still showed the traces of remarkable beauty what particularly charmed
me was her eyes large and mournful in expression She was leaning her
elbows on her knees and had her face in her hands Yermola was
sitting with his back to me and thrusting sticks into the fire

Theyve the cattleplague again at Zheltonhiny the millers wife was
saying father Ivans two cows are deadLord have mercy on them

And how are your pigs doing asked Yermola after a brief pause

Theyre alive

You ought to make me a present of a sucking pig

The millers wife was silent for a while then she sighed

Who is it youre with she asked

A gentleman from Kostomarovo

Yermola threw a few pine twigs on the fire they all caught fire at
once and a thick white smoke came puffing into his face

Why didnt your husband let us into the cottage

Hes afraid

Afraid the fat old tub Arina Timofyevna my darling bring me a
little glass of spirits

The millers wife rose and vanished into the darkness Yermola began
to sing in an undertone

     When I went to see my sweetheart
      I wore out all my shoes


Arina returned with a small flask and a glass Yermola got up crossed
himself and drank it off at a draught Good was his comment

The millers wife sat down again on the tub

Well Arina Timofyevna are you still ill

Yes

What is it

My cough troubles me at night

The gentlemans asleep it seems observed Yermola after a short
silence Dont go to a doctor Arina it will be worse if you do

Well I am not going

But come and pay me a visit

Arina hung down her head dejectedly

I will drive my wife out for the occasion continued Yermola Upon
my word I will

You had better wake the gentleman Yermola Petrovitch you see the
potatoes are done

Oh let him snore observed my faithful servant indifferently hes
tired with walking so he sleeps sound

I turned over in the hay Yermola got up and came to me The potatoes
are ready will you come and eat them

I came out of the outhouse the millers wife got up from the tub and
was going away I addressed her

Have you kept this mill long

Its two years since I came on Trinity day

And where does your husband come from

Arina had not caught my question

Wheres your husband from repeated Yermola raising his voice

From Byelev Hes a Byelev townsman

And are you too from Byelev

No Im a serf I was a serf

Whose

Zvyerkoff was my master Now I am free

What Zvyerkoff

Alexandr Selitch

Werent you his wifes ladys maid

How did you know Yes

I looked at Arina with redoubled curiosity and sympathy

I know your master I continued

Do you she replied in a low voice and her head drooped

I must tell the reader why I looked with such sympathy at Arina During
my stay at Petersburg I had become by chance acquainted with Mr
Zvyerkoff He had a rather influential position and was reputed a man
of sense and education He had a wife fat sentimental lachrymose and
spitefula vulgar and disagreeable creature he had too a son the
very type of the young swell of today pampered and stupid The
exterior of Mr Zvyerkoff himself did not prepossess one in his favour
his little mouselike eyes peeped slyly out of a broad almost square
face he had a large prominent nose with distended nostrils his
closecropped grey hair stood up like a brush above his scowling brow
his thin lips were for ever twitching and smiling mawkishly Mr
Zvyerkoffs favourite position was standing with his legs wide apart
and his fat hands in his trouser pockets Once I happened somehow to be
driving alone with Mr Zvyerkoff in a coach out of town We fell into
conversation As a man of experience and of judgment Mr Zvyerkoff
began to try to set me in the path of truth

Allow me to observe to you he drawled at last all you young people
criticise and form judgments on everything at random you have little
knowledge of your own country Russia young gentlemen is an unknown
land to you thats where it is You are for ever reading German
For instance now you say this and that and the other about anything
for instance about the houseserfs Very fine I dont dispute its
all very fine but you dont know them you dont know the kind of
people they are Mr Zvyerkoff blew his nose loudly and took a pinch
of snuff Allow me to tell you as an illustration one little
anecdote it may perhaps interest you Mr Zvyerkoff cleared his
throat You know doubtless what my wife is it would be difficult
I should imagine to find a more kindhearted woman you will agree
For her waitingmaids existence is simply a perfect paradise and no
mistake about it But my wife has made it a rule never to keep
married ladys maids Certainly it would not do children comeand one
thing and the otherand how is a ladys maid to look after her
mistress as she ought to fit in with her ways she is no longer able
to do it her mind is in other things One must look at things through
human nature Well we were driving once through our village it must
belet me be correctyes fifteen years ago We saw at the
bailiffs a young girl his daughter very pretty indeed something
evenyou knowsomething attractive in her manners And my wife said
to me Kokyou understand of course that is her pet name for
melet us take this girl to Petersburg I like her Kok I said
Let us take her by all means The bailiff of course was at our
feet he could not have expected such good fortune you can imagine
Well the girl of course cried violently Of course it was hard for
her at first the parental home  in fact  there was nothing
surprising in that However she soon got used to us at first we put
her in the maidservants room they trained her of course And what do
you think The girl made wonderful progress my wife became simply
devoted to her promoted her at last above the rest to wait on herself
 observe And one must do her the justice to say my wife had
never such a maid absolutely never attentive modest and
obedientsimply all that could be desired But my wife I must
confess spoilt her too much she dressed her well fed her from our
own table gave her tea to drink and so on as you can imagine So she
waited on my wife like this for ten years Suddenly one fine morning
picture to yourself Arinaher name was Arinarushes unannounced into
my study and flops down at my feet Thats a thing I tell you
plainly I cant endure No human being ought ever to lose sight of
their personal dignity Am I not right What do you say Your honour
Alexandr Selitch I beseech a favour of you What favour Let me be
married I must confess I was taken aback But you know you stupid
your mistress has no other ladys maid I will wait on mistress as
before Nonsense nonsense your mistress cant endure married ladys
maids Malanya could take my place Pray dont argue I obey your
will I must confess it was quite a shock I assure you I am like
that nothing wounds me sonothing I venture to say wounds me so
deeply as ingratitude I need not tell youyou know what my wife is
an angel upon earth goodness inexhaustible One would fancy even the
worst of men would be ashamed to hurt her Well I got rid of Arina I
thought perhaps she would come to her senses I was unwilling do you
know to believe in wicked black ingratitude in anyone What do you
think Within six months she thought fit to come to me again with the
same request I felt revolted But imagine my amazement when some time
later my wife comes to me in tears so agitated that I felt positively
alarmed What has happened Arina You understand  I am
ashamed to tell it  Impossible  Who is the man Petrushka
the footman My indignation broke out then I am like that I dont
like half measures Petrushka was not to blame We might flog him but
in my opinion he was not to blame Arina Well well well what
mores to be said I gave orders of course that her hair should be
cut off she should be dressed in sackcloth and sent into the country
My wife was deprived of an excellent ladys maid but there was no help
for it immorality cannot be tolerated in a household in any case
Better to cut off the infected member at once There there now you
can judge the thing for yourselfyou know that my wife is  yes
yes yes indeed an angel She had grown attached to Arina and
Arina knew it and had the face to  Eh no tell me  eh And
whats the use of talking about it Any way there was no help for it
I indeedI in particular felt hurt felt wounded for a long time by
the ingratitude of this girl Whatever you sayits no good to look
for feeling for heart in these people You may feed the wolf as you
will he has always a hankering for the woods Education by all means
But I only wanted to give you an example

And Mr Zvyerkoff without finishing his sentence turned away his
head and wrapping himself more closely into his cloak manfully
repressed his involuntary emotion

The reader now probably understands why I looked with sympathetic
interest at Arina

Have you long been married to the miller I asked her at last

Two years

How was it Did your master allow it

They bought my freedom

Who

Savely Alexyevitch

Who is that

My husband Yermola smiled to himself Has my master perhaps
spoken to you of me added Arina after a brief silence

I did not know what reply to make to her question

Arina cried the miller from a distance She got up and walked away

Is her husband a good fellow I asked Yermola

Soso

Have they any children

There was one but it died

How was it Did the miller take a liking to her Did he give much to
buy her freedom

I dont know She can read and write in their business its of use I
suppose he liked her

And have you known her long

Yes I used to go to her masters Their house isnt far from here

And do you know the footman Petrushka

Piotr Vassilyevitch Of course I knew him

Where is he now

He was sent for a soldier

We were silent for a while

She doesnt seem well I asked Yermola at last

I should think not Tomorrow I say we shall have good sport A
little sleep now would do us no harm

A flock of wild ducks swept whizzing over our heads and we heard them
drop down into the river not far from us It was now quite dark and it
began to be cold in the thicket sounded the melodious notes of a
nightingale We buried ourselves in the hay and fell asleep



                                   III

                            RASPBERRY SPRING


At the beginning of August the heat often becomes insupportable At
that season from twelve to three oclock the most determined and
ardent sportsman is not able to hunt and the most devoted dog begins
to clean his masters spurs that is to follow at his heels his
eyes painfully blinking and his tongue hanging out to an exaggerated
length and in response to his masters reproaches he humbly wags his
tail and shows his confusion in his face but he does not run forward
I happened to be out hunting on exactly such a day I had long been
fighting against the temptation to lie down somewhere in the shade at
least for a moment for a long time my indefatigable dog went on
running about in the bushes though he clearly did not himself expect
much good from his feverish activity The stifling heat compelled me at
last to begin to think of husbanding our energies and strength I
managed to reach the little river Ista which is already known to my
indulgent readers descended the steep bank and walked along the damp
yellow sand in the direction of the spring known to the whole
neighbourhood as Raspberry Spring This spring gushes out of a cleft in
the bank which widens out by degrees into a small but deep creek and
twenty paces beyond it falls with a merry babbling sound into the
river the short velvety grass is green about the source the suns
rays scarcely ever reach its cold silvery water I came as far as the
spring a cup of birchwood lay on the grass left by a passing peasant
for the public benefit I quenched my thirst lay down in the shade
and looked round In the cave which had been formed by the flowing of
the stream into the river and hence marked for ever with the trace of
ripples two old men were sitting with their backs to me One a rather
stout and tall man in a neat darkgreen coat and lined cap was
fishing the other was thin and little he wore a patched fustian coat
and no cap he held a little pot full of worms on his knees and
sometimes lifted his hand up to his grizzled little head as though he
wanted to protect it from the sun I looked at him more attentively
and recognised in him Styopushka of Shumihino I must ask the readers
leave to present this man to him

A few miles from my place there is a large village called Shumihino
with a stone church erected in the name of St Kosmo and St Damian
Facing this church there had once stood a large and stately
manorhouse surrounded by various outhouses offices workshops
stables and coachhouses baths and temporary kitchens wings for
visitors and for bailiffs conservatories swings for the people and
other more or less useful edifices A family of rich landowners lived
in this manorhouse and all went well with them till suddenly one
morning all this prosperity was burnt to ashes The owners removed to
another home the place was deserted The blackened site of the immense
house was transformed into a kitchengarden cumbered up in parts by
piles of bricks the remains of the old foundations A little hut had
been hurriedly put together out of the beams that had escaped the fire
it was roofed with timber bought ten years before for the construction
of a pavilion in the Gothic style and the gardener Mitrofan with his
wife Axinya and their seven children was installed in it Mitrofan
received orders to send greens and gardenstuff for the masters table
a hundred and fifty miles away Axinya was put in charge of a Tyrolese
cow which had been bought for a high price in Moscow but had not
given a drop of milk since its acquisition a crested smokecoloured
drake too had been left in her hands the solitary seignorial bird
for the children in consideration of their tender age no special
duties had been provided a fact however which had not hindered them
from growing up utterly lazy It happened to me on two occasions to
stay the night at this gardeners and when I passed by I used to get
cucumbers from him which for some unknown reason were even in summer
peculiar for their size their poor watery flavour and their thick
yellow skin It was there I first saw Styopushka Except Mitrofan and
his family and the old deaf churchwarden Gerasim kept out of charity
in a little room at the oneeyed soldiers widows not one man among
the houseserfs had remained at Shumihino for Styopushka whom I
intend to introduce to the reader could not be classified under the
special order of houseserfs and hardly under the genus man at all

Every man has some kind of position in society and at least some ties
of some sort every houseserf receives if not wages at least some
socalled ration Styopushka had absolutely no means of subsistence
of any kind had no relationship to anyone no one knew of his
existence This man had not even a past there was no story told of
him he had probably never been enrolled on a censusrevision There
were vague rumours that he had once belonged to someone as a valet but
who he was where he came from who was his father and how he had come
to be one of the Shumihino people in what way he had come by the
fustian coat he had worn from immemorial times where he lived and what
he lived onon all these questions no one had the least idea and to
tell the truth no one took any interest in the subject Grandfather
Trofimitch who knew all the pedigrees of all the houseserfs in the
direct line to the fourth generation had once indeed been known to say
that he remembered that Styopushka was related to a Turkish woman whom
the late master the brigadier Alexy Romanitch had been pleased to
bring home from a campaign in the baggage waggon Even on holidays
days of general moneygiving and of feasting on buckwheat dumplings and
vodka after the old Russian fashioneven on such days Styopushka did
not put in an appearance at the trestletables nor at the barrels he
did not make his bow nor kiss the masters hand nor toss off to the
masters health and under the masters eye a glass filled by the fat
hands of the bailiff Some kind soul who passed by him might share an
unfinished bit of dumpling with the poor beggar perhaps At Easter
they said Christ is risen to him but he did not pull up his greasy
sleeve and bring out of the depths of his pocket a coloured egg to
offer it panting and blinking to his young masters or to the mistress
herself He lived in summer in a little shed behind the chickenhouse
and in winter in the anteroom of the bathhouse in the bitter frosts
he spent the night in the hayloft The houseserfs had grown used to
seeing him sometimes they gave him a kick but no one ever addressed a
remark to him as for him he seems never to have opened his lips from
the time of his birth After the conflagration this forsaken creature
sought a refuge at the gardener Mitrofans The gardener left him
alone he did not say Live with me but he did not drive him away
And Styopushka did not live at the gardeners his abode was the
garden He moved and walked about quite noiselessly he sneezed and
coughed behind his hand not without apprehension he was for ever busy
and going stealthily to and fro like an ant and all to get
foodsimply food to eat And indeed if he had not toiled from morning
till night for his living our poor friend would certainly have died of
hunger Its a sad lot not to know in the morning what you will find to
eat before night Sometimes Styopushka sits under the hedge and gnaws a
radish or sucks a carrot or shreds up some dirty cabbagestalks or he
drags a bucket of water along for some object or other groaning as he
goes or he lights a fire under a small pot and throws in some little
black scraps which he takes from out of the bosom of his coat or he is
hammering in his little wooden dendriving in a nail putting up a
shelf for bread And all this he does silently as though on the sly
before you can look round hes in hiding again Sometimes he suddenly
disappears for a couple of days but of course no one notices his
absence Then lo and behold he is there again somewhere under the
hedge stealthily kindling a fire of sticks under a kettle He had a
small face yellowish eyes hair coming down to his eyebrows a sharp
nose large transparent ears like a bats and a beard that looked as
if it were a fortnights growth and never grew more nor less This
then was Styopushka whom I met on the bank of the Ista in company
with another old man

I went up to him wished him goodday and sat down beside him
Styopushkas companion too I recognised as an acquaintance he was a
freed serf of Count Piotr Ilitchs one Mihal Savelitch nicknamed
Tuman ie fog He lived with a consumptive Bolhovsky man who kept
an inn where I had several times stayed Young officials and other
persons of leisure travelling on the Orel highroad merchants buried
in their striped rugs have other things to do may still see at no
great distance from the large village of Troitska and almost on the
highroad an immense twostoried wooden house completely deserted
with its roof falling in and its windows closely stuffed up At midday
in bright sunny weather nothing can be imagined more melancholy than
this ruin Here there once lived Count Piotr Ilitch a rich grandee of
the olden time renowned for his hospitality At one time the whole
province used to meet at his house to dance and make merry to their
hearts content to the deafening sound of a hometrained orchestra and
the popping of rockets and Roman candles and doubtless more than one
aged lady sighs as she drives by the deserted palace of the boyar and
recalls the old days and her vanished youth The count long continued
to give balls and to walk about with an affable smile among the crowd
of fawning guests but his property unluckily was not enough to last
his whole life When he was entirely ruined he set off to Petersburg
to try for a post for himself and died in a room at a hotel without
having gained anything by his efforts Tuman had been a steward of his
and had received his freedom already in the counts lifetime He was a
man of about seventy with a regular and pleasant face He was almost
continually smiling as only men of the time of Catherine ever do
smilea smile at once stately and indulgent in speaking he slowly
opened and closed his lips winked genially with his eyes and spoke
slightly through his nose He blew his nose and took snuff too in a
leisurely fashion as though he were doing something serious

Well Mihal Savelitch I began have you caught any fish

Here if you will deign to look in the basket I have caught two perch
and five roaches Show them Styopka

Styopushka stretched out the basket to me

How are you Styopka I asked him

Ohohnotnotnot so badly your honour answered Stepan
stammering as though he had a heavy weight on his tongue

And is Mitrofan well

Wellyes yesyour honour

The poor fellow turned away

But there are not many bites remarked Tuman its so fearfully hot
the fish are all tired out under the bushes theyre asleep Put on a
worm Styopka Styopushka took out a worm laid it on his open hand
struck it two or three times put it on the hook spat on it and gave
it to Tuman Thanks Styopka And you your honour he continued
turning to me are pleased to be out hunting

As you see

Ahand is your dog there English or German

The old man liked to show off on occasion as though he would say I
too have lived in the world

I dont know what breed it is but its a good dog

Ah and do you go out with the hounds too

Yes I have two leashes of hounds

Tuman smiled and shook his head

Thats just it one man is devoted to dogs and another doesnt want
them for anything According to my simple notions I fancy dogs should
be kept rather for appearance sake  and all should be in style too
horses too should be in style and huntsmen in style as they ought to
be and all The late countGods grace be with himwas never I
must own much of a hunter but he kept dogs and twice a year he was
pleased to go out with them The huntsmen assembled in the courtyard
in red caftans trimmed with galloon and blew their horns his
excellency would be pleased to come out and his excellencys horse
would be led up his excellency would mount and the chief huntsman
puts his feet in the stirrups takes his hat off and puts the reins in
his hat to offer them to his excellency His excellency is pleased to
click his whip like this and the huntsmen give a shout and off they
go out of the gate away A huntsman rides behind the count and holds
in a silken leash two of the masters favourite dogs and looks after
them well you may fancy And he too this huntsman sits up high
on a Cossack saddle such a redcheeked fellow he was and rolled his
eyes like this And there were guests too you may be sure on such
occasions and entertainment and ceremonies observed Ah hes got
away the Asiatic He interrupted himself suddenly drawing in his
line

They say the count used to live pretty freely in his day I asked

The old man spat on the worm and lowered the line in again

He was a great gentleman as is wellknown At times the persons of
the first rank one may say at Petersburg used to visit him With
coloured ribbons on their breasts they used to sit down to table and
eat Well he knew how to entertain them He called me sometimes
Tuman says he I want by tomorrow some live sturgeon see there
are some do you hear Yes your excellency Embroidered coats
wigs canes perfumes eau de Cologne of the best sort snuffboxes
huge pictures he would order them all from Paris itself When he gave
a banquet God Almighty Lord of my being there were fireworks and
carriages driving up They even fired off the cannon The orchestra
alone consisted of forty men He kept a German as conductor of the
band but the German gave himself dreadful airs he wanted to eat at
the same table as the masters so his excellency gave orders to get rid
of him My musicians says he can do their work even without a
conductor Of course he was master Then they would fall to dancing
and dance till morning especially at the cossaisematrador 
Ahahtheres one caught The old man drew a small perch out of the
water Here you are Styopka The master was all a master should be
continued the old man dropping his line in again and he had a kind
heart too He would give you a blow at times and before you could look
round hed forgotten it already There was only one thing he kept
mistresses Ugh those mistresses God forgive them They were the ruin
of him too and yet you know he took them most generally from a low
station You would fancy they would not want much Not a bitthey must
have everything of the most expensive in all Europe One may say Why
shouldnt he live as he likes its the masters business  but
there was no need to ruin himself There was one especially Akulina
was her name She is dead now God rest her soul the daughter of the
watchman at Sitoia and such a vixen She would slap the counts face
sometimes She simply bewitched him My nephew she sent for a soldier
he spilt some chocolate on a new dress of hers  and he wasnt the
only one she served so Ah well those were good times though added
the old man with a deep sigh His head drooped forward and he was
silent

Your master I see was severe then I began after a brief silence

That was the fashion then your honour he replied shaking his head

That sort of thing is not done now I observed not taking my eyes
off him

He gave me a look askance

Now surely its better he muttered and let out his line further

We were sitting in the shade but even in the shade it was stifling
The sultry atmosphere was faint and heavy one lifted ones burning
face uneasily seeking a breath of wind but there was no wind The sun
beat down from blue and darkening skies right opposite us on the
other bank was a yellow field of oats overgrown here and there with
wormwood not one ear of the oats quivered A little lower down a
peasants horse stood in the river up to its knees and slowly shook
its wet tail from time to time under an overhanging bush a large
fish shot up bringing bubbles to the surface and gently sank down to
the bottom leaving a slight ripple behind it The grasshoppers chirped
in the scorched grass the quails cry sounded languid and reluctant
hawks sailed smoothly over the meadows often resting in the same spot
rapidly fluttering their wings and opening their tails into a fan We
sat motionless overpowered with the heat Suddenly there was a sound
behind us in the creek someone came down to the spring I looked
round and saw a peasant of about fifty covered with dust in a smock
and wearing bast slippers he carried a wickerwork pannier and a cloak
on his shoulders He went down to the spring drank thirstily and got
up

Ah Vlass cried Tuman staring at him good health to you friend
Where has God sent you from

Good health to you Mihal Savelitch said the peasant coming nearer
to us from a long way off

Where have you been Tuman asked him

I have been to Moscow to my master

What for

I went to ask him a favour

What about

Oh to lessen my rent or to let me work it out in labour or to put
me on another piece of land or something My son is deadso I
cant manage it now alone

Your son is dead

He is dead My son added the peasant after a pause lived in
Moscow as a cabman he paid I must confess rent for me

Then are you now paying rent

Yes we pay rent

What did your master say

What did the master say He drove me away Says he How dare you come
straight to me there is a bailiff for such things You ought first
says he to apply to the bailiff  and where am I to put you on
other land You first says he bring the debt you owe He was angry
altogether

What thendid you come back

I came back I wanted to find out if my son had not left any goods of
his own but I couldnt get a straight answer I say to his employer
I am Philips father and he says What do I know about that And
your son says he left nothing he was even in debt to me So I
came away

The peasant related all this with a smile as though he were speaking
of someone else but tears were starting into his small screwedup
eyes and his lips were quivering

Well are you going home then now

Where can I go Of course Im going home My wife I suppose is
pretty well starved by now

You shouldthen Styopushka said suddenly He grew confused was
silent and began to rummage in the wormpot

And shall you go to the bailiff continued Tuman looking with some
amazement at Styopka

What should I go to him forIm in arrears as it is My son was ill
for a year before his death he could not pay even his own rent But it
cant hurt me they can get nothing from me Yes my friend you can
be as cunning as you pleaseIm cleaned out The peasant began to
laugh Kintlyan Semenitchll have to be clever if

Vlass laughed again

Oh things are in a sad way brother Vlass Tuman ejaculated
deliberately

Sad No Vlasss voice broke How hot it is he went on wiping
his face with his sleeve

Who is your master I asked him

Count Valerian Petrovitch

The son of Piotr Ilitch

The son of Piotr Ilitch replied Tuman Piotr Hitch gave him Vlasss
village in his lifetime

Is he well

He is well thank God replied Vlass He has grown so red and his
face looks as though it were padded

You see your honour continued Tuman turning to me it would be
very well near Moscow but its a different matter to pay rent here

And what is the rent for you altogether

Ninetyfive roubles muttered Vlass

There you see and its the least bit of land all there is is the
masters forest

And that they say they have sold observed the peasant

There you see Styopka give me a worm Why Styopka are you
asleepeh

Styopushka started The peasant sat down by us We sank into silence
again On the other bank someone was singing a songbut such a
mournful one Our poor Vlass grew deeply dejected

Halfanhour later we parted



                                   IV

                           THE DISTRICT DOCTOR


One day in autumn on my way back from a remote part of the country I
caught cold and fell ill Fortunately the fever attacked me in the
district town at the inn I sent for the doctor In halfanhour the
district doctor appeared a thin darkhaired man of middle height He
prescribed me the usual sudorific ordered a mustardplaster to be put
on very deftly slid a fiverouble note up his sleeve coughing drily
and looking away as he did so and then was getting up to go home but
somehow fell into talk and remained I was exhausted with feverishness
I foresaw a sleepless night and was glad of a little chat with a
pleasant companion Tea was served My doctor began to converse freely
He was a sensible fellow and expressed himself with vigour and some
humour Queer things happen in the world you may live a long while
with some people and be on friendly terms with them and never once
speak openly with them from your soul with others you have scarcely
time to get acquainted and all at once you are pouring out to himor
he to youall your secrets as though you were at confession I dont
know how I gained the confidence of my new friendany way with
nothing to lead up to it he told me a rather curious incident and
here I will report his tale for the information of the indulgent
reader I will try to tell it in the doctors own words

You dont happen to know he began in a weak and quavering voice the
common result of the use of unmixed Berezov snuff you dont happen
to know the judge here Mylov Pavel Lukitch You dont know him
Well its all the same He cleared his throat and rubbed his eyes
Well you see the thing happened to tell you exactly without
mistake in Lent at the very time of the thaws I was sitting at his
houseour judges you knowplaying preference Our judge is a good
fellow and fond of playing preference Suddenly the doctor made
frequent use of this word suddenly they tell me Theres a servant
asking for you I say What does he want They say He has brought
a noteit must be from a patient Give me the note I say So it is
from a patientwell and goodyou understandits our bread and
butter  But this is how it was a lady a widow writes to me she
says My daughter is dying Come for Gods sake she says and the
horses have been sent for you  Well thats all right But she was
twenty miles from the town and it was midnight out of doors and the
roads in such a state my word And as she was poor herself one could
not expect more than two silver roubles and even that problematic and
perhaps it might only be a matter of a roll of linen and a sack of
oatmeal in payment However duty you know before everything a
fellowcreature may be dying I hand over my cards at once to
Kalliopin the member of the provincial commission and return home I
look a wretched little trap was standing at the steps with peasants
horses fattoo fatand their coat as shaggy as felt and the
coachman sitting with his cap off out of respect Well I think to
myself Its clear my friend these patients arent rolling in
riches  You smile but I tell you a poor man like me has to take
everything into consideration If the coachman sits like a prince
and doesnt touch his cap and even sneers at you behind his beard and
flicks his whipthen you may bet on six roubles But this case I saw
had a very different air However I think theres no help for it duty
before everything I snatch up the most necessary drugs and set off
Will you believe it I only just managed to get there at all The road
was infernal streams snow watercourses and the dyke had suddenly
burst therethat was the worst of it However I arrived at last It
was a little thatched house There was a light in the windows that
meant they expected me I was met by an old lady very venerable in a
cap Save her she says she is dying I say Pray dont distress
yourselfWhere is the invalid Come this way I see a clean little
room a lamp in the corner on the bed a girl of twenty unconscious
She was in a burning heat and breathing heavilyit was fever There
were two other girls her sisters scared and in tears Yesterday
they tell me she was perfectly well and had a good appetite this
morning she complained of her head and this evening suddenly you
see like this I say again Pray dont be uneasy Its a doctors
duty you knowand I went up to her and bled her told them to put on
a mustardplaster and prescribed a mixture Meantime I looked at her
I looked at her you knowthere by God I had never seen such a
faceshe was a beauty in a word I felt quite shaken with pity Such
lovely features such eyes But thank God she became easier she
fell into a perspiration seemed to come to her senses looked round
smiled and passed her hand over her face Her sisters bent over
her They ask How are you All right she says and turns away I
looked at her she had fallen asleep Well I say now the patient
should be left alone So we all went out on tiptoe only a maid
remained in case she was wanted In the parlour there was a samovar
standing on the table and a bottle of rum in our profession one cant
get on without it They gave me tea asked me to stop the night  I
consented where could I go indeed at that time of night The old
lady kept groaning What is it I say she will live dont worry
yourself you had better take a little rest yourself it is about two
oclock But will you send to wake me if anything happens Yes
yes The old lady went away and the girls too went to their own room
they made up a bed for me in the parlour Well I went to bedbut I
could not get to sleep for a wonder for in reality I was very tired
I could not get my patient out of my head At last I could not put up
with it any longer I got up suddenly I think to myself I will go
and see how the patient is getting on Her bedroom was next to the
parlour Well I got up and gently opened the doorhow my heart beat
I looked in the servant was asleep her mouth wide open and even
snoring the wretch but the patient lay with her face towards me and
her arms flung wide apart poor girl I went up to her  when
suddenly she opened her eyes and stared at me Who is it who is it
I was in confusion Dont be alarmed madam I say I am the doctor
I have come to see how you feel You the doctor Yes the doctor
your mother sent for me from the town we have bled you madam now
pray go to sleep and in a day or two please God we will set you on
your feet again Ah yes yes doctor dont let me die please
please Why do you talk like that God bless you She is in a fever
again I think to myself I felt her pulse yes she was feverish She
looked at me and then took me by the hand I will tell you why I
dont want to die I will tell you Now we are alone and only
please dont you  not to anyone  Listen I bent down she
moved her lips quite to my ear she touched my cheek with her hairI
confess my head went roundand began to whisper I could make out
nothing of it Ah she was delirious She whispered and
whispered but so quickly and as if it were not in Russian at last
she finished and shivering dropped her head on the pillow and
threatened me with her finger Remember doctor to no one I calmed
her somehow gave her something to drink waked the servant and went
away

At this point the doctor again took snuff with exasperated energy and
for a moment seemed stupefied by its effects

However he continued the next day contrary to my expectations
the patient was no better I thought and thought and suddenly decided
to remain there even though my other patients were expecting me
And you know one cant afford to disregard that ones practice suffers
if one does But in the first place the patient was really in danger
and secondly to tell the truth I felt strongly drawn to her Besides
I liked the whole family Though they were really badly off they were
singularly I may say cultivated people Their father had been a
learned man an author he died of course in poverty but he had
managed before he died to give his children an excellent education he
left a lot of books too Either because I looked after the invalid very
carefully or for some other reason any way I can venture to say all
the household loved me as if I were one of the family Meantime the
roads were in a worse state than ever all communications so to say
were cut off completely even medicine could with difficulty be got
from the town The sick girl was not getting better  Day after
day and day after day  but  here The doctor made a brief
pause I declare I dont know how to tell you  He again took
snuff coughed and swallowed a little tea I will tell you without
beating about the bush My patient  how should I say Well she
had fallen in love with me  or no it was not that she was in love
 however  really how should one say The doctor looked down
and grew red No he went on quickly in love indeed A man should
not overestimate himself She was an educated girl clever and
wellread and I had even forgotten my Latin one may say completely
As to appearance the doctor looked himself over with a smile I am
nothing to boast of there either But God Almighty did not make me a
fool I dont take black for white I know a thing or two I could see
very clearly for instance that Alexandra Andreevnathat was her
namedid not feel love for me but had a friendly so to say
inclinationa respect or something for me Though she herself perhaps
mistook this sentiment any way this was her attitude you may form
your own judgment of it But added the doctor who had brought out
all these disconnected sentences without taking breath and with
obvious embarrassment I seem to be wandering ratheryou wont
understand anything like this There with your leave I will relate
it all in order

He drank off a glass of tea and began in a calmer voice

Well then My patient kept getting worse and worse You are not a
doctor my good sir you cannot understand what passes in a poor
fellows heart especially at first when he begins to suspect that the
disease is getting the upper hand of him What becomes of his belief in
himself You suddenly grow so timid its indescribable You fancy then
that you have forgotten everything you knew and that the patient has
no faith in you and that other people begin to notice how distracted
you are and tell you the symptoms with reluctance that they are
looking at you suspiciously whispering Ah its horrid There must
be a remedy you think for this disease if one could find it Isnt
this it You tryno thats not it You dont allow the medicine the
necessary time to do good You clutch at one thing then at another
Sometimes you take up a book of medical prescriptionshere it is you
think Sometimes by Jove you pick one out by chance thinking to
leave it to fate But meantime a fellowcreatures dying and
another doctor would have saved him We must have a consultation you
say I will not take the responsibility on myself And what a fool
you look at such times Well in time you learn to bear it its
nothing to you A man has diedbut its not your fault you treated
him by the rules But whats still more torture to you is to see blind
faith in you and to feel yourself that you are not able to be of use
Well it was just this blind faith that the whole of Alexandra
Andreevnas family had in me they had forgotten to think that their
daughter was in danger I too on my side assure them that its
nothing but meantime my heart sinks into my boots To add to our
troubles the roads were in such a state that the coachman was gone for
whole days together to get medicine And I never left the patients
room I could not tear myself away I tell her amusing stories you
know and play cards with her I watch by her side at night The old
mother thanks me with tears in her eyes but I think to myself I
dont deserve your gratitude I frankly confess to youthere is no
object in concealing it nowI was in love with my patient And
Alexandra Andreevna had grown fond of me she would not sometimes let
anyone be in her room but me She began to talk to me to ask me
questions where I had studied how I lived who are my people whom I
go to see I feel that she ought not to talk but to forbid her toto
forbid her resolutely you knowI could not Sometimes I held my head
in my hands and asked myself What are you doing villain  And
she would take my hand and hold it give me a long long look and turn
away sigh and say How good you are Her hands were so feverish
her eyes so large and languid Yes she says you are a good
kind man you are not like our neighbours No you are not like
that  Why did I not know you till now Alexandra Andreevna calm
yourself I say I feel believe me I dont know how I have
gained  but there calm yourself All will be right you will be
well again And meanwhile I must tell you continued the doctor
bending forward and raising his eyebrows that they associated very
little with the neighbours because the smaller people were not on
their level and pride hindered them from being friendly with the rich
I tell you they were an exceptionally cultivated family so you know
it was gratifying for me She would only take her medicine from my
hands  she would lift herself up poor girl with my aid take it
and gaze at me My heart felt as if it were bursting And meanwhile
she was growing worse and worse worse and worse all the time she
will die I think to myself she must die Believe me I would sooner
have gone to the grave myself and here were her mother and sisters
watching me looking into my eyes  and their faith in me was wearing
away Well how is she Oh all right all right All right
indeed My mind was failing me Well I was sitting one night alone
again by my patient The maid was sitting there too and snoring away
in full swing I cant find fault with the poor girl though she was
worn out too Alexandra Andreevna had felt very unwell all the evening
she was very feverish Until midnight she kept tossing about at last
she seemed to fall asleep at least she lay still without stirring
The lamp was burning in the corner before the holy image I sat there
you know with my head bent I even dozed a little Suddenly it seemed
as though someone touched me in the side I turned round Good God
Alexandra Andreevna was gazing with intent eyes at me  her lips
parted her cheeks seemed burning What is it Doctor shall I die
Merciful Heavens No doctor no please dont tell me I shall live
 dont say so If you knew Listen for Gods sake dont
conceal my real position and her breath came so fast If I can know
for certain that I must die  then I will tell you allall
Alexandra Andreevna I beg Listen I have not been asleep at all
 I have been looking at you a long while For Gods sake  I
believe in you you are a good man an honest man I entreat you by all
that is sacred in the worldtell me the truth If you knew how
important it is for me Doctor for Gods sake tell me Am I in
danger What can I tell you Alexandra Andreevna pray For Gods
sake I beseech you I cant disguise from you I say Alexandra
Andreevna you are certainly in danger but God is merciful I shall
die I shall die And it seemed as though she were pleased her face
grew so bright I was alarmed Dont be afraid dont be afraid I am
not frightened of death at all She suddenly sat up and leaned on her
elbow Now  yes now I can tell you that I thank you with my whole
heart  that you are kind and goodthat I love you I stare at her
like one possessed it was terrible for me you know Do you hear I
love you Alexandra Andreevna how have I deserved No no you
dontyou dont understand me  And suddenly she stretched out her
arms and taking my head in her hands she kissed it Believe me I
almost screamed aloud I threw myself on my knees and buried my
head in the pillow She did not speak her fingers trembled in my hair
I listen she is weeping I began to soothe her to assure her I
really dont know what I did say to her You will wake up the girl I
say to her Alexandra Andreevna I thank you  believe me  calm
yourself Enough enough she persisted never mind all of them
let them wake then let them come init does not matter I am dying
you see And what do you fear why are you afraid Lift up your
head Or perhaps you dont love me perhaps I am wrong In that
case forgive me Alexandra Andreevna what are you saying I love
you Alexandra Andreevna She looked straight into my eyes and opened
her arms wide Then take me in your arms I tell you frankly I dont
know how it was I did not go mad that night I feel that my patient is
killing herself I see that she is not fully herself I understand
too that if she did not consider herself on the point of death she
would never have thought of me and indeed say what you will its
hard to die at twenty without having known love this was what was
torturing her this was why in despair she caught at medo you
understand now But she held me in her arms and would not let me go
Have pity on me Alexandra Andreevna and have pity on yourself I
say Why she says what is there to think of You know I must die
 This she repeated incessantly If I knew that I should return
to life and be a proper young lady again I should be ashamed  of
course ashamed  but why now But who has said you will die Oh
no leave off you will not deceive me you dont know how to lielook
at your face  You shall live Alexandra Andreevna I will cure
you we will ask your mothers blessing  we will be unitedwe will
be happy No no I have your word I must die  you have promised
me  you have told me  It was cruel for mecruel for many
reasons And see what trifling things can do sometimes it seems
nothing at all but its painful It occurred to her to ask me what is
my name not my surname but my first name I must needs be so unlucky
as to be called Trifon Yes indeed Trifon Ivanitch Every one in the
house called me doctor However theres no help for it I say
Trifon madam She frowned shook her head and muttered something in
Frenchah something unpleasant of courseand then she
laugheddisagreeably too Well I spent the whole night with her in
this way Before morning I went away feeling as though I were mad
When I went again into her room it was daytime after morning tea Good
God I could scarcely recognise her people are laid in their grave
looking better than that I swear to you on my honour I dont
understandI absolutely dont understandnow how I lived through
that experience Three days and nights my patient still lingered on
And what nights What things she said to me And on the last
nightonly imagine to yourselfI was sitting near her and kept
praying to God for one thing only Take her I said quickly and me
with her Suddenly the old mother comes unexpectedly into the room I
had already the evening before told herthe motherthere was little
hope and it would be well to send for a priest When the sick girl saw
her mother she said Its very well you have come look at us we love
one anotherwe have given each other our word What does she say
doctor what does she say I turned livid She is wandering I say
the fever But she Hush hush you told me something quite
different just now and have taken my ring Why do you pretend My
mother is goodshe will forgiveshe will understandand I am
dying I have no need to tell lies give me your hand I jumped up
and ran out of the room The old lady of course guessed how it was

I will not however weary you any longer and to me too of course
its painful to recall all this My patient passed away the next day
God rest her soul the doctor added speaking quickly and with a sigh
Before her death she asked her family to go out and leave me alone
with her

Forgive me she said I am perhaps to blame towards you  my
illness  but believe me I have loved no one more than you  do
not forget me  keep my ring

The doctor turned away I took his hand

Ah he said let us talk of something else or would you care to
play preference for a small stake It is not for people like me to give
way to exalted emotions Theres only one thing for me to think of how
to keep the children from crying and the wife from scolding Since
then you know I have had time to enter into lawful wedlock as they
say Oh  I took a merchants daughterseven thousand for her
dowry Her names Akulina it goes well with Trifon She is an
illtempered woman I must tell you but luckily shes asleep all
day Well shall it be preference

We sat down to preference for halfpenny points Trifon Ivanitch won two
roubles and a half from me and went home late well pleased with his
success

                          MY NEIGHBOUR RADILOV


For the autumn woodcocks often take refuge in old gardens of
limetrees There are a good many such gardens among us in the
province of Orel Our forefathers when they selected a place for
habitation invariably marked out two acres of good ground for a
fruitgarden with avenues of limetrees Within the last fifty or
seventy years at most these mansionsnoblemens nests as they call
themhave gradually disappeared off the face of the earth the houses
are falling to pieces or have been sold for the building materials
the stone outhouses have become piles of rubbish the appletrees are
dead and turned into firewood the hedges and fences are pulled up
Only the limetrees grow in all their glory as before and with
ploughed fields all round them tell a tale to this lighthearted
generation of our fathers and brothers who have lived before us

A magnificent tree is such an old limetree Even the merciless axe
of the Russian peasant spares it Its leaves are small its powerful
limbs spread wide in all directions there is perpetual shade under
them

Once as I was wandering about the fields after partridges with
Yermola I saw some way off a deserted garden and turned into it I
had hardly crossed its borders when a snipe rose up out of a bush with
a clatter I fired my gun and at the same instant a few paces from
me I heard a shriek the frightened face of a young girl peeped out
for a second from behind the trees and instantly disappeared Yermola
ran up to me Why are you shooting here there is a landowner living
here

Before I had time to answer him before my dog had had time to bring
me with dignified importance the bird I had shot swift footsteps
were heard and a tall man with moustaches came out of the thicket and
stopped with an air of displeasure before me I made my apologies as
best I could gave him my name and offered him the bird that had been
killed on his domains

Very well he said to me with a smile I will take your game but
only on one condition that you will stay and dine with us

I must confess I was not greatly delighted at his proposition but it
was impossible to refuse

I am a landowner here and your neighbour Radilov perhaps you have
heard of me continued my new acquaintance today is Sunday and we
shall be sure to have a decent dinner otherwise I would not have
invited you

I made such a reply as one does make in such circumstances and turned
to follow him A little path that had lately been cleared soon led us
out of the grove of limetrees we came into the kitchengarden
Between the old appletrees and gooseberry bushes were rows of curly
whitishgreen cabbages the hop twined its tendrils round high poles
there were thick ranks of brown twigs tangled over with dried peas
large flat pumpkins seemed rolling on the ground cucumbers showed
yellow under their dusty angular leaves tall nettles were waving along
the hedge in two or three places grew clumps of tartar honeysuckle
elder and wild rosethe remnants of former flowerbeds Near a small
fishpond full of reddish and slimy water we saw the well surrounded
by puddles Ducks were busily splashing and waddling about these
puddles a dog blinking and twitching in every limb was gnawing a bone
in the meadow where a piebald cow was lazily chewing the grass from
time to time flicking its tail over its lean back The little path
turned to one side from behind thick willows and birches we caught
sight of a little grey old house with a boarded roof and a winding
flight of steps Radilov stopped short

But he said with a goodhumoured and direct look in my face on
second thoughts  perhaps you dont care to come and see me after
all In that case

I did not allow him to finish but assured him that on the contrary
it would be a great pleasure to me to dine with him

Well you know best

We went into the house A young man in a long coat of stout blue cloth
met us on the steps Radilov at once told him to bring Yermola some
vodka my huntsman made a respectful bow to the back of the munificent
host From the hall which was decorated with various particoloured
pictures and check curtains we went into a small roomRadilovs
study I took off my hunting accoutrements and put my gun in a corner
the young man in the longskirted coat busily brushed me down

Well now let us go into the drawingroom said Radilov cordially
I will make you acquainted with my mother

I walked after him In the drawingroom in the sofa in the centre of
the room was sitting an old lady of medium height in a
cinnamoncoloured dress and a white cap with a thinnish kind old
face and a timid mournful expression

Here mother let me introduce to you our neighbour

The old lady got up and made me a bow not letting go out of her
withered hands a fat worsted reticule that looked like a sack

Have you been long in our neighbourhood she asked in a weak and
gentle voice blinking her eyes

No not long

Do you intend to remain here long

Till the winter I think

The old lady said no more

And here interposed Radilov indicating to me a tall and thin man
whom I had not noticed on entering the drawingroom is Fyodor
Miheitch  Come Fedya give the visitor a specimen of your art Why
have you hidden yourself away in that corner

Fyodor Miheitch got up at once from his chair fetched a wretched
little fiddle from the window took the bownot by the end as is
usual but by the middleput the fiddle to his chest shut his eyes
and fell to dancing singing a song and scraping on the strings He
looked about seventy a thin nankin overcoat flapped pathetically about
his dry and bony limbs He danced at times skipping boldly and then
dropping his little bald head with his scraggy neck stretched out as if
he were dying stamping his feet on the ground and sometimes bending
his knees with obvious difficulty A voice cracked with age came from
his toothless mouth

Radilov must have guessed from the expression of my face that Fedyas
art did not give me much pleasure

Very good old man thats enough he said You can go and refresh
yourself

Fyodor Miheitch at once laid down the fiddle on the windowsill bowed
first to me as the guest then to the old lady then to Radilov and
went away

He too was a landowner my new friend continued and a rich one too
but he ruined himselfso he lives now with me But in his day he
was considered the most dashing fellow in the province he eloped with
two married ladies he used to keep singers and sang himself and
danced like a master But wont you take some vodka dinner is just
ready

A young girl the same that I had caught a glimpse of in the garden
came into the room

And here is Olga observed Radilov slightly turning his head let
me present you Well let us go into dinner

We went in and sat down to the table While we were coming out of the
drawingroom and taking our seats Fyodor Miheitch whose eyes were
bright and his nose rather red after his refreshment sang Raise the
cry of Victory They laid a separate cover for him in a corner on a
little table without a tablenapkin The poor old man could not boast
of very nice habits and so they always kept him at some distance from
society He crossed himself sighed and began to eat like a shark The
dinner was in reality not bad and in honour of Sunday was accompanied
of course with shaking jelly and Spanish puffs of pastry At the table
Radilov who had served ten years in an infantry regiment and had been
in Turkey fell to telling anecdotes I listened to him with attention
and secretly watched Olga She was not very pretty but the tranquil
and resolute expression of her face her broad white brow her thick
hair and especially her brown eyesnot large but clear sensible and
livelywould have made an impression on anyone in my place She seemed
to be following every word Radilov utterednot so much sympathy as
passionate attention was expressed on her face Radilov in years might
have been her father he called her by her Christian name but I
guessed at once that she was not his daughter In the course of
conversation he referred to his deceased wifeher sister he added
indicating Olga She blushed quickly and dropped her eyes Radilov
paused a moment and then changed the subject The old lady did not
utter a word during the whole of dinner she ate scarcely anything
herself and did not press me to partake Her features had an air of
timorous and hopeless expectation that melancholy of old age which it
pierces ones heart to look upon At the end of dinner Fyodor Miheitch
was beginning to celebrate the hosts and guests but Radilov looked
at me and asked him to be quiet the old man passed his hand over his
lips began to blink bowed and sat down again but only on the very
edge of his chair After dinner I returned with Radilov to his study

In people who are constantly and intensely preoccupied with one idea
or one emotion there is something in common a kind of external
resemblance in manner however different may be their qualities their
abilities their position in society and their education The more I
watched Radilov the more I felt that he belonged to the class of such
people He talked of husbandry of the crops of the war of the gossip
of the district and the approaching elections he talked without
constraint and even with interest but suddenly he would sigh and drop
into a chair and pass his hand over his face like a man wearied out
by a tedious task His whole naturea good and warmhearted one
tooseemed saturated through steeped in some one feeling I was
amazed by the fact that I could not discover in him either a passion
for eating nor for wine nor for sport nor for Kursk nightingales
nor for epileptic pigeons nor for Russian literature nor for
trottinghacks nor for Hungarian coats nor for cards nor billiards
nor for dances nor trips to the provincial town or the capital nor
for paperfactories and beetsugar refineries nor for painted
pavilions nor for tea nor for tracehorses trained to hold their
heads askew nor even for fat coachmen belted under their very
armpitsthose magnificent coachmen whose eyes for some mysterious
reason seem rolling and starting out of their heads at every
movement What sort of landowner is this then I thought At the
same time he did not in the least pose as a gloomy man discontented
with his destiny on the contrary he seemed full of indiscrimating
goodwill cordial and even offensive readiness to become intimate with
every one he came across In reality you felt at the same time that he
could not be friends nor be really intimate with anyone and that he
could not be so not because in general he was independent of other
people but because his whole being was for a time turned inwards upon
himself Looking at Radilov I could never imagine him happy either now
or at any time He too was not handsome but in his eyes his smile
his whole being there was a something mysterious and extremely
attractiveyes mysterious is just what it was So that you felt you
would like to know him better to get to love him Of course at times
the landowner and the man of the steppes peeped out in him but all the
same he was a capital fellow

We were beginning to talk about the new marshal of the district when
suddenly we heard Olgas voice at the door Tea is ready We went
into the drawingroom Fyodor Miheitch was sitting as before in his
corner between the little window and the door his legs curled up under
him Radilovs mother was knitting a stocking From the opened windows
came a breath of autumn freshness and the scent of apples Olga was
busy pouring out tea I looked at her now with more attention than at
dinner Like provincial girls as a rule she spoke very little but at
any rate I did not notice in her any of their anxiety to say something
fine together with their painful consciousness of stupidity and
helplessness she did not sigh as though from the burden of unutterable
emotions nor cast up her eyes nor smile vaguely and dreamily Her
look expressed tranquil selfpossession like a man who is taking
breath after great happiness or great excitement Her carriage and her
movements were resolute and free I liked her very much

I fell again into conversation with Radilov I dont recollect what
brought us to the familiar observation that often the most
insignificant things produce more effect on people than the most
important

Yes Radilov agreed I have experienced that in my own case I as
you know have been married It was not for longthree years my wife
died in childbirth I thought that I should not survive her I was
fearfully miserable broken down but I could not weepI wandered
about like one possessed They decked her out as they always do and
laid her on a tablein this very room The priest came the deacons
came began to sing to pray and to burn incense I bowed to the
ground and hardly shed a tear My heart seemed turned to stoneand my
head tooI was heavy all over So passed my first day Would you
believe it I even slept in the night The next morning I went in to
look at my wife it was summertime the sunshine fell upon her from
head to foot and it was so bright Suddenly I saw  here Radilov
gave an involuntary shudder what do you think One of her eyes was
not quite shut and on this eye a fly was moving I fell down in a
heap and when I came to myself I began to weep and weep  I could
not stop myself

Radilov was silent I looked at him then at Olga I can never
forget the expression of her face The old lady had laid the stocking
down on her knees and taken a handkerchief out of her reticule she
was stealthily wiping away her tears Fyodor Miheitch suddenly got up
seized his fiddle and in a wild and hoarse voice began to sing a song
He wanted doubtless to restore our spirits but we all shuddered at his
first note and Radilov asked him to be quiet

Still what is past is past he continued we cannot recall the
past and in the end  all is for the best in this world below as I
think Voltaire said he added hurriedly

Yes I replied of course Besides every trouble can be endured
and there is no position so terrible that there is no escape from it

Do you think so said Radilov Well perhaps you are right I
recollect I lay once in the hospital in Turkey half dead I had typhus
fever Well our quarters were nothing to boast ofof course in time
of warand we had to thank God for what we had Suddenly they bring in
more sickwhere are they to put them The doctor goes here and
therethere is no room left So he comes up to me and asks the
attendant Is he alive He answers He was alive this morning The
doctor bends down listens I am breathing The good man could not help
saying Well what an absurd constitution the mans dying hes
certain to die and he keeps hanging on lingering taking up space for
nothing and keeping out others Well I thought to myself So you
are in a bad way Mihal Mihalitch And after all I got well and
am alive till now as you may see for yourself You are right to be
sure

In any case I am right I replied even if you had died you would
just the same have escaped from your horrible position

Of course of course he added with a violent blow of his fist on
the table One has only to come to a decision What is the use of
being in a horrible position What is the good of delaying
lingering

Olga rose quickly and went out into the garden

Well Fedya a dance cried Radilov

Fedya jumped up and walked about the room with that artificial and
peculiar motion which is affected by the man who plays the part of a
goat with a tame bear He sang meanwhile While at our Gates

The rattle of a racing droshky sounded in the drive and in a few
minutes a tall broadshouldered and stoutly made man the peasant
proprietor Ovsyanikov came into the room

But Ovsyanikov is such a remarkable and original personage that with
the readers permission we will put off speaking about him till the
next sketch And now I will only add for myself that the next day I
started off hunting at earliest dawn with Yermola and returned home
after the days sport was over  that a week later I went again to
Radilovs but did not find him or Olga at home and within a fortnight
I learned that he had suddenly disappeared left his mother and gone
away somewhere with his sisterinlaw The whole province was excited
and talked about this event and I only then completely understood the
expression of Olgas face while Radilov was telling us his story It
was breathing not with sympathetic suffering only it was burning with
jealousy

Before leaving the country I called on old Madame Radilov I found her
in the drawingroom she was playing cards with Fyodor Miheitch

Have you news of your son I asked her at last

The old lady began to weep I made no more inquiries about Radilov



                                   VI

                    THE PEASANT PROPRIETOR OVSYANIKOV


Picture to yourselves gentle readers a stout tall man of seventy
with a face reminding one somewhat of the face of Kriloff clear and
intelligent eyes under overhanging brows dignified in bearing slow in
speech and deliberate in movement there you have Ovsyanikov He wore
an ample blue overcoat with long sleeves buttoned all the way up a
lilac silkhandkerchief round his neck brightly polished boots with
tassels and altogether resembled in appearance a welltodo merchant
His hands were handsome soft and white he often fumbled with the
buttons of his coat as he talked With his dignity and his composure
his good sense and his indolence his uprightness and his obstinacy
Ovsyanikov reminded me of the Russian boyars of the times before Peter
the Great The national holiday dress would have suited him well He
was one of the last men left of the old time All his neighbours had a
great respect for him and considered it an honour to be acquainted
with him His fellow peasantproprietors almost worshipped him and
took off their hats to him from a distance they were proud of him
Generally speaking in these days it is difficult to tell a
peasantproprietor from a peasant his husbandry is almost worse than
the peasants his calves are wretchedly small his horses are only
half alive his harness is made of rope Ovsyanikov was an exception to
the general rule though he did not pass for a wealthy man He lived
alone with his wife in a clean and comfortable little house kept a few
servants whom he dressed in the Russian style and called his
workmen They were employed also in ploughing his land He did not
attempt to pass for a nobleman did not affect to be a landowner
never as they say forgot himself he did not take a seat at the first
invitation to do so and he never failed to rise from his seat on the
entrance of a new guest but with such dignity with such stately
courtesy that the guest involuntarily made him a more deferential bow
Ovsyanikov adhered to the antique usages not from superstition he was
naturally rather independent in mind but from habit He did not for
instance like carriages with springs because he did not find them
comfortable and preferred to drive in a racing droshky or in a pretty
little trap with leather cushions and he always drove his good bay
himself he kept none but bay horses His coachman a young
rosycheeked fellow his hair cut round like a basin in a dark blue
coat with a strap round the waist sat respectfully beside him
Ovsyanikov always had a nap after dinner and visited the bathhouse on
Saturdays he read none but religious books and used gravely to fix his
round silver spectacles on his nose when he did so he got up and went
to bed early He shaved his beard however and wore his hair in the
German style He always received visitors cordially and affably but he
did not bow down to the ground nor fuss over them and press them to
partake of every kind of dried and salted delicacy Wife he would
say deliberately not getting up from his seat but only turning his
head a little in her direction bring the gentleman a little of
something to eat He regarded it as a sin to sell wheat it was the
gift of God In the year  at the time of the general famine and
terrible scarcity he shared all his store with the surrounding
landowners and peasants the following year they gratefully repaid
their debt to him in kind The neighbours often had recourse to
Ovsyanikov as arbitrator and mediator between them and they almost
always acquiesced in his decision and listened to his advice Thanks
to his intervention many had conclusively settled their boundaries
But after two or three tussles with ladylandowners he announced that
he declined all mediation between persons of the feminine gender He
could not bear the flurry and excitement the chatter of women and the
fuss Once his house had somehow got on fire A workman ran to him in
headlong haste shrieking Fire fire Well what are you screaming
about said Ovsyanikov tranquilly give me my cap and my stick He
liked to break in his horses himself Once a spirited horse he was
training bolted with him down a hillside and over a precipice Come
there there you young colt youll kill yourself said Ovsyanikov
soothingly to him and an instant later he flew over the precipice
together with the racing droshky the boy who was sitting behind and
the horse Fortunately the bottom of the ravine was covered with heaps
of sand No one was injured only the horse sprained a leg Well you
see continued Ovsyanikov in a calm voice as he got up from the
ground I told you so He had found a wife to match him Tatyana
Ilyinitchna Ovsyanikov was a tall woman dignified and taciturn always
dressed in a cinnamoncoloured silk dress She had a cold air though
none complained of her severity but on the contrary many poor
creatures called her their little mother and benefactress Her regular
features her large dark eyes and her delicately cut lips bore
witness even now to her once celebrated beauty Ovsyanikov had no
children

I made his acquaintance as the reader is already aware at Radilovs
and two days later I went to see him I found him at home He was
reading the lives of the Saints A grey cat was purring on his
shoulder He received me according to his habit with stately
cordiality We fell into conversation

But tell me the truth Luka Petrovitch I said to him among other
things werent things better of old in your time

In some ways certainly things were better I should say replied
Ovsyanikov we lived more easily there was a greater abundance of
everything  All the same things are better now and they will be
better still for your children please God

I had expected you Luka Petrovitch to praise the old times

No I have no special reason to praise old times Here for instance
though you are a landowner now and just as much a landowner as your
grandfather was you have not the same powerand indeed you are not
yourself the same kind of man Even now some noblemen oppress us but
of course it is impossible to help that altogether Where there are
mills grinding there will be flour No I dont see now what I have
experienced myself in my youth

What for instance

Well for instance I will tell you about your grandfather He was an
overbearing man he oppressed us poorer folks You know
perhapsindeed you surely know your own estatesthat bit of land
that runs from Tchepligin to Malininayou have it under oats now
Well you know it is oursit is all ours Your grandfather took it
away from us he rode by on his horse pointed to it with his hand and
said Its my property and took possession of it My father God
rest his soul was a just man he was a hottempered man too he
would not put up with itindeed who does like to lose his
propertyand he laid a petition before the court But he was alone
the others did not appearthey were afraid So they reported to your
grandfather that Piotr Ovsyanikov is making a complaint against you
that you were pleased to take away his land Your grandfather at once
sent his huntsman Baush with a detachment of men Well they seized
my father and carried him to your estate I was a little boy at that
time I ran after him barefoot What happened They brought him to your
house and flogged him right under your windows And your grandfather
stands on the balcony and looks on and your grandmother sits at the
window and looks on too My father cries out Gracious lady Marya
Vasilyevna intercede for me have mercy on me But her only answer
was to keep getting up to have a look at him So they exacted a promise
from my father to give up the land and bade him be thankful they let
him go alive So it has remained with you Go and ask your
peasantswhat do they call the land indeed Its called The
Cudgelled Land because it was gained by the cudgel So you see from
that we poor folks cant bewail the old order very much

I did not know what answer to make Ovsyanikov and I had not the
courage to look him in the face

We had another neighbour who settled amongst us in those days Komov
Stepan Niktopolionitch He used to worry my father out of his life
when it wasnt one thing it was another He was a drunken fellow and
fond of treating others and when he was drunk he would say in French
Say bon and Take away the holy images He would go to all the
neighbours to ask them to come to him His horses stood always in
readiness and if you wouldnt go he would come after you himself at
once And he was such a strange fellow In his sober times he was
not a liar but when he was drunk he would begin to relate how he had
three houses in Petersburgone red with one chimney another yellow
with two chimneys and a third blue with no chimneys and three sons
though he had never even been married one in the infantry another
in the cavalry and the third was his own master And he would say
that in each house lived one of his sons that admirals visited the
eldest and generals the second and the third only Englishmen Then he
would get up and say To the health of my eldest son he is the most
dutiful and he would begin to weep Woe to anyone who refused to
drink the toast I will shoot him he would say and I wont let him
be buried  Then he would jump up and scream Dance Gods people
for your pleasure and my diversion Well then you must dance if you
had to die for it you must dance He thoroughly worried his serfgirls
to death Sometimes all night long till morning they would be singing
in chorus and the one who made the most noise would have a prize If
they began to be tired he would lay his head down in his hands and
begins moaning Ah poor forsaken orphan that I am They abandon me
poor little dove And the stableboys would wake the girls up at once
He took a liking to my father what was he to do He almost drove my
father into his grave and would actually have driven him into it but
thank Heaven he died himself in one of his drunken fits he fell off
the pigeonhouse  There thats what our sweet little neighbours
were like

How the times have changed I observed

Yes yes Ovsyanikov assented And there is this to be saidin the
old days the nobility lived more sumptuously Im not speaking of the
real grandees now I used to see them in Moscow They say such people
are scarce nowadays

Have you been in Moscow

I used to stay there long very long ago I am now in my seventythird
year and I went to Moscow when I was sixteen

Ovsyanikov sighed

Whom did you see there

I saw a great many grandeesand every one saw them they kept open
house for the wonder and admiration of all Only no one came up to
Count Alexey Grigoryevitch OrlovTchesmensky I often saw Alexey
Grigoryevitch my uncle was a steward in his service The count was
pleased to live in Shabolovka near the Kaluga Gate He was a grand
gentleman Such stateliness such gracious condescension you cant
imagine and its impossible to describe it His figure alone was worth
something and his strength and the look in his eyes Till you knew
him you did not dare come near himyou were afraid overawed indeed
but directly you came near him he was like sunshine warming you up and
making you quite cheerful He allowed every man access to him in
person and he was devoted to every kind of sport He drove himself in
races and outstripped every one and he would never get in front at
the start so as not to offend his adversary he would not cut it
short but would pass him at the finish and he was so pleasanthe
would soothe his adversary praising his horse He kept tumblerpigeons
of a firstrate kind He would come out into the court sit down in an
armchair and order them to let loose the pigeons and his men would
stand all round on the roofs with guns to keep off the hawks A large
silver basin of water used to be placed at the counts feet and he
looked at the pigeons reflected in the water Beggars and poor people
were fed in hundreds at his expense and what a lot of money he used to
give away When he got angry it was like a clap of thunder
Everyone was in a great fright but there was nothing to weep over
look round a minute after and he was all smiles again When he gave a
banquet he made all Moscow drunkand see what a clever man he was
you know he beat the Turk He was fond of wrestling too strong men
used to come from Tula from Harkoff from Tamboff and from everywhere
to him If he threw any one he would pay him a reward but if any one
threw him he perfectly loaded him with presents and kissed him on the
lips And once during my stay at Moscow he arranged a hunting
party such as had never been in Russia before he sent invitations to
all the sportsmen in the whole empire and fixed a day for it and gave
them three months notice They brought with them dogs and grooms
well it was an army of peoplea regular army

First they had a banquet in the usual way and then they set off into
the open country The people flocked there in thousands And what do
you think Your fathers dog outran them all

Wasnt that Milovidka I inquired

Milovidka Milovidka So the count began to ask him Give me your
dog says he take what you like for her No count he said I
am not a tradesman I dont sell anything for filthy lucre for your
sake I am ready to part with my wife even but not with Milovidka I
would give myself into bondage first And Alexey Grigoryevitch praised
him for it I like you for it he said Your grandfather took her
back in the coach with him and when Milovidka died he buried her in
the garden with music at the burialyes a funeral for a dogand put
a stone with an inscription on it over the dog

Then Alexey Grigoryevitch did not oppress anyone I observed

Yes it is always like that those who can only just keep themselves
afloat are the ones to drag others under

And what sort of a man was this Baush I asked after a short silence

Why how comes it you have heard about Milovidka and not about Baush
He was your grandfathers chief huntsman and whipperin Your
grandfather was as fond of him as of Milovidka He was a desperate
fellow and whatever order your grandfather gave him he would carry it
out in a minutehed have run on to a sword at his bidding And
when he hallooed  it was something like a tallyho in the forest
And then he would suddenly turn nasty get off his horse and lie down
on the ground  and directly the dogs ceased to hear his voice it
was all over They would give up the hottest scent and wouldnt go on
for anything Ay ay your grandfather did get angry Damn me if I
dont hang the scoundrel Ill turn him inside out the antichrist
Ill stuff his heels down his gullet the cutthroat And it ended by
his going up to find out what he wanted why he wouldnt halloo to the
hounds Usually on such occasions Baush asked for some vodka drank
it up got on his horse and began to halloo as lustily as ever again

You seem to be fond of hunting too Luka Petrovitch

I should have beencertainly not now now my time is overbut in my
young days But you know it was not an easy matter in my position
Its not suitable for people like us to go trailing after noblemen
Certainly you may find in our class some drinking goodfornothing
fellow who associates with the gentrybut its a queer sort of
enjoyment He only brings shame on himself They mount him on a
wretched stumbling nag keep knocking his hat off on to the ground and
cut at him with a whip pretending to whip the horse and he must laugh
at everything and be a laughingstock for the others No I tell you
the lower your station the more reserved must be your behaviour or
else you disgrace yourself directly

Yes continued Ovsyanikov with a sigh theres many a gallon of
water has flowed down to the sea since I have been living in the world
times are different now Especially I see a great change in the
nobility The smaller landowners have all either become officials or
at any rate do not stop here as for the larger owners theres no
making them out I have had experience of themthe larger
landownersin cases of settling boundaries And I must tell you it
does my heart good to see them they are courteous and affable Only
this is what astonishes me they have studied all the sciences they
speak so fluently that your heart is melted but they dont understand
the actual business in hand they dont even perceive whats their own
interest some bailiff a bondservant drives them just where he
pleases as though they were in a yoke Theres KorolyovAlexandr
Vladimirovitchfor instance you know him perhapsisnt he every
inch a nobleman He is handsome rich has studied at the versities
and travelled I think abroad he speaks simply and easily and shakes
hands with us all You know him Well listen then Last week we
assembled at Beryozovka at the summons of the mediator Nikifor Ilitch
And the mediator Nikifor Ilitch says to us Gentlemen we must
settle the boundaries its disgraceful our district is behind all the
others we must get to work Well so we got to work There followed
discussions disputes as usual our attorney began to make objections
But the first to make an uproar was Porfiry Ovtchinnikov And what
had the fellow to make an uproar about He hasnt an acre of ground
he is acting as representative of his brother He bawls No you shall
not impose on me no you shant drive me to that give the plans here
give me the surveyors plans the Judass plans here But what is
your claim then Oh you think Im a fool Indeed do you suppose I
am going to lay bare my claim to you offhand No let me have the plans
herethats what I want And he himself is banging his fist on the
plans all the time Then he mortally offended Marfa Dmitrievna She
shrieks out How dare you asperse my reputation Your reputation
says he I shouldnt like my chestnut mare to have your reputation
They poured him out some Madeira at last and so quieted him then
others begin to make a row Alexandr Vladimirovitch Korolyov the dear
fellow sat in a corner sucking the knob of his cane and only shook
his head I felt ashamed I could hardly sit it out What must he be
thinking of us I said to myself When behold Alexandr
Vladimirovitch has got up and shows signs of wanting to speak The
mediator exerts himself says Gentlemen gentlemen Alexandr
Vladimirovitch wishes to speak And I must do them this credit they
were all silent at once And so Alexandr Vladimirovitch began and said
that we seemed to have forgotten what we had come together for that
indeed the fixing of boundaries was indisputably advantageous for
owners of land but actually what was its object To make things easier
for the peasant so that he could work and pay his dues more
conveniently that now the peasant hardly knows his own land and often
goes to work five miles away and one cant expect too much of him
Then Alexandr Vladimirovitch said that it was disgraceful in a
landowner not to interest himself in the wellbeing of his peasants
that in the end if you look at it rightly their interests and our
interests are inseparable if they are welloff we are welloff and if
they do badly we do badly and that consequently it was injudicious
and wrong to disagree over trifles  and so onand so on There
how he did speak He seemed to go right to your heart All the
gentry hung their heads I myself faith it nearly brought me to
tears To tell the truth you would not find sayings like that in the
old books even But what was the end of it He himself would not
give up four acres of peat marsh and wasnt willing to sell it He
said I am going to drain that marsh for my people and set up a
clothfactory on it with all the latest improvements I have already
he said fixed on that place I have thought out my plans on the
subject And if only that had been the truth it would be all very
well but the simple fact is Alexandr Vladimirovitchs neighbour
Anton Karasikov had refused to buy over Korolyovs bailiff for a
hundred roubles And so we separated without having done anything But
Alexandr Vladimirovitch considers to this day that he is right and
still talks of the clothfactory but he does not start draining the
marsh

And how does he manage in his estate

He is always introducing new ways The peasants dont speak well of
himbut its useless to listen to them Alexandr Vladimirovitch is
doing right

Hows that Luka Petrovitch I thought you kept to the old ways

Ithats another thing You see I am not a nobleman or a landowner
What sort of management is mine Besides I dont know how to do
things differently I try to act according to justice and the law and
leave the rest in Gods hands Young gentlemen dont like the old
method I think they are right Its the time to take in ideas Only
this is the pity of it the young are too theoretical They treat the
peasant like a doll they turn him this way and that way twist him
about and throw him away And their bailiff a serf or some overseer
from the German natives gets the peasant under his thumb again Now
if any one of the young gentlemen would set us an example would show
us See this is how you ought to manage  What will be the end of
it Can it be that I shall die without seeing the new methods What
is the proverbthe old is dead but the young is not born

I did not know what reply to make to Ovsyanikov He looked round drew
himself nearer to me and went on in an undertone

Have you heard talk of Vassily Nikolaitch Lubozvonov

No I havent

Explain to me please what sort of strange creature he is I cant
make anything of it His peasants have described him but I cant make
any sense of their tales He is a young man you know its not long
since he received his heritage from his mother Well he arrived at his
estate The peasants were all collected to stare at their master
Vassily Nikolaitch came out to them The peasants looked at
himstrange to relate the master wore plush pantaloons like a
coachman and he had on boots with trimming at the top he wore a red
shirt and a coachmans long coat too he had let his beard grow and
had such a strange hat and such a strange facecould he be drunk No
he wasnt drunk and yet he didnt seem quite right Good health to
you lads he says God keep you The peasants bow to the ground
but without speaking they began to feel frightened you know And he
too seemed timid He began to make a speech to them I am a Russian
he says and you are Russians I like everything Russian Russia
says he is my heart and my blood too is Russian Then he
suddenly gives the order Come lads sing a Russian national song
The peasants legs shook under them with fright they were utterly
stupefied One bold spirit did begin to sing but he sat down at once
on the ground and hid himself behind the others And what is so
surprising is this we have had landowners like that daredevil
gentlemen regular rakes of course they dressed pretty much like
coachmen and danced themselves and played on the guitar and sang and
drank with their houseserfs and feasted with the peasants but this
Vassily Nikolaitch is like a girl he is always reading books or
writing or else declaiming poetry aloudhe never addresses any one
he is shy walks by himself in his garden seems either bored or sad
The old bailiff at first was in a thorough scare before Vassily
Nikolaitchs arrival he was afraid to go near the peasants houses he
bowed to all of themone could see the cat knew whose butter he had
eaten And the peasants were full of hope they thought Fiddlesticks
my friendnow theyll make you answer for it my dear theyll lead
you a dance now you robber  But instead of this it has turned
outhow shall I explain it to youGod Almighty could not account for
how things have turned out Vassily Nikolaitch summoned him to his
presence and says blushing himself and breathing quick you know Be
upright in my service dont oppress any onedo you hear And since
that day he has never asked to see him in person again He lives on his
own property like a stranger Well the bailiffs been enjoying
himself and the peasants dont dare to go to Vassily Nikolaitch they
are afraid And do you see whats a matter for wonder again the master
even bows to them and looks graciously at them but he seems to turn
their stomachs with fright What do you say to such a strange state of
things your honour Either I have grown stupid in my old age or
something I cant understand it

I said to Ovsyanikov that Mr Lubozvonov must certainly be ill

Ill indeed Hes as broad as hes long and a face like thisGod
bless himand bearded though he is so young Well God knows
And Ovsyanikov gave a deep sigh

Come putting the nobles aside I began what have you to tell me
about the peasant proprietors Luka Petrovitch

No you must let me off that he said hurriedly Truly I could
tell you  but whats the use with a wave of his hand We had
better have some tea We are common peasants and nothing more but
when we come to think of it what else could we be

He ceased talking Tea was served Tatyana Ilyinitchna rose from her
place and sat down rather nearer to us In the course of the evening
she several times went noiselessly out and as quietly returned Silence
reigned in the room Ovsyanikov drank cup after cup with gravity and
deliberation

Mitya has been to see us today said Tatyana Ilyinitchna in a low
voice

Ovsyanikov frowned

What does he want

He came to ask forgiveness

Ovsyanikov shook his head

Come tell me he went on turning to me what is one to do with
relations And to abandon them altogether is impossible Here God
has bestowed on me a nephew Hes a fellow with brainsa smart
fellowI dont dispute that he has had a good education but I dont
expect much good to come of him He went into a government office
threw up his positiondidnt get on fast enough if you please
Does he suppose hes a noble And even noblemen dont come to be
generals all at once So now he is living without an occupation And
that even would not be such a great matterexcept that he has taken
to litigation He gets up petitions for the peasants writes memorials
he instructs the village delegates drags the surveyors over the coals
frequents drinking houses is seen in taverns with city tradesmen and
innkeepers Hes bound to come to ruin before long The constables and
policecaptains have threatened him more than once already But he
luckily knows how to turn it offhe makes them laugh but they will
boil his kettle for him some day But there isnt he sitting in
your little room he added turning to his wife I know you you see
youre so softheartedyou will always take his part

Tatyana Ilyinitchna dropped her eyes smiled and blushed

Well I see it is so continued Ovsyanikov Fie you spoil the boy
Well tell him to come in So be it then for the sake of our good
guest I will forgive the silly fellow Come tell him tell him

Tatyana Ilyinitchna went to the door and cried Mitya

Mitya a young man of twentyeight tall wellmade and curlyheaded
came into the room and seeing me stopped short in the doorway His
costume was in the German style but the unnatural size of the puffs on
his shoulders was enough alone to prove convincingly that the tailor
who had cut it was a Russian of the Russians

Well come in come in began the old man why are you bashful You
must thank your auntyoure forgiven Here your honour I commend
him to you he continued pointing to Mitya hes my own nephew but
I dont get on with him at all The end of the world is coming We
bowed to one another Well tell me what is this you have got mixed
up in What is the complaint they are making against you Explain it to
us

Mitya obviously did not care to explain matters and justify himself
before me

Later on uncle he muttered

No not laternow pursued the old man You are ashamed I see
before this gentleman all the betterits only what you deserve
Speak speak we are listening

I have nothing to be ashamed of began Mitya spiritedly with a toss
of his head Be so good as to judge for yourself uncle Some peasant
proprietors of Reshetilovo came to me and said Defend us brother
What is the matter This is it our grain stores were in perfect
orderin fact they could not be better all at once a government
inspector came to us with orders to inspect the granaries He inspected
them and said Your granaries are in disorderserious neglect its
my duty to report it to the authorities But what does the neglect
consist in Thats my business he says We met together and
decided to tip the official in the usual way but old Prohoritch
prevented us He said No thats only giving him a taste for more
Come after all havent we the courts of justice We obeyed the old
man and the official got in a rage and made a complaint and wrote a
report So now we are called up to answer to his charges But are
your granaries actually in order I asked God knows they are in
order and the legal quantity of corn is in them Well then say I
you have nothing to fear and I drew up a document for them And
it is not yet known in whose favour it is decided And as to the
complaints they have made to you about me over that affairits very
easy to understand thatevery mans shirt is nearest to his own skin

Everyones indeedbut not yours seemingly said the old man in an
undertone But what plots have you been hatching with the
Shutolomovsky peasants

How do you know anything of it

Never mind I do know of it

And there too I am rightjudge for yourself again A neighbouring
landowner Bezpandin has ploughed over four acres of the Shutolomovsky
peasants land The lands mine he says The Shutolomovsky people
are on the rentsystem their landowner has gone abroadwho is to
stand up for them Tell me yourself But the land is theirs beyond
dispute theyve been bound to it for ages and ages So they came to
me and said Write us a petition So I wrote one And Bezpandin
heard of it and began to threaten me Ill break every bone in that
Mityas body and knock his head off his shoulders We shall see
how he will knock it off its still on so far

Come dont boast its in a bad way your head said the old man
You are a mad fellow altogether

Why uncle what did you tell me yourself

I know I know what you will say Ovsyanikov interrupted him of
course a man ought to live uprightly and he is bound to succour his
neighbour Sometimes one must not spare oneself But do you always
behave in that way Dont they take you to the tavern eh Dont they
treat you bow to you eh Dmitri Alexyitch they say help us and
we will prove our gratitude to you And they slip a silver rouble or
note into your hand Eh doesnt that happen Tell me doesnt that
happen

I am certainly to blame in that answered Mitya rather confused
but I take nothing from the poor and I dont act against my
conscience

You dont take from them now but when you are badly off yourself
then you will You dont act against your consciencefie on you Of
course they are all saints whom you defend Have you forgotten
Borka Perohodov Who was it looked after him Who took him under his
protectioneh

Perohodov suffered through his own fault certainly

He appropriated the public moneys That was all

But consider uncle his poverty his family

Poverty poverty Hes a drunkard a quarrelsome fellow thats
what it is

He took to drink through trouble said Mitya dropping his voice

Through trouble indeed Well you might have helped him if your
heart was so warm to him but there was no need for you to sit in
taverns with the drunken fellow yourself Though he did speak so finely
 a prodigy to be sure

He was a very good fellow

Every one is good with you But did you send him  pursued
Ovsyanikov turning to his wife come you know

Tatyana Ilyinitchna nodded

Where have you been lately the old man began again

I have been in the town

You have been doing nothing but playing billiards I wager and
drinking tea and running to and fro about the government offices
drawing up petitions in little back rooms flaunting about with
merchants sons Thats it of course Tell us

Perhaps that is about it said Mitya with a smile Ah I had
almost forgottenFuntikov Anton Parfenitch asks you to dine with him
next Sunday

I shant go to see that old tub He gives you costly fish and puts
rancid butter on it God bless him

And I met Fedosya Mihalovna

What Fedosya is that

She belongs to Garpentchenko the landowner who bought Mikulino by
auction Fedosya is from Mikulino She lived in Moscow as a
dressmaker paying her service in money and she paid her
servicemoney accuratelya hundred and eighty tworoubles and a half a
year And she knows her business she got good orders in Moscow But
now Garpentchenko has written for her back and he retains her here
but does not provide any duties for her She would be prepared to buy
her freedom and has spoken to the master but he will not give any
decisive answer You uncle are acquainted with Garpentchenko  so
couldnt you just say a word to him And Fedosya would give a good
price for her freedom

Not with your money I hope Hey Well well all right I will speak
to him I will speak to him But I dont know continued the old man
with a troubled face this Garpentchenko God forgive him is a shark
he buys up debts lends money at interest purchases estates at
auctions And who brought him into our parts Ugh I cant bear
these newcomers One wont get an answer out of him very quickly
However we shall see

Try to manage it uncle

Very well I will see to it Only you take care take care of
yourself There there dont defend yourself God bless you God
bless you Only take care for the future or else Mitya upon my
word it will go ill with you Upon my word you will come to
grief I cant always screen you  and I myself am not a man of
influence There go now and God be with you

Mitya went away Tatyana Ilyinitchna went out after him

Give him some tea you softhearted creature cried Ovsyanikov after
her Hes not a stupid fellow he continued and hes a good heart
but I feel afraid for him But pardon me for having so long kept you
occupied with such details

The door from the hall opened A short grizzled little man came in in
a velvet coat

Ah Frantz Ivanitch cried Ovsyanikov good day to you Is God
merciful to you

Allow me gentle reader to introduce to you this gentleman

Frantz Ivanitch Lejeune my neighbour and a landowner of Orel had
arrived at the respectable position of a Russian nobleman in a not
quite ordinary way He was born in Orleans of French parents and had
gone with Napoleon on the invasion of Russia in the capacity of a
drummer At first all went smoothly and our Frenchman arrived in
Moscow with his head held high But on the return journey poor Monsieur
Lejeune halffrozen and without his drum fell into the hands of some
peasants of Smolensk The peasants shut him up for the night in an
empty cloth factory and the next morning brought him to an icehole
near the dyke and began to beg the drummer de la Grrrrande Arme
to oblige them in other words to swim under the ice Monsieur Lejeune
could not agree to their proposition and in his turn began to try to
persuade the Smolensk peasants in the dialect of France to let him go
to Orleans There messieurs he said my mother is living une
tendre mre But the peasants doubtless through their ignorance of
the geographical position of Orleans continued to offer him a journey
under water along the course of the meandering river Gniloterka and
had already begun to encourage him with slight blows on the vertebrae
of the neck and back when suddenly to the indescribable delight of
Lejeune the sound of bells was heard and there came along the dyke a
huge sledge with a striped rug over its excessively high dickey
harnessed with three roan horses In the sledge sat a stout and
redfaced landowner in a wolfskin pelisse

What is it you are doing there he asked the peasants

We are drowning a Frenchman your honour

Ah replied the landowner indifferently and he turned away

Monsieur Monsieur shrieked the poor fellow

Ah ah observed the wolfskin pelisse reproachfully you came with
twenty nations into Russia burnt Moscow tore down you damned
heathen the cross from Ivan the Great and nowmossoo mossoo
indeed now you turn tail You are paying the penalty of your sins
Go on Filka

The horses were starting

Stop though added the landowner Eh you mossoo do you know
anything of music

Sauvezmoi sauvezmoi mon bon monsieur repeated Lejeune

There see what a wretched people they are Not one of them knows
Russian Muzeek muzeek savey muzeek voo savey Well speak do
Compreny savey muzeek voo on the piano savey zhooey

Lejeune comprehended at last what the landowner meant and persistently
nodded his head

Oui monsieur oui oui je suis musicien je joue tous les
instruments possibles Oui monsieur Sauvezmoi monsieur

Well thank your lucky star replied the landowner Lads let him
go heres a twentycopeck piece for vodka

Thank you your honour thank you Take him your honour

They sat Lejeune in the sledge He was gasping with delight weeping
shivering bowing thanking the landowner the coachman the peasants
He had nothing on but a green jacket with pink ribbons and it was
freezing very hard The landowner looked at his blue and benumbed
shoulders in silence wrapped the unlucky fellow in his own pelisse
and took him home The household ran out They soon thawed the
Frenchman fed him and clothed him The landowner conducted him to his
daughters

Here children he said to them a teacher is found for you You
were always entreating me to have you taught music and the French
jargon here you have a Frenchman and he plays on the piano Come
mossoo he went on pointing to a wretched little instrument he had
bought five years before of a Jew whose special line was eau de
Cologne give us an example of your art zhooey

Lejeune with a sinking heart sat down on the musicstool he had
never touched a piano in his life

Zhooey zhooey repeated the landowner

In desperation the unhappy man beat on the keys as though on a drum
and played at hazard I quite expected he used to tell afterwards
that my deliverer would seize me by the collar and throw me out of
the house But to the utmost amazement of the unwilling improvisor
the landowner after waiting a little patted him goodhumouredly on
the shoulder

Good good he said I see your attainments go now and rest
yourself

Within a fortnight Lejeune had gone from this landowners to stay with
another a rich and cultivated man He gained his friendship by his
bright and gentle disposition was married to a ward of his went into
a government office rose to the nobility married his daughter to
Lobizanyev a landowner of Orel and a retired dragoon and poet and
settled himself on an estate in Orel

It was this same Lejeune or rather as he is called now Frantz
Ivanitch who when I was there came in to see Ovsyanikov with whom
he was on friendly terms

But perhaps the reader is already weary of sitting with me at the
Ovsyanikovs and so I will become eloquently silent



                                  VII

                                  LGOV


Let us go to Lgov Yermola whom the reader knows already said to
me one day there we can shoot ducks to our hearts content

Although wild duck offers no special attraction for a genuine
sportsman still through lack of other game at the time it was the
beginning of September snipe were not on the wing yet and I was tired
of running across the fields after partridges I listened to my
huntsmans suggestion and we went to Lgov

Lgov is a large village of the steppes with a very old stone church
with a single cupola and two mills on the swampy little river Rossota
Five miles from Lgov this river becomes a wide swampy pond overgrown
at the edges and in places also in the centre with thick reeds Here
in the creeks or rather pools between the reeds live and breed a
countless multitude of ducks of all possible kindsquackers
halfquackers pintails teals divers etc Small flocks are for ever
flitting about and swimming on the water and at a gunshot they rise
in such clouds that the sportsman involuntarily clutches his hat with
one hand and utters a prolonged Pshaw I walked with Yermola along
beside the pond but in the first place the duck is a wary bird and
is not to be met quite close to the bank and secondly even when some
straggling and inexperienced teal exposed itself to our shots and lost
its life our dogs were not able to get it out of the thick reeds in
spite of their most devoted efforts they could neither swim nor tread
on the bottom and only cut their precious noses on the sharp reeds for
nothing

No was Yermolas comment at last it wont do we must get a
boat Let us go back to Lgov

We went back We had only gone a few paces when a rather
wretchedlooking setterdog ran out from behind a bushy willow to meet
us and behind him appeared a man of middle height in a blue and
muchworn greatcoat a yellow waistcoat and pantaloons of a
nondescript grey colour hastily tucked into high boots full of holes
with a red handkerchief round his neck and a singlebarrelled gun on
his shoulder While our dogs with the ordinary Chinese ceremonies
peculiar to their species were sniffing at their new acquaintance who
was obviously ill at ease held his tail between his legs dropped his
ears back and kept turning round and round showing his teeththe
stranger approached us and bowed with extreme civility He appeared to
be about twentyfive his long dark hair perfectly saturated with
kvas stood up in stiff tufts his small brown eyes twinkled genially
his face was bound up in a black handkerchief as though for toothache
his countenance was all smiles and amiability

Allow me to introduce myself he began in a soft and insinuating
voice I am a sportsman of these partsVladimir Having heard of
your presence and having learnt that you proposed to visit the shores
of our pond I resolved if it were not displeasing to you to offer
you my services

The sportsman Vladimir uttered those words for all the world like a
young provincial actor in the rle of leading lover I agreed to his
proposition and before we had reached Lgov I had succeeded in learning
his whole history He was a freed houseserf in his tender youth had
been taught music then served as valet could read and write had
readso much I could discoversome few trashy books and existed now
as many do exist in Russia without a farthing of ready money without
any regular occupation fed by manna from heaven or something hardly
less precarious He expressed himself with extraordinary elegance and
obviously plumed himself on his manners he must have been devoted to
the fair sex too and in all probability popular with them Russian
girls love fine talking Among other things he gave me to understand
that he sometimes visited the neighbouring landowners and went to stay
with friends in the town where he played preference and that he was
acquainted with people in the metropolis His smile was masterly and
exceedingly varied what specially suited him was a modest contained
smile which played on his lips as he listened to any other mans
conversation He was attentive to you he agreed with you completely
but still he did not lose sight of his own dignity and seemed to wish
to give you to understand that he could if occasion arose express
convictions of his own Yermola not being very refined and quite
devoid of subtlety began to address him with coarse familiarity The
fine irony with which Vladimir used Sir in his reply was worth seeing

Why is your face tied up I inquired have you toothache

No he answered it was a most disastrous consequence of
carelessness I had a friend a good fellow but not a bit of a
sportsman as sometimes occurs Well one day he said to me My dear
friend take me out shooting I am curious to learn what this diversion
consists in I did not like of course to refuse a comrade I got him
a gun and took him out shooting Well we shot a little in the ordinary
way at last we thought we would rest I sat down under a tree but he
began instead to play with his gun pointing it at me meantime I asked
him to leave off but in his inexperience he did not attend to my
words the gun went off and I lost half my chin and the first finger
of my right hand

We reached Lgov Vladimir and Yermola had both decided that we could
not shoot without a boat

Sutchok ie the twig has a punt observed Vladimir but I dont
know where he has hidden it We must go to him

To whom I asked

The man lives here Sutchok is his nickname

Vladimir went with Yermola to Sutchoks I told them I would wait for
them at the church While I was looking at the tombstones in the
churchyard I stumbled upon a blackened fourcornered urn with the
following inscription on one side in French Cigit ThophileHenri
Vicomte de Blangy on the next Under this stone is laid the body of
a French subject Count Blangy born  died  in the nd year
of his age on the third Peace to his ashes and on the fourth

   Under this stone there lies from France an emigrant
     Of high descent was he and also of talent
     A wife and kindred murdered he bewailed
     And left his land by tyrants cruel assailed
     The friendly shores of Russia he attained
     And hospitable shelter here he gained
     Children he taught their parents cares allayed
     Here by Gods will in peace he has been laid


The approach of Yermola with Vladimir and the man with the strange
nickname Sutchok broke in on my meditations

Barelegged ragged and dishevelled Sutchok looked like a discharged
stray houseserf of sixty years old

Have you a boat I asked him

I have a boat he answered in a hoarse cracked voice but its a
very poor one

How so

Its boards are split apart and the rivets have come off the cracks

Thats no great disaster interposed Yermola we can stuff them up
with tow

Of course you can Sutchok assented

And who are you

I am the fisherman of the manor

How is it when youre a fisherman your boat is in such bad
condition

There are no fish in our river

Fish dont like slimy marshes observed my huntsman with the air of
an authority

Come I said to Yermola go and get some tow and make the boat
right for us as soon as you can

Yermola went off

Well in this way we may very likely go to the bottom I said to
Vladimir God is merciful he answered Anyway we must suppose that
the pond is not deep

No it is not deep observed Sutchok who spoke in a strange
faraway voice as though he were in a dream and theres sedge and
mud at the bottom and its all overgrown with sedge But there are
deep holes too

But if the sedge is so thick said Vladimir it will be impossible
to row

Who thinks of rowing in a punt One has to punt it I will go with
you my pole is thereor else one can use a wooden spade

With a spade it wont be easy you wont touch the bottom perhaps in
some places said Vladimir

Its true it wont be easy

I sat down on a tombstone to wait for Yermola Vladimir moved a
little to one side out of respect to me and also sat down Sutchok
remained standing in the same place his head bent and his hands
clasped behind his back according to the old habit of houseserfs

Tell me please I began have you been the fisherman here long

It is seven years now he replied rousing himself with a start

And what was your occupation before

I was coachman before

Who dismissed you from being coachman

The new mistress

What mistress

Oh that bought us Your honour does not know her Alyona Timofyevna
she is so fat  not young

Why did she decide to make you a fisherman

God knows She came to us from her estate in Tamboff gave orders for
all the household to come together and came out to us We first kissed
her hand and she said nothing she was not angry Then she began to
question us in order How are you employed what duties have you She
came to me in my turn so she asked What have you been I say
Coachman Coachman Well a fine coachman you are only look at you
Youre not fit for a coachman but be my fisherman and shave your
beard On the occasions of my visits provide fish for the table do you
hear  So since then I have been enrolled as a fisherman And mind
you keep my pond in order But how is one to keep it in order

Whom did you belong to before

To Serga Sergiitch Pehterev We came to him by inheritance But he
did not own us long only six years altogether I was his coachman 
but not in town he had others thereonly in the country

And were you always a coachman from your youth up

Always a coachman Oh no I became a coachman in Serga Sergiitchs
time but before that I was a cookbut not towncook only a cook in
the country

Whose cook were you then

Oh my former masters Afanasy Nefeditch Serga Sergiitchs uncle
Lgov was bought by him by Afanasy Nefeditch but it came to Serga
Sergiitch by inheritance from him

Whom did he buy it from

From Tatyana Vassilyevna

What Tatyana Vassilyevna was that

Why that died last year in Bolhov  that is at Karatchev an old
maid She had never married Dont you know her We came to her from
her father Vassily Semenitch She owned us a goodish while  twenty
years

Then were you cook to her

At first to be sure I was cook and then I was coffeebearer

What were you

Coffeebearer

What sort of duty is that

I dont know your honour I stood at the sideboard and was called
Anton instead of Kuzma The mistress ordered that I should be called
so

Your real name then is Kuzma

Yes

And were you coffeebearer all the time

No not all the time I was an actor too

Really

Yes I was I played in the theatre Our mistress set up a theatre
of her own

What kind of parts did you take

What did you please to say

What did you do in the theatre

Dont you know Why they take me and dress me up and I walk about
dressed up or stand or sit down there as it happens and they say
See this is what you must say and I say it Once I represented a
blind man They laid little peas under each eyelid Yes indeed

And what were you afterwards

Afterwards I became a cook again

Why did they degrade you to being a cook again

My brother ran away

Well and what were you under the father of your first mistress

I had different duties at first I found myself a page I have been a
postilion a gardener and a whipperin

A whipperin And did you ride out with the hounds

Yes I rode with the hounds and was nearly killed I fell off my
horse and the horse was injured Our old master was very severe he
ordered them to flog me and to send me to learn a trade to Moscow to
a shoemaker

To learn a trade But you werent a child I suppose when you were a
whipperin

I was twenty and over then

But could you learn a trade at twenty

I suppose one could some way since the master ordered it But he
luckily died soon after and they sent me back to the country

And when were you taught to cook

Sutchok lifted his thin yellowish little old face and grinned

Is that a thing to be taught Old women can cook

Well I commented you have seen many things Kuzma in your time
What do you do now as a fisherman seeing there are no fish

Oh your honour I dont complain And thank God they made me a
fisherman Why another old man like meAndrey Pupirthe mistress
ordered to be put into the paper factory as a ladler Its a sin
she said to eat bread in idleness And Pupir had even hoped for
favour his cousins son was clerk in the mistresss countinghouse he
had promised to send his name up to the mistress to remember him a
fine way he remembered him And Pupir fell at his cousins knees
before my eyes

Have you a family Have you married

No your honour I have never been married Tatyana VassilyevnaGod
rest her souldid not allow anyone to marry God forbid she said
sometimes here am I living single what indulgence What are they
thinking of

What do you live on now Do you get wages

Wages your honour Victuals are given me and thanks be to Thee
Lord I am very contented May God give our lady long life

Yermola returned

The boat is repaired he announced churlishly Go after your
poleyou there

Sutchok ran to get his pole During the whole time of my conversation
with the poor old man the sportsman Vladimir had been staring at him
with a contemptuous smile

A stupid fellow was his comment when the latter had gone off an
absolutely uneducated fellow a peasant nothing more One cannot even
call him a houseserf and he was boasting all the time How could he
be an actor be pleased to judge for yourself You were pleased to
trouble yourself for no good in talking to him

A quarter of an hour later we were sitting in Sutchoks punt The dogs
we left in a hut in charge of my coachman We were not very
comfortable but sportsmen are not a fastidious race At the rear end
which was flattened and straight stood Sutchok punting I sat with
Vladimir on the planks laid across the boat and Yermola ensconced
himself in front in the very beak In spite of the tow the water soon
made its appearance under our feet Fortunately the weather was calm
and the pond seemed slumbering

We floated along rather slowly The old man had difficulty in drawing
his long pole out of the sticky mud it came up all tangled in green
threads of watersedge the flat round leaves of the waterlily also
hindered the progress of our boat last we got up to the reeds and then
the fun began Ducks flew up noisily from the pond scared by our
unexpected appearance in their domains shots sounded at once after
them it was a pleasant sight to see these shorttailed game turning
somersaults in the air splashing heavily into the water We could not
of course get at all the ducks that were shot those who were slightly
wounded swam away some which had been quite killed fell into such
thick reeds that even Yermolas little lynx eyes could not discover
them yet our boat was nevertheless filled to the brim with game for
dinner

Vladimir to Yermolas great satisfaction did not shoot at all well
he seemed surprised after each unsuccessful shot looked at his gun and
blew down it seemed puzzled and at last explained to us the reason
why he had missed his aim Yermola as always shot triumphantly
Irather badly after my custom Sutchok looked on at us with the eyes
of a man who has been the servant of others from his youth up now and
then he cried out There there theres another little duck and he
constantly rubbed his back not with his hands but by a peculiar
movement of the shoulderblades The weather kept magnificent curly
white clouds moved calmly high above our heads and were reflected
clearly in the water the reeds were whispering around us here and
there the pond sparkled in the sunshine like steel We were preparing
to return to the village when suddenly a rather unpleasant adventure
befel us

For a long time we had been aware that the water was gradually filling
our punt Vladimir was entrusted with the task of baling it out by
means of a ladle which my thoughtful huntsman had stolen to be ready
for any emergency from a peasant woman who was staring away in another
direction All went well so long as Vladimir did not neglect his duty
But just at the end the ducks as if to take leave of us rose in such
flocks that we scarcely had time to load our guns In the heat of the
sport we did not pay attention to the state of our puntwhen suddenly
Yermola in trying to reach a wounded duck leaned his whole weight on
the boatsedge at his overeager movement our old tub veered on one
side began to fill and majestically sank to the bottom fortunately
not in a deep place We cried out but it was too late in an instant
we were standing in the water up to our necks surrounded by the
floating bodies of the slaughtered ducks I cannot help laughing now
when I recollect the scared white faces of my companions probably my
own face was not particularly rosy at that moment but I must confess
at the time it did not enter my head to feel amused Each of us kept
his gun above his head and Sutchok no doubt from the habit of
imitating his masters lifted his pole above him The first to break
the silence was Yermola

Tfoo curse it he muttered spitting into the water heres a go
Its all you you old devil he added turning wrathfully to Sutchok
youve such a boat

Its my fault stammered the old man

Yes and youre a nice one continued my huntsman turning his head
in Vladimirs direction what were you thinking of Why werent you
baling outyou you

But Vladimir was not equal to a reply he was shaking like a leaf his
teeth were chattering and his smile was utterly meaningless What had
become of his fine language his feeling of fine distinctions and of
his own dignity

The cursed punt rocked feebly under our feet At the instant of our
ducking the water seemed terribly cold to us but we soon got hardened
to it when the first shock had passed off I looked round me the
reeds rose up in a circle ten paces from us in the distance above
their tops the bank could be seen It looks bad I thought

What are we to do I asked Yermola

Well well take a look round we cant spend the night here he
answered Here you take my gun he said to Vladimir

Vladimir obeyed submissively

I will go and find the ford continued Yermola as though there must
infallibly be a ford in every pond he took the pole from Sutchok and
went off in the direction of the bank warily sounding the depth as he
walked

Can you swim I asked him

No I cant his voice sounded from behind the reeds

Then hell be drowned remarked Sutchok indifferently He had been
terrified at first not by the danger but through fear of our anger
and now completely reassured he drew a long breath from time to time
and seemed not to be aware of any necessity for moving from his present
position

And he will perish without doing any good added Vladimir piteously

Yermola did not return for more than an hour That hour seemed an
eternity to us At first we kept calling to him very energetically
then his answering shouts grew less frequent at last he was completely
silent The bells in the village began ringing for evening service
There was not much conversation between us indeed we tried not to
look at one another The ducks hovered over our heads some seemed
disposed to settle near us but suddenly rose up into the air and flew
away quacking We began to grow numb Sutchok shut his eyes as though
he were disposing himself to sleep

At last to our indescribable delight Yermola returned

Well

I have been to the bank I have found the ford Let us go

We wanted to set off at once but he first brought some string out of
his pocket out of the water tied the slaughtered ducks together by
their legs took both ends in his teeth and moved slowly forward
Vladimir came behind him and I behind Vladimir and Sutchok brought up
the rear It was about two hundred paces to the bank Yermola walked
boldly and without stopping so well had he noted the track only
occasionally crying out More to the lefttheres a hole here to the
right or Keep to the rightyoull sink in there to the left
Sometimes the water was up to our necks and twice poor Sutchok who
was shorter than all the rest of us got a mouthful and spluttered
Come come come Yermola shouted roughly to himand Sutchok
scrambling hopping and skipping managed to reach a shallower place
but even in his greatest extremity was never so bold as to clutch at
the skirt of my coat Worn out muddy and wet we at last reached the
bank

Two hours later we were all sitting as dry as circumstances would
allow in a large hay barn preparing for supper The coachman
Yehudiil an exceedingly deliberate man heavy in gait cautious and
sleepy stood at the entrance zealously plying Sutchok with snuff I
have noticed that coachmen in Russia very quickly make friends
Sutchok was taking snuff with frenzied energy in quantities to make
him ill he was spitting sneezing and apparently enjoying himself
greatly Vladimir had assumed an air of languor he leaned his head on
one side and spoke little Yermola was cleaning our guns The dogs
were wagging their tails at a great rate in the expectation of
porridge the horses were stamping and neighing in the outhouse
The sun had set its last rays were broken up into broad tracts of
purple golden clouds were drawn out over the heavens into finer and
ever finer threads like a fleece washed and combed out  There was
the sound of singing in the village



                                  VIII

                            BYEZHIN PRAIRIE


It was a glorious July day one of those days which only come after
many days of fine weather From earliest morning the sky is clear the
sunrise does not glow with fire it is suffused with a soft roseate
flush The sun not fiery not redhot as in time of stifling drought
not dull purple as before a storm but with a bright and genial
radiance rises peacefully behind a long and narrow cloud shines out
freshly and plunges again into its lilac mist The delicate upper edge
of the strip of cloud flashes in little gleaming snakes their
brilliance is like polished silver But lo the dancing rays flash
forth again and in solemn joy as though flying upward rises the
mighty orb About midday there is wont to be high up in the sky a
multitude of rounded clouds goldengrey with soft white edges Like
islands scattered over an overflowing river that bathes them in its
unbroken reaches of deep transparent blue they scarcely stir farther
down the heavens they are in movement packing closer now there is no
blue to be seen between them but they are themselves almost as blue as
the sky filled full with light and heat The colour of the horizon a
faint pale lilac does not change all day and is the same all round
nowhere is there storm gathering and darkening only somewhere rays of
bluish colour stretch down from the sky it is a sprinkling of
scarceperceptible rain In the evening these clouds disappear the
last of them blackish and undefined as smoke lie streaked with pink
facing the setting sun in the place where it has gone down as calmly
as it rose a crimson glow lingers long over the darkening earth and
softly flashing like a candle carried carelessly the evening star
flickers in the sky On such days all the colours are softened bright
but not glaring everything is suffused with a kind of touching
tenderness On such days the heat is sometimes very great often it is
even steaming on the slopes of the fields but a wind dispels this
growing sultriness and whirling eddies of dustsure sign of settled
fine weathermove along the roads and across the fields in high white
columns In the pure dry air there is a scent of wormwood rye in
blossom and buckwheat even an hour before nightfall there is no
moisture in the air It is for such weather that the farmer longs for
harvesting his wheat

On just such a day I was once out grouseshooting in the Tchern
district of the province of Tula I started and shot a fair amount of
game my full gamebag cut my shoulder mercilessly but already the
evening glow had faded and the cool shades of twilight were beginning
to grow thicker and to spread across the sky which was still bright
though no longer lighted up by the rays of the setting sun when I at
last decided to turn back homewards With swift steps I passed through
the long square of underwoods clambered up a hill and instead of
the familiar plain I expected to see with the oakwood on the right and
the little white church in the distance I saw before me a scene
completely different and quite new to me A narrow valley lay at my
feet and directly facing me a dense wood of aspentrees rose up like a
thick wall I stood still in perplexity looked round me Aha I
thought I have somehow come wrong I kept too much to the right and
surprised at my own mistake I rapidly descended the hill I was at
once plunged into a disagreeable clinging mist exactly as though I had
gone down into a cellar the thick high grass at the bottom of the
valley all drenched with dew was white like a smooth tablecloth one
felt afraid somehow to walk on it I made haste to get on the other
side and walked along beside the aspenwood bearing to the left Bats
were already hovering over its slumbering treetops mysteriously
flitting and quivering across the clear obscure of the sky a young
belated hawk flew in swift straight course upwards hastening to its
nest Here directly I get to this corner I thought to myself I
shall find the road at once but I have come a mile out of my way

I did at last reach the end of the wood but there was no road of any
sort there some kind of low bushes overgrown with long grass extended
far and wide before me behind them in the far far distance could be
discerned a tract of waste land I stopped again Well Where am I I
began ransacking my brain to recall how and where I had been walking
during the day Ah but these are the bushes at Parahin I cried
at last of course then this must be Sindyev wood But how did I get
here So far Strange Now I must bear to the right again

I went to the right through the bushes Meantime the night had crept
close and grown up like a stormcloud it seemed as though with the
mists of evening darkness was rising up on all sides and flowing down
from overhead I had come upon some sort of little untrodden
overgrown path I walked along it gazing intently before me Soon all
was blackness and silence aroundonly the quails cry was heard from
time to time Some small nightbird flitting noiselessly near the
ground on its soft wings almost flapped against me and skurried away
in alarm I came out on the further side of the bushes and made my way
along a field by the hedge By now I could hardly make out distant
objects the field showed dimly white around beyond it rose up a
sullen darkness which seemed moving up closer in huge masses every
instant My steps gave a muffled sound in the air that grew colder and
colder The pale sky began again to grow bluebut it was the blue of
night The tiny stars glimmered and twinkled in it

What I had been taking for a wood turned out to be a dark round
hillock But where am I then I repeated again aloud standing still
for the third time and looking inquiringly at my spot and tan English
dog Dianka by name certainly the most intelligent of fourfooted
creatures But the most intelligent of fourfooted creatures only
wagged her tail blinked her weary eyes dejectedly and gave me no
sensible advice I felt myself disgraced in her eyes and pushed
desperately forward as though I had suddenly guessed which way I ought
to go I scaled the hill and found myself in a hollow of no great
depth ploughed round

A strange sensation came over me at once This hollow had the form of
an almost perfect cauldron with sloping sides at the bottom of it
were some great white stones standing uprightit seemed as though they
had crept there for some secret counciland it was so still and dark
in it so dreary and weird seemed the sky overhanging it that my
heart sank Some little animal was whining feebly and piteously among
the stones I made haste to get out again on to the hillock Till then
I had not quite given up all hope of finding the way home but at this
point I finally decided that I was utterly lost and without any
further attempt to make out the surrounding objects which were almost
completely plunged in darkness I walked straight forward by the aid
of the stars at random For about halfanhour I walked on in this
way though I could hardly move one leg before the other It seemed as
if I had never been in such a deserted country in my life nowhere was
there the glimmer of a fire nowhere a sound to be heard One sloping
hillside followed another fields stretched endlessly upon fields
bushes seemed to spring up out of the earth under my very nose I kept
walking and was just making up my mind to lie down somewhere till
morning when suddenly I found myself on the edge of a horrible
precipice

I quickly drew back my lifted foot and through the almost opaque
darkness I saw far below me a vast plain A long river skirted it in a
semicircle turned away from me its course was marked by the steely
reflection of the water still faintly glimmering here and there The
hill on which I found myself terminated abruptly in an almost
overhanging precipice whose gigantic profile stood out black against
the darkblue waste of sky and directly below me in the corner formed
by this precipice and the plain near the river which was there a dark
motionless mirror under the lee of the hill two fires side by side
were smoking and throwing up red flames People were stirring round
them shadows hovered and sometimes the front of a little curly head
was lighted up by the glow

I found out at last where I had got to This plain was well known in
our parts under the name of Byezhin Prairie But there was no
possibility of returning home especially at night my legs were
sinking under me from weariness I decided to get down to the fires and
to wait for the dawn in the company of these men whom I took for
drovers I got down successfully but I had hardly let go of the last
branch I had grasped when suddenly two large shaggy white dogs rushed
angrily barking upon me The sound of ringing boyish voices came from
round the fires two or three boys quickly got up from the ground I
called back in response to their shouts of inquiry They ran up to me
and at once called off the dogs who were specially struck by the
appearance of my Dianka I came down to them

I had been mistaken in taking the figures sitting round the fires for
drovers They were simply peasant boys from a neighbouring village who
were in charge of a drove of horses In hot summer weather with us they
drive the horses out at night to graze in the open country the flies
and gnats would give them no peace in the daytime they drive out the
drove towards evening and drive them back in the early morning its a
great treat for the peasant boys Bareheaded in old furcapes they
bestride the most spirited nags and scurry along with merry cries and
hooting and ringing laughter swinging their arms and legs and leaping
into the air The fine dust is stirred up in yellow clouds and moves
along the road the tramp of hoofs in unison resounds afar the horses
race along pricking up their ears in front of all with his tail in
the air and thistles in his tangled mane prances some shaggy chestnut
constantly shifting his paces as he goes

I told the boys I had lost my way and sat down with them They asked
me where I came from and then were silent for a little and turned
away Then we talked a little again I lay down under a bush whose
shoots had been nibbled off and began to look round It was a
marvellous picture about the fire a red ring of light quivered and
seemed to swoon away in the embrace of a background of darkness the
flame flaring up from time to time cast swift flashes of light beyond
the boundary of this circle a fine tongue of light licked the dry
twigs and died away at once long thin shadows in their turn breaking
in for an instant danced right up to the very fires darkness was
struggling with light Sometimes when the fire burnt low and the
circle of light shrank together suddenly out of the encroaching
darkness a horses head was thrust in bay with striped markings or
all white stared with intent blank eyes upon us nipped hastily the
long grass and drawing back again vanished instantly One could only
hear it still munching and snorting From the circle of light it was
hard to make out what was going on in the darkness everything close at
hand seemed shut off by an almost black curtain but farther away hills
and forests were dimly visible in long blurs upon the horizon

The dark unclouded sky stood inconceivably immense triumphant above
us in all its mysterious majesty One felt a sweet oppression at ones
heart breathing in that peculiar overpowering yet fresh
fragrancethe fragrance of a summer night in Russia Scarcely a sound
was to be heard around Only at times in the river near the sudden
splash of a big fish leaping and the faint rustle of a reed on the
bank swaying lightly as the ripples reached it  the fires alone
kept up a subdued crackling

The boys sat round them there too sat the two dogs who had been so
eager to devour me They could not for long after reconcile themselves
to my presence and drowsily blinking and staring into the fire they
growled now and then with an unwonted sense of their own dignity first
they growled and then whined a little as though deploring the
impossibility of carrying out their desires There were altogether five
boys Fedya Pavlusha Ilyusha Kostya and Vanya From their talk I
learnt their names and I intend now to introduce them to the reader

The first and eldest of all Fedya one would take to be about
fourteen He was a wellmade boy with goodlooking delicate rather
small features curly fair hair bright eyes and a perpetual
halfmerry halfcareless smile He belonged by all appearances to a
welltodo family and had ridden out to the prairie not through
necessity but for amusement He wore a gay print shirt with a yellow
border a short new overcoat slung round his neck was almost slipping
off his narrow shoulders a comb hung from his blue belt His boots
coming a little way up the leg were certainly his ownnot his
fathers The second boy Pavlusha had tangled black hair grey eyes
broad cheekbones a pale face pitted with smallpox a large but
wellcut mouth his head altogether was largea beerbarrel head as
they sayand his figure was square and clumsy He was not a
goodlooking boytheres no denying itand yet I liked him he
looked very sensible and straightforward and there was a vigorous ring
in his voice He had nothing to boast of in his attire it consisted
simply of a homespun shirt and patched trousers The face of the third
Ilyusha was rather uninteresting it was a long face with
shortsighted eyes and a hook nose it expressed a kind of dull
fretful uneasiness his tightlydrawn lips seemed rigid his contracted
brow never relaxed he seemed continually blinking from the firelight
His flaxenalmost whitehair hung out in thin wisps under his low
felt hat which he kept pulling down with both hands over his ears He
had on new bastshoes and leggings a thick string wound three times
round his figure carefully held together his neat black smock Neither
he nor Pavlusha looked more than twelve years old The fourth Kostya
a boy of ten aroused my curiosity by his thoughtful and sorrowful
look His whole face was small thin freckled pointed at the chin
like a squirrels his lips were barely perceptible but his great
black eyes that shone with liquid brilliance produced a strange
impression they seemed trying to express something for which the
tonguehis tongue at leasthad no words He was undersized and
weakly and dressed rather poorly The remaining boy Vanya I had not
noticed at first he was lying on the ground peacefully curled up
under a square rug and only occasionally thrust his curly brown head
out from under it this boy was seven years old at the most

So I lay under the bush at one side and looked at the boys A small pot
was hanging over one of the fires in it potatoes were cooking
Pavlusha was looking after them and on his knees he was trying them by
poking a splinter of wood into the boiling water Fedya was lying
leaning on his elbow and smoothing out the skirts of his coat Ilyusha
was sitting beside Kostya and still kept blinking constrainedly
Kostyas head drooped despondently and he looked away into the
distance Vanya did not stir under his rug I pretended to be asleep
Little by little the boys began talking again

At first they gossiped of one thing and another the work of tomorrow
the horses but suddenly Fedya turned to Ilyusha and as though taking
up again an interrupted conversation asked him

Come then so youve seen the domovoy

No I didnt see him and no one ever can see him answered Ilyusha
in a weak hoarse voice the sound of which was wonderfully in keeping
with the expression of his face I heard him Yes and not I alone

Where does he livein your place asked Pavlusha

In the old papermill

Why do you go to the factory

Of course we do My brother Avdushka and I we are paperglazers

I sayfactoryhands

Well how did you hear it then asked Fedya

It was like this It happened that I and my brother Avdushka with
Fyodor of Mihyevska and Ivashka the Squinteyed and the other Ivashka
who comes from the Red Hills and Ivashka of Suhorukov tooand there
were some other boys there as wellthere were ten of us boys there
altogetherthe whole shift that isit happened that we spent the
night at the papermill thats to say it didnt happen but Nazarov
the overseer kept us Why said he should you waste time going
home boys theres a lot of work tomorrow so dont go home boys
So we stopped and were all lying down together and Avdushka had just
begun to say I say boys suppose the domovoy were to come And
before hed finished saying so some one suddenly began walking over
our heads we were lying down below and he began walking upstairs
overhead where the wheel is We listened he walked the boards seemed
to be bending under him they creaked so then he crossed over above
our heads all of a sudden the water began to drip and drip over the
wheel the wheel rattled and rattled and again began to turn though
the sluices of the conduit above had been let down We wondered who
could have lifted them up so that the water could run any way the
wheel turned and turned a little and then stopped Then he went to the
door overhead and began coming downstairs and came down like this
not hurrying himself the stairs seemed to groan under him too
Well he came right down to our door and waited and waited  and all
of a sudden the door simply flew open We were in a fright we
lookedthere was nothing Suddenly what if the net on one of the
vats didnt begin moving it got up and went rising and ducking and
moving in the air as though some one were stirring with it and then it
was in its place again Then at another vat a hook came off its nail
and then was on its nail again and then it seemed as if some one came
to the door and suddenly coughed and choked like a sheep but so
loudly We all fell down in a heap and huddled against one
another Just werent we in a fright that night

I say murmured Pavel what did he cough for

I dont know perhaps it was the damp

All were silent for a little

Well inquired Fedya are the potatoes done

Pavlusha tried them

No they are raw My what a splash he added turning his face in
the direction of the river that must be a pike And theres a star
falling

I say I can tell you something brothers began Kostya in a shrill
little voice listen what my dad told me the other day

Well we are listening said Fedya with a patronising air

You know Gavrila I suppose the carpenter up in the big village

Yes we know him

And do you know why he is so sorrowful always never speaks do you
know Ill tell you why hes so sorrowful he went one day daddy said
he went brothers into the forest nutting So he went nutting into the
forest and lost his way he went onGod only can tell where he got to
So he went on and on brothersbut twas no goodhe could not find
the way and so night came on out of doors So he sat down under a
tree Ill wait till morning thought he He sat down and began to
drop asleep So as he was falling asleep suddenly he heard some one
call him He looked up there was no one He fell asleep again again
he was called He looked and looked again and in front of him there
sat a russalka on a branch swinging herself and calling him to her
and simply dying with laughing she laughed so And the moon was
shining bright so bright the moon shone so cleareverything could be
seen plain brothers So she called him and she herself was as bright
and as white sitting on the branch as some dace or a roach or like
some little carp so white and silvery Gavrila the carpenter almost
fainted brothers but she laughed without stopping and kept beckoning
him to her like this Then Gavrila was just getting up he was just
going to yield to the russalka brothers butthe Lord put it into his
heart doubtlesshe crossed himself like this And it was so hard
for him to make that cross brothers he said My hand was simply like
a stone it would not move  Ugh the horrid witch So when he
made the cross brothers the russalka she left off laughing and all
at once how she did cry She cried brothers and wiped her eyes
with her hair and her hair was green as any hemp So Gavrila looked
and looked at her and at last he fell to questioning her Why are you
weeping wild thing of the woods And the russalka began to speak to
him like this If you had not crossed yourself man she says you
should have lived with me in gladness of heart to the end of your days
and I weep I am grieved at heart because you crossed yourself but I
will not grieve alone you too shall grieve at heart to the end of your
days Then she vanished brothers and at once it was plain to Gavrila
how to get out of the forest Only since then he goes always
sorrowful as you see

Ugh said Fedya after a brief silence but how can such an evil
thing of the woods ruin a Christian soulhe did not listen to her

And I say said Kostya Gavrila said that her voice was as shrill
and plaintive as a toads

Did your father tell you that himself Fedya went on

Yes I was lying in the loft I heard it all

Its a strange thing Why should he be sorrowful But I suppose she
liked him since she called him

Ay she liked him put in Ilyusha Yes indeed she wanted to tickle
him to death thats what she wanted Thats what they do those
russalkas

There ought to be russalkas here too I suppose observed Fedya

No answered Kostya this is a holy open place Theres one thing
though the rivers near

All were silent Suddenly from out of the distance came a prolonged
resonant almost wailing sound one of those inexplicable sounds of the
night which break upon a profound stillness rise upon the air
linger and slowly die away at last You listen it is as though there
were nothing yet it echoes still It is as though some one had uttered
a long long cry upon the very horizon as though some other had
answered him with shrill harsh laughter in the forest and a faint
hoarse hissing hovers over the river The boys looked round about
shivering

Christs aid be with us whispered Ilyusha

Ah you craven crows cried Pavel what are you frightened of Look
the potatoes are done They all came up to the pot and began to eat
the smoking potatoes only Vanya did not stir Well arent you
coming said Pavel

But he did not creep out from under his rug The pot was soon
completely emptied

Have you heard boys began Ilyusha what happened with us at
Varnavitsi

Near the dam asked Fedya

Yes yes near the dam the brokendown dam That is a haunted place
such a haunted place and so lonely All round there are pits and
quarries and there are always snakes in pits

Well what did happen Tell us

Well this is what happened You dont know perhaps Fedya but there
a drowned man was buried he was drowned long long ago when the water
was still deep only his grave can still be seen though it can only
just be seen  like thisa little mound So one day the bailiff
called the huntsman Yermil and says to him Go to the post Yermil
Yermil always goes to the post for us he has let all his dogs die
they never will live with him for some reason and they have never
lived with him though hes a good huntsman and everyone liked him So
Yermil went to the post and he stayed a bit in the town and when he
rode back he was a little tipsy It was night a fine night the moon
was shining So Yermil rode across the dam his way lay there So
as he rode along he saw on the drowned mans grave a little lamb so
white and curly and pretty running about So Yermil thought I will
take him and he got down and took him in his arms But the little
lamb didnt take any notice So Yermil goes back to his horse and the
horse stares at him and snorts and shakes his head however he said
wo to him and sat on him with the lamb and rode on again he held
the lamb in front of him He looks at him and the lamb looks him
straight in the face like this Yermil the huntsman felt upset I
dont remember he said that lambs ever look at any one like that
however he began to stroke it like this on its wool and to say
Chucky chucky And the lamb suddenly showed its teeth and said too
Chucky chucky

The boy who was telling the story had hardly uttered this last word
when suddenly both dogs got up at once and barking convulsively
rushed away from the fire and disappeared in the darkness All the boys
were alarmed Vanya jumped up from under his rug Pavlusha ran shouting
after the dogs Their barking quickly grew fainter in the distance
There was the noise of the uneasy tramp of the frightened drove of
horses Pavlusha shouted aloud Hey Grey Beetle  In a few
minutes the barking ceased Pavels voice sounded still in the
distance A little time more passed the boys kept looking about in
perplexity as though expecting something to happen Suddenly the
tramp of a galloping horse was heard it stopped short at the pile of
wood and hanging on to the mane Pavel sprang nimbly off it Both the
dogs also leaped into the circle of light and at once sat down their
red tongues hanging out

What was it what was it asked the boys

Nothing answered Pavel waving his hand to his horse I suppose the
dogs scented something I thought it was a wolf he added calmly
drawing deep breaths into his chest

I could not help admiring Pavel He was very fine at that moment His
ugly face animated by his swift ride glowed with hardihood and
determination Without even a switch in his hand he had without the
slightest hesitation rushed out into the night alone to face a
wolf What a splendid fellow I thought looking at him

Have you seen any wolves then asked the trembling Kostya

There are always a good many of them here answered Pavel but they
are only troublesome in the winter

He crouched down again before the fire As he sat down on the ground
he laid his hand on the shaggy head of one of the dogs For a long
while the flattered brute did not turn his head gazing sidewise with
grateful pride at Pavlusha

Vanya lay down under his rug again

What dreadful things you were telling us Ilyusha began Fedya whose
part it was as the son of a welltodo peasant to lead the
conversation He spoke little himself apparently afraid of lowering
his dignity And then some evil spirit set the dogs barking
Certainly I have heard that place was haunted

Varnavitsi I should think it was haunted More than once they
say they have seen the old master therethe late master He wears
they say a long skirted coat and keeps groaning like this and
looking for something on the ground Once grandfather Trofimitch met
him What says he your honour Ivan Ivanitch are you pleased to
look for on the ground

He asked him put in Fedya in amazement

Yes he asked him

Well I call Trofimitch a brave fellow after that Well what did
he say

I am looking for the herb that cleaves all things says he But he
speaks so thickly so thickly And what your honour Ivan Ivanitch
do you want with the herb that cleaves all things The tomb weighs on
me it weighs on me Trofimitch I want to get awayaway

My word observed Fedya he didnt enjoy his life enough I suppose

What a marvel said Kosyta I thought one could only see the
departed on All Hallows day

One can see the departed any time Ilyusha interposed with
conviction From what I could observe I judged he knew the village
superstitions better than the others But on All Hallows day you
can see the living too those that is whose turn it is to die that
year You need only sit in the church porch and keep looking at the
road They will come by you along the road those that is who will
die that year Last year old Ulyana went to the porch

Well did she see anyone asked Kostya inquisitively

To be sure she did At first she sat a long long while and saw no
one and heard nothing  only it seemed as if some dog kept whining
and whining like this somewhere Suddenly she looks up a boy comes
along the road with only a shirt on She looked at him It was Ivashka
Fedosyev

He who died in the spring put in Fedya

Yes he He came along and never lifted up his head But Ulyana knew
him And then she looks again a woman came along She stared and
stared at her Ah God Almighty  it was herself coming along the
road Ulyana herself

Could it be herself asked Fedya

Yes by God herself

Well but she is not dead yet you know But the year is not over
yet And only look at her her life hangs on a thread

All were still again Pavel threw a handful of dry twigs on to the
fire They were soon charred by the suddenly leaping flame they
cracked and smoked and began to contract curling up their burning
ends Gleams of light in broken flashes glanced in all directions
especially upwards Suddenly a white dove flew straight into the bright
light fluttered round and round in terror bathed in the red glow and
disappeared with a whirr of its wings

Its lost its home I suppose remarked Pavel Now it will fly till
it gets somewhere where it can rest till dawn

Why Pavlusha said Kostya might it not be a just soul flying to
heaven

Pavel threw another handful of twigs on to the fire

Perhaps he said at last

But tell us please Pavlusha began Fedya what was seen in your
parts at Shalamovy at the heavenly portent

Footnote This is what the peasants call an eclipseAuthors Note

When the sun could not be seen Yes indeed

Were you frightened then

Yes and we werent the only ones Our master though he talked to us
beforehand and said there would be a heavenly portent yet when it got
dark they say he himself was frightened out of his wits And in the
houseserfs cottage the old woman directly it grew dark broke all
the dishes in the oven with the poker Who will eat now she said
the last day has come So the soup was all running about the place
And in the village there were such tales about among us that white
wolves would run over the earth and would eat men that a bird of prey
would pounce down on us and that they would even see Trishka

Footnote The popular belief in Trishka is probably derived from some
tradition of AntichristAuthors Note

What is Trishka asked Kostya

Why dont you know interrupted Ilyusha warmly Why brother where
have you been brought up not to know Trishka Youre a stayathome
oneeyed lot in your village really Trishka will be a marvellous man
who will come one day and he will be such a marvellous man that they
will never be able to catch him and never be able to do anything with
him he will be such a marvellous man The people will try to take him
for example they will come after him with sticks they will surround
him but he will blind their eyes so that they fall upon one another
They will put him in prison for example he will ask for a little
water to drink in a bowl they will bring him the bowl and he will
plunge into it and vanish from their sight They will put chains on
him but he will only clap his handsthey will fall off him So this
Trishka will go through villages and towns and this Trishka will be a
wily man he will lead astray Christs people  and they will be able
to do nothing to him He will be such a marvellous wily man

Well then continued Pavel in his deliberate voice thats what he
s like And so they expected him in our parts The old men declared
that directly the heavenly portent began Trishka would come So the
heavenly portent began All the people were scattered over the street
in the fields waiting to see what would happen Our place you know
is open country They look and suddenly down the mountainside from
the big village comes a man of some sort such a strange man with such
a wonderful head  that all scream Oy Trishka is coming Oy
Trishka is coming and all run in all directions Our elder crawled
into a ditch his wife stumbled on the doorboard and screamed with all
her might she terrified her yarddog so that he broke away from his
chain and over the hedge and into the forest and Kuzkas father
Dorofyitch ran into the oats lay down there and began to cry like a
quail Perhaps says he the Enemy the Destroyer of Souls will
spare the birds at least So they were all in such a scare But he
that was coming was our cooper Vavila he had bought himself a new
pitcher and had put the empty pitcher over his head

All the boys laughed and again there was a silence for a while as
often happens when people are talking in the open air I looked out
into the solemn majestic stillness of the night the dewy freshness of
late evening had been succeeded by the dry heat of midnight the
darkness still had long to lie in a soft curtain over the slumbering
fields there was still a long while left before the first whisperings
the first dewdrops of dawn There was no moon in the heavens it rose
late at that time Countless golden stars twinkling in rivalry seemed
all running softly towards the Milky Way and truly looking at them
you were almost conscious of the whirling neverresting motion of the
earth A strange harsh painful cry sounded twice together over
the river and a few moments later was repeated farther down

Kostya shuddered What was that

That was a herons cry replied Pavel tranquilly

A heron repeated Kostya And what was it Pavlusha I heard
yesterday evening he added after a short pause you perhaps will
know

What did you hear

I will tell you what I heard I was going from Stony Ridge to
Shashkino I went first through our walnut wood and then passed by a
little poolyou know where theres a sharp turn down to the
ravinethere is a waterpit there you know it is quite overgrown
with reeds so I went near this pit brothers and suddenly from this
came a sound of some one groaning and piteously so piteously oooo
oooo I was in such a fright my brothers it was late and the voice
was so miserable I felt as if I should cry myself What could that
have been eh

It was in that pit the thieves drowned Akim the forester last
summer observed Pavel so perhaps it was his soul lamenting

Oh dear really brothers replied Kostya opening wide his eyes
which were round enough before I did not know they had drowned Akim
in that pit Shouldnt I have been frightened if Id known

But they say there are little tiny frogs continued Pavel who cry
piteously like that

Frogs Oh no it was not frogs certainly not A heron again uttered
a cry above the river Ugh there it is Kostya cried involuntarily
it is just like a woodspirit shrieking

The woodspirit does not shriek it is dumb put in Ilyusha it only
claps its hands and rattles

And have you seen it then the woodspirit Fedya asked him
ironically

No I have not seen it and God preserve me from seeing it but others
have seen it Why one day it misled a peasant in our parts and led
him through the woods and all in a circle in one field He scarcely
got home till daylight

Well and did he see it

Yes He says it was a big big creature dark wrapped up just like a
tree you could not make it out well it seemed to hide away from the
moon and kept staring and staring with its great eyes and winking and
winking with them

Ugh exclaimed Fedya with a slight shiver and a shrug of the
shoulders pfoo

And how does such an unclean brood come to exist in the world said
Pavel its a wonder

Dont speak ill of it take care it will hear you said Ilyusha

Again there was a silence

Look look brothers suddenly came Vanyas childish voice look at
Gods little stars they are swarming like bees

He put his fresh little face out from under his rug leaned on his
little fist and slowly lifted up his large soft eyes The eyes of all
the boys were raised to the sky and they were not lowered quickly

Well Vanya began Fedya caressingly is your sister Anyutka well

Yes she is very well replied Vanya with a slight lisp

You ask her why doesnt she come to see us

I dont know

You tell her to come

Very well

Tell her I have a present for her

And a present for me too

Yes you too

Vanya sighed

No I dont want one Better give it to her she is so kind to us at
home

And Vanya laid his head down again on the ground Pavel got up and took
the empty pot in his hand

Where are you going Fedya asked him

To the river to get water I want some water to drink

The dogs got up and followed him

Take care you dont fall into the river Ilyusha cried after him

Why should he fall in said Fedya He will be careful

Yes he will be careful But all kinds of things happen he will stoop
over perhaps to draw the water and the waterspirit will clutch him
by the hand and drag him to him Then they will say The boy fell
into the water  Fell in indeed  There he has crept in among
the reeds he added listening

The reeds certainly shished as they call it among us as they were
parted

But is it true asked Kostya that crazy Akulina has been mad ever
since she fell into the water

Yes ever since How dreadful she is now But they say she was a
beauty before then The waterspirit bewitched her I suppose he did
not expect they would get her out so soon So down there at the bottom
he bewitched her

I had met this Akulina more than once Covered with rags fearfully
thin with face as black as a coal bleareyed and for ever grinning
she would stay whole hours in one place in the road stamping with her
feet pressing her fleshless hands to her breast and slowly shifting
from one leg to the other like a wild beast in a cage She understood
nothing that was said to her and only chuckled spasmodically from time
to time

But they say continued Kostya that Akulina threw herself into the
river because her lover had deceived her

Yes that was it

And do you remember Vasya added Kostya mournfully

What Vasya asked Fedya

Why the one who was drowned replied Kostya in this very river
Ah what a boy he was What a boy he was His mother Feklista how she
loved him her Vasya And she seemed to have a foreboding Feklista
did that harm would come to him from the water Sometimes when Vasya
went with us boys in the summer to bathe in the river she used to be
trembling all over The other women did not mind they passed by with
the pails and went on but Feklista put her pail down on the ground
and set to calling him Come back come back my little joy come
back my darling And no one knows how he was drowned He was playing
on the bank and his mother was there haymaking suddenly she hears as
though some one was blowing bubbles through the water and behold
there was only Vasyas little cap to be seen swimming on the water You
know since then Feklista has not been right in her mind she goes and
lies down at the place where he was drowned she lies down brothers
and sings a songyou remember Vasya was always singing a song like
thatso she sings it too and weeps and weeps and bitterly rails
against God

Here is Pavlusha coming said Fedya

Pavel came up to the fire with a full pot in his hand

Boys he began after a short silence something bad happened

Oh what asked Kostya hurriedly

I heard Vasyas voice

They all seemed to shudder

What do you mean what do you mean stammered Kostya

I dont know Only I went to stoop down to the water suddenly I hear
my name called in Vasyas voice as though it came from below water
Pavlusha Pavlusha come here I came away But I fetched the water
though

Ah God have mercy upon us said the boys crossing themselves

It was the waterspirit calling you Pavel said Fedya we were just
talking of Vasya

Ah its a bad omen said Ilyusha deliberately

Well never mind dont bother about it Pavel declared stoutly and
he sat down again no one can escape his fate

The boys were still It was clear that Pavels words had produced a
strong impression on them They began to lie down before the fire as
though preparing to go to sleep

What is that asked Kostya suddenly lifting his head

Pavel listened

Its the curlews flying and whistling

Where are they flying to

To a land where they say there is no winter

But is there such a land

Yes

Is it far away

Far far away beyond the warm seas

Kostya sighed and shut his eyes

More than three hours had passed since I first came across the boys
The moon at last had risen I did not notice it at first it was such a
tiny crescent This moonless night was as solemn and hushed as it had
been at first But already many stars that not long before had been
high up in the heavens were setting over the earths dark rim
everything around was perfectly still as it is only still towards
morning all was sleeping the deep unbroken sleep that comes before
daybreak Already the fragrance in the air was fainter once more a dew
seemed falling How short are nights in summer The boys talk
died down when the fires did The dogs even were dozing the horses so
far as I could make out in the hardlyperceptible faintly shining
light of the stars were asleep with downcast heads I fell into a
state of weary unconsciousness which passed into sleep

A fresh breeze passed over my face I opened my eyes the morning was
beginning The dawn had not yet flushed the sky but already it was
growing light in the east Everything had become visible though dimly
visible around The pale grey sky was growing light and cold and
bluish the stars twinkled with a dimmer light or disappeared the
earth was wet the leaves covered with dew and from the distance came
sounds of life and voices and a light morning breeze went fluttering
over the earth My body responded to it with a faint shudder of
delight I got up quickly and went to the boys They were all sleeping
as though they were tired out round the smouldering fire only Pavel
half rose and gazed intently at me

I nodded to him and walked homewards beside the misty river Before I
had walked two miles already all around me over the wide dewdrenched
prairie and in front from forest to forest where the hills were
growing green again and behind over the long dusty road and the
sparkling bushes flushed with the red glow and the river faintly blue
now under the lifting mist flowed fresh streams of burning light
first pink then red and golden All things began to stir to
awaken to sing to flutter to speak On all sides thick drops of dew
sparkled in glittering diamonds to welcome me pure and clear as
though bathed in the freshness of morning came the notes of a bell
and suddenly there rushed by me driven by the boys I had parted from
the drove of horses refreshed and rested

Sad to say I must add that in that year Pavel met his end He was not
drowned he was killed by a fall from his horse Pity he was a
splendid fellow



                                   IX

                        KASSYAN OF FAIR SPRINGS


I was returning from hunting in a jolting little trap and overcome by
the stifling heat of a cloudy summer day it is well known that the
heat is often more insupportable on such days than in bright days
especially when there is no wind I dozed and was shaken about
resigning myself with sullen fortitude to being persecuted by the fine
white dust which was incessantly raised from the beaten road by the
warped and creaking wheels when suddenly my attention was aroused by
the extraordinary uneasiness and agitated movements of my coachman who
had till that instant been more soundly dozing than I He began tugging
at the reins moved uneasily on the box and started shouting to the
horses staring all the while in one direction I looked round We were
driving through a wide ploughed plain low hills also ploughed over
ran in gently sloping swelling waves over it the eye took in some
five miles of deserted country in the distance the roundscolloped
treetops of some small birchcopses were the only objects to break the
almost straight line of the horizon Narrow paths ran over the fields
disappeared into the hollows and wound round the hillocks On one of
these paths which happened to run into our road five hundred paces
ahead of us I made out a kind of procession At this my coachman was
looking

It was a funeral In front in a little cart harnessed with one horse
and advancing at a walking pace came the priest beside him sat the
deacon driving behind the cart four peasants bareheaded carried the
coffin covered with a white cloth two women followed the coffin The
shrill wailing voice of one of them suddenly reached my ears I
listened she was intoning a dirge Very dismal sounded this chanted
monotonous hopelesslysorrowful lament among the empty fields The
coachman whipped up the horses he wanted to get in front of this
procession To meet a corpse on the road is a bad omen And he did
succeed in galloping ahead beyond this path before the funeral had had
time to turn out of it into the highroad but we had hardly got a
hundred paces beyond this point when suddenly our trap jolted
violently heeled on one side and all but overturned The coachman
pulled up the galloping horses and spat with a gesture of his hand

What is it I asked

My coachman got down without speaking or hurrying himself

But what is it

The axle is broken  it caught fire he replied gloomily and he
suddenly arranged the collar on the offside horse with such
indignation that it was almost pushed over but it stood its ground
snorted shook itself and tranquilly began to scratch its foreleg
below the knee with its teeth

I got out and stood for some time on the road a prey to a vague and
unpleasant feeling of helplessness The right wheel was almost
completely bent in under the trap and it seemed to turn its
centrepiece upwards in dumb despair

What are we to do now I said at last

Thats whats the cause of it said my coachman pointing with his
whip to the funeral procession which had just turned into the highroad
and was approaching us I have always noticed that he went on its
a true sayingMeet a corpseyes indeed

And again he began worrying the offside horse who seeing his
illhumour resolved to remain perfectly quiet and contented itself
with discreetly switching its tail now and then I walked up and down a
little while and then stopped again before the wheel

Meanwhile the funeral had come up to us Quietly turning off the road
on to the grass the mournful procession moved slowly past us My
coachman and I took off our caps saluted the priest and exchanged
glances with the bearers They moved with difficulty under their
burden their broad chests standing out under the strain Of the two
women who followed the coffin one was very old and pale her set face
terribly distorted as it was by grief still kept an expression of
grave and severe dignity She walked in silence from time to time
lifting her wasted hand to her thin drawn lips The other a young
woman of fiveandtwenty had her eyes red and moist and her whole face
swollen with weeping as she passed us she ceased wailing and hid her
face in her sleeve But when the funeral had got round us and turned
again into the road her piteous heartpiercing lament began again My
coachman followed the measured swaying of the coffin with his eyes in
silence Then he turned to me

Its Martin the carpenter theyre burying he said Martin of
Ryaby

How do you know

I know by the women The old one is his mother and the young ones
his wife

Has he been ill then

Yes  fever The day before yesterday the overseer sent for the
doctor but they did not find the doctor at home He was a good
carpenter he drank a bit but he was a good carpenter See how upset
his good woman is But there womens tears dont cost much we
know Womens tears are only water  yes indeed

And he bent down crept under the sidehorses trace and seized the
wooden yoke that passes over the horses heads with both hands

Any way I observed what are we going to do

My coachman just supported himself with his knees on the shafthorses
shoulder twice gave the backstrap a shake and straightened the pad
then he crept out of the sidehorses trace again and giving it a blow
on the nose as he passed went up to the wheel He went up to it and
never taking his eyes off it slowly took out of the skirts of his coat
a box slowly pulled open its lid by a strap slowly thrust into it his
two fat fingers which pretty well filled it up rolled and rolled up
some snuff and creasing up his nose in anticipation helped himself to
it several times in succession accompanying the snufftaking every
time by a prolonged sneezing Then his streaming eyes blinking
faintly he relapsed into profound meditation

Well I said at last

My coachman thrust his box carefully into his pocket brought his hat
forward on to his brows without the aid of his hand by a movement of
his head and gloomily got up on the box

What are you doing I asked him somewhat bewildered

Pray be seated he replied calmly picking up the reins

But how can we go on

We will go on now

But the axle

Pray be seated

But the axle is broken

It is broken but we will get to the settlement  at a walking pace
of course Over here beyond the copse on the right is a settlement
they call it Yudino

And do you think we can get there

My coachman did not vouchsafe me a reply

I had better walk I said

As you like And he nourished his whip The horses started

We did succeed in getting to the settlement though the right front
wheel was almost off and turned in a very strange way On one hillock
it almost flew off but my coachman shouted in a voice of exasperation
and we descended it in safety

Yudino settlement consisted of six little lowpitched huts the walls
of which had already begun to warp out of the perpendicular though
they had certainly not been long built the backyards of some of the
huts were not even fenced in with a hedge As we drove into this
settlement we did not meet a single living soul there were no hens
even to be seen in the street and no dogs but one black croptailed
cur which at our approach leaped hurriedly out of a perfectly dry and
empty trough to which it must have been driven by thirst and at once
without barking rushed headlong under a gate I went up to the first
hut opened the door into the outer room and called for the master of
the house No one answered me I called once more the hungry mewing of
a cat sounded behind the other door I pushed it open with my foot a
thin cat ran up and down near me her green eyes glittering in the
dark I put my head into the room and looked round it was empty dark
and smoky I returned to the yard and there was no one there
either A calf lowed behind the paling a lame grey goose waddled a
little away I passed on to the second hut Not a soul in the second
hut either I went into the yard

In the very middle of the yard in the glaring sunlight there lay
with his face on the ground and a cloak thrown over his head a boy as
it seemed to me In a thatched shed a few paces from him a thin little
nag with broken harness was standing near a wretched little cart The
sunshine falling in streaks through the narrow cracks in the
dilapidated roof striped his shaggy reddishbrown coat in small bands
of light Above in the high birdhouse starlings were chattering and
looking down inquisitively from their airy home I went up to the
sleeping figure and began to awaken him

He lifted his head saw me and at once jumped up on to his feet
What what do you want what is it he muttered half asleep

I did not answer him at once I was so much impressed by his appearance

Picture to yourself a little creature of fifty years old with a little
round wrinkled face a sharp nose little scarcely visible brown
eyes and thick curly black hair which stood out on his tiny head like
the cap on the top of a mushroom His whole person was excessively thin
and weakly and it is absolutely impossible to translate into words the
extraordinary strangeness of his expression

What do you want he asked me again I explained to him what was the
matter he listened slowly blinking without taking his eyes off me

So cannot we get a new axle I said finally I will gladly pay for
it

But who are you Hunters eh he asked scanning me from head to foot

Hunters

You shoot the fowls of heaven I suppose the wild things of the
woods And is it not a sin to kill Gods birds to shed the innocent
blood

The strange old man spoke in a very drawling tone The sound of his
voice also astonished me There was none of the weakness of age to be
heard in it it was marvellously sweet young and almost feminine in
its softness

I have no axle he added after a brief silence That thing will not
suit you He pointed to his cart You have I expect a large trap

But can I get one in the village

Not much of a village here No one has an axle here And there
is no one at home either they are all at work You must go on he
announced suddenly and he lay down again on the ground

I had not at all expected this conclusion

Listen old man I said touching him on the shoulder do me a
kindness help me

Go on in Gods name I am tired I have driven into the town he
said and drew his cloak over his head

But pray do me a kindness I said I  I will pay for it I
dont want your money

But please old man

He half raised himself and sat up crossing his little legs

I could take you perhaps to the clearing Some merchants have bought
the forest hereGod be their judge They are cutting down the forest
and they have built a countinghouse thereGod be their judge You
might order an axle of them there or buy one ready made

Splendid I cried delighted splendid let us go

An oak axle a good one he continued not getting up from his place

And is it far to this clearing

Three miles

Come then we can drive there in your trap

Oh no

Come let us go I said let us go old man The coachman is waiting
for us in the road

The old man rose unwillingly and followed me into the street We found
my coachman in an irritable frame of mind he had tried to water his
horses but the water in the well it appeared was scanty in quantity
and bad in taste and water is the first consideration with
coachmen However he grinned at the sight of the old man nodded
his head and cried Hallo Kassyanushka good health to you

Good health to you Erofay upright man replied Kassyan in a
dejected voice

I at once made known his suggestion to the coachman Erofay expressed
his approval of it and drove into the yard While he was busy
deliberately unharnessing the horses the old man stood leaning with
his shoulders against the gate and looking disconsolately first at him
and then at me He seemed in some uncertainty of mind he was not very
pleased as it seemed to me at our sudden visit

So they have transported you too Erofay asked him suddenly lifting
the wooden arch of the harness

Yes

Ugh said my coachman between his teeth You know Martin the
carpenter Of course you know Martin of Ryaby

Yes

Well he is dead We have just met his coffin

Kassyan shuddered

Dead he said and his head sank dejectedly

Yes he is dead Why didnt you cure him eh You know they say you
cure folks youre a doctor

My coachman was apparently laughing and jeering at the old man

And is this your trap pray he added with a shrug of his shoulders
in its direction

Yes

Well a trap  a fine trap he repeated and taking it by the
shafts almost turned it completely upside down A trap But what
will you drive in it to the clearing You cant harness our horses
in these shafts our horses are all too big

I dont know replied Kassyan what you are going to drive that
beast perhaps he added with a sigh

That broke in Erofay and going up to Kassyans nag he tapped it
disparagingly on the back with the third finger of his right hand
See he added contemptuously its asleep the scarecrow

I asked Erofay to harness it as quickly as he could I wanted to drive
myself with Kassyan to the clearing grouse are fond of such places
When the little cart was quite ready and I together with my dog had
been installed in the warped wicker body of it and Kassyan huddled up
into a little ball with still the same dejected expression on his
face had taken his seat in front Erofay came up to me and whispered
with an air of mystery

You did well your honour to drive with him He is such a queer
fellow hes cracked you know and his nickname is the Flea I dont
know how you managed to make him out

I tried to say to Erofay that so far Kassyan had seemed to me a very
sensible man but my coachman continued at once in the same voice

But you keep a lookout where he is driving you to And your honour
be pleased to choose the axle yourself be pleased to choose a sound
one Well Flea he added aloud could I get a bit of bread in
your house

Look about you may find some answered Kassyan He pulled the reins
and we rolled away

His little horse to my genuine astonishment did not go badly Kassyan
preserved an obstinate silence the whole way and made abrupt and
unwilling answers to my questions We quickly reached the clearing and
then made our way to the countinghouse a lofty cottage standing by
itself over a small gully which had been dammed up and converted into
a pool In this countinghouse I found two young merchants clerks
with snowwhite teeth sweet and soft eyes sweet and subtle words and
sweet and wily smiles I bought an axle of them and returned to the
clearing I thought that Kassyan would stay with the horse and await my
return but he suddenly came up to me

Are you going to shoot birds eh he said

Yes if I come across any

I will come with you Can I

Certainly certainly

So we went together The land cleared was about a mile in length I
must confess I watched Kassyan more than my dogs He had been aptly
called Flea His little black uncovered head though his hair
indeed was as good a covering as any cap seemed to flash hither and
thither among the bushes He walked extraordinarily swiftly and seemed
always hopping up and down as he moved he was for ever stooping down
to pick herbs of some kind thrusting them into his bosom muttering to
himself and constantly looking at me and my dog with such a strange
searching gaze Among low bushes and in clearings there are often
little grey birds which constantly flit from tree to tree and which
whistle as they dart away Kassyan mimicked them answered their calls
a young quail flew from between his feet chirruping and he chirruped
in imitation of him a lark began to fly down above him moving his
wings and singing melodiously Kassyan joined in his song He did not
speak to me at all

The weather was glorious even more so than before but the heat was no
less Over the clear sky the high thin clouds were hardly stirred
yellowishwhite like snow lying late in spring flat and drawn out
like rolledup sails Slowly but perceptibly their fringed edges soft
and fluffy as cottonwool changed at every moment they were melting
away even these clouds and no shadow fell from them I strolled about
the clearing for a long while with Kassyan Young shoots which had not
yet had time to grow more than a yard high surrounded the low
blackened stumps with their smooth slender stems and spongy funguses
with grey edgesthe same of which they make tinderclung to these
strawberry plants flung their rosy tendrils over them mushrooms
squatted close in groups The feet were constantly caught and entangled
in the long grass that was parched in the scorching sun the eyes were
dazzled on all sides by the glaring metallic glitter on the young
reddish leaves of the trees on all sides were the variegated blue
clusters of vetch the golden cups of bloodwort and the halflilac
halfyellow blossoms of the heartsease In some places near the
disused paths on which the tracks of wheels were marked by streaks on
the fine bright grass rose piles of wood blackened by wind and rain
laid in yardlengths there was a faint shadow cast from them in
slanting oblongs there was no other shade anywhere A light breeze
rose then sank again suddenly it would blow straight in the face and
seem to be rising everything would begin to rustle merrily to nod to
shake around one the supple tops of the ferns bow down gracefully and
one rejoices in it but at once it dies away again and all is at rest
once more Only the grasshoppers chirrup in chorus with frenzied
energy and wearisome is this unceasing sharp dry sound It is in
keeping with the persistent heat of midday it seems akin to it as
though evoked by it out of the glowing earth

Without having started one single covey we at last reached another
clearing There the aspentrees had only lately been felled and lay
stretched mournfully on the ground crushing the grass and small
undergrowth below them on some the leaves were still green though
they were already dead and hung limply from the motionless branches
on others they were crumpled and dried up Fresh goldenwhite chips lay
in heaps round the stumps that were covered with bright drops a
peculiar very pleasant pungent odour rose from them Farther away
nearer the wood sounded the dull blows of the axe and from time to
time bowing and spreading wide its arms a bushy tree fell slowly and
majestically to the ground

For a long time I did not come upon a single bird at last a corncrake
flew out of a thick clump of young oak across the wormwood springing up
round it I fired it turned over in the air and fell At the sound of
the shot Kassyan quickly covered his eyes with his hand and he did
not stir till I had reloaded the gun and picked up the bird When I had
moved farther on he went up to the place where the wounded bird had
fallen bent down to the grass on which some drops of blood were
sprinkled shook his head and looked in dismay at me I heard him
afterwards whispering A sin Ah yes its a sin

The heat forced us at last to go into the wood I flung myself down
under a high nutbush over which a slender young maple gracefully
stretched its light branches Kassyan sat down on the thick trunk of a
felled birchtree I looked at him The leaves faintly stirred
overhead and their thin greenish shadows crept softly to and fro over
his feeble body muffled in a dark coat and over his little face He
did not lift his head Bored by his silence I lay on my back and began
to admire the tranquil play of the tangled foliage on the background of
the bright far away sky A marvellously sweet occupation it is to lie
on ones back in a wood and gaze upwards You may fancy you are looking
into a bottomless sea that it stretches wide below you that the trees
are not rising out of the earth but like the roots of gigantic weeds
are droppingfalling straight down into those glassy limpid depths
the leaves on the trees are at one moment transparent as emeralds the
next they condense into golden almost black green Somewhere afar
off at the end of a slender twig a single leaf hangs motionless
against the blue patch of transparent sky and beside it another
trembles with the motion of a fish on the line as though moving of its
own will not shaken by the wind Round white clouds float calmly
across and calmly pass away like submarine islands and suddenly all
this ocean this shining ether these branches and leaves steeped in
sunlightall is rippling quivering in fleeting brilliance and a
fresh trembling whisper awakens like the tiny incessant plash of
suddenly stirred eddies One does not moveone looks and no word can
tell what peace what joy what sweetness reigns in the heart One
looks the deep pure blue stirs on ones lips a smile innocent as
itself like the clouds over the sky and as it were with them happy
memories pass in slow procession over the soul and still one fancies
ones gaze goes deeper and deeper and draws one with it up into that
peaceful shining immensity and that one cannot be brought back from
that height that depth

Master master cried Kassyan suddenly in his musical voice

I raised myself in surprise up till then he had scarcely replied to my
questions and now he suddenly addressed me of himself

What is it I asked

What did you kill the bird for he began looking me straight in the
face

What for Corncrake is game one can eat it

That was not what you killed it for master as though you were going
to eat it You killed it for amusement

Well you yourself I suppose eat geese or chickens

Those birds are provided by God for man but the corncrake is a wild
bird of the woods and not he alone many they are the wild things of
the woods and the fields and the wild things of the rivers and marshes
and moors flying on high or creeping below and a sin it is to slay
them let them live their allotted life upon the earth But for man
another food has been provided his food is other and other his
sustenance bread the good gift of God and the water of heaven and
the tame beasts that have come down to us from our fathers of old

I looked in astonishment at Kassyan His words flowed freely he did
not hesitate for a word he spoke with quiet inspiration and gentle
dignity sometimes closing his eyes

So is it sinful then to kill fish according to you I asked

Fishes have cold blood he replied with conviction The fish is a
dumb creature it knows neither fear nor rejoicing The fish is a
voiceless creature The fish does not feel the blood in it is not
living Blood he continued after a pause blood is a holy thing
Gods sun does not look upon blood it is hidden away from the light
 it is a great sin to bring blood into the light of day a great sin
and horror Ah a great sin

He sighed and his head drooped forward I looked I confess in
absolute amazement at the strange old man His language did not sound
like the language of a peasant the common people do not speak like
that nor those who aim at fine speaking His speech was meditative
grave and curious I had never heard anything like it

Tell me please Kassyan I began without taking my eyes off his
slightly flushed face what is your occupation

He did not answer my question at once His eyes strayed uneasily for an
instant

I live as the Lord commands he brought out at last and as for
occupationno I have no occupation Ive never been very clever from
a child I work when I can Im not much of a workmanhow should I be
I have no health my hands are awkward In the spring I catch
nightingales

You catch nightingales But didnt you tell me that we must not
touch any of the wild things of the woods and the fields and so on

We must not kill them of a certainty death will take its own without
that Look at Martin the carpenter Martin lived and his life was not
long but he died his wife now grieves for her husband for her little
children Neither for man nor beast is there any charm against
death Death does not hasten nor is there any escaping it but we must
not aid death And I do not kill nightingalesGod forbid I do not
catch them to harm them to spoil their lives but for the pleasure of
men for their comfort and delight

Do you go to Kursk to catch them

Yes I go to Kursk and farther too at times I pass nights in the
marshes or at the edge of the forests I am alone at night in the
fields in the thickets there the curlews call and the hares squeak
and the wild ducks lift up their voices I note them at evening at
morning I give ear to them at daybreak I cast my net over the
bushes There are nightingales that sing so pitifully sweet  yea
pitifully

And do you sell them

I give them to good people

And what are you doing now

What am I doing

Yes how are you employed

The old man was silent for a little

I am not employed at all I am a poor workman But I can read and
write

You can read

Yes I can read and write I learnt by the help of God and good
people

Have you a family

No not a family

How so Are they dead then

No but  I have never been lucky in life But all that is in Gods
hands we are all in Gods hands and a man should be righteousthat
is all Upright before God that is it

And you have no kindred

Yes  well

The old man was confused

Tell me please I began I heard my coachman ask you why you did
not cure Martin You cure disease

Your coachman is a righteous man Kassyan answered thoughtfully I
too am not without sin They call me a doctor Me a doctor indeed
And who can heal the sick That is all a gift from God But there are
 yes there are herbs and there are flowers they are of use of a
certainty There is plantain for instance a herb good for man there
is budmarigold too it is not sinful to speak of them they are holy
herbs of God Then there are others not so and they may be of use but
its a sin and to speak of them is a sin Still with prayer may
be And doubtless there are such words But who has faith shall
be saved he added dropping his voice

You did not give Martin anything I asked

I heard of it too late replied the old man But what of it Each
mans destiny is written from his birth The carpenter Martin was not
to live he was not to live upon the earth that was what it was No
when a man is not to live on the earth him the sunshine does not warm
like another and him the bread does not nourish and make strong it is
as though something is drawing him away Yes God rest his soul

Have you been settled long amongst us I asked him after a short
pause

Kassyan started

No not long four years In the old masters time we always lived in
our old houses but the trustees transported us Our old master was a
kind heart a man of peacethe Kingdom of Heaven be his The trustees
doubtless judged righteously

And where did you live before

At Fair Springs

Is it far from here

A hundred miles

Well were you better off there

Yes  yes there there was open country with rivers it was our
home here we are cramped and parched up Here we are strangers
There at home at Fair Springs you could get up on to a hilland ah
my God what a sight you could see Streams and plains and forests and
there was a church and then came plains beyond You could see far
very far Yes how far you could lookyou could look and look ah
yes Here doubtless the soil is better it is claygood fat clay as
the peasants say for me the corn grows well enough everywhere

Confess then old man you would like to visit your birthplace again

Yes I should like to see it Still all places are good I am a man
without kin without neighbours And after all do you gain much
pray by staying at home But behold as you walk and as you walk
he went on raising his voice the heart grows lighter of a truth
And the sun shines upon you and you are in the sight of God and the
singing comes more tunefully Here you lookwhat herb is growing you
look on ityou pick it Here water runs perhapsspring water a
source of pure holy water so you drink of ityou look on it too The
birds of heaven sing And beyond Kursk come the steppes that
steppescountry ah what a marvel what a delight for man what
freedom what a blessing of God And they go on folks tell even to
the warm seas where dwells the sweetvoiced bird the Hamayune and
from the trees the leaves fall not neither in autumn nor in winter
and apples grow of gold on silver branches and every man lives in
uprightness and content And I would go even there Have I journeyed
so little already I have been to Romyon and to Simbirsk the fair city
and even to Moscow of the golden domes I have been to Oka the good
nurse and to Tsna the dove and to our mother Volga and many folks
good Christians have I seen and noble cities I have visited Well
I would go thither  yes  and more too  and I am not the only
one I a poor sinner  many other Christians go in bastshoes
roaming over the world seeking truth yea For what is there at
home No righteousness in manits that

These last words Kassyan uttered quickly almost unintelligibly then
he said something more which I could not catch at all and such a
strange expression passed over his face that I involuntarily recalled
the epithet cracked He looked down cleared his throat and seemed
to come to himself again What sunshine he murmured in a low voice
It is a blessing oh Lord What warmth in the woods

He gave a movement of the shoulders and fell into silence With a vague
look round him he began softly to sing I could not catch all the words
of his slow chant I heard the following

             They call me Kassyan
               But my nicknames the Flea


Oh I thought so he improvises Suddenly he started and ceased
singing looking intently at a thick part of the wood I turned and saw
a little peasant girl about seven years old in a blue frock with a
checked handkerchief over her head and a woven barkbasket in her
little bare sunburnt hand She had certainly not expected to meet us
she had as they say stumbled upon us and she stood motionless in a
shady recess among the thick foliage of the nuttrees looking dismayed
at me with her black eyes I had scarcely time to catch a glimpse of
her she dived behind a tree

Annushka Annushka come here dont be afraid cried the old man
caressingly

Im afraid came her shrill voice

Dont be afraid dont be afraid come to me

Annushka left her hiding place in silence walked softly roundher
little childish feet scarcely sounded on the thick grassand came out
of the bushes near the old man She was not a child of seven as I had
fancied at first from her diminutive stature but a girl of thirteen
or fourteen Her whole person was small and thin but very neat and
graceful and her pretty little face was strikingly like Kassyans own
though he was certainly not handsome There were the same thin
features and the same strange expression shy and confiding
melancholy and shrewd and her gestures were the same Kassyan kept
his eyes fixed on her she took her stand at his side

Well have you picked any mushrooms he asked

Yes she answered with a shy smile

Did you find many

Yes She stole a swift look at him and smiled again

Are they white ones

Yes

Show me show me She slipped the basket off her arm and
halflifted the big burdock leaf which covered up the mushrooms Ah
said Kassyan bending down over the basket what splendid ones Well
done Annushka

Shes your daughter Kassyan isnt she I asked Annushkas face
flushed faintly

No well a relative replied Kassyan with affected indifference
Come Annushka run along he added at once run along and God be
with you And take care

But why should she go on foot I interrupted We could take her with
us

Annushka blushed like a poppy grasped the handle of her basket with
both hands and looked in trepidation at the old man

No she will get there all right he answered in the same languid and
indifferent voice Why not She will get there Run along

Annushka went rapidly away into the forest Kassyan looked after her
then looked down and smiled to himself In this prolonged smile in the
few words he had spoken to Annushka and in the very sound of his voice
when he spoke to her there was an intense indescribable love and
tenderness He looked again in the direction she had gone again smiled
to himself and passing his hand across his face he nodded his head
several times

Why did you send her away so soon I asked him I would have bought
her mushrooms

Well you can buy them there at home just the same sir if you like
he answered for the first time using the formal sir in addressing me

Shes very pretty your girl

No  only soso he answered with seeming reluctance and from
that instant he relapsed into the same uncommunicative mood as at first

Seeing that all my efforts to make him talk again were fruitless I
went off into the clearing Meantime the heat had somewhat abated but
my illsuccess or as they say among us my illluck continued and
I returned to the settlement with nothing but one corncrake and the new
axle Just as we were driving into the yard Kassyan suddenly turned to
me

Master master he began do you know I have done you a wrong it
was I cast a spell to keep all the game off

How so

Oh I can do that Here you have a welltrained dog and a good one
but he could do nothing When you think of it what are men what are
they Heres a beast what have they made of him

It would have been useless for me to try to convince Kassyan of the
impossibility of casting a spell on game and so I made him no reply
Meantime we had turned into the yard

Annushka was not in the hut she had had time to get there before us
and to leave her basket of mushrooms Erofay fitted in the new axle
first exposing it to a severe and most unjust criticism and an hour
later I set off leaving a small sum of money with Kassyan which at
first he was unwilling to accept but afterwards after a moments
thought holding it in his hand he put it in his bosom In the course
of this hour he had scarcely uttered a single word he stood as before
leaning against the gate He made no reply to the reproaches of my
coachman and took leave very coldly of me

Directly I turned round I could see that my worthy Erofay was in a
gloomy frame of mind To be sure he had found nothing to eat in the
country the only water for his horses was bad We drove off With
dissatisfaction expressed even in the back of his head he sat on the
box burning to begin to talk to me While waiting for me to begin by
some question he confined himself to a low muttering in an undertone
and some rather caustic instructions to the horses A village he
muttered call that a village You ask for a drop of kvasnot a drop
of kvas even Ah Lord And the watersimply filth He spat
loudly Not a cucumber nor kvas nor nothing Now then he
added aloud turning to the right tracehorse I know you you
humbug And he gave him a cut with the whip That horse has learnt
to shirk his work entirely and yet he was a willing beast once Now
thenlook alive

Tell me please Erofay I began what sort of a man is Kassyan

Erofay did not answer me at once he was in general a reflective and
deliberate fellow but I could see directly that my question was
soothing and cheering to him

The Flea he said at last gathering up the reins hes a queer
fellow yes a crazy chap such a queer fellow you wouldnt find
another like him in a hurry You know for example hes for all the
world like our roan horse here he gets out of everythingout of work
thats to say But then what sort of workman could he be Hes
hardly body enough to keep his soul in  but still of course
Hes been like that from a child up you know At first he followed his
uncles business as a carrierthere were three of them in the
business but then he got tired of it you knowhe threw it up He
began to live at home but he could not keep at home long hes so
restlessa regular flea in fact He happened by good luck to have a
good masterhe didnt worry him Well so ever since he has been
wandering about like a lost sheep And then hes so strange theres
no understanding him Sometimes hell be as silent as a post and then
hell begin talking and God knows what hell say Is that good
manners pray Hes an absurd fellow that he is But he sings well
for all that

And does he cure people really

Cure people Well how should he A fine sort of doctor Though he
did cure me of the kings evil I must own But how can he Hes a
stupid fellow thats what he is he added after a moments pause

Have you known him long

A long while I was his neighbour at Sitchovka up at Fair Springs

And what of that girlwho met us in the wood Annushkawhat relation
is she to him

Erofay looked at me over his shoulder and grinned all over his face

He he yes they are relations She is an orphan she has no
mother and its not even known who her mother was But she must be a
relation shes too much like him Anyway she lives with him Shes
a smart girl theres no denying a good girl and as for the old man
shes simply the apple of his eye shes a good girl And do you know
you wouldnt believe it but do you know hes managed to teach
Annushka to read Well well thats quite like him hes such an
extraordinary fellow such a changeable fellow theres no reckoning on
him really Eh eh eh My coachman suddenly interrupted himself
and stopping the horses he bent over on one side and began sniffing
Isnt there a smell of burning Yes Why that new axle I do
declare I thought Id greased it We must get on to some water
why here is a puddle just right

And Erofay slowly got off his seat untied the pail went to the pool
and coming back listened with a certain satisfaction to the hissing of
the box of the wheel as the water suddenly touched it Six times
during some eight miles he had to pour water on the smouldering axle
and it was quite evening when we got home at last



                                   X

                               THE AGENT


Twelve miles from my place lives an acquaintance of mine a landowner
and a retired officer in the GuardsArkady Pavlitch Pyenotchkin He
has a great deal of game on his estate a house built after the design
of a French architect and servants dressed after the English fashion
he gives capital dinners and a cordial reception to visitors and
with all that one goes to see him reluctantly He is a sensible and
practical man has received the excellent education now usual has been
in the service mixed in the highest society and is now devoting
himself to his estate with great success Arkady Pavlitch is to judge
by his own words severe but just he looks after the good of the
peasants under his control and punishes themfor their good One has
to treat them like children he says on such occasions their
ignorance mon cher il faut prendre cela en considration When
this socalled painful necessity arises he eschews all sharp or
violent gestures and prefers not to raise his voice but with a
straight blow in the culprits face says calmly I believe I asked
you to do something my friend or What is the matter my boy what
are you thinking about while he sets his teeth a little and the
corners of his mouth are drawn He is not tall but has an elegant
figure and is very goodlooking his hands and nails are kept
perfectly exquisite his rosy cheeks and lips are simply the picture of
health He has a ringing lighthearted laugh and there is sometimes a
very genial twinkle in his clear brown eyes He dresses in excellent
taste he orders French books prints and papers though hes no great
lover of reading himself he has hardly as much as waded through the
Wandering Jew He plays cards in masterly style Altogether Arkady
Pavlitch is reckoned one of the most cultivated gentlemen and most
eligible matches in our province the ladies are perfectly wild over
him and especially admire his manners He is wonderfully well
conducted wary as a cat and has never from his cradle been mixed up
in any scandal though he is fond of making his power felt
intimidating or snubbing a nervous man when he gets a chance He has a
positive distaste for doubtful societyhe is afraid of compromising
himself in his lighter moments however he will avow himself a
follower of Epicurus though as a rule he speaks slightingly of
philosophy calling it the foggy food fit for German brains or at
times simply rot He is fond of music too at the cardtable he is
given to humming through his teeth but with feeling he knows by heart
some snatches from Lucia and Somnambula but he is always apt to
sing everything a little sharp The winters he spends in Petersburg
His house is kept in extraordinarily good order the very grooms feel
his influence and every day not only rub the harness and brush their
coats but even wash their faces Arkady Pavlitchs houseserfs have
it is true something of a hangdog look but among us Russians theres
no knowing what is sullenness and what is sleepiness Arkady Pavlitch
speaks in a soft agreeable voice with emphasis and as it were with
satisfaction he brings out each word through his handsome perfumed
moustaches he uses a good many French expressions too such as Mais
cest impayable Mais comment donc and so so For all that I for
one am never overeager to visit him and if it were not for the
grouse and the partridges I should probably have dropped his
acquaintance altogether One is possessed by a strange sort of
uneasiness in his house the very comfort is distasteful to one and
every evening when a befrizzed valet makes his appearance in a blue
livery with heraldic buttons and begins with cringing servility
drawing off ones boots one feels that if his pale lean figure could
suddenly be replaced by the amazingly broad cheeks and incredibly thick
nose of a stalwart young labourer fresh from the plough who has yet
had time in his ten months of service to tear his new nankin coat open
at every seam one would be unutterably overjoyed and would gladly run
the risk of having ones whole leg pulled off with the boot

In spite of my aversion for Arkady Pavlitch I once happened to pass a
night in his house The next day I ordered my carriage to be ready
early in the morning but he would not let me start without a regular
breakfast in the English style and conducted me into his study With
our tea they served us cutlets boiled eggs butter honey cheese and
so on Two footmen in clean white gloves swiftly and silently
anticipated our faintest desires We sat on a Persian divan Arkady
Pavlitch was arrayed in loose silk trousers a black velvet smoking
jacket a red fez with a blue tassel and yellow Chinese slippers
without heels He drank his tea laughed scrutinised his fingernails
propped himself up with cushions and was altogether in an excellent
humour After making a hearty breakfast with obvious satisfaction
Arkady Pavlitch poured himself out a glass of red wine lifted it to
his lips and suddenly frowned

Why was not the wine warmed he asked rather sharply of one of the
footmen

The footman stood stockstill in confusion and turned white

Didnt I ask you a question my friend Arkady Pavlitch resumed
tranquilly never taking his eyes off the man

The luckless footman fidgeted in his place twisted the napkin and
uttered not a word

Arkady Pavlitch dropped his head and looked up at him thoughtfully from
under his eyelids

Pardon mon cher he observed patting my knee amicably and again
he stared at the footman You can go he added after a short
silence raising his eyebrows and he rang the bell

A stout swarthy blackhaired man with a low forehead and eyes
positively lost in fat came into the room

About Fyodor  make the necessary arrangements said Arkady
Pavlitch in an undertone and with complete composure

Yes sir answered the fat man and he went out

Voil mon cher les dsagrments de la campagne Arkady Pavlitch
remarked gaily But where are you off to Stop you must stay a
little

No I answered its time I was off

Nothing but sport Oh you sportsmen And where are you going to shoot
just now

Thirtyfive miles from here at Ryabovo

Ryabovo By Jove now in that case I will come with you Ryabovos
only four miles from my village Shipilovka and its a long while since
Ive been over to Shipilovka Ive never been able to get the time
Well this is a piece of luck you can spend the day shooting in
Ryabovo and come on in the evening to me Well have supper
togetherwell take the cook with us and youll stay the night with
me Capital capital he added without waiting for my answer

Cest arrang Hey you there Have the carriage brought out and
look sharp You have never been in Shipilovka I should be ashamed to
suggest your putting up for the night in my agents cottage but youre
not particular I know and at Ryabovo youd have slept in some
hayloft We will go we will go

And Arkady Pavlitch hummed some French song

You dont know I dare say he pursued swaying from side to side
Ive some peasants there who pay rent Its the custom of the
placewhat was I to do They pay their rent very punctually though I
should Ill own have put them back to payment in labour but theres
so little land I really wonder how they manage to make both ends meet
However cest leur affaire My agent theres a fine fellow une
forte tte a man of real administrative power You shall see
Really how luckily things have turned out

There was no help for it Instead of nine oclock in the morning we
started at two in the afternoon Sportsmen will sympathise with my
impatience Arkady Pavlitch liked as he expressed it to be
comfortable when he had the chance and he took with him such a supply
of linen dainties wearing apparel perfumes pillows and
dressingcases of all sorts that a careful and selfdenying German
would have found enough to last him for a year Every time we went down
a steep hill Arkady Pavlitch addressed some brief but powerful remarks
to the coachman from which I was able to deduce that my worthy friend
was a thorough coward The journey was however performed in safety
except that in crossing a latelyrepaired bridge the trap with the
cook in it broke down and he got squeezed in the stomach against the
hindwheel

Arkady Pavlitch was alarmed in earnest at the sight of the fall of
Karem his homemade professor of the culinary art and he sent at once
to inquire whether his hands were injured On receiving a reassuring
reply to this query his mind was set at rest immediately With all
this we were rather a long time on the road I was in the same
carriage as Arkady Pavlitch and towards the end of the journey I was a
prey to deadly boredom especially as in a few hours my companion ran
perfectly dry of subjects of conversation and even fell to expressing
his liberal views on politics At last we did arrivenot at Ryabovo
but at Shipilovka it happened so somehow I could have got no shooting
now that day in any case and so raging inwardly I submitted to my
fate

The cook had arrived a few minutes before us and apparently had had
time to arrange things and prepare those whom it concerned for on our
very entrance within the village boundaries we were met by the village
bailiff the agents son a stalwart redhaired peasant of seven
feet he was on horseback bareheaded and wearing a new overcoat not
buttoned up And wheres Sofron Arkady Pavlitch asked him The
bailiff first jumped nimbly off his horse bowed to his master till he
was bent double and said Good health to you Arkady Pavlitch sir
then raised his head shook himself and announced that Sofron had gone
to Perov but they had sent after him

Well come along after us said Arkady Pavlitch The bailiff
deferentially led his horse to one side clambered on to it and
followed the carriage at a trot his cap in his hand We drove through
the village A few peasants in empty carts happened to meet us they
were driving from the threshingfloor and singing songs swaying
backwards and forwards and swinging their legs in the air but at the
sight of our carriage and the bailiff they were suddenly silent took
off their winter caps it was summertime and got up as though waiting
for orders Arkady Pavlitch nodded to them graciously A flutter of
excitement had obviously spread through the hamlet Peasant women in
check petticoats flung splinters of wood at indiscreet or overzealous
dogs an old lame man with a beard that began just under his eyes
pulled a horse away from the well before it had drunk gave it for
some obscure reason a blow on the side and fell to bowing low Boys
in long smocks ran with a howl to the huts flung themselves on their
bellies on the high doorsills with their heads down and legs in the
air rolled over with the utmost haste into the dark outer rooms from
which they did not reappear again Even the hens sped in a hurried
scuttle to the turning one bold cock with a black throat like a satin
waistcoat and a red tail rumpled up to his very comb stood his ground
in the road and even prepared for a crow then suddenly took fright
and scuttled off too The agents cottage stood apart from the rest in
the middle of a thick green patch of hemp We stopped at the gates Mr
Pyenotchkin got up flung off his cloak with a picturesque motion and
got out of the carriage looking affably about him The agents wife
met us with low curtseys and came up to kiss the masters hand Arkady
Pavlitch let her kiss it to her hearts content and mounted the steps
In the outer room in a dark corner stood the bailiffs wife and she
too curtsied but did not venture to approach his hand In the cold
hut as it is calledto the right of the outer roomtwo other women
were still busily at work they were carrying out all the rubbish
empty tubs sheepskins stiff as boards greasy pots a cradle with a
heap of dishclouts and a baby covered with spots and sweeping out the
dirt with bathbrooms Arkady Pavlitch sent them away and installed
himself on a bench under the holy pictures The coachmen began bringing
in the trunks bags and other conveniences trying each time to subdue
the noise of their heavy boots

Meantime Arkady Pavlitch began questioning the bailiff about the crops
the sowing and other agricultural subjects The bailiff gave
satisfactory answers but spoke with a sort of heavy awkwardness as
though he were buttoning up his coat with benumbed fingers He stood at
the door and kept looking round on the watch to make way for the nimble
footman Behind his powerful shoulders I managed to get a glimpse of
the agents wife in the outer room surreptitiously belabouring some
other peasant woman Suddenly a cart rumbled up and stopped at the
steps the agent came in

This man as Arkady Pavlitch said of real administrative power was
short broadshouldered grey and thickset with a red nose little
blue eyes and a beard of the shape of a fan We may observe by the
way that ever since Russia has existed there has never yet been an
instance of a man who has grown rich and prosperous without a big
bushy beard sometimes a man may have had a thin wedgeshape beard all
his life but then he begins to get one all at once it is all round
his face like a haloone wonders where the hair has come from The
agent must have been making merry at Perov his face was unmistakably
flushed and there was a smell of spirits about him

Ah our father our gracious benefactor he began in a singsong
voice and with a face of such deep feeling that it seemed every minute
as if he would burst into tears at last you have graciously deigned
to come to us  your hand your honours hand he added his lips
protruded in anticipation Arkady Pavlitch gratified his desire Well
brother Sofron how are things going with you he asked in a friendly
voice

Ah you our father cried Sofron how should they go ill how
should things go ill now that you our father our benefactor
graciously deign to lighten our poor village with your presence to
make us happy till the day of our death Thank the Lord for thee
Arkady Pavlitch thank the Lord for thee All is right by your gracious
favour

At this point Sofron paused gazed upon his master and as though
carried away by a rush of feeling tipsiness had its share in it too
begged once more for his hand and whined more than before

Ah you our father benefactor  and  There God bless me Im a
regular fool with delight God bless me I look and cant believe my
eyes Ah our father

Arkady Pavlitch glanced at me smiled and asked Nestce pas que
cest touchant

But Arkady Pavlitch your honour resumed the indefatigable agent
what are you going to do Youll break my heart your honour your
honour didnt graciously let me know of your visit Where are you to
put up for the night You see here its dirty nasty

Nonsense Sofron nonsense Arkady Pavlitch responded with a smile
its all right here

But our father all rightfor whom For peasants like us its all
right but for you  oh our father our gracious protector oh you
 our father Pardon an old fool like me Im off my head bless
me Im gone clean crazy

Meanwhile supper was served Arkady Pavlitch began to eat The old man
packed his son off saying he smelt too strong

Well settled the division of land old chap hey enquired Mr
Pyenotchkin obviously trying to imitate the peasant speech with a
wink to me

Weve settled the land shares your honour all by your gracious
favour Day before yesterday the list was made out The Hlinovsky folks
made themselves disagreeable about it at first  they were
disagreeable about it certainly They wanted this  and they wanted
that  and God knows what they didnt want but theyre a set of
fools your honouran ignorant lot But we your honour graciously
please you gave an earnest of our gratitude and satisfied Nikolai
Nikolaitch the mediator we acted in everything according to your
orders your honour as you graciously ordered so we did and nothing
did we do unbeknown to Yegor Dmitritch

Yegor reported to me Arkady Pavlitch remarked with dignity

To be sure your honour Yegor Dmitritch to be sure

Well then now I suppose you re satisfied

Sofron had only been waiting for this

Ah you are our father our benefactor he began in the same
singsong as before Indeed now your honour  why for you our
father we pray day and night to God Almighty Theres too little
land of course

Pyenotchkin cut him short

There thatll do thatll do Sofron I know youre eager in my
service Well and how goes the threshing

Sofron sighed

Well our father the threshings none too good But there your
honour Arkady Pavlitch let me tell you about a little matter that
came to pass Here he came closer to Mr Pyenotchkin with his arms
apart bent down and screwed up one eye There was a dead body found
on our land

How was that

I cant think myself your honour it seems like the doing of the evil
one But luckily it was found near the boundary on our side of it
to tell the truth I ordered them to drag it on to the neighbours
strip of land at once while it was still possible and set a watch
there and sent word round to our folks Mums the word says I But
I explained how it was to the police officer in case of the worst You
see how it was says I and of course I had to treat him and slip some
notes into his hand Well what do you say your honour We shifted
the burden on to other shoulders you see a dead bodys a matter of two
hundred roubles as sure as ninepence

Mr Pyenotchkin laughed heartily at his agents cunning and said
several times to me indicating him with a nod Quel gaillard eh

Meantime it was quite dark out of doors Arkady Pavlitch ordered the
table to be cleared and hay to be brought in The valet spread out
sheets for us and arranged pillows we lay down Sofron retired after
receiving his instructions for the next day Arkady Pavlitch before
falling asleep talked a little more about the firstrate qualities of
the Russian peasant and at that point made the observation that since
Sofron had had the management of the place the Shipilovka peasants had
never been one farthing in arrears The watchman struck his board a
baby who apparently had not yet had time to be imbued with a sentiment
of dutiful selfabnegation began crying somewhere in the cottage 
we fell asleep

The next morning we got up rather early I was getting ready to start
for Ryabovo but Arkady Pavlitch was anxious to show me his estate and
begged me to remain I was not averse myself to seeing more of the
firstrate qualities of that man of administrative powerSofronin
their practical working The agent made his appearance He wore a blue
loose coat tied round the waist with a red handkerchief He talked
much less than on the previous evening kept an alert intent eye on
his masters face and gave connected and sensible answers We set off
with him to the threshingfloor Sofrons son the sevenfoot bailiff
by every external sign a very slowwitted fellow walked after us also
and we were joined farther on by the village constable Fedosyitch a
retired soldier with immense moustaches and an extraordinary
expression of face he looked as though he had had some startling shock
of astonishment a very long while ago and had never quite got over it
We took a look at the threshingfloor the barn the cornstacks the
outhouses the windmill the cattleshed the vegetables and the
hempfields everything was as a fact in excellent order only the
dejected faces of the peasants rather puzzled me Sofron had had an eye
to the ornamental as well as the useful he had planted all the ditches
with willows between the stacks he had made little paths to the
threshingfloor and strewn them with fine sand on the windmill he had
constructed a weathercock of the shape of a bear with his jaws open and
a red tongue sticking out he had attached to the brick cattleshed
something of the nature of a Greek facade and on it inscribed in white
letters Construt in the village Shipilovky  thousand eight Hunderd
farthieth year This cattleshed Arkady Pavlitch was quite touched
and fell to expatiating in French to me upon the advantages of the
system of rentpayment adding however that labourdues came more
profitable to the ownerbut after all that wasnt everything He
began giving the agent advice how to plant his potatoes how to prepare
cattlefood and so on Sofron heard his masters remarks out with
attention sometimes replied but did not now address Arkady Pavlitch
as his father or his benefactor and kept insisting that there was too
little land that it would be a good thing to buy more Well buy some
then said Arkady Pavlitch Ive no objection in my name of
course To this Sofron made no reply he merely stroked his beard
And now it would be as well to ride down to the copse observed Mr
Pyenotchkin Saddlehorses were led out to us at once we went off to
the copse or as they call it about us the enclosure In this
enclosure we found thick undergrowth and abundance of wild game for
which Arkady Pavlitch applauded Sofron and clapped him on the shoulder
In regard to forestry Arkady Pavlitch clung to the Russian ideas and
told me on that subject an amusingin his wordsanecdote of how a
jocose landowner had given his forester a good lesson by pulling out
nearly half his beard by way of a proof that growth is none the
thicker for being cut back In other matters however neither Sofron
nor Arkady Pavlitch objected to innovations On our return to the
village the agent took us to look at a winnowing machine he had
recently ordered from Moscow The winnowing machine did certainly work
beautifully but if Sofron had known what a disagreeable incident was
in store for him and his master on this last excursion he would
doubtless have stopped at home with us

This was what happened As we came out of the barn the following
spectacle confronted us A few paces from the door near a filthy pool
in which three ducks were splashing unconcernedly there stood two
peasantsone an old man of sixty the other a lad of twentyboth in
patched homespun shirts barefoot and with cord tied round their
waists for belts The village constable Fedosyitch was busily engaged
with them and would probably have succeeded in inducing them to retire
if we had lingered a little longer in the barn but catching sight of
us he grew stiff all over and seemed bereft of all sensation on the
spot Close by stood the bailiff gaping his fists hanging irresolute
Arkady Pavlitch frowned bit his lip and went up to the suppliants
They both prostrated themselves at his feet in silence

What do you want What are you asking about he inquired in a stern
voice a little through his nose The peasants glanced at one another
and did not utter a syllable only blinked a little as if the sun were
in their faces and their breathing came quicker

Well what is it Arkady Pavlitch said again and turning at once to
Sofron Of what family

The Tobolyev family the agent answered slowly

Well what do you want Mr Pyenotchkin said again have you lost
your tongues or what Tell me you what is it you want he added
with a nod at the old man And dont be afraid stupid

The old man craned forward his dark brown wrinkled neck opened his
bluish twitching lips and in a hoarse voice uttered the words
Protect us lord and again he bent his forehead to the earth The
young peasant prostrated himself too Arkady Pavlitch looked at their
bent necks with an air of dignity threw back his head and stood with
his legs rather wide apart What is it Whom do you complain of

Have mercy lord Let us breathe We are crushed worried
tormented to death quite The old man spoke with difficulty

Who worries you

Sofron Yakovlitch your honour

Arkady Pavlitch was silent a minute

Whats your name

Antip your honour

And whos this

My boy your honour

Arkady Pavlitch was silent again he pulled his moustaches

Well and how has he tormented you he began again looking over his
moustaches at the old man

Your honour he has ruined us utterly Two sons your honour hes
sent for recruits out of turn and now he is taking the third also
Yesterday your honour our last cow was taken from the yard and my
old wife was beaten by his worship here that is all the pity he has
for us He pointed to the bailiff

Hm commented Arkady Pavlitch

Let him not destroy us to the end gracious protector

Mr Pyenotchkin scowled Whats the meaning of this he asked the
agent in a low voice with an air of displeasure

Hes a drunken fellow sir answered the agent for the first time
using this deferential address and lazy too Hes never been out of
arrears this five years back sir

Sofron Yakovlitch paid the arrears for me your honour the old man
went on its the fifth years come that hes paid it hes paid
itand hes brought me into slavery to him your honour and here

And why did you get into arrears Mr Pyenotchkin asked
threateningly The old mans head sank Youre fond of drinking
hanging about the taverns I dare say The old man opened his mouth
to speak I know you Arkady Pavlitch went on emphatically you
think youve nothing to do but drink and lie on the stove and let
steady peasants answer for you

And hes an impudent fellow too the agent threw in

Thats sure to be so its always the way Ive noticed it more than
once The whole year round hes drinking and abusive and then he
falls at ones feet

Your honour Arkady Pavlitch the old man began despairingly have
pity protect us when have I been impudent Before God Almighty I
swear it was beyond my strength Sofron Yakovlitch has taken a dislike
to me for some reason he dislikes meGod be his judge He will ruin
me utterly your honour The last  here  the last boy  and
him he A tear glistened in the old mans wrinkled yellow eyes
Have pity gracious lord defend us

And its not us only the young peasant began

Arkady Pavlitch flew into a rage at once

And who asked your opinion hey Till youre spoken to hold your
tongue Whats the meaning of it Silence I tell you silence
Why upon my word this is simply mutiny No my friend I dont advise
you to mutiny on my domain  on my  Arkady Pavlitch stepped
forward but probably recollected my presence turned round and put
his hands in his pockets  Je vous demande bien pardon mon
cher he said with a forced smile dropping his voice significantly
Cest le mauvais ct de la mdaille  There thatll do thatll
do he went on not looking at the peasants I say  thatll do
you can go The peasants did not rise Well havent I told you 
thatll do You can go I tell you

Arkady Pavlitch turned his back on them Nothing but vexation he
muttered between his teeth and strode with long steps homewards
Sofron followed him The village constable opened his eyes wide
looking as if he were just about to take a tremendous leap into space
The bailiff drove a duck away from the puddle The suppliants remained
as they were a little then looked at each other and without turning
their heads went on their way

Two hours later I was at Ryabovo and making ready to begin shooting
accompanied by Anpadist a peasant I knew well Pyenotchkin had been
out of humour with Sofron up to the time I left I began talking to
Anpadist about the Shipilovka peasants and Mr Pyenotchkin and asked
him whether he knew the agent there

Sofron Yakovlitch  ugh

What sort of man is he

Hes not a man hes a dog you couldnt find another brute like him
between here and Kursk

Really

Why Shipilovkas hardly reckoned aswhats his nameMr
Pyenotchkins at all hes not the master there Sofrons the master

You dont say so

Hes master just as if it were his own The peasants all about are in
debt to him they work for him like slaves hell send one off with the
waggons another another way He harries them out of their lives

They havent much land I suppose

Not much land He rents two hundred acres from the Hlinovsky peasants
alone and two hundred and eighty from our folks theres more than
three hundred and seventyfive acres hes got And he doesnt only
traffic in land he does a trade in horses and stock and pitch and
butter and hemp and one thing and the other Hes sharp awfully
sharp and rich too the beast But whats badhe beats them Hes a
brute not a man a dog I tell you a cur a regular cur thats what
he is

How is it they dont make complaints of him

I dare say the masterd be pleased Theres no arrears so what does
he care Yes youd better he added after a brief pause I should
advise you to complain No hed let you know  yes youd better try
it on No hed let you know

I thought of Antip and told him what I had seen

There commented Anpadist he will eat him up now hell simply eat
the man up The bailiff will beat him now Such a poor unlucky chap
come to think of it And whats his offence He had some wrangle in
meeting with him the agent and he lost all patience I suppose and
of course he wouldnt stand it A great matter truly to make so
much of So he began pecking at him Antip Now hell eat him up
altogether You see hes such a dog Such a curGod forgive my
transgressionshe knows whom to fall upon The old men that are a bit
richer orve more children he doesnt touch the redheaded devil
but theres all the difference here Why hes sent Antips sons for
recruits out of turn the heartless ruffian the cur God forgive my
transgressions

We went on our way



                                   XI

                           THE COUNTINGHOUSE


It was autumn For some hours I had been strolling across country with
my gun and should probably not have returned till evening to the
tavern on the Kursk highroad where my threehorse trap was awaiting
me had not an exceedingly fine and persistent rain which had worried
me all day with the obstinacy and ruthlessness of some old maiden lady
driven me at last to seek at least a temporary shelter somewhere in the
neighbourhood While I was still deliberating in which direction to go
my eye suddenly fell on a low shanty near a field sown with peas I
went up to the shanty glanced under the thatched roof and saw an old
man so infirm that he reminded me at once of the dying goat Robinson
Crusoe found in some cave on his island The old man was squatting on
his heels his little dim eyes halfclosed while hurriedly but
carefully like a hare the poor fellow had not a single tooth he
munched a dry hard pea incessantly rolling it from side to side He
was so absorbed in this occupation that he did not notice my entrance

Grandfather hey grandfather said I He ceased munching lifted his
eyebrows high and with an effort opened his eyes

What he mumbled in a broken voice

Where is there a village near I asked

The old man fell to munching again He had not heard me I repeated my
question louder than before

A village But what do you want

Why shelter from the rain

What

Shelter from the rain

Ah He scratched his sunburnt neck Well now you go he said
suddenly waving his hands indefinitely so  as you go by the
copsesee as you gotherell be a road you pass it by and keep
right on to the right keep right on keep right on keep right on
Well there will be Ananyevo Or else youd go to Sitovka

I followed the old man with difficulty His moustaches muffled his
voice and his tongue too did not obey him readily

Where are you from I asked him

What

Where are you from

Ananyevo

What are you doing here

Im watchman

Why what are you watching

The peas

I could not help smiling

Reallyhow old are you

God knows

Your sights failing I expect

What

Your sights failing I daresay

Yes its failing At times I can hear nothing

Then how can you be a watchman eh

Oh my elders know about that

Elders I thought and I gazed not without compassion at the poor old
man He fumbled about pulled out of his bosom a bit of coarse bread
and began sucking it like a child with difficulty moving his sunken
cheeks

I walked in the direction of the copse turned to the right kept on
kept right on as the old man had advised me and at last got to a large
village with a stone church in the new style ie with columns and
a spacious manorhouse also with columns While still some way off I
noticed through the fine network of falling rain a cottage with a deal
roof and two chimneys higher than the others in all probability the
dwelling of the village elder and towards it I bent my steps in the
hope of finding in this cottage a samovar tea sugar and some not
absolutely sour cream Escorted by my halffrozen dog I went up the
steps into the outer room opened the door and instead of the usual
appurtenances of a cottage I saw several tables heaped up with
papers two red cupboards bespattered inkstands pewter boxes of
blotting sand weighing half a hundredweight long penholders and so
on At one of the tables was sitting a young man of twenty with a
swollen sickly face diminutive eyes a greasylooking forehead and
long straggling locks of hair He was dressed as one would expect in
a grey nankin coat shiny with wear at the waist and the collar

What do you want he asked me flinging his head up like a horse
taken unexpectedly by the nose

Does the bailiff live here or

This is the principal office of the manor he interrupted Im the
clerk on duty Didnt you see the signboard Thats what it was put
up for

Where could I dry my clothes here Is there a samovar anywhere in the
village

Samovars of course replied the young man in the grey coat with
dignity go to Father Timofeys or to the servants cottage or else
to Nazar Tarasitch or to Agrafena the poultrywoman

Who are you talking to you blockhead Cant you let me sleep dummy
shouted a voice from the next room

Heres a gentlemans come in to ask where he can dry himself

What sort of a gentleman

I dont know With a dog and a gun

A bedstead creaked in the next room The door opened and there came in
a stout short man of fifty with a bull neck goggleeyes
extraordinarily round cheeks and his whole face positively shining
with sleekness

What is it you wish he asked me

To dry my things

Theres no place here

I didnt know this was the countinghouse I am willing though to
pay

Well perhaps it could be managed here rejoined the fat man wont
you come inside here He led me into another room but not the one he
had come from Would this do for you

Very well And could I have tea and milk

Certainly at once If youll meantime take off your things and rest
the tea shall be got ready this minute

Whose property is this

Madame Losnyakovs Elena Nikolaevna

He went out I looked round against the partition separating my room
from the office stood a huge leather sofa two highbacked chairs also
covered in leather were placed on both sides of the solitary window
which looked out on the village street On the walls covered with a
green paper with pink patterns on it hung three immense oil paintings
One depicted a setterdog with a blue collar bearing the inscription
This is my consolation at the dogs feet flowed a river on the
opposite bank of the river a hare of quite disproportionate size with
ears cocked up was sitting under a pine tree In another picture two
old men were eating a melon behind the melon was visible in the
distance a Greek temple with the inscription The Temple of
Satisfaction The third picture represented the halfnude figure of a
woman in a recumbent position much foreshortened with red knees and
very big heels My dog had with superhuman efforts crouched under the
sofa and apparently found a great deal of dust there as he kept
sneezing violently I went to the window Boards had been laid across
the street in a slanting direction from the manorhouse to the
countinghousea very useful precaution as thanks to our rich black
soil and the persistent rain the mud was terrible In the grounds of
the manorhouse which stood with its back to the street there was the
constant going and coming there always is about manorhouses maids in
faded chintz gowns flitted to and fro houseserfs sauntered through
the mud stood still and scratched their spines meditatively the
constables horse tied up to a post lashed his tail lazily and with
his nose high up gnawed at the hedge hens were clucking sickly
turkeys kept up an incessant gobblegobble On the steps of a dark
crumbling outhouse probably the bathhouse sat a stalwart lad with a
guitar singing with some spirit the wellknown ballad

         Im leaving this enchanting spot
             To go into the desert

The fat man came into the room

Theyre bringing you in your tea he told me with an affable smile

The young man in the grey coat the clerk on duty laid on the old
cardtable a samovar a teapot a tumbler on a broken saucer a jug of
cream and a bunch of Bolhovo biscuit rings The fat man went out

What is he I asked the clerk the steward

No sir he was the chief cashier but now he has been promoted to be
headclerk

Havent you got a steward then

No sir Theres an agent Mihal Vikulov but no steward

Is there a manager then

Yes a German Lindamandol Karlo Karlitch only he does not manage
the estate

Who does manage it then

Our mistress herself

You dont say so And are there many of you in the office

The young man reflected

There are six of us

Who are they I inquired

Well first theres Vassily Nikolaevitch the head cashier then
Piotr one clerk Piotrs brother Ivan another clerk the other Ivan
a clerk Konstantin Narkizer another clerk and me heretheres a lot
of us you cant count all of them

I suppose your mistress has a great many serfs in her house

No not to say a great many

How many then

I dare say it runs up to about a hundred and fifty

We were both silent for a little

I suppose you write a good hand eh I began again

The young man grinned from ear to ear went into the office and brought
in a sheet covered with writing

This is my writing he announced still with the same smile on his
face

I looked at it on the square sheet of greyish paper there was written
in a good bold hand the following document

     ORDER

     From the Chief Office of the Manor of Ananyevo to
     the Agent Mihal Vikulov

     No 

Whereas some person unknown entered the garden at Ananyevo last night
in an intoxicated condition and with unseemly songs waked the French
governess Madame Engne and disturbed her and whether the watchmen
saw anything and who were on watch in the garden and permitted such
disorderliness as regards all the abovewritten matters your orders
are to investigate in detail and report immediately to the Office

                                     HeadClerk NIKOLAI HVOSTOV

A huge heraldic seal was attached to the order with the inscription
Seal of the chief office of the manor of Ananyevo and below stood
the signature To be executed exactly Elena Losnyakov

Your lady signed it herself eh I queried

To be sure she always signs herself Without that the order would be
of no effect

Well and now shall you send this order to the agent

No sir Hell come himself and read it Thats to say itll be read
to him you see hes no scholar The clerk on duty was silent again
for a while But what do you say he added simpering is it well
written

Very well written

It wasnt composed I must confess by me Konstantin is the great one
for that

What Do you mean the orders have first to be composed among you

Why how else could we do Couldnt write them off straight without
making a fair copy

And what salary do you get I inquired

Thirtyfive roubles and five roubles for boots

And are you satisfied

Of course I am satisfied Its not everyone can get into an office
like ours It was Gods will in my case to be sure Id an uncle who
was in service as a butler

And youre welloff

Yes sir Though to tell the truth he went on with a sigh a
place at a merchants for instance is better for the likes of us At
a merchants theyre very well off Yesterday evening a merchant came
to us from Venev and his man got talking to me Yes thats a good
place no doubt about it a very good place

Why Do the merchants pay more wages

Lord preserve us Why a merchant would soon give you the sack if you
asked him for wages No at a merchants you must live on trust and on
fear Hell give you food and drink and clothes and all If you give
him satisfaction hell do more Talk of wages indeed You dont
need them And a merchant too lives in plain Russian style like
ourselves you go with him on a journeyhe has tea and you have it
what he eats you eat A merchant  one can put up with a merchants
a very different thing from what a gentleman is a merchants not
whimsical if hes out of temper hell give you a blow and there it
ends He doesnt nag nor sneer But with a gentleman its a woeful
business Nothings as he likes itthis is not right and that he
cant fancy You hand him a glass of water or something to eat Ugh
the water stinks positively stinks You take it out stay a minute
outside the door and bring it back Come now thats good this
doesnt stink now And as for the ladies I tell you the ladies are
something beyond everything and the young ladies above all

Fedyushka came the fat mans voice from the office

The clerk went out quickly I drank a glass of tea lay down on the
sofa and fell asleep I slept for two hours

When I woke I meant to get up but I was overcome by laziness I
closed my eyes but did not fall asleep again On the other side of the
partition in the office they were talking in subdued voices
Unconsciously I began to listen

Quite so quite so Nikolai Eremyitch one voice was saying quite
so One cant but take that into account yes certainly Hm The
speaker coughed

You may believe me Gavrila Antonitch replied the fat mans voice
dont I know how things are done here Judge for yourself

Who does if you dont Nikolai Eremyitch youre one may say the
first person here Well then hows it to be pursued the voice I did
not recognise what decision are we to come to Nikolai Eremyitch
Allow me to put the question

What decision Gavrila Antonitch The thing depends so to say on
you you dont seem over anxious

Upon my word Nikolai Eremyitch what do you mean Our business is
trading buying its our business to buy Thats what we live by
Nikolai Eremyitch one may say

Eight roubles a measure said the fat man emphatically

A sigh was audible

Nikolai Eremyitch sir you ask a heavy price Impossible Gavrila
Antonitch to do otherwise I speak as before God Almighty impossible

Silence followed

I got up softly and looked through a crack in the partition The fat
man was sitting with his back to me Facing him sat a merchant a man
about forty lean and pale who looked as if he had been rubbed with
oil He was incessantly fingering his beard and very rapidly blinking
and twitching his lips

Wonderful the young green crops this year one may say he began
again Ive been going about everywhere admiring them All the way
from Voronezh theyve come up wonderfully firstclass one may say

The crops are pretty fair certainly answered the headclerk but
you know the saying Gavrila Antonitch autumn bids fair but spring
may be foul

Thats so indeed Nikolai Eremyitch all is in Gods hands its the
absolute truth what youve just remarked sir But perhaps your
visitors awake now

The fat man turned round  listened

No hes asleep He may though

He went to the door

No hes asleep he repeated and went back to his place

Well so what are we to say Nikolai Eremyitch the merchant began
again we must bring our little business to a conclusion Let it be
so Nikolai Eremyitch let it be so he went on blinking incessantly
two grey notes and a white for your favour and there he nodded in
the direction of the house six and a half Done eh

Four grey notes answered the clerk

Come three then

Four greys and no white

Three Nikolai Eremyitch

Three and a half and not a farthing less

Three Nikolai Eremyitch

Youre not talking sense Gavrila Antonitch

My what a pigheaded fellow muttered the merchant Then Id better
arrange it with the lady herself

Thats as you like answered the fat man far better I should say
Why should you worry yourself after all Much better indeed

Well well Nikolai Eremyitch I lost my temper for a minute That was
nothing but talk

No really why

Nonsense I tell you I tell you I was joking Well take your
three and a half theres no doing anything with you

I ought to have got four but I was in too great a hurrylike an
ass muttered the fat man

Then up there at the house six and a half Nikolai Eremyitch the
corn will be sold for six and a half

Six and a half as we said already

Well your hand on that then Nikolai Eremyitch the merchant clapped
his outstretched fingers into the clerks palm And goodbye in
Gods name The merchant got up So then Nikolai Eremyitch sir
Ill go now to your lady and bid them send up my name and so Ill say
to her Nikolai Eremyitch Ill say has made a bargain with me for
six and a half

Thats what you must say Gavrila Antonitch

And now allow me

The merchant handed the manager a small roll of notes bowed shook his
head picked up his hat with two fingers shrugged his shoulders and
with a sort of undulating motion went out his boots creaking after
the approved fashion Nikolai Eremyitch went to the wall and as far
as I could make out began sorting the notes handed him by the
merchant A red head adorned with thick whiskers was thrust in at the
door

Well asked the head all as it should be

Yes

How much

The fat man made an angry gesture with his hand and pointed to my room

Ah all right responded the head and vanished

The fat man went up to the table sat down opened a book took out a
reckoning frame and began shifting the beads to and fro as he counted
using not the forefinger but the third finger of his right hand which
has a much more showy effect

The clerk on duty came in

What is it

Sidor is here from Goloplek

Oh ask him in Wait a bit wait a bit First go and look whether
the strange gentlemans still asleep or whether he has waked up

The clerk on duty came cautiously into my room I laid my head on my
gamebag which served me as a pillow and closed my eyes

Hes asleep whispered the clerk on duty returning to the
countinghouse

The fat man muttered something

Well send Sidor in he said at last

I got up again A peasant of about thirty of huge stature came ina
redcheeked vigorouslooking fellow with brown hair and a short
curly beard He crossed himself praying to the holy image bowed to
the headclerk held his hat before him in both hands and stood erect

Good day Sidor said the fat man tapping with the reckoning beads

Goodday to you Nikolai Eremyitch

Well what are the roads like

Pretty fair Nikolai Eremyitch A bit muddy The peasant spoke
slowly and not loud

Wife quite well

Shes all right

The peasant gave a sigh and shifted one leg forward Nikolai Eremyitch
put his pen behind his ear and blew his nose

Well what have you come about he proceeded to inquire putting his
check handkerchief into his pocket

Why they do say Nikolai Eremyitch theyre asking for carpenters
from us

Well arent there any among you hey

To be sure there are Nikolai Eremyitch our place is right in the
woods our earnings are all from the wood to be sure But its the
busy time Nikolai Eremyitch Wheres the time to come from

The time to come from Busy time I dare say youre so eager to work
for outsiders and dont care to work for your mistress Its all
the same

The works all the same certainly Nikolai Eremyitch  but

Well

The pays  very

What next Youve been spoiled thats what it is Get along with you

And whats more Nikolai Eremyitch therell be only a weeks work
but theyll keep us hanging on a month One time theres not material
enough and another time theyll send us into the garden to weed the
path

What of it Our lady herself is pleased to give the order so its
useless you and me talking about it

Sidor was silent he began shifting from one leg to the other

Nikolai Eremyitch put his head on one side and began busily playing
with the reckoning beads

Our  peasants  Nikolai Eremyitch Sidor began at last
hesitating over each word sent word to your honour  there is 
see here He thrust his big hand into the bosom of his coat and
began to pull out a folded linen kerchief with a red border

What are you thinking of Goodness idiot are you out of your
senses the fat man interposed hurriedly Go on go to my cottage
he continued almost shoving the bewildered peasant out ask for my
wife there  shell give you some tea Ill be round directly go on
For goodness sake I tell you go on

Sidor went away

Ugh what a bear the head clerk muttered after him shaking his
head and set to work again on his reckoning frame

Suddenly shouts of Kuprya Kuprya theres no knocking down Kuprya
were heard in the street and on the steps and a little later there
came into the countinghouse a small man of sickly appearance with an
extraordinarily long nose and large staring eyes who carried himself
with a great air of superiority He was dressed in a ragged little old
surtout with a plush collar and diminutive buttons He carried a
bundle of firewood on his shoulder Five houseserfs were crowding
round him all shouting Kuprya theres no suppressing Kuprya
Kupryas been turned stoker Kupryas turned a stoker But the man in
the coat with the plush collar did not pay the slightest attention to
the uproar made by his companions and was not in the least out of
countenance With measured steps he went up to the stove flung down
his load straightened himself took out of his tailpocket a
snuffbox and with round eyes began helping himself to a pinch of dry
trefoil mixed with ashes At the entrance of this noisy party the fat
man had at first knitted his brows and risen from his seat but seeing
what it was he smiled and only told them not to shout Theres a
sportsman said he asleep in the next room What sort of
sportsman two of them asked with one voice

A gentleman

Ah

Let them make a row said the man with the plush collar waving his
arms what do I care so long as they dont touch me Theyve turned
me into a stoker

A stoker a stoker the others put in gleefully

Its the mistresss orders he went on with a shrug of his
shoulders but just you wait a bit  theyll turn you into
swineherds yet But Ive been a tailor and a good tailor too learnt
my trade in the best house in Moscow and worked for generals  and
nobody can take that from me And what have you to boast of What
youre a pack of idlers not worth your salt thats what you are Turn
me off I shant die of hunger I shall be all right give me a
passport Id send a good rent home and satisfy the masters But what
would you do Youd die off like flies thats what youd do

Thats a nice lie interposed a pockmarked lad with white eyelashes
a red cravat and ragged elbows You went off with a passport sharp
enough but never a halfpenny of rent did the masters see from you and
you never earned a farthing for yourself you just managed to crawl
home again and youve never had a new rag on you since

Ah well what could one do Konstantin Narkizitch responded Kuprya
a man falls in lovea mans ruined and done for You go through what
I have Konstantin Narkizitch before you blame me

And you picked out a nice one to fall in love witha regular fright

No you must not say that Konstantin Narkizitch

Whos going to believe that Ive seen her you know I saw her with
my own eyes last year in Moscow

Last year she had gone off a little certainly observed Kuprya

No gentlemen I tell you what a tall thin man with a face spotted
with pimples a valet probably from his frizzed and pomatumed head
remarked in a careless and disdainful voice let Kuprya Afanasyitch
sing us his song Come on now begin Kuprya Afanasyitch

Yes yes put in the others Hoorah for Alexandra Thats one for
Kuprya pon my soul  Sing away Kuprya Youre a regular brick
Alexandra Serfs often use feminine terminations in referring to a
man as an expression of endearment Sing away

This is not the place to sing Kuprya replied firmly this is the
manor countinghouse

And whats that to do with you youve got your eye on a place as
clerk eh answered Konstantin with a coarse laugh Thats what it
is

Everything rests with the mistress observed the poor wretch

There thats what hes got his eye on a fellow like him oo oo a

And they all roared some rolled about with merriment Louder than all
laughed a lad of fifteen probably the son of an aristocrat among the
houseserfs he wore a waistcoat with bronze buttons and a cravat of
lilac colour and had already had time to fill out his waistcoat

Come tell us confess now Kuprya Nikolai Eremyitch began
complacently obviously tickled and diverted himself is it bad being
stoker Is it an easy job eh

Nikolai Eremyitch began Kuprya youre headclerk among us now
certainly theres no disputing that no but you know you have been in
disgrace yourself and you too have lived in a peasants hut

Youd better look out and not forget yourself in my place the fat
man interrupted emphatically people joke with a fool like you you
ought you fool to have sense and be grateful to them for taking
notice of a fool like you

It was a slip of the tongue Nikolai Eremyitch I beg your pardon

Yes indeed a slip of the tongue

The door opened and a little page ran in

Nikolai Eremyitch mistress wants you

Whos with the mistress he asked the page

Aksinya Nikitishna and a merchant from Venev

Ill be there this minute And you mates he continued in a
persuasive voice better move off out of here with the newlyappointed
stoker if the German pops in hell make a complaint for certain

The fat man smoothed his hair coughed into his hand which was almost
completely hidden in his coatsleeve buttoned himself and set off
with rapid strides to see the lady of the manor In a little while the
whole party trailed out after him together with Kuprya My old friend
the clerkon duty was left alone He set to work mending the pens and
dropped asleep in his chair A few flies promptly seized the
opportunity and settled on his mouth A mosquito alighted on his
forehead and stretching its legs out with a regular motion slowly
buried its sting into his flabby flesh The same red head with whiskers
showed itself again at the door looked in looked again and then came
into the office together with the rather ugly body belonging to it

Fedyushka eh Fedyushka always asleep said the head

The clerk on duty opened his eyes and got up from his seat

Nikolai Eremyitch has gone to the mistress

Yes Vassily Nikolaevitch

Ah ah thought I this is he the head cashier

The head cashier began walking about the room He really slunk rather
than walked and altogether resembled a cat An old black frockcoat
with very narrow skirts hung about his shoulders he kept one hand in
his bosom while the other was for ever fumbling about his high narrow
horsehair collar and he turned his head with a certain effort He
wore noiseless kid boots and trod very softly

The landowner Yagushkin was asking for you today added the clerk
on duty

Hm asking for me What did he say

Said hed go to Tyutyurov this evening and would wait for you I want
to discuss some business with Vassily Nikolaevitch said he but what
the business was he didnt say Vassily Nikolaevitch will know says
he

Hm replied the head cashier and he went up to the window

Is Nikolai Eremyitch in the countinghouse a loud voice was heard
asking in the outer room and a tall man apparently angry with an
irregular but bold and expressive face and rather clean in his dress
stepped over the threshold

Isnt he here he inquired looking rapidly round

Nikolai Eremyitch is with the mistress responded the cashier Tell
me what you want Pavel Andreitch you can tell me What is it you
want

What do I want You want to know what I want The cashier gave a
sickly nod I want to give him a lesson the fat greasy villain the
scoundrelly telltale Ill give him a tale to tell

Pavel flung himself into a chair

What are you saying Pavel Andreitch Calm yourself Arent you
ashamed Dont forget whom youre talking about Pavel Andreitch
lisped the cashier

Forget whom Im talking about What do I care for his being made
headclerk A fine person theyve found to promote theres no denying
that Theyve let the goat loose in the kitchen garden you may say

Hush hush Pavel Andreitch hush drop that  what rubbish are you
talking

So Master Fox is beginning to fawn I will wait for him Pavel said
with passion and he struck a blow on the table Ah here hes
coming he added with a look at the window speak of the devil With
your kind permission He got up

Nikolai Eremyitch came into the countinghouse His face was shining
with satisfaction but he was rather taken aback at seeing Pavel
Andreitch

Good day to you Nikolai Eremyitch said Pavel in a significant tone
advancing deliberately to meet him

The headclerk made no reply The face of the merchant showed itself in
the doorway

What wont you deign to answer me pursued Pavel But no  no
he added thats not it theres no getting anything by shouting and
abuse No youd better tell me in a friendly way Nikolai Eremyitch
what do you persecute me for what do you want to ruin me for Come
speak speak

This is no fit place to come to an understanding with you the
headclerk answered in some agitation and no fit time But I must say
I wonder at one thing what makes you suppose I want to ruin you or
that Im persecuting you And if you come to that how can I persecute
you Youre not in my countinghouse

I should hope not answered Pavel that would be the last straw But
why are you humbugging Nikolai Eremyitch You understand me you
know

No I dont understand

No you do understand

No by God I dont understand

Swearing too Well tell us since its come to that have you no fear
of God Why cant you let the poor girl live in peace What do you want
of her

Whom are you talking of the fat man asked with feigned amazement

Ugh doesnt know what next Im talking of Tatyana Have some fear
of Godwhat do you want to revenge yourself for You ought to be
ashamed a married man like you with children as big as I am its a
very different thing with me I mean marriage Im acting
straightforwardly

How am I to blame in that Pavel Andreitch The mistress wont permit
you to marry its her seignorial will What have I to do with it

Why havent you been plotting with that old hag the housekeeper eh
Havent you been telling tales eh Tell me arent you bringing all
sorts of stories up against the defenceless girl I suppose its not
your doing that shes been degraded from laundrymaid to washing dishes
in the scullery And its not your doing that shes beaten and dressed
in sackcloth You ought to be ashamed you ought to be ashamedan
old man like you You know theres a paralytic stroke always hanging
over you You will have to answer to God

Youre abusive Pavel Andreitch youre abusive You shant have a
chance to be insolent much longer

Pavel fired up

What You dare to threaten me he said passionately You think Im
afraid of you No my man Im not come to that What have I to be
afraid of I can make my bread everywhere For you now its
another thing Its only here you can live and tell tales and
filch

Fancy the conceit of the fellow interrupted the clerk who was also
beginning to lose patience an apothecarys assistant simply an
apothecarys assistant a wretched leech and listen to himfie upon
you youre a high and mighty personage

Yes an apothecarys assistant and except for this apothecarys
assistant youd have been rotting in the graveyard by now It was
some devil drove me to cure him he added between his teeth

You cured me No you tried to poison me you dosed me with aloes
the clerk put in

What was I to do if nothing but aloes had any effect on you

The use of aloes is forbidden by the Board of Health pursued
Nikolai Ill lodge a complaint against you yet You tried to
compass my deaththat was what you did But the Lord suffered it not

Hush now thats enough gentlemen the cashier was beginning

Stand off bawled the clerk He tried to poison me Do you
understand that

Thats very likely Listen Nikolai Eremyitch Pavel began in
despairing accents For the last time I beg you You force me to
itcant stand it any longer Let us alone do you hear or else by
God itll go ill with one or other of usI mean with you

The fat man flew into a rage

Im not afraid of you he shouted do you hear milksop I got the
better of your father I broke his hornsa warning to you take care

Dont talk of my father Nikolai Eremyitch

Get away who are you to give me orders

I tell you dont talk of him

And I tell you dont forget yourself However necessary you think
yourself if our lady has a choice between us its not youll be kept
my dear Nones allowed to mutiny mind Pavel was shaking with
fury As for the wench Tatyana she deserves  wait a bit shell
get something worse

Pavel dashed forward with uplifted fists and the clerk rolled heavily
on the floor

Handcuff him handcuff him groaned Nikolai Eremyitch

I wont take upon myself to describe the end of this scene I fear I
have wounded the readers delicate susceptibilities as it is

The same day I returned home A week later I heard that Madame
Losnyakov had kept both Pavel and Nikolai in her service but had sent
away the girl Tatyana it appeared she was not wanted



                                   XII

                                 BIRYUK


I was coming back from hunting one evening alone in a racing droshky I
was six miles from home my good trotting mare galloped bravely along
the dusty road pricking up her ears with an occasional snort my weary
dog stuck close to the hindwheels as though he were fastened there A
tempest was coming on In front a huge purplish stormcloud slowly
rose from behind the forest long grey rainclouds flew over my head
and to meet me the willows stirred and whispered restlessly The
suffocating heat changed suddenly to a damp chilliness the darkness
rapidly thickened I gave the horse a lash with the reins descended a
steep slope pushed across a dry watercourse overgrown with brushwood
mounted the hill and drove into the forest The road ran before me
bending between thick hazel bushes now enveloped in darkness I
advanced with difficulty The droshky jumped up and down over the hard
roots of the ancient oaks and limes which were continually intersected
by deep rutsthe tracks of cart wheels my horse began to stumble A
violent wind suddenly began to roar overhead the trees blustered big
drops of rain fell with slow tap and splash on the leaves there came a
flash of lightning and a clap of thunder The rain fell in torrents I
went on a step or so and soon was forced to stop my horse foundered
I could not see an inch before me I managed to take refuge somehow in
a spreading bush Crouching down and covering my face I waited
patiently for the storm to blow over when suddenly in a flash of
lightning I saw a tall figure on the road I began to stare intently
in that directionthe figure seemed to have sprung out of the ground
near my droshky

Whos that inquired a ringing voice

Why who are you

Im the forester here

I mentioned my name

Oh I know Are you on your way home

Yes But you see in such a storm

Yes there is a storm replied the voice

A pale flash of lightning lit up the forester from head to foot a
brief crashing clap of thunder followed at once upon it The rain
lashed with redoubled force

It wont be over just directly the forester went on

Whats to be done

Ill take you to my hut if you like he said abruptly

That would be a service

Please to take your seat

He went up to the mares head took her by the bit and pulled her up
We set off I held on to the cushion of the droshky which rocked like
a boat on the sea and called my dog My poor mare splashed with
difficulty through the mud slipped and stumbled the forester hovered
before the shafts to right and to left like a ghost We drove rather a
long while at last my guide stopped Here we are home sir he
observed in a quiet voice The gate creaked some puppies barked a
welcome I raised my head and in a flash of lightning I made out a
small hut in the middle of a large yard fenced in with hurdles From
the one little window there was a dim light The forester led his horse
up to the steps and knocked at the door Coming coming we heard in
a little shrill voice there was the patter of bare feet the bolt
creaked and a girl of twelve in a little old smock tied round the
waist with list appeared in the doorway with a lantern in her hand

Show the gentleman a light he said to her and I will put your
droshky in the shed

The little girl glanced at me and went into the hut I followed her

The foresters hut consisted of one room smoky lowpitched and
empty without curtains or partition A tattered sheepskin hung on the
wall On the bench lay a singlebarrelled gun in the corner lay a heap
of rags two great pots stood near the oven A pine splinter was
burning on the table flickering up and dying down mournfully In the
very middle of the hut hung a cradle suspended from the end of a long
horizontal pole The little girl put out the lantern sat down on a
tiny stool and with her right hand began swinging the cradle while
with her left she attended to the smouldering pine splinter I looked
roundmy heart sank within me its not cheering to go into a
peasants hut at night The baby in the cradle breathed hard and fast

Are you all alone here I asked the little girl

Yes she uttered hardly audibly

Youre the foresters daughter

Yes she whispered

The door creaked and the forester bending his head stepped across
the threshold He lifted the lantern from the floor went up to the
table and lighted a candle

I dare say youre not used to the splinter light said he and he
shook back his curls

I looked at him Rarely has it been my fortune to behold such a comely
creature He was tall broadshouldered and in marvellous proportion
His powerful muscles stood out in strong relief under his wet homespun
shirt A curly black beard hid half of his stern and manly face small
brown eyes looked out boldly from under broad eyebrows which met in the
middle He stood before me his arms held lightly akimbo

I thanked him and asked his name

My names Foma he answered and my nicknames Biryuk ie
wolf Footnote The name Biryuk is used in the Orel province to
denote a solitary misanthropic manAuthors Note

Oh youre Biryuk

I looked with redoubled curiosity at him From my Yermola and others I
had often heard stories about the forester Biryuk whom all the
peasants of the surrounding districts feared as they feared fire
According to them there had never been such a master of his business in
the world before He wont let you carry off a handful of brushwood
hell drop upon you like a fall of snow whatever time it may be even
in the middle of the night and you neednt think of resisting
himhes strong and cunning as the devil And theres no getting
at him anyhow neither by brandy nor by money theres no snare hell
walk into More than once good folks have planned to put him out of the
world but noits never come off

That was how the neighbouring peasants spoke of Biryuk

So youre Biryuk I repeated Ive heard talk of you brother They
say you show no mercy to anyone

I do my duty he answered grimly its not right to eat the masters
bread for nothing

He took an axe from his girdle and began splitting splinters

Have you no wife I asked him

No he answered with a vigorous sweep of the axe

Shes dead I suppose

No  yes  shes dead he added and turned away I was silent
he raised his eyes and looked at me

She ran away with a travelling pedlar he brought out with a bitter
smile The little girl hung her head the baby waked up and began
crying the little girl went to the cradle There give it him said
Biryuk thrusting a dirty feedingbottle into her hand Him too she
abandoned he went on in an undertone pointing to the baby He went
up to the door stopped and turned round

A gentleman like you he began wouldnt care for our bread I dare
say and except bread Ive

Im not hungry

Well thats for you to say I would have heated the samovar but Ive
no tea Ill go and see how your horse is getting on

He went out and slammed the door I looked round again the hut struck
me as more melancholy than ever The bitter smell of stale smoke choked
my breathing unpleasantly The little girl did not stir from her place
and did not raise her eyes from time to time she jogged the cradle
and timidly pulled her slipping smock up on to shoulder her bare legs
hung motionless

Whats your name I asked her

Ulita she said her mournful little face drooping more than ever

The forester came in and sat down on the bench

The storm s passing over he observed after a brief silence if
you wish it I will guide you out of the forest

I got up Biryuk took his gun and examined the firepan

Whats that for I inquired

Theres mischief in the forest Theyre cutting a tree down on
Mares Ravine he added in reply to my look of inquiry

Could you hear it from here

I can hear it outside

We went out together The rain had ceased Heavy masses of stormcloud
were still huddled in the distance from time to time there were long
flashes of lightning but here and there overhead the dark blue sky was
already visible stars twinkled through the swiftly flying clouds The
outline of the trees drenched with rain and stirred by the wind
began to stand out in the darkness We listened The forester took off
his cap and bent his head Th  there he said suddenly and he
stretched out his hand see what a night hes pitched on I had heard
nothing but the rustle of the leaves Biryuk led the mare out of the
shed But perhaps he added aloud this way I shall miss him
Ill go with you  if you like Certainly he answered and he
backed the horse in again well catch him in a trice and then Ill
take you Lets be off We started Biryuk in front I following him
Heaven only knows how he found out his way but he only stopped once or
twice and then merely to listen to the strokes of the axe There he
muttered do you hear do you hear Why where Biryuk shrugged his
shoulders We went down into the ravine the wind was still for an
instant the rhythmical strokes reached my hearing distinctly Biryuk
glanced at me and shook his head We went farther through the wet
bracken and nettles A slow muffled crash was heard

Hes felled it muttered Biryuk Meantime the sky had grown clearer
and clearer there was a faint light in the forest We clambered at
last out of the ravine

Wait here a little the forester whispered to me He bent down and
raising his gun above his head vanished among the bushes I began
listening with strained attention Across the continual roar of the
wind faint sounds from close by reached me there was a cautious blow
of an axe on the brushwood the crash of wheels the snort of a
horse

Where are you off to Stop the iron voice of Biryuk thundered
suddenly Another voice was heard in a pitiful shriek like a trapped
hare A struggle was beginning

No no youve made a mistake Biryuk declared panting youre not
going to get off I rushed in the direction of the noise and ran
up to the scene of the conflict stumbling at every step A felled tree
lay on the ground and near it Biryuk was busily engaged holding the
thief down and binding his hands behind his back with a kerchief I
came closer Biryuk got up and set him on his feet I saw a peasant
drenched with rain in tatters and with a long dishevelled beard A
sorry little nag half covered with a stiff mat was standing by
together with a rough cart The forester did not utter a word the
peasant too was silent his head was shaking

Let him go I whispered in Biryuks ears Ill pay for the tree

Without a word Biryuk took the horse by the mane with his left hand in
his right he held the thief by the belt Now turn round you rat he
said grimly

The bit of an axe there take it muttered the peasant

No reason to lose it certainly said the forester and he picked up
the axe We started I walked behind The rain began sprinkling
again and soon fell in torrents With difficulty we made our way to
the hut Biryuk pushed the captured horse into the middle of the yard
led the peasant into the room loosened the knot in the kerchief and
made him sit down in a corner The little girl who had fallen asleep
near the oven jumped up and began staring at us in silent terror I
sat down on the locker

Ugh what a downpour remarked the forester you will have to wait
till its over Wont you lie down

Thanks

I would have shut him in the store loft on your honours account he
went on indicating the peasant but you see the bolt

Leave him here dont touch him I interrupted

The peasant stole a glance at me from under his brows I vowed inwardly
to set the poor wretch free come what might He sat without stirring
on the locker By the light of the lantern I could make out his worn
wrinkled face his overhanging yellow eyebrows his restless eyes his
thin limbs The little girl lay down on the floor just at his feet
and again dropped asleep Biryuk sat at the table his head in his
hands A cricket chirped in the corner  the rain pattered on the
roof and streamed down the windows we were all silent

Foma Kuzmitch said the peasant suddenly in a thick broken voice
Foma Kuzmitch

What is it

Let me go

Biryuk made no answer

Let me go  hunger drove me to it let me go

I know you retorted the forester severely your sets all
alikeall thieves

Let me go repeated the peasant Our manager  we re ruined
thats what it islet me go

Ruined indeed Nobody need steal

Let me go Foma Kuzmitch Dont destroy me Your manager you know
yourself will have no mercy on me thats what it is

Biryuk turned away The peasant was shivering as though he were in the
throes of fever His head was shaking and his breathing came in broken
gasps

Let me go he repeated with mournful desperation Let me go by God
let me go Ill pay see by God I will By God it was through
hunger the little ones are crying you know yourself Its hard for
us see

You neednt go stealing for all that

My little horse the peasant went on my poor little horse at least
 our only beast  let it go

I tell you I cant Im not a free man Im made responsible You
oughtnt to be spoilt either

Let me go Its through want Foma Kuzmitch wantand nothing
elselet me go

I know you

Oh let me go

Ugh whats the use of talking to you sit quiet or else youll catch
it Dont you see the gentleman hey

The poor wretch hung his head Biryuk yawned and laid his head on
the table The rain still persisted I was waiting to see what would
happen

Suddenly the peasant stood erect His eyes were glittering and his
face flushed dark red Come then here strike yourself here he
began his eyes puckering up and the corners of his mouth dropping
come cursed destroyer of mens souls drink Christian blood drink

The forester turned round

Im speaking to you Asiatic bloodsucker you

Are you drunk or what to set to being abusive began the forester
puzzled Are you out of your senses hey

Drunk not at your expense cursed destroyer of soulsbrute brute
brute

Ah youIll show you

Whats that to me Its all one Im done for what can I do without a
home Kill meits the same in the end whether its through hunger or
like thisits all one Ruin us allwife children  kill us all at
once But wait a bit well get at you

Biryuk got up

Kill me kill me the peasant went on in savage tones kill me
come come kill me The little girl jumped up hastily from the
ground and stared at him Kill me kill me

Silence thundered the forester and he took two steps forward

Stop Foma stop I shouted let him go Peace be with him

I wont be silent the luckless wretch went on Its all the
sameruin anywayyou destroyer of souls you brute youve not come
to ruin yet But wait a bit you wont have long to boast of
theyll wring your neck wait a bit

Biryuk clutched him by the shoulder I rushed to help the peasant

Dont touch him master the forester shouted to me

I should not have feared his threats and already had my fist in the
air but to my intense amazement with one pull he tugged the kerchief
off the peasants elbows took him by the scruff of the neck thrust
his cap over his eyes opened the door and shoved him out

Go to the devil with your horse he shouted after him but mind
next time

He came back into the hut and began rummaging in the corner

Well Biryuk I said at last youve astonished me I see youre a
splendid fellow

Oh stop that master he cut me short with an air of vexation
please dont speak of it But Id better see you on your way now he
added I suppose you wont wait for this little rain

In the yard there was the rattle of the wheels of the peasants cart

Hes off then he muttered but next time

Halfanhour later he parted from me at the edge of the wood



                                  XIII

                         TWO COUNTRY GENTLEMEN


I have already had the honour kind readers of introducing to you
several of my neighbours let me now seize a favourable opportunity it
is always a favourable opportunity with us writers to make known to
you two more gentlemen on whose lands I often used to go
shootingvery worthy wellintentioned persons who enjoy universal
esteem in several districts

First I will describe to you the retired Generalmajor Vyatcheslav
Ilarionovitch Hvalinsky Picture to yourselves a tall and once slender
man now inclined to corpulence but not in the least decrepit or even
elderly a man of ripe age in his very prime as they say It is true
the once regular and even now rather pleasing features of his face have
undergone some change his cheeks are flabby there are close wrinkles
like rays about his eyes a few teeth are not as Saadi according to
Pushkin used to say his light brown hairat least all that is left
of ithas assumed a purplish hue thanks to a composition bought at
the Romyon horsefair of a Jew who gave himself out as an Armenian but
Vyatcheslav Ilarionovitch has a smart walk and a ringing laugh jingles
his spurs and curls his moustaches and finally speaks of himself as an
old cavalry man whereas we all know that really old men never talk of
being old He usually wears a frockcoat buttoned up to the top a high
cravat starched collars and grey sprigged trousers of a military cut
he wears his hat tilted over his forehead leaving all the back of his
head exposed He is a goodnatured man but of rather curious notions
and principles For instance he can never treat noblemen of no wealth
or standing as equals When he talks to them he usually looks sideways
at them his cheek pressed hard against his stiff white collar and
suddenly he turns and silently fixes them with a clear stony stare
while he moves the whole skin of his head under his hair he even has a
way of his own in pronouncing many words he never says for instance
Thank you Pavel Vasilyitch or This way if you please Mihalo
Ivanitch but always Fanks Pal Asilitch or Is wy please Mil
Vanitch With persons of the lower grades of society his behaviour
is still more quaint he never looks at them at all and before making
known his desires to them or giving an order he repeats several times
in succession with a puzzled faraway air Whats your name
what whats your name with extraordinary sharp emphasis on the first
word which gives the phrase a rather close resemblance to the call of
a quail He is very fussy and terribly closefisted but manages his
land badly he had chosen as overseer on his estate a retired
quartermaster a Little Russian and a man of really exceptional
stupidity None of us though in the management of land has ever
surpassed a certain great Petersburg dignitary who having perceived
from the reports of his steward that the cornkilns in which the corn
was dried on his estate were often liable to catch fire whereby he
lost a great deal of grain gave the strictest orders that for the
future they should not put the sheaves in till the fire had been
completely put out This same great personage conceived the brilliant
idea of sowing his fields with poppies as the result of an apparently
simple calculation poppy being dearer than rye he argued it is
consequently more profitable to sow poppy He it was too who ordered
his women serfs to wear tiaras after a pattern bespoken from Moscow
and to this day the peasant women on his lands do actually wear the
tiaras only they wear them over their skullcaps But let us return
to Vyatcheslav Ilarionovitch Vyatcheslav Ilarionovitch is a devoted
admirer of the fair sex and directly he catches sight of a pretty
woman in the promenade of his district town he is promptly off in
pursuit but falls at once into a sort of limping gaitthat is the
remarkable feature of the case He is fond of playing cards but only
with people of a lower standing they toady him with Your Excellency
in every sentence while he can scold them and find fault to his
hearts content When he chances to play with the governor or any
official personage a marvellous change comes over him he is all nods
and smiles he looks them in the face he seems positively flowing with
honey He even loses without grumbling Vyatcheslav Ilarionovitch
does not read much when he is reading he incessantly works his
moustaches and eyebrows up and down as if a wave were passing from
below upwards over his face This undulatory motion in Vyatcheslav
Ilarionovitchs face is especially marked when before company of
course he happens to be reading the columns of the Journal des
Dbats In the assemblies of nobility he plays a rather important
part but on grounds of economy he declines the honourable dignity of
marshal Gentlemen he usually says to the noblemen who press that
office upon him and he speaks in a voice filled with condescension and
selfsufficiency much indebted for the honour but I have made up my
mind to consecrate my leisure to solitude And as he utters these
words he turns his head several times to right and to left and then
with a dignified air adjusts his chin and his cheek over his cravat
In his young days he served as adjutant to some very important person
whom he never speaks of except by his Christian name and patronymic
they do say he fulfilled other functions than those of an adjutant
that for instance in full parade getup buttoned up to the chin he
had to lather his chief in his bathbut one cant believe everything
one hears General Hvalinsky is not however fond of talking himself
about his career in the army which is certainly rather curious it
seems that he had never seen active service General Hvalinsky lives in
a small house alone he has never known the joys of married life and
consequently he still regards himself as a possible match and indeed a
very eligible one But he has a housekeeper a darkeyed darkbrowed
plump freshlooking woman of fiveandthirty with a moustache she
wears starched dresses even on weekdays and on Sundays puts on muslin
sleeves as well Vyatcheslav Ilarionovitch is at his best at the large
invitation dinners given by gentlemen of the neighbourhood in honour of
the governor and other dignitaries then he is one may say in his
natural element On these occasions he usually sits if not on the
governors right hand at least at no great distance from him at the
beginning of dinner he is more disposed to nurse his sense of personal
dignity and sitting back in his chair he loftily scans the necks and
standup collars of the guests without turning his head but towards
the end of the meal he unbends begins smiling in all directions he
had been all smiles for the governor from the first and sometimes
even proposes the toast in honour of the fair sex the ornament of our
planet as he says General Hvalinsky shows to advantage too at all
solemn public functions inspections assemblies and exhibitions no
one in church goes up for the benediction with such style Vyatcheslav
Ilarionovitchs servants are never noisy and clamorous on the breaking
up of assemblies or in crowded thoroughfares as they make a way for
him through the crowd or call his carriage they say in an agreeable
guttural baritone By your leave by your leave allow General
Hvalinsky to pass or Call for General Hvalinskys carriage 
Hvalinskys carriage is it must be admitted of a rather queer design
and the footmens liveries are rather threadbare that they are grey
with red facings it is hardly necessary to remark his horses too
have seen a good deal of hard service in their time but Vyatcheslav
Ilarionovitch has no pretensions to splendour and goes so far as to
think it beneath his rank to make an ostentation of wealth Hvalinsky
has no special gift of eloquence or possibly has no opportunity of
displaying his rhetorical powers as he has a particular aversion not
only for disputing but for discussion in general and assiduously
avoids long conversation of all sorts especially with young people
This was certainly judicious on his part the worst of having to do
with the younger generation is that they are so ready to forget the
proper respect and submission due to their superiors In the presence
of persons of high rank Hvalinsky is for the most part silent while
with persons of a lower rank whom to judge by appearances he despises
though he constantly associates with them his remarks are sharp and
abrupt expressions such as the following occurring incessantly
Thats a piece of folly what youre saying now or I feel myself
compelled sir to remind you or You ought to realise with whom you
are dealing and so on He is peculiarly dreaded by postmasters
officers of the local boards and superintendents of posting stations
He never entertains any one in his house and lives as the rumour
goes like a screw For all that hes an excellent country gentleman
An old soldier a disinterested fellow a man of principle vieux
grognard his neighbours say of him The provincial prosecutor alone
permits himself to smile when General Hvalinskys excellent and solid
qualities are referred to before himbut what will not envy drive men
to

However we will pass now to another landed proprietor

Mardary Apollonitch Stegunov has no sort of resemblance to Hvalinsky I
hardly think he has ever served under government in any capacity and
he has never been reckoned handsome Mardary Apollonitch is a little
fattish bald old man of a respectable corpulence with a double chin
and little soft hands He is very hospitable and jovial lives as the
saying is for his comfort summer and winter alike he wears a striped
wadded dressinggown Theres only one thing in which he is like
General Hvalinsky he too is a bachelor He owns five hundred souls
Mardary Apollonitchs interest in his estate is of a rather superficial
description not to be behind the age he ordered a threshingmachine
from Butenops in Moscow locked it up in a barn and then felt his
mind at rest on the subject Sometimes on a fine summer day he would
have out his racing droshky and drive off to his fields to look at
the crops and gather cornflowers Mardary Apollonitchs existence is
carried on in quite the old style His house is of an oldfashioned
construction in the hall there is of course a smell of kvas tallow
candles and leather close at hand on the right there is a sideboard
with pipes and towels in the diningroom family portraits flies a
great pot of geraniums and a squeaky piano in the drawingroom three
sofas three tables two lookingglasses and a wheezy clock of
tarnished enamel with engraved bronze hands in the study a table
piled up with papers and a bluishcoloured screen covered with
pictures cut out of various works of last century a bookcase full of
musty books spiders and black dust a puffy armchair an Italian
window a sealedup door into the garden Everything in short just
as it always is Mardary Apollonitch has a multitude of servants all
dressed in the oldfashioned style in long blue full coats with high
collars shortish pantaloons of a muddy hue and yellow waistcoats
They address visitors as father His estate is under the
superintendence of an agent a peasant with a beard that covers the
whole of his sheepskin his household is managed by a stingy wrinkled
old woman whose face is always tied up in a cinnamoncoloured
handkerchief In Mardary Apollonitchs stable there are thirty horses
of various kinds he drives out in a coach built on the estate that
weighs four tons He receives visitors very cordially and entertains
them sumptuously in other words thanks to the stupefying powers of
our national cookery he deprives them of all capacity for doing
anything but playing preference For his part he never does anything
and has even given up reading the Dreambook But there are a good
many of our landed gentry in Russia exactly like this It will be
asked What is my object in talking about him Well by way of
answering that question let me describe to you one of my visits at
Mardary Apollonitchs

I arrived one summer evening at seven oclock An evening service was
only just over the priest a young man apparently very timid and
only lately come from the seminary was sitting in the drawingroom
near the door on the extreme edge of a chair Mardary Apollonitch
received me as usual very cordially he was genuinely delighted to see
any visitor and indeed he was the most goodnatured of men altogether
The priest got up and took his hat

Wait a bit wait a bit father said Mardary Apollonitch not yet
leaving go of my hand dont go  I have sent for some vodka for
you

I never drink it sir the priest muttered in confusion blushing up
to his ears

What nonsense answered Mardary Apollonitch Mishka Yushka vodka
for the father

Yushka a tall thin old man of eighty came in with a glass of vodka
on a darkcoloured tray with a few patches of fleshcolour on it all
that was left of the original enamel

The priest began to decline

Come drink it up father no ceremony its too bad of you observed
the landowner reproachfully

The poor young man had to obey

There now father you may go

The priest took leave

There there thatll do get along with you

A capital fellow pursued Mardary Apollonitch looking after him I
like him very much theres only one thinghes young yet But how are
you my dear sir What have you been doing How are you Lets come
out on to the balconysuch a lovely evening

We went out on the balcony sat down and began to talk Mardary
Apollonitch glanced below and suddenly fell into a state of tremendous
excitement

Whose hens are those whose hens are those he shouted Whose are
those hens roaming about in the garden Whose are those hens How
many times Ive forbidden it How many times Ive spoken about it

Yushka ran out

What disorder protested Mardary Apollonitch its horrible

The unlucky hens two speckled and one white with a topknot as I still
remember went on stalking tranquilly about under the appletrees
occasionally giving vent to their feelings in a prolonged clucking
when suddenly Yushka bareheaded and stick in hand with three other
houseserfs of mature years flew at them simultaneously Then the fun
began The hens clucked flapped their wings hopped raised a
deafening cackle the houseserfs ran tripping up and tumbling over
their master shouted from the balcony like one possessed Catch em
catch em catch em catch em catch em catch em catch em

At last one servant succeeded in catching the hen with the topknot
tumbling upon her and at the very same moment a little girl of eleven
with dishevelled hair and a dry branch in her hand jumped over the
gardenfence from the village street

Ah we see now whose hens cried the landowner in triumph Theyre
Yermil the coachmans hens hes sent his Natalka to chase them
out He didnt send his Parasha no fear the landowner added in a
low voice with a significant snigger Hey Yushka let the hens alone
catch Natalka for me

But before the panting Yushka had time to reach the terrified little
girl the housekeeper suddenly appeared snatched her by the arm and
slapped her several times on the back

Thats it thats it cried the master tuttuttut And carry
off the hens Avdotya he added in a loud voice and he turned with a
beaming face to me that was a fine chase my dear sir heyIm in a
regular perspiration look

And Mardary Apollonitch went off into a series of chuckles

We remained on the balcony The evening was really exceptionally fine

Tea was served us

Tell me I began Mardary Apollonitch are those your peasants
huts out there on the highroad above the ravine

Yes  why do you ask

I wonder at you Mardary Apollonitch Its really sinful The huts
allotted to the peasants there are wretched cramped little hovels
there isnt a tree to be seen near them theres not a pond even
theres only one well and thats no good Could you really find no
other place to settle them And they say youre taking away the old
hempgrounds too

And what is one to do with this new division of the lands Mardary
Apollonitch made answer Do you know Ive this redivision quite on my
mind and I foresee no sort of good from it And as for my having taken
away the hempground and their not having dug any ponds or what
notas to that my dear sir I know my own business Im a plain
manI go on the old system To my ideas when a mans masterhes
master and when hes peasanthes peasant  Thats what I think
about it

To an argument so clear and convincing there was of course no answer

And besides he went on those peasants are a wretched lot theyre
in disgrace Particularly two families there why my late fatherGod
rest his soulcouldnt bear them positively couldnt bear them And
you know my precept is where the fathers a thief the sons a thief
say what you like Blood bloodoh thats the great thing

Meanwhile there was a perfect stillness in the air Only rarely there
came a gust of wind which as it sank for the last time near the
house brought to our ears the sound of rhythmically repeated blows
seeming to come from the stable Mardary Apollonitch was in the act of
lifting a saucer full of tea to his lips and was just inflating his
nostrils to sniff its fragranceno trueborn Russian as we all know
can drink his tea without this preliminarybut he stopped short
listened nodded his head sipped his tea and laying the saucer on the
table with the most goodnatured smile imaginable he murmured as
though involuntarily accompanying the blows Tchukitchukitchuk
Tchukitchuk

What is it I asked puzzled Oh by my order theyre punishing a
scamp of a fellow Do you happen to remember Vasya who waits at the
sideboard

Which Vasya

Why that waited on us at dinner just now He with the long whiskers

The fiercest indignation could not have stood against the clear mild
gaze of Mardary Apollonitch

What are you after young man what is it he said shaking his head
Am I a criminal or something that you stare at me like that Whom he
loveth he chasteneth you know that

A quarter of an hour later I had taken leave of Mardary Apollonitch As
I was driving through the village I caught sight of Vasya He was
walking down the village street cracking nuts I told the coachman to
stop the horses and called him up

Well my boy so theyve been punishing you today I said to him

How did you know answered Vasya

Your master told me

The master himself

What did he order you to be punished for

Oh I deserved it father I deserved it They dont punish for
trifles among us thats not the way with usno no Our masters not
like that our master  you wont find another master like him in all
the province

Drive on I said to the coachman There you have it old Russia I
mused on my homeward way



                                  XIV

                                LEBEDYAN


One of the principal advantages of hunting my dear readers consists
in its forcing you to be constantly moving from place to place which
is highly agreeable for a man of no occupation It is true that
sometimes especially in wet weather its not over pleasant to roam
over byroads to cut across country to stop every peasant you meet
with the question Hey my good man how are we to get to Mordovka
and at Mordovka to try to extract from a halfwitted peasant woman the
working population are all in the fields whether it is far to an inn
on the highroad and how to get to itand then when you have gone on
eight miles farther instead of an inn to come upon the deserted
village of Hudobubnova to the great amazement of a whole herd of pigs
who have been wallowing up to their ears in the black mud in the middle
of the village street without the slightest anticipation of ever being
disturbed There is no great joy either in having to cross planks that
dance under your feet to drop down into ravines to wade across boggy
streams it is not overpleasant to tramp twentyfour hours on end
through the sea of green that covers the highroads or which God
forbid stay for hours stuck in the mud before a striped milestone
with the figures  on one side and  on the other it is not wholly
pleasant to live for weeks together on eggs milk and the ryebread
patriots affect to be so fond of But there is ample compensation
for all these inconveniences and discomforts in pleasures and
advantages of another sort Let us come though to our story

After all I have said above there is no need to explain to the reader
how I happened five years ago to be at Lebedyan just in the very thick
of the horsefair We sportsmen may often set off on a fine morning
from our more or less ancestral roof in the full intention of
returning there the following evening and little by little still in
pursuit of snipe may get at last to the blessed banks of Petchora
Besides every lover of the gun and the dog is a passionate admirer of
the noblest animal in the world the horse And so I turned up at
Lebedyan stopped at the hotel changed my clothes and went out to the
fair The waiter a thin lanky youth of twenty had already informed
me in a sweet nasal tenor that his Excellency Prince N who
purchases the chargers of theregiment was staying at their house
that many other gentlemen had arrived that some gypsies were to sing
in the evenings and there was to be a performance of Pan Tvardovsky
at the theatre that the horses were fetching good prices and that
there was a fine show of them

In the market square there were endless rows of carts drawn up and
behind the carts horses of every possible kind racers studhorses
dray horses carthorses postinghacks and simple peasants nags
Some fat and sleek assorted by colours covered with striped
horsecloths and tied up short to high racks turned furtive glances
backward at the too familiar whips of their owners the horsedealers
private owners horses sent by noblemen of the steppes a hundred or
two hundred miles away in charge of some decrepit old coachman and two
or three headstrong stableboys shook their long necks stamped with
ennui and gnawed at the fences roan horses from Vyatka huddled
close to one another racehorses dapplegrey raven and sorrel with
large hindquarters flowing tails and shaggy legs stood in majestic
immobility like lions Connoisseurs stopped respectfully before them
The avenues formed by the rows of carts were thronged with people of
every class age and appearance horsedealers in long blue coats and
high caps with sly faces were on the lookout for purchasers
gypsies with staring eyes and curly heads strolled up and down like
uneasy spirits looking into the horses mouths lifting up a hoof or a
tail shouting swearing acting as gobetweens casting lots or
hanging about some army horsecontracter in a foragingcap and military
cloak with beaver collar A stalwart Cossack rode up and down on a
lanky gelding with the neck of a stag offering it for sale in one
lot that is saddle bridle and all Peasants in sheepskins torn at
the armpits were forcing their way despairingly through the crowd or
packing themselves by dozens into a cart harnessed to a horse which
was to be put to the test or somewhere on one side with the aid of
a wily gypsy they were bargaining till they were exhausted clasping
each others hands a hundred times over each still sticking to his
price while the subject of their dispute a wretched little jade
covered with a shrunken mat was blinking quite unmoved as though it
was no concern of hers And after all what difference did it make
to her who was to have the beating of her Broadbrowed landowners
with dyed moustaches and an expression of dignity on their faces in
Polish hats and cotton overcoats pulled halfon were talking
condescendingly with fat merchants in felt hats and green gloves
Officers of different regiments were crowding everywhere an
extraordinarily lanky cuirassier of German extraction was languidly
inquiring of a lame horsedealer what he expected to get for that
chestnut A fairhaired young hussar a boy of nineteen was choosing
a tracehorse to match a lean carriagehorse a postboy in a
lowcrowned hat with a peacocks feather twisted round it in a brown
coat and long leather gloves tied round the arm with narrow greenish
bands was looking for a shafthorse Coachmen were plaiting the
horses tails wetting their manes and giving respectful advice to
their masters Those who had completed a stroke of business were
hurrying to hotel or to tavern according to their class And all
the crowd were moving shouting bustling quarrelling and making it up
again swearing and laughing all up to their knees in the mud I
wanted to buy a set of three horses for my covered trap mine had begun
to show signs of breaking down I had found two but had not yet
succeeded in picking up a third After a hotel dinner which I cannot
bring myself to describe even Aeneas had discovered how painful it is
to dwell on sorrows past I repaired to a caf socalled which was
the evening resort of the purchasers of cavalry mounts horsebreeders
and other persons In the billiardroom which was plunged in grey
floods of tobacco smoke there were about twenty men Here were
freeandeasy young landowners in embroidered jackets and grey
trousers with long curling hair and little waxed moustaches staring
about them with gentlemanly insolence other noblemen in Cossack dress
with extraordinarily short necks and eyes lost in layers of fat were
snorting with distressing distinctness merchants sat a little apart on
the quivive as it is called officers were chatting freely among
themselves At the billiardtable was Prince N a young man of
twoandtwenty with a lively and rather contemptuous face in a coat
hanging open a red silk shirt and loose velvet pantaloons he was
playing with the exlieutenant Viktor Hlopakov

The exlieutenant Viktor Hlopakov a little thinnish dark man of
thirty with black hair brown eyes and a thick snub nose is a
diligent frequenter of elections and horsefairs He walks with a skip
and a hop waves his fat hands with a jovial swagger cocks his cap on
one side and tucks up the sleeves of his military coat showing the
blueblack cotton lining Mr Hlopakov knows how to gain the favour of
rich scapegraces from Petersburg smokes drinks and plays cards with
them calls them by their Christian names What they find to like in
him it is rather hard to comprehend He is not clever he is not
amusing he is not even a buffoon It is true they treat him with
friendly casualness as a goodnatured fellow but rather a fool they
chum with him for two or three weeks and then all of a sudden do not
recognise him in the street and he on his side too does not
recognise them The chief peculiarity of Lieutenant Hlopakov consists
in his continually for a year sometimes two at a time using in season
and out of season one expression which though not in the least
humorous for some reason or other makes everyone laugh Eight years
ago he used on every occasion to say Umble respecks and duty and
his patrons of that date used always to fall into fits of laughter and
make him repeat Umble respecks and duty then he began to adopt a
more complicated expression No thats too too kessksay and with
the same brilliant success two years later he had invented a fresh
saying Ne voo excite vooself pa man of sin sewn in a
sheepskin and so on And strange to say these as you see not
overwhelmingly witty phrases keep him in food and drink and clothes
He has run through his property ages ago and lives solely upon his
friends There is observe absolutely no other attraction about him
he can it is true smoke a hundred pipes of Zhukov tobacco in a day
and when he plays billiards throws his right leg higher than his head
and while taking aim shakes his cue affectedly but after all not
everyone has a fancy for these accomplishments He can drink too 
but in Russia it is hard to gain distinction as a drinker In short
his success is a complete riddle to me There is one thing perhaps
he is discreet he has no taste for washing dirty linen away from home
never speaks a word against anyone

Well I thought on seeing Hlopakov I wonder what his catchword is
now

The prince hit the white

Thirty love whined a consumptive marker with a dark face and blue
rings under his eyes

The prince sent the yellow with a crash into the farthest pocket

Ah a stoutish merchant sitting in the corner at a tottering little
onelegged table boomed approvingly from the depths of his chest and
immediately was overcome by confusion at his own presumption But
luckily no one noticed him He drew a long breath and stroked his
beard

Thirtysix love the marker shouted in a nasal voice

Well what do you say to that old man the prince asked Hlopakov

What rrrrakaliooon of course simply rrrrakaliooooon

The prince roared with laughter

What what Say it again

Rrrrrakaliooon repeated the exlieutenant complacently

So thats the catchword thought I

The prince sent the red into the pocket

Oh thats not the way prince thats not the way lisped a
fairhaired young officer with red eyes a tiny nose and a babyish
sleepy face You shouldnt play like that  you ought  not that
way

Eh the prince queried over his shoulder

You ought to have done it  in a triplet

Oh really muttered the prince

What do you say prince Shall we go this evening to hear the
gypsies the young man hurriedly went on in confusion Styoshka will
sing  Ilyushka

The prince vouchsafed no reply

Rrrrrakaliooon old boy said Hlopakov with a sly wink of his left
eye

And the prince exploded

Thirtynine to love sang out the marker

Love  just look Ill do the trick with that yellow  Hlopakov
fidgeting his cue in his hand took aim and missed

Eh rrrakalioon he cried with vexation

The prince laughed again

What what what

Your honour made a miss observed the marker Allow me to chalk the
cue Forty love

Yes gentlemen said the prince addressing the whole company and
not looking at any one in particular you know Verzhembitskaya must
be called before the curtain tonight

To be sure to be sure of course several voices cried in rivalry
amazingly flattered at the chance of answering the princes speech
Verzhembitskaya to be sure

Verzhembitskayas an excellent actress far superior to Sopnyakova
whined an ugly little man in the corner with moustaches and spectacles
Luckless wretch he was secretly sighing at Sopnyakovas feet and the
prince did not even vouchsafe him a look

Waiter hey a pipe a tall gentleman with regular features and a
most majestic mannerin fact with all the external symptoms of a
cardsharpermuttered into his cravat

A waiter ran for a pipe and when he came back announced to his
excellency that the groom Baklaga was asking for him

Ah tell him to wait a minute and take him some vodka

Yes sir

Baklaga as I was told afterwards was the name of a youthful
handsome and excessively depraved groom the prince loved him made
him presents of horses went out hunting with him spent whole nights
with him Now you would not know this same prince who was once a
rake and a scapegrace In what good odour he is now how
straightlaced how supercilious How devoted to the governmentand
above all so prudent and judicious

However the tobacco smoke had begun to make my eyes smart After
hearing Hlopakovs exclamation and the princes chuckle one last time
more I went off to my room where on a narrow hairstuffed sofa
pressed into hollows with a high curved back my man had already made
me up a bed

The next day I went out to look at the horses in the stables and began
with the famous horsedealer Sitnikovs I went through a gate into a
yard strewn with sand Before a wide open stabledoor stood the
horsedealer himselfa tall stout man no longer young in a hareskin
coat with a raised turnover collar Catching sight of me he moved
slowly to meet me held his cap in both hands above his head and in a
singsong voice brought out

Ah our respects to you Youd like to have a look at the horses may
be

Yes Ive come to look at the horses

And what sort of horses precisely I make bold to ask

Show me what you have

With pleasure

We went into the stable Some white pugdogs got up from the hay and
ran up to us wagging their tails and a longbearded old goat walked
away with an air of dissatisfaction three stableboys in strong but
greasy sheepskins bowed to us without speaking To right and to left
in horseboxes raised above the ground stood nearly thirty horses
groomed to perfection Pigeons fluttered cooing about the rafters

What now do you want a horse for for driving or for breeding
Sitnikov inquired of me

Oh Ill see both sorts

To be sure to be sure the horsedealer commented dwelling on each
syllable Petya show the gentleman Ermine

We came out into the yard

But wont you let them bring you a bench out of the hut You dont
want to sit down As you please

There was the thud of hoofs on the boards the crack of a whip and
Petya a swarthy fellow of forty marked by smallpox popped out of
the stable with a rather wellshaped grey stallion made it rear ran
twice round the yard with it and adroitly pulled it up at the right
place Ermine stretched himself snorted raised his tail shook his
head and looked sideways at me

A clever beast I thought

Give him his head give him his head said Sitniker and he stared at
me

What may you think of him he inquired at last

The horses not badthe hind legs arent quite sound

His legs are firstrate Sitnikov rejoined with an air of
conviction and his hindquarters  just look sir  broad as an
ovenyou could sleep up there His pasterns are long

Long mercy on us Start him Petya start him but at a trot a trot
 dont let him gallop

Again Petya ran round the yard with Ermine None of us spoke for a
little

There lead him back said Sitnikov and show us Falcon

Falcon a gaunt beast of Dutch extraction with sloping hindquarters
as black as a beetle turned out to be little better than Ermine He
was one of those beasts of whom fanciers will tell you that they go
chopping and mincing and dancing about meaning thereby that they
prance and throw out their forelegs to right and to left without
making much headway Middleaged merchants have a great fancy for such
horses their action recalls the swaggering gait of a smart waiter
they do well in single harness for an afterdinner drive with mincing
paces and curved neck they zealously draw a clumsy droshky laden with
an overfed coachman a depressed dyspeptic merchant and his lymphatic
wife in a blue silk mantle with a lilac handkerchief over her head
Falcon too I declined Sitnikov showed me several horses One at
last a dapplegrey beast of Voyakov breed took my fancy I could not
restrain my satisfaction and patted him on the withers Sitnikov at
once feigned absolute indifference

Well does he go well in harness I inquired They never speak of a
trotting horse as being driven

Oh yes answered the horsedealer carelessly

Can I see him

If you like certainly Hi Kuzya put Pursuer into the droshky

Kuzya the jockey a real master of horsemanship drove three times
past us up and down the street The horse went well without changing
its pace nor shambling it had a free action held its tail high and
covered the ground well

And what are you asking for him

Sitnikov asked an impossible price We began bargaining on the spot in
the street when suddenly a splendidlymatched team of three
postinghorses flew noisily round the corner and drew up sharply at the
gates before Sitnikovs house In the smart little sportsmans trap sat
Prince N beside him Hlopakov Baklaga was driving  and how he
drove He could have driven them through an earring the rascal The
bay tracehorses little keen blackeyed blacklegged beasts were
all impatience they kept rearinga whistle and off they would have
bolted The darkbay shafthorse stood firmly its neck arched like a
swans its breast forward its legs like arrows shaking its head and
proudly blinking They were splendid No one could desire a finer
turn out for an Easter procession

Your excellency please to come in cried Sitnikov

The prince leaped out of the trap Hlopakov slowly descended on the
other side

Good morning friend  any horses

You may be sure weve horses for your excellency Pray walk in
Petya bring out Peacock and let them get Favourite ready too And
with you sir he went on turning to me well settle matters
another time Fomka a bench for his excellency

From a special stable which I had not at first observed they led out
Peacock A powerful dark sorrel horse seemed to fly across the yard
with all its legs in the air Sitnikov even turned away his head and
winked

Oh rrakalion piped Hlopakov Zhaymsah jaime a

The prince laughed

Peacock was stopped with difficulty he dragged the stableboy about
the yard at last he was pushed against the wall He snorted started
and reared while Sitnikov still teased him brandishing a whip at him

What are you looking at there oo said the horsedealer with
caressing menace unable to refrain from admiring his horse himself

How much asked the prince

For your excellency five thousand

Three

Impossible your excellency upon my word

I tell you three rrakalion put in Hlopakov

I went away without staying to see the end of the bargaining At the
farthest corner of the street I noticed a large sheet of paper fixed on
the gate of a little grey house At the top there was a penandink
sketch of a horse with a tail of the shape of a pipe and an endless
neck and below his hoofs were the following words written in an
oldfashioned hand

Here are for sale horses of various colours brought to the Lebedyan
fair from the celebrated steppes stud of Anastasei Ivanitch Tchornobai
landowner of Tambov These horses are of excellent sort broken in to
perfection and free from vice Purchasers will kindly ask for
Anastasei Ivanitch himself should Anastasei Ivanitch be absent then
ask for Nazar Kubishkin the coachman Gentlemen about to purchase
kindly honour an old man

I stopped Come I thought lets have a look at the horses of the
celebrated steppes breeder Mr Tchornobai

I was about to go in at the gate but found that contrary to the
common usage it was locked I knocked

Whos there A customer whined a womans voice

Yes

Coming sir coming

The gate was opened I beheld a peasantwoman of fifty bareheaded in
boots and a sheepskin worn open

Please to come in kind sir and Ill go at once and tell Anastasei
Ivanitch  Nazar hey Nazar

What mumbled an old mans voice from the stable

Get a horse ready heres a customer

The old woman ran into the house

A customer a customer Nazar grumbled in response Ive not washed
all their tails yet

Oh Arcadia thought I

Good day sir pleased to see you I heard a rich pleasant voice
saying behind my back I looked round before me in a longskirted
blue coat stood an old man of medium height with white hair a
friendly smile and fine blue eyes

You want a little horse By all means my dear sir by all means
But wont you step in and drink just a cup of tea with me first

I declined and thanked him

Well well as you please You must excuse me my dear sir you see
Im oldfashioned Mr Tchornobai spoke with deliberation and in a
broad Doric Everything with me is done in a plain way you know
Nazar hey Nazar he added not raising his voice but prolonging
each syllable Nazar a wrinkled old man with a little hawk nose and a
wedgeshaped beard showed himself at the stable door

What sort of horses is it youre wanting my dear sir resumed Mr
Tchornobai

Not too expensive for driving in my covered gig

To be sure  we have got them to suit you to be sure Nazar
Nazar show the gentleman the grey gelding you know that stands at
the farthest corner and the sorrel with the star or else the other
sorrelfoal of Beauty you know

Nazar went back to the stable

And bring them out by their halters just as they are Mr Tchornobai
shouted after him You wont find things with me my good sir he
went on with a clear mild gaze into my face as they are with the
horsedealers confound their tricks There are drugs of all sorts go
in there salt and malted grains God forgive them But with me you
will see sir everythings aboveboard no underhandedness

The horses were led in I did not care for them

Well well take them back in Gods name said Anastasei Ivanitch
Show us the others

Others were shown At last I picked out one rather a cheap one We
began to haggle over the price Mr Tchornobai did not get excited he
spoke so reasonably with such dignity that I could not help
honouring the old man I gave him the earnestmoney

Well now observed Anastasei Ivanitch allow me to give over the
horse to you from hand to hand after the old fashion You will
thank me for him  as sound as a nut see  fresh  a true child
of the steppes Goes well in any harness

He crossed himself laid the skirt of his coat over his hand took the
halter and handed me the horse

Youre his master now with Gods blessing And you still wont
take a cup of tea

No I thank you heartily its time I was going home

Thats as you think best And shall my coachman lead the horse
after you

Yes now if you please

By all means my dear sir by all means Vassily hey Vassily
step along with the gentleman lead the horse and take the money for
him Well goodbye my good sir God bless you

Goodbye Anastasei Ivanitch

They led the horse home for me The next day he turned out to be
brokenwinded and lame I tried having him put in harness the horse
backed and if one gave him a flick with the whip he jibbed kicked
and positively lay down I set off at once to Mr Tchornobais I
inquired At home

Yes

Whats the meaning of this said I here youve sold me a
brokenwinded horse

Brokenwinded God forbid

Yes and hes lame too and vicious besides

Lame I know nothing about it your coachman must have illtreated him
somehow But before God I

Look here Anastasei Ivanitch as things stand you ought to take him
back

No my good sir dont put yourself in a passion once gone out of the
yard is done with You should have looked before sir

I understood what that meant accepted my fate laughed and walked
off Luckily I had not paid very dear for the lesson

Two days later I left and in a week I was again at Lebedyan on my way
home again In the caf I found almost the same persons and again I
came upon Prince N at billiards But the usual change in the
fortunes of Mr Hlopakov had taken place in this interval the
fairhaired young officer had supplanted him in the princes favours
The poor exlieutenant once more tried letting off his catchword in my
presence on the chance it might succeed as before but far from
smiling the prince positively scowled and shrugged his shoulders Mr
Hlopakov looked downcast shrank into a corner and began furtively
filling himself a pipe

Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenbergtm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone For forty years he produced and

volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the US unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
