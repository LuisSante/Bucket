THE DUCHESS AT PRAYER


Have you ever questioned the long shuttered front of an old Italian house
that motionless mask smooth mute equivocal as the face of a priest
behind which buzz the secrets of the confessional Other houses declare the
activities they shelter they are the clear expressive cuticle of a life
flowing close to the surface but the old palace in its narrow street the
villa on its cypresshooded hill are as impenetrable as death The tall
windows are like blind eyes the great door is a shut mouth Inside there
may be sunshine the scent of myrtles and a pulse of life through all the
arteries of the huge frame or a mortal solitude where bats lodge in the
disjointed stones and the keys rust in unused doors


II

From the loggia with its vanishing frescoes I looked down an avenue
barred by a ladder of cypressshadows to the ducal escutcheon and mutilated
vases of the gate Flat noon lay on the gardens on fountains porticoes
and grottoes Below the terrace where a chromecolored lichen had sheeted
the balustrade as with fine laminae of gold vineyards stooped to
the rich valley clasped in hills The lower slopes were strewn with white
villages like stars spangling a summer dusk and beyond these fold on
fold of blue mountain clear as gauze against the sky The August air was
lifeless but it seemed light and vivifying after the atmosphere of the
shrouded rooms through which I had been led Their chill was on me and I
hugged the sunshine

The Duchesss apartments are beyond said the old man

He was the oldest man I had ever seen so sucked back into the past that he
seemed more like a memory than a living being The one trait linking him
with the actual was the fixity with which his small saurian eye held the
pocket that as I entered had yielded a lira to the gatekeepers
child He went on without removing his eye

For two hundred years nothing has been changed in the apartments of the
Duchess

And no one lives here now

No one sir The Duke goes to Como for the summer season

I had moved to the other end of the loggia Below me through hanging
groves white roofs and domes flashed like a smile

And thats Vicenza

Proprio The old man extended fingers as lean as the hands fading
from the walls behind us You see the palace roof over there just to the
left of the Basilica The one with the row of statues like birds taking
flight Thats the Dukes town palace built by Palladio

And does the Duke come there

Never In winter he goes to Rome

And the palace and the villa are always closed

As you seealways

How long has this been

Since I can remember

I looked into his eyes they were like tarnished metal mirrors reflecting
nothing That must be a long time I said involuntarily

A long time he assented

I looked down on the gardens An opulence of dahlias overran the
boxborders between cypresses that cut the sunshine like basalt shafts
Bees hung above the lavender lizards sunned themselves on the benches and
slipped through the cracks of the dry basins Everywhere were vanishing
traces of that fantastic horticulture of which our dull age has lost the
art Down the alleys maimed statues stretched their arms like rows of
whining beggars fauneared terms grinned in the thickets and above the
laurustinus walls rose the mock ruin of a temple falling into real ruin
in the bright disintegrating air The glare was blinding

Let us go in I said

The old man pushed open a heavy door behind which the cold lurked like a
knife

The Duchesss apartments he said

Overhead and around us the same evanescent frescoes under foot the same
scagliola volutes unrolled themselves interminably Ebony cabinets with
inlay of precious marbles in cunning perspective alternated down the
room with the tarnished efflorescence of gilt consoles supporting Chinese
monsters and from the chimneypanel a gentleman in the Spanish habit
haughtily ignored us

Duke Ercole II the old man explained by the Genoese Priest

It was a narrowbrowed face sallow as a wax effigy highnosed and
cautiouslidded as though modelled by priestly hands the lips weak and
vain rather than cruel a quibbling mouth that would have snapped at verbal
errors like a lizard catching flies but had never learned the shape of a
round yes or no One of the Dukes hands rested on the head of a dwarf a
simian creature with pearl earrings and fantastic dress the other turned
the pages of a folio propped on a skull

Beyond is the Duchesss bedroom the old man reminded me

Here the shutters admitted but two narrow shafts of light gold bars
deepening the subaqueous gloom On a dais the bedstead grim nuptial
official lifted its baldachin a yellow Christ agonized between the
curtains and across the room a lady smiled at us from the chimneybreast

The old man unbarred a shutter and the light touched her face Such a face
it was with a flicker of laughter over it like the wind on a June meadow
and a singular tender pliancy of mien as though one of Tiepolos lenient
goddesses had been busked into the stiff sheath of a seventeenth century
dress

No one has slept here said the old man since the Duchess Violante

And she was

The lady therefirst Duchess of Duke Ercole II

He drew a key from his pocket and unlocked a door at the farther end of the
room The chapel he said This is the Duchesss balcony As I turned
to follow him the Duchess tossed me a sidelong smile

I stepped into a grated tribune above a chapel festooned with stucco
Pictures of bituminous saints mouldered between the pilasters the
artificial roses in the altarvases were gray with dust and age and under
the cobwebby rosettes of the vaulting a birds nest clung Before the altar
stood a row of tattered armchairs and I drew back at sight of a figure
kneeling near them

The Duchess the old man whispered By the Cavaliere Bernini

It was the image of a woman in furred robes and spreading fraise her hand
lifted her face addressed to the tabernacle There was a strangeness in
the sight of that immovable presence locked in prayer before an abandoned
shrine Her face was hidden and I wondered whether it were grief or
gratitude that raised her hands and drew her eyes to the altar where no
living prayer joined her marble invocation I followed my guide down the
tribune steps impatient to see what mystic version of such terrestrial
graces the ingenious artist had foundthe Cavaliere was master of such
arts The Duchesss attitude was one of transport as though heavenly airs
fluttered her laces and the lovelocks escaping from her coif I saw how
admirably the sculptor had caught the poise of her head the tender slope
of the shoulder then I crossed over and looked into her faceit was a
frozen horror Never have hate revolt and agony so possessed a human
countenance

The old man crossed himself and shuffled his feet on the marble

The Duchess Violante he repeated

The same as in the picture

Ehthe same

But the facewhat does it mean

He shrugged his shoulders and turned deaf eyes on me Then he shot a glance
round the sepulchral place clutched my sleeve and said close to my ear
It was not always so

What was not

The faceso terrible

The Duchesss face

The statues It changed after

After

It was put here

The statues face changed

He mistook my bewilderment for incredulity and his confidential finger
dropped from my sleeve Eh thats the story I tell what Ive heard What
do I know He resumed his senile shuffle across the marble This is a bad
place to stay inno one comes here Its too cold But the gentleman said
I must see everything

I let the lire sound So I mustand hear everything This story
nowfrom whom did you have it

His hand stole back One that saw it by God

That saw it

My grandmother then Im a very old man

Your grandmother Your grandmother was

The Duchesss serving girl with respect to you

Your grandmother Two hundred years ago

Is it too long ago Thats as God pleases I am a very old man and she
was a very old woman when I was born When she died she was as black as a
miraculous Virgin and her breath whistled like the wind in a keyhole She
told me the story when I was a little boy She told it to me out there in
the garden on a bench by the fishpond one summer night of the year she
died It must be true for I can show you the very bench we sat on


III

Noon lay heavier on the gardens not our live humming warmth but the stale
exhalation of dead summers The very statues seemed to drowse like watchers
by a deathbed Lizards shot out of the cracked soil like flames and the
bench in the laurustinusniche was strewn with the blue varnished bodies of
dead flies Before us lay the fishpond a yellow marble slab above rotting
secrets The villa looked across it composed as a dead face with the
cypresses flanking it for candles


IV

Impossible you say that my mothers mother should have been the
Duchesss maid What do I know It is so long since anything has happened
here that the old things seem nearer perhaps than to those who live in
cities But how else did she know about the statue then Answer me that
sir That she saw with her eyes I can swear to and never smiled again
so she told me till they put her first child in her arms  for she was
taken to wife by the stewards son Antonio the same who had carried
the letters But where am I Ah well  she was a mere slip you
understand my grandmother when the Duchess died a niece of the upper
maid Nencia and suffered about the Duchess because of her pranks and the
funny songs she knew Its possible you think she may have heard from
others what she afterward fancied she had seen herself How that is its
not for an unlettered man to say though indeed I myself seem to have seen
many of the things she told me This is a strange place No one comes here
nothing changes and the old memories stand up as distinct as the statues
in the garden

It began the summer after they came back from the Brenta Duke Ercole had
married the lady from Venice you must know it was a gay city then Im
told with laughter and music on the water and the days slipped by like
boats running with the tide Well to humor her he took her back the first
autumn to the Brenta Her father it appears had a grand palace there
with such gardens bowlingalleys grottoes and casinos as never were
gondolas bobbing at the watergates a stable full of gilt coaches a
theatre full of players and kitchens and offices full of cooks and
lackeys to serve up chocolate all day long to the fine ladies in masks
and furbelows with their pet dogs and their blackamoors and their
abates Eh I know it all as if Id been there for Nencia you see
my grandmothers aunt travelled with the Duchess and came back with her
eyes round as platters and not a word to say for the rest of the year to
any of the lads whod courted her here in Vicenza

What happened there I dont knowmy grandmother could never get at
the rights of it for Nencia was mute as a fish where her lady was
concernedbut when they came back to Vicenza the Duke ordered the villa
set in order and in the spring he brought the Duchess here and left her
She looked happy enough my grandmother said and seemed no object for
pity Perhaps after all it was better than being shut up in Vicenza
in the tall painted rooms where priests came and went as softly as cats
prowling for birds and the Duke was forever closeted in his library
talking with learned men The Duke was a scholar you noticed he was
painted with a book Well those that can read em make out that theyre
full of wonderful things as a man thats been to a fair across the
mountains will always tell his people at home it was beyond anything
theyll ever see As for the Duchess she was all for music
playacting and young company The Duke was a silent man stepping quietly
with his eyes down as though hed just come from confession when the
Duchesss lapdog yapped at his heels he danced like a man in a swarm of
hornets when the Duchess laughed he winced as if youd drawn a diamond
across a windowpane And the Duchess was always laughing

When she first came to the villa she was very busy laying out the gardens
designing grottoes planting groves and planning all manner of agreeable
surprises in the way of waterjets that drenched you unexpectedly and
hermits in caves and wild men that jumped at you out of thickets She had
a very pretty taste in such matters but after a while she tired of it and
there being no one for her to talk to but her maids and the chaplaina
clumsy man deep in his bookswhy she would have strolling players out
from Vicenza mountebanks and fortunetellers from the marketplace
travelling doctors and astrologers and all manner of trained animals
Still it could be seen that the poor lady pined for company and her
waiting women who loved her were glad when the Cavaliere Ascanio the
Dukes cousin came to live at the vineyard across the valleyyou see
the pinkish house over there in the mulberries with a red roof and a
pigeoncote

The Cavaliere Ascanio was a cadet of one of the great Venetian houses
pezzi grossi of the Golden Book He had been meant for the Church
I believe but what he set fighting above praying and cast in his lot with
the captain of the Duke of Mantuas bravi himself a Venetian of
good standing but a little at odds with the law Well the next I know
the Cavaliere was in Venice again perhaps not in good odor on account of
his connection with the gentleman I speak of Some say he tried to carry
off a nun from the convent of Santa Croce how that may be I cant say but
my grandmother declared he had enemies there and the end of it was that on
some pretext or other the Ten banished him to Vicenza There of course
the Duke being his kinsman had to show him a civil face and that was how
he first came to the villa

He was a fine young man beautiful as a Saint Sebastian a rare musician
who sang his own songs to the lute in a way that used to make my
grandmothers heart melt and run through her body like mulled wine He
had a good word for everybody too and was always dressed in the French
fashion and smelt as sweet as a beanfield and every soul about the place
welcomed the sight of him

Well the Duchess it seemed welcomed it too youth will have youth
and laughter turns to laughter and the two matched each other like the
candlesticks on an altar The Duchessyouve seen her portraitbut to
hear my grandmother sir it no more approached her than a weed comes up to
a rose The Cavaliere indeed as became a poet paragoned her in his song
to all the pagan goddesses of antiquity and doubtless these were finer
to look at than mere women but so it seemed was she for to believe
my grandmother she made other women look no more than the big French
fashiondoll that used to be shown on Ascension days in the Piazza She
was one at any rate that needed no outlandish finery to beautify her
whatever dress she wore became her as feathers fit the bird and her hair
didnt get its color by bleaching on the housetop It glittered of itself
like the threads in an Easter chasuble and her skin was whiter than fine
wheaten bread and her mouth as sweet as a ripe fig

Well sir you could no more keep them apart than the bees and the
lavender They were always together singing bowling playing cup and
ball walking in the gardens visiting the aviaries and petting her graces
trickdogs and monkeys The Duchess was as gay as a foal always playing
pranks and laughing tricking out her animals like comedians disguising
herself as a peasant or a nun you should have seen her one day pass
herself off to the chaplain as a mendicant sister or teaching the lads
and girls of the vineyards to dance and sing madrigals together The
Cavaliere had a singular ingenuity in planning such entertainments and the
days were hardly long enough for their diversions But toward the end of
the summer the Duchess fell quiet and would hear only sad music and the
two sat much together in the gazebo at the end of the garden It was there
the Duke found them one day when he drove out from Vicenza in his gilt
coach He came but once or twice a year to the villa and it was as my
grandmother said just a part of her poor ladys illluck to be wearing
that day the Venetian habit which uncovered the shoulders in a way the
Duke always scowled at and her curls loose and powdered with gold Well
the three drank chocolate in the gazebo and what happened no one knew
except that the Duke on taking leave gave his cousin a seat in his
carriage but the Cavaliere never returned

Winter approaching and the poor lady thus finding herself once more
alone it was surmised among her women that she must fall into a deeper
depression of spirits But far from this being the case she displayed such
cheerfulness and equanimity of humor that my grandmother for one was
halfvexed with her for giving no more thought to the poor young man who
all this time was eating his heart out in the house across the valley It
is true she quitted her goldlaced gowns and wore a veil over her head but
Nencia would have it she looked the lovelier for the change and so gave the
Duke greater displeasure Certain it is that the Duke drove out oftener to
the villa and though he found his lady always engaged in some innocent
pursuit such as embroidery or music or playing games with her young
women yet he always went away with a sour look and a whispered word to
the chaplain Now as to the chaplain my grandmother owned there had been
a time when her grace had not handled him overwisely For according to
Nencia it seems that his reverence who seldom approached the Duchess
being buried in his library like a mouse in a cheesewell one day he made
bold to appeal to her for a sum of money a large sum Nencia said to buy
certain tall books a chest full of them that a foreign pedlar had brought
him whereupon the Duchess who could never abide a book breaks out at
him with a laugh and a flash of her old spiritHoly Mother of God must
I have more books about me I was nearly smothered with them in the first
year of my marriage and the chaplain turning red at the affront she
added You may buy them and welcome my good chaplain if you can find
the money but as for me I am yet seeking a way to pay for my turquoise
necklace and the statue of Daphne at the end of the bowlinggreen and
the Indian parrot that my black boy brought me last Michaelmas from the
Bohemiansso you see Ive no money to waste on trifles and as he backs
out awkwardly she tosses at him over her shoulder You should pray to
Saint Blandina to open the Dukes pocket to which he returned very
quietly Your excellencys suggestion is an admirable one and I have
already entreated that blessed martyr to open the Dukes understanding

Thereat Nencia said who was standing by the Duchess flushed
wonderfully red and waved him out of the room and then Quick she cried
to my grandmother who was too glad to run on such errands Call me
Antonio the gardeners boy to the boxgarden Ive a word to say to him
about the new clovecarnations

Now I may not have told you sir that in the crypt under the chapel there
has stood for more generations than a man can count a stone coffin
containing a thighbone of the blessed Saint Blandina of Lyons a relic
offered Ive been told by some great Duke of France to one of our own
dukes when they fought the Turk together and the object ever since of
particular veneration in this illustrious family Now since the Duchess
had been left to herself it was observed she affected a fervent devotion
to this relic praying often in the chapel and even causing the stone slab
that covered the entrance to the crypt to be replaced by a wooden one
that she might at will descend and kneel by the coffin This was matter of
edification to all the household and should have been peculiarly pleasing
to the chaplain but with respect to you he was the kind of man who
brings a sour mouth to the eating of the sweetest apple

However that may be the Duchess when she dismissed him was seen running
to the garden where she talked earnestly with the boy Antonio about the
new clovecarnations and the rest of the day she sat indoors and played
sweetly on the virginal Now Nencia always had it in mind that her grace
had made a mistake in refusing that request of the chaplains but she said
nothing for to talk reason to the Duchess was of no more use than praying
for rain in a drought

Winter came early that year there was snow on the hills by All Souls
the wind stripped the gardens and the lemontrees were nipped in the
lemonhouse The Duchess kept her room in this black season sitting over
the fire embroidering reading books of devotion which was a thing she
had never done and praying frequently in the chapel As for the chaplain
it was a place he never set foot in but to say mass in the morning
with the Duchess overhead in the tribune and the servants aching with
rheumatism on the marble floor The chaplain himself hated the cold and
galloped through the mass like a man with witches after him The rest of
the day he spent in his library over a brazier with his eternal books

Youll wonder sir if Im ever to get to the gist of the story and Ive
gone slowly I own for fear of whats coming Well the winter was long
and hard When it fell cold the Duke ceased to come out from Vicenza
and not a soul had the Duchess to speak to but her maidservants and the
gardeners about the place Yet it was wonderful my grandmother said how
she kept her brave colors and her spirits only it was remarked that she
prayed longer in the chapel where a brazier was kept burning for her all
day When the young are denied their natural pleasures they turn often
enough to religion and it was a mercy as my grandmother said that she
who had scarce a live sinner to speak to should take such comfort in a
dead saint

My grandmother seldom saw her that winter for though she showed a brave
front to all she kept more and more to herself choosing to have only
Nencia about her and dismissing even her when she went to pray For
her devotion had that mark of true piety that she wished it not to be
observed so that Nencia had strict orders on the chaplains approach to
warn her mistress if she happened to be in prayer

Well the winter passed and spring was well forward when my grandmother
one evening had a bad fright That it was her own fault I wont deny for
shed been down the limewalk with Antonio when her aunt fancied her to be
stitching in her chamber and seeing a sudden light in Nencias window she
took fright lest her disobedience be found out and ran up quickly through
the laurelgrove to the house Her way lay by the chapel and as she crept
past it meaning to slip in through the scullery and groping her way for
the dark had fallen and the moon was scarce up she heard a crash close
behind her as though someone had dropped from a window of the chapel The
young fools heart turned over but she looked round as she ran and there
sure enough was a man scuttling across the terrace and as he doubled
the corner of the house my grandmother swore she caught the whisk of the
chaplains skirts Now that was a strange thing certainly for why should
the chaplain be getting out of the chapel window when he might have passed
through the door For you may have noticed sir theres a door leads from
the chapel into the saloon on the ground floor the only other way out
being through the Duchesss tribune

Well my grandmother turned the matter over and next time she met Antonio
in the limewalk which by reason of her fright was not for some days
she laid before him what had happened but to her surprise he only laughed
and said You little simpleton he wasnt getting out of the window he
was trying to look in and not another word could she get from him

So the season moved on to Easter and news came the Duke had gone to Rome
for that holy festivity His comings and goings made no change at the
villa and yet there was no one there but felt easier to think his yellow
face was on the far side of the Apennines unless perhaps it was the
chaplain

Well it was one day in May that the Duchess who had walked long with
Nencia on the terrace rejoicing at the sweetness of the prospect and the
pleasant scent of the gillyflowers in the stone vases the Duchess toward
midday withdrew to her rooms giving orders that her dinner should be
served in her bedchamber My grandmother helped to carry in the dishes
and observed she said the singular beauty of the Duchess who in honor
of the fine weather had put on a gown of shotsilver and hung her bare
shoulders with pearls so that she looked fit to dance at court with an
emperor She had ordered too a rare repast for a lady that heeded so
little what she atejellies gamepasties fruits in syrup spiced cakes
and a flagon of Greek wine and she nodded and clapped her hands as the
women set it before her saying again and again I shall eat well today

But presently another mood seized her she turned from the table called
for her rosary and said to Nencia The fine weather has made me neglect
my devotions I must say a litany before I dine

She ordered the women out and barred the door as her custom was and
Nencia and my grandmother went downstairs to work in the linenroom

Now the linenroom gives on the courtyard and suddenly my grandmother
saw a strange sight approaching First up the avenue came the Dukes
carriage whom all thought to be in Rome and after it drawn by a long
string of mules and oxen a cart carrying what looked like a kneeling
figure wrapped in deathclothes The strangeness of it struck the girl dumb
and the Dukes coach was at the door before she had the wit to cry out that
it was coming Nencia when she saw it went white and ran out of the room
My grandmother followed scared by her face and the two fled along the
corridor to the chapel On the way they met the chaplain deep in a book
who asked in surprise where they were running and when they said to
announce the Dukes arrival he fell into such astonishment and asked them
so many questions and uttered such ohs and ahs that by the time he let
them by the Duke was at their heels Nencia reached the chapeldoor first
and cried out that the Duke was coming and before she had a reply he was
at her side with the chaplain following

A moment later the door opened and there stood the Duchess She held her
rosary in one hand and had drawn a scarf over her shoulders but they shone
through it like the moon in a mist and her countenance sparkled with
beauty

The Duke took her hand with a bow Madam he said I could have had no
greater happiness than thus to surprise you at your devotions

My own happiness she replied would have been greater had your
excellency prolonged it by giving me notice of your arrival

Had you expected me Madam said he your appearance could scarcely
have been more fitted to the occasion Few ladies of your youth and beauty
array themselves to venerate a saint as they would to welcome a lover

Sir she answered having never enjoyed the latter opportunity I am
constrained to make the most of the formerWhats that she cried
falling back and the rosary dropped from her hand

There was a loud noise at the other end of the saloon as of a heavy
object being dragged down the passage and presently a dozen men were seen
haling across the threshold the shrouded thing from the oxcart The Duke
waved his hand toward it That said he Madam is a tribute to your
extraordinary piety I have heard with peculiar satisfaction of your
devotion to the blessed relics in this chapel and to commemorate a zeal
which neither the rigors of winter nor the sultriness of summer could abate
I have ordered a sculptured image of you marvellously executed by the
Cavaliere Bernini to be placed before the altar over the entrance to the
crypt

The Duchess who had grown pale nevertheless smiled playfully at this
As to commemorating my piety she said I recognize there one of your
excellencys pleasantries

A pleasantry the Duke interrupted and he made a sign to the men who
had now reached the threshold of the chapel In an instant the wrappings
fell from the figure and there knelt the Duchess to the life A cry of
wonder rose from all but the Duchess herself stood whiter than the marble

You will see says the Duke this is no pleasantry but a triumph
of the incomparable Berninis chisel The likeness was done from your
miniature portrait by the divine Elisabetta Sirani which I sent to the
master some six months ago with what results all must admire

Six months cried the Duchess and seemed about to fall but his
excellency caught her by the hand

Nothing he said could better please me than the excessive emotion you
display for true piety is ever modest and your thanks could not take a
form that better became you And now says he to the men let the image
be put in place

By this life seemed to have returned to the Duchess and she answered him
with a deep reverence That I should be overcome by so unexpected a grace
your excellency admits to be natural but what honors you accord it is my
privilege to accept and I entreat only that in mercy to my modesty the
image be placed in the remotest part of the chapel

At that the Duke darkened What You would have this masterpiece of a
renowned chisel which I disguise not cost me the price of a good
vineyard in gold pieces you would have it thrust out of sight like the
work of a village stonecutter

It is my semblance not the sculptors work I desire to conceal

It you are fit for my house Madam you are fit for Gods and entitled
to the place of honor in both Bring the statue forward you dawdlers he
called out to the men

The Duchess fell back submissively You are right sir as always but I
would at least have the image stand on the left of the altar that looking
up it may behold your excellencys seat in the tribune

A pretty thought Madam for which I thank you but I design before long
to put my companion image on the other side of the altar and the wifes
place as you know is at her husbands right hand

True my lordbut again if my poor presentment is to have the
unmerited honor of kneeling beside yours why not place both before the
altar where it is our habit to pray in life

And where Madam should we kneel if they took our places Besides says
the Duke still speaking very blandly I have a more particular purpose
in placing your image over the entrance to the crypt for not only would I
thereby mark your special devotion to the blessed saint who rests there
but by sealing up the opening in the pavement would assure the perpetual
preservation of that holy martyrs bones which hitherto have been too
thoughtlessly exposed to sacrilegious attempts

What attempts my lord cries the Duchess No one enters this chapel
without my leave

So I have understood and can well believe from what I have learned of
your piety yet at night a malefactor might break in through a window
Madam and your excellency not know it

Im a light sleeper said the Duchess

The Duke looked at her gravely Indeed said he A bad sign at your
age I must see that you are provided with a sleepingdraught

The Duchesss eyes filled You would deprive me then of the consolation
of visiting those venerable relics

I would have you keep eternal guard over them knowing no one to whose
care they may more fittingly be entrusted

By this the image was brought close to the wooden slab that covered the
entrance to the crypt when the Duchess springing forward placed herself
in the way

Sir let the statue be put in place tomorrow and suffer me tonight
to say a last prayer beside those holy bones

The Duke stepped instantly to her side Well thought Madam I will go
down with you now and we will pray together

Sir your long absences have alas given me the habit of solitary
devotion and I confess that any presence is distracting

Madam I accept your rebuke Hitherto it is true the duties of my
station have constrained me to long absences but henceforward I remain
with you while you live Shall we go down into the crypt together

No for I fear for your excellencys ague The air there is excessively
damp

The more reason you should no longer be exposed to it and to prevent the
intemperance of your zeal I will at once make the place inaccessible

The Duchess at this fell on her knees on the slab weeping excessively and
lifting her hands to heaven

Oh she cried you are cruel sir to deprive me of access to the
sacred relics that have enabled me to support with resignation the solitude
to which your excellencys duties have condemned me and if prayer and
meditation give me any authority to pronounce on such matters suffer me to
warn you sir that I fear the blessed Saint Blandina will punish us for
thus abandoning her venerable remains

The Duke at this seemed to pause for he was a pious man and my
grandmother thought she saw him exchange a glance with the chaplain who
stepping timidly forward with his eyes on the ground said There is
indeed much wisdom in her excellencys words but I would suggest sir
that her pious wish might be met and the saint more conspicuously honored
by transferring the relics from the crypt to a place beneath the altar

True cried the Duke and it shall be done at once

But thereat the Duchess rose to her feet with a terrible look

No she cried by the body of God For it shall not be said that after
your excellency has chosen to deny every request I addressed to him I owe
his consent to the solicitation of another

The chaplain turned red and the Duke yellow and for a moment neither
spoke

Then the Duke said Here are words enough Madam Do you wish the relics
brought up from the crypt

I wish nothing that I owe to anothers intervention

Put the image in place then says the Duke furiously and handed her
grace to a chair

She sat there my grandmother said straight as an arrow her hands
locked her head high her eyes on the Duke while the statue was dragged
to its place then she stood up and turned away As she passed by Nencia
Call me Antonio she whispered but before the words were out of her
mouth the Duke stepped between them

Madam says he all smiles now I have travelled straight from Rome to
bring you the sooner this proof of my esteem I lay last night at Monselice
and have been on the road since daybreak Will you not invite me to
supper

Surely my lord said the Duchess It shall be laid in the
diningparlor within the hour

Why not in your chamber and at once Madam Since I believe it is your
custom to sup there

In my chamber says the Duchess in disorder

Have you anything against it he asked

Assuredly not sir if you will give me time to prepare myself

I will wait in your cabinet said the Duke

At that said my grandmother the Duchess gave one look as the souls in
hell may have looked when the gates closed on our Lord then she called
Nencia and passed to her chamber

What happened there my grandmother could never learn but that the
Duchess in great haste dressed herself with extraordinary splendor
powdering her hair with gold painting her face and bosom and covering
herself with jewels till she shone like our Lady of Loreto and hardly
were these preparations complete when the Duke entered from the cabinet
followed by the servants carrying supper Thereupon the Duchess dismissed
Nencia and what follows my grandmother learned from a pantrylad who
brought up the dishes and waited in the cabinet for only the Dukes
bodyservant entered the bedchamber

Well according to this boy sir who was looking and listening with his
whole body as it were because he had never before been suffered so near
the Duchess it appears that the noble couple sat down in great good humor
the Duchess playfully reproving her husband for his long absence while the
Duke swore that to look so beautiful was the best way of punishing him
In this tone the talk continued with such gay sallies on the part of the
Duchess such tender advances on the Dukes that the lad declared they
were for all the world like a pair of lovers courting on a summers night
in the vineyard and so it went till the servant brought in the mulled
wine

Ah the Duke was saying at that moment this agreeable evening repays
me for the many dull ones I have spent away from you nor do I remember
to have enjoyed such laughter since the afternoon last year when we drank
chocolate in the gazebo with my cousin Ascanio And that reminds me he
said is my cousin in good health

I have no reports of it says the Duchess But your excellency should
taste these figs stewed in malmsey

I am in the mood to taste whatever you offer said he and as she helped
him to the figs he added If my enjoyment were not complete as it is
I could almost wish my cousin Ascanio were with us The fellow is rare
good company at supper What do you say Madam I hear hes still in the
country shall we send for him to join us

Ah said the Duchess with a sigh and a languishing look I see your
excellency wearies of me already

I Madam Ascanio is a capital good fellow but to my mind his chief
merit at this moment is his absence It inclines me so tenderly to him
that by God I could empty a glass to his good health

With that the Duke caught up his goblet and signed to the servant to fill
the Duchesss

Heres to the cousin he cried standing who has the good taste to
stay away when hes not wanted I drink to his very long lifeand you
Madam

At this the Duchess who had sat staring at him with a changed face rose
also and lifted her glass to her lips

And I to his happy death says she in a wild voice and as she spoke the
empty goblet dropped from her hand and she fell face down on the floor

The Duke shouted to her women that she had swooned and they came and
lifted her to the bed She suffered horribly all night Nencia said
twisting herself like a heretic at the stake but without a word escaping
her The Duke watched by her and toward daylight sent for the chaplain
but by this she was unconscious and her teeth being locked our Lords
body could not be passed through them

                                   

The Duke announced to his relations that his lady had died after partaking
too freely of spiced wine and an omelet of carps roe at a supper she had
prepared in honor of his return and the next year he brought home a new
Duchess who gave him a son and five daughters


V

The sky had turned to a steel gray against which the villa stood out
sallow and inscrutable A wind strayed through the gardens loosening here
and there a yellow leaf from the sycamores and the hills across the valley
were purple as thunderclouds

                                   

And the statue I asked

Ah the statue Well sir this is what my grandmother told me here on
this very bench where were sitting The poor child who worshipped the
Duchess as a girl of her years will worship a beautiful kind mistress
spent a night of horror you may fancy shut out from her ladys room
hearing the cries that came from it and seeing as she crouched in her
corner the women rush to and fro with wild looks the Dukes lean face in
the door and the chaplain skulking in the antechamber with his eyes on
his breviary No one minded her that night or the next morning and toward
dusk when it became known the Duchess was no more the poor girl felt the
pious wish to say a prayer for her dead mistress She crept to the chapel
and stole in unobserved The place was empty and dim but as she advanced
she heard a low moaning and coming in front of the statue she saw that
its face the day before so sweet and smiling had the look on it that you
knowand the moaning seemed to come from its lips My grandmother turned
cold but something she said afterward kept her from calling or shrieking
out and she turned and ran from the place In the passage she fell in a
swoon and when she came to her senses in her own chamber she heard that
the Duke had locked the chapel door and forbidden any to set foot there
The place was never opened again till the Duke died some ten years later
and then it was that the other servants going in with the new heir
saw for the first time the horror that my grandmother had kept in her
bosom

And the crypt I asked Has it never been opened

Heaven forbid sir cried the old man crossing himself Was it not the
Duchesss express wish that the relics should not be disturbed




THE ANGEL AT THE GRAVE


The House stood a few yards back from the elmshaded village street
in that semipublicity sometimes cited as a democratic protest against
oldworld standards of domestic exclusiveness This candid exposure to
the public eye is more probably a result of the gregariousness which in
the New England bosom oddly coexists with a shrinking from direct social
contact most of the inmates of such houses preferring that furtive
intercourse which is the result of observations through shuttered windows
and a categorical acquaintance with the neighboring clotheslines The
House however faced its public with a difference For sixty years it had
written itself with a capital letter had selfconsciously squared itself
in the eye of an admiring nation The most searching inroads of village
intimacy hardly counted in a household that opened on the universe and a
lady whose doorbell was at any moment liable to be rung by visitors from
London or Vienna was not likely to flutter upstairs when she observed a
neighbor stepping over

The solitary inmate of the Anson House owed this induration of the social
texture to the most conspicuous accident in her annals the fact that she
was the only granddaughter of the great Orestes Anson She had been born
as it were into a museum and cradled in a glass case with a label
the first foundations of her consciousness being built on the rock of
her grandfathers celebrity To a little girl who acquires her earliest
knowledge of literature through a Reader embellished with fragments
of her ancestors prose that personage necessarily fills an heroic space
in the foreground of life To communicate with ones past through the
impressive medium of print to have as it were a footing in every library
in the country and an acknowledged kinship with that worlddiffused clan
the descendants of the great was to be pledged to a standard of manners
that amazingly simplified the lesser relations of life The village street
on which Paulina Ansons youth looked out led to all the capitals of
Europe and over the roads of intercommunication unseen caravans bore back
to the elmshaded House the tribute of an admiring world

Fate seemed to have taken a direct share in fitting Paulina for her part as
the custodian of this historic dwelling It had long been secretly regarded
as a visitation by the great mans family that he had left no son and
that his daughters were not intellectual The ladies themselves were the
first to lament their deficiency to own that nature had denied them the
gift of making the most of their opportunities A profound veneration for
their parent and an unswerving faith in his doctrines had not amended their
congenital incapacity to understand what he had written Laura who had her
moments of mute rebellion against destiny had sometimes thought how much
easier it would have been if their progenitor had been a poet for she
could recite with feeling portions of The Culprit Fay and of the
poems of Mrs Hemans and Phoebe who was more conspicuous for memory than
imagination kept an album filled with selections But the great man
was a philosopher and to both daughters respiration was difficult on the
cloudy heights of metaphysic The situation would have been intolerable
but for the fact that while Phoebe and Laura were still at school
their fathers fame had passed from the open ground of conjecture to the
chill privacy of certitude Dr Anson had in fact achieved one of those
anticipated immortalities not uncommon at a time when people were apt to
base their literary judgments on their emotions and when to affect plain
food and despise England went a long way toward establishing a mans
intellectual preeminence Thus when the daughters were called on to
strike a filial attitude about their parents pedestal there was little
to do but to pose gracefully and point upward and there are spines to
which the immobility of worship is not a strain A legend had by this time
crystallized about the great Orestes and it was of more immediate interest
to the public to hear what brand of tea he drank and whether he took off
his boots in the hall than to rouse the drowsy echo of his dialectic A
great man never draws so near his public as when it has become unnecessary
to read his books and is still interesting to know what he eats for
breakfast

As recorders of their parents domestic habits as pious scavengers of his
wastepaper basket the Misses Anson were unexcelled They always had an
interesting anecdote to impart to the literary pilgrim and the tact with
which in later years they intervened between the public and the growing
inaccessibility of its idol sent away many an enthusiast satisfied to have
touched the veil before the sanctuary Still it was felt especially by old
Mrs Anson who survived her husband for some years that Phoebe and Laura
were not worthy of their privileges There had been a third daughter so
unworthy of hers that she had married a distant cousin who had taken her
to live in a new Western community where the Works of Orestes Anson
had not yet become a part of the civic consciousness but of this daughter
little was said and she was tacitly understood to be excluded from the
family heritage of fame In time however it appeared that the traditional
penny with which she had been cut off had been invested to unexpected
advantage and the interest on it when she died returned to the Anson
House in the shape of a granddaughter who was at once felt to be what Mrs
Anson called a compensation It was Mrs Ansons firm belief that the
remotest operations of nature were governed by the centripetal force of her
husbands greatness and that Paulinas exceptional intelligence could be
explained only on the ground that she was designed to act as the guardian
of the family temple

The House by the time Paulina came to live in it had already acquired
the publicity of a place of worship not the perfumed chapel of a romantic
idolatry but the cold clean empty meetinghouse of ethical enthusiasms The
ladies lived on its outskirts as it were in cells that left the central
fane undisturbed The very position of the furniture had come to have a
ritual significance the sparse ornaments were the offerings of kindred
intellects the steel engravings by Raphael Morghen marked the Via Sacra
of a European tour and the blackwalnut desk with its bronze inkstand
modelled on the Pantheon was the altar of this bleak temple of thought

To a child compact of enthusiasms and accustomed to pasture them on the
scanty herbage of a new social soil the atmosphere of the old house was
full of floating nourishment In the compressed perspective of Paulinas
outlook it stood for a monument of ruined civilizations and its white
portico opened on legendary distances Its very aspect was impressive
to eyes that had first surveyed life from the jigsaw residence of a
rawedged Western town The highceilinged rooms with their panelled
walls their polished mahogany their portraits of triplestocked ancestors
and of ringleted females in crayon furnished the child with the historic
scenery against which a young imagination constructs its vision of the
past To other eyes the cold spotless thinlyfurnished interior might have
suggested the shuttered mind of a maidenlady who associates fresh air and
sunlight with dust and discoloration but it is the eye which supplies the
coloringmatter and Paulinas brimmed with the richest hues

Nevertheless the House did not immediately dominate her She had her
confused outreachings toward other centres of sensation her vague
intuition of a heliocentric system but the attraction of habit the steady
pressure of example gradually fixed her roving allegiance and she bent her
neck to the yoke Vanity had a share in her subjugation for it had early
been discovered that she was the only person in the family who could read
her grandfathers works The fact that she had perused them with delight at
an age when even presupposing a metaphysical bias it was impossible for
her to understand them seemed to her aunts and grandmother sure evidence
of predestination Paulina was to be the interpreter of the oracle and the
philosophic fumes so vertiginous to meaner minds would throw her into the
needed condition of clairvoyance Nothing could have been more genuine than
the emotion on which this theory was based Paulina in fact delighted in
her grandfathers writings His sonorous periods his mystic vocabulary
his bold flights into the rarefied air of the abstract were thrilling to
a fancy unhampered by the need of definitions This purely verbal pleasure
was supplemented later by the excitement of gathering up crumbs of meaning
from the rhetorical board What could have been more stimulating than
to construct the theory of a girlish world out of the fragments of this
Titanic cosmogony Before Paulinas opinions had reached the stage when
ossification sets in their form was fatally predetermined

The fact that Dr Anson had died and that his apotheosis had taken
place before his young priestesss induction to the temple made her
ministrations easier and more inspiring There were no little personal
traitssuch as the great mans manner of helping himself to salt or the
guttural cluck that started the wheels of speechto distract the eye
of young veneration from the central fact of his divinity A man whom
one knows only through a crayon portrait and a dozen yellowing tomes on
freewill and intuition is at least secure from the belittling effects of
intimacy

Paulina thus grew up in a world readjusted to the fact of her grandfathers
greatness and as each organism draws from its surroundings the kind of
nourishment most needful to its growth so from this somewhat colorless
conception she absorbed warmth brightness and variety Paulina was the
type of woman who transmutes thought into sensation and nurses a theory in
her bosom like a child

In due course Mrs Anson passed awayno one died in the Anson
vocabularyand Paulina became more than ever the foremost figure of the
commemorative group Laura and Phoebe content to leave their fathers
glory in more competent hands placidly lapsed into needlework and fiction
and their niece stepped into immediate prominence as the chief authority
on the great man Historians who were getting up the period wrote to
consult her and to borrow documents ladies with inexplicable yearnings
begged for an interpretation of phrases which had influenced them but
which they had not quite understood critics applied to her to verify some
doubtful citation or to decide some disputed point in chronology and the
great tide of thought and investigation kept up a continuous murmur on the
quiet shores of her life

An explorer of another kind disembarked there one day in the shape
of a young man to whom Paulina was primarily a kissable girl with an
afterthought in the shape of a grandfather From the outset it had been
impossible to fix Hewlett Winsloes attention on Dr Anson The young man
behaved with the innocent profanity of infants sporting on a tomb His
excuse was that he came from New York a Cimmerian outskirt which survived
in Paulinas geography only because Dr Anson had gone there once or twice
to lecture The curious thing was that she should have thought it worth
while to find excuses for young Winsloe The fact that she did so had not
escaped the attention of the village but people after a gasp of awe said
it was the most natural thing in the world that a girl like Paulina Anson
should think of marrying It would certainly seem a little odd to see a
man in the House but young Winsloe would of course understand that the
Doctors books were not to be disturbed and that he must go down to the
orchard to smoke The village had barely framed this modus vivendi
when it was convulsed by the announcement that young Winsloe declined to
live in the House on any terms Hang going down to the orchard to smoke
He meant to take his wife to New York The village drew its breath and
watched

Did Persephone snatched from the warm fields of Enna peer
halfconsentingly down the abyss that opened at her feet Paulina it must
be owned hung a moment over the black gulf of temptation She would have
found it easy to cope with a deliberate disregard of her grandfathers
rights but young Winsloes unconsciousness of that shadowy claim was as
much a natural function as the falling of leaves on a grave His love was
an embodiment of the perpetual renewal which to some tender spirits seems a
crueller process than decay

On women of Paulinas mould this piety toward implicit demands toward
the ghosts of dead duties walking unappeased among usurping passions
has a stronger hold than any tangible bond People said that she gave up
young Winsloe because her aunts disapproved of her leaving them but such
disapproval as reached her was an emanation from the walls of the House
from the bare desk the faded portraits the dozen yellowing tomes that no
hand but hers ever lifted from the shelf


II

After that the House possessed her As if conscious of its victory it
imposed a conquerors claims It had once been suggested that she should
write a life of her grandfather and the task from which she had shrunk as
from a toooppressive privilege now shaped itself into a justification of
her course In a burst of filial pantheism she tried to lose herself in the
vast ancestral consciousness Her one refuge from scepticism was a blind
faith in the magnitude and the endurance of the idea to which she had
sacrificed her life and with a passionate instinct of selfpreservation
she labored to fortify her position

The preparations for the Life led her through byways that the most
scrupulous of the previous biographers had left unexplored She accumulated
her material with a blind animal patience unconscious of fortuitous risks
The years stretched before her like some vast blank page spread out to
receive the record of her toil and she had a mystic conviction that she
would not die till her work was accomplished

The aunts sustained by no such high purpose withdrew in turn to their
respective divisions of the Anson plot and Paulina remained alone with
her task She was forty when the book was completed She had travelled
little in her life and it had become more and more difficult to her to
leave the House even for a day but the dread of entrusting her document to
a strange hand made her decide to carry it herself to the publisher On the
way to Boston she had a sudden vision of the loneliness to which this last
parting condemned her All her youth all her dreams all her renunciations
lay in that neat bundle on her knee It was not so much her grandfathers
life as her own that she had written and the knowledge that it would come
back to her in all the glorification of print was of no more help than to
a mothers grief the assurance that the lad she must part with will return
with epaulets

She had naturally addressed herself to the firm which had published her
grandfathers works Its founder a personal friend of the philosophers
had survived the Olympian group of which he had been a subordinate member
long enough to bestow his octogenarian approval on Paulinas pious
undertaking But he had died soon afterward and Miss Anson found herself
confronted by his grandson a person with a brisk commercial view of his
trade who was said to have put new blood into the firm

This gentleman listened attentively fingering her manuscript as though
literature were a tactile substance then with a confidential twist of his
revolving chair he emitted the verdict We ought to have had this ten
years sooner

Miss Anson took the words as an allusion to the repressed avidity of her
readers It has been a long time for the public to wait she solemnly
assented

The publisher smiled They havent waited he said

She looked at him strangely Havent waited

Notheyve gone off taken another train Literatures like a big
railwaystation now you know theres a train starting every minute
People are not going to hang round the waitingroom If they cant get
to a place when they want to they go somewhere else

The application of this parable cost Miss Anson several minutes of
throbbing silence At length she said Then I am to understand that the
public is no longer interested inin my grandfather She felt as though
heaven must blast the lips that risked such a conjecture

Well its this way Hes a name still of course People dont exactly
want to be caught not knowing who he is but they dont want to spend
two dollars finding out when they can look him up for nothing in any
biographical dictionary

Miss Ansons world reeled She felt herself adrift among mysterious forces
and no more thought of prolonging the discussion than of opposing an
earthquake with argument She went home carrying the manuscript like a
wounded thing On the return journey she found herself travelling straight
toward a fact that had lurked for months in the background of her life
and that now seemed to await her on the very threshold the fact that
fewer visitors came to the House She owned to herself that for the last
four or five years the number had steadily diminished Engrossed in her
work she had noted the change only to feel thankful that she had fewer
interruptions There had been a time when at the travelling season the
bell rang continuously and the ladies of the House lived in a chronic
state of best silks and expectancy It would have been impossible then to
carry on any consecutive work and she now saw that the silence which had
gathered round her task had been the hush of death

Not of his death The very walls cried out against the implication
It was the worlds enthusiasm the worlds faith the worlds loyalty that
had died A corrupt generation that had turned aside to worship the brazen
serpent Her heart yearned with a prophetic passion over the lost sheep
straying in the wilderness But all great glories had their interlunar
period and in due time her grandfather would once more flash fullorbed
upon a darkling world

The few friends to whom she confided her adventure reminded her with
tender indignation that there were other publishers less subject to the
fluctuations of the market but much as she had braved for her grandfather
she could not again brave that particular probation She found herself
in fact incapable of any immediate effort She had lost her way in a
labyrinth of conjecture where her worst dread was that she might put her
hand upon the clue

She locked up the manuscript and sat down to wait If a pilgrim had come
just then the priestess would have fallen on his neck but she continued
to celebrate her rites alone It was a double solitude for she had always
thought a great deal more of the people who came to see the House than of
the people who came to see her She fancied that the neighbors kept a keen
eye on the path to the House and there were days when the figure of a
stranger strolling past the gate seemed to focus upon her the scorching
sympathies of the village For a time she thought of travelling of going
to Europe or even to Boston but to leave the House now would have
seemed like deserting her post Gradually her scattered energies centred
themselves in the fierce resolve to understand what had happened She was
not the woman to live long in an unmapped country or to accept as final
her private interpretation of phenomena Like a traveller in unfamiliar
regions she began to store for future guidance the minutest natural signs
Unflinchingly she noted the accumulating symptoms of indifference that
marked her grandfathers descent toward posterity She passed from the
heights on which he had been grouped with the sages of his day to the lower
level where he had come to be the friend of Emerson the correspondent
of Hawthorne or later still the Dr Anson mentioned in their letters
The change had taken place as slowly and imperceptibly as a natural
process She could not say that any ruthless hand had stripped the leaves
from the tree it was simply that among the evergreen glories of his
group her grandfathers had proved deciduous

She had still to ask herself why If the decay had been a natural process
was it not the very pledge of renewal It was easier to find such arguments
than to be convinced by them Again and again she tried to drug her
solicitude with analogies but at last she saw that such expedients were
but the expression of a growing incredulity The best way of proving her
faith in her grandfather was not to be afraid of his critics She had no
notion where these shadowy antagonists lurked for she had never heard of
the great mans doctrine being directly combated Oblique assaults there
must have been however Parthian shots at the giant that none dared face
and she thirsted to close with such assailants The difficulty was to
find them She began by rereading the Works thence she passed to
the writers of the same school those whose rhetoric bloomed perennial
in First Readers from which her grandfathers prose had long
since faded Amid that clamor of faroff enthusiasms she detected no
controversial note The little knot of Olympians held their views in common
with an earlyChristian promiscuity They were continually proclaiming
their admiration for each other the public joining as chorus in this
guileless antiphon of praise and she discovered no traitor in their midst

What then had happened Was it simply that the main current of thought
had set another way Then why did the others survive Why were they still
marked down as tributaries to the philosophic stream This question carried
her still farther afield and she pressed on with the passion of a champion
whose reluctance to know the worst might be construed into a doubt of his
cause At lengthslowly but inevitablyan explanation shaped itself
Death had overtaken the doctrines about which her grandfather had draped
his cloudy rhetoric They had disintegrated and been reabsorbed adding
their little pile to the dust drifted about the mute lips of the Sphinx
The great mans contemporaries had survived not by reason of what they
taught but of what they were and he who had been the mere mask through
which they mouthed their lesson the instrument on which their tune was
played lay buried deep among the obsolete tools of thought

The discovery came to Paulina suddenly She looked up one evening from her
reading and it stood before her like a ghost It had entered her life with
stealthy steps creeping close before she was aware of it She sat in the
library among the carefullytended books and portraits and it seemed to
her that she had been walled alive into a tomb hung with the effigies of
dead ideas She felt a desperate longing to escape into the outer air
where people toiled and loved and living sympathies went hand in hand It
was the sense of wasted labor that oppressed her of two lives consumed in
that ruthless process that uses generations of effort to build a single
cell There was a dreary parallel between her grandfathers fruitless
toil and her own unprofitable sacrifice Each in turn had kept vigil by a
corpse


III

The bell rangshe remembered it afterwardwith a loud thrilling note It
was what they used to call the visitors ring not the tentative tinkle
of a neighbor dropping in to borrow a saucepan or discuss parochial
incidents but a decisive summons from the outer world

Miss Anson put down her knitting and listened She sat upstairs now
making her rheumatism an excuse for avoiding the rooms below Her interests
had insensibly adjusted themselves to the perspective of her neighbors
lives and she wonderedas the bell reechoedif it could mean that Mrs
Heminways baby had come Conjecture had time to ripen into certainty and
she was limping toward the closet where her cloak and bonnet hung when her
little maid fluttered in with the announcement A gentleman to see the
house

The House

Yes mm I dont know what he means faltered the messenger whose
memory did not embrace the period when such announcements were a daily part
of the domestic routine

Miss Anson glanced at the proffered card The name it boreMr George
Corbywas unknown to her but the blood rose to her languid cheek
Hand me my Mechlin cap Katy she said trembling a little as she laid
aside her walking stick She put her cap on before the mirror with rapid
unsteady touches Did you draw up the library blinds she breathlessly
asked

She had gradually built up a wall of commonplace between herself and her
illusions but at the first summons of the past filial passion swept away
the frail barriers of expediency

She walked downstairs so hurriedly that her stick clicked like a girlish
heel but in the hall she paused wondering nervously if Katy had put a
match to the fire The autumn air was cold and she had the reproachful
vision of a visitor with elderly ailments shivering by her inhospitable
hearth She thought instinctively of the stranger as a survivor of the days
when such a visit was a part of the young enthusiasts itinerary

The fire was unlit and the room forbiddingly cold but the figure which as
Miss Anson entered turned from a lingering scrutiny of the bookshelves
was that of a fresheyed sanguine youth clearly independent of any
artificial caloric She stood still a moment feeling herself the victim of
some anterior impression that made this robust presence an insubstantial
thing but the young man advanced with an air of genial assurance which
rendered him at once more real and more reminiscent

Why this you know he exclaimed is simply immense

The words which did not immediately present themselves as slang to Miss
Ansons unaccustomed ear echoed with an odd familiarity through the
academic silence

The room you know I mean he explained with a comprehensive gesture
These jolly portraits and the booksthats the old gentleman himself
over the mantelpiece I supposeand the elms outside andand the whole
business I do like a congruous backgrounddont you

His hostess was silent No one but Hewlett Winsloe had ever spoken of her
grandfather as the old gentleman

Its a hundred times better than I could have hoped her visitor
continued with a cheerful disregard of her silence The seclusion the
remoteness the philosophic atmospheretheres so little of that kind
of flavor left I should have simply hated to find that he lived over
a grocery you knowI had the deuce of a time finding out where he
did live he began again after another glance of parenthetical
enjoyment But finally I got on the trail through some old book on Brook
Farm I was bound Id get the environment right before I did my article

Miss Anson by this time had recovered sufficient selfpossession to seat
herself and assign a chair to her visitor

Do I understand she asked slowly following his rapid eye about the
room that you intend to write an article about my grandfather

Thats what Im here for Mr Corby genially responded that is if
youre willing to help me for I cant get on without your help he added
with a confident smile

There was another pause during which Miss Anson noticed a fleck of dust on
the faded leather of the writingtable and a fresh spot of discoloration in
the righthand upper corner of Raphael Morghens Parnassus

Then you believe in him she said looking up She could not tell what
had prompted her the words rushed out irresistibly

Believe in him Corby cried springing to his feet Believe in Orestes
Anson Why I believe hes simply the greatestthe most stupendousthe
most phenomenal figure weve got

The color rose to Miss Ansons brow Her heart was beating passionately
She kept her eyes fixed on the young mans face as though it might vanish
if she looked away

Youyou mean to say this in your article she asked

Say it Why the facts will say it he exulted The baldest kind of a
statement would make it clear When a man is as big as that he doesnt need
a pedestal

Miss Anson sighed People used to say that when I was young she
murmured But now

Her visitor stared When you were young But how did they knowwhen the
thing hung fire as it did When the whole edition was thrown back on his
hands

The whole editionwhat edition It was Miss Ansons turn to stare

Why of his pamphletthe pamphletthe one thing that counts that
survives that makes him what he is For heavens sake he tragically
adjured her dont tell me there isnt a copy of it left

Miss Anson was trembling slightly I dont think I understand what you
mean she faltered less bewildered by his vehemence than by the strange
sense of coming on an unexplored region in the very heart of her dominion

Why his account of the amphioxus of course You cant mean that
his family didnt know about itthat you dont know about it I came
across it by the merest accident myself in a letter of vindication that
he wrote in  to an old scientific paper but I understood there were
journalsearly journals there must be references to it somewhere in the
twenties He must have been at least ten or twelve years ahead of Yarrell
and he saw the whole significance of it toohe saw where it led to As
I understand it he actually anticipated in his pamphlet Saint Hilaires
theory of the universal type and supported the hypothesis by describing
the notochord of the amphioxus as a cartilaginous vertebral column
The specialists of the day jeered at him of course as the specialists in
Goethes time jeered at the plantmetamorphosis As far as I can make out
the anatomists and zoologists were down on Dr Anson to a man that was why
his cowardly publishers went back on their bargain But the pamphlet must
be here somewherehe writes as though in his first disappointment he had
destroyed the whole edition but surely there must be at least one copy
left

His scientific jargon was as bewildering as his slang and there were even
moments in his discourse when Miss Anson ceased to distinguish between
them but the suspense with which he continued to gaze on her acted as a
challenge to her scattered thoughts

The amphioxus she murmured halfrising Its an animal isnt
ita fish Yes I think I remember She sank back with the inward look of
one who retraces some lost line of association

Gradually the distance cleared the details started into life In her
researches for the biography she had patiently followed every ramification
of her subject and one of these overgrown paths now led her back to
the episode in question The great Orestess title of Doctor had in
fact not been merely the spontaneous tribute of a national admiration
he had actually studied medicine in his youth and his diaries as his
granddaughter now recalled showed that he had passed through a brief phase
of anatomical ardor before his attention was diverted to supersensual
problems It had indeed seemed to Paulina as she scanned those early
pages that they revealed a spontaneity a freshness of feeling somehow
absent from his later lucubrationsas though this one emotion had reached
him directly the others through some intervening medium In the excess of
her commemorative zeal she had even struggled through the unintelligible
pamphlet to which a few lines in the journal had bitterly directed her But
the subject and the phraseology were alien to her and unconnected with her
conception of the great mans genius and after a hurried perusal she had
averted her thoughts from the episode as from a revelation of failure
At length she rose a little unsteadily supporting herself against the
writingtable She looked hesitatingly about the room then she drew a key
from her oldfashioned reticule and unlocked a drawer beneath one of the
bookcases Young Corby watched her breathlessly With a tremulous hand she
turned over the dusty documents that seemed to fill the drawer Is this
it she said holding out a thin discolored volume

He seized it with a gasp Oh by George he said dropping into the
nearest chair

She stood observing him strangely as his eye devoured the mouldy pages

Is this the only copy left he asked at length looking up for a moment
as a thirsty man lifts his head from his glass

I think it must be I found it long ago among some old papers that my
aunts were burning up after my grandmothers death They said it was of no
usethat hed always meant to destroy the whole edition and that I ought
to respect his wishes But it was something he had written to burn it was
like shutting the door against his voiceagainst something he had once
wished to say and that nobody had listened to I wanted him to feel that I
was always here ready to listen even when others hadnt thought it worth
while and so I kept the pamphlet meaning to carry out his wish and
destroy it before my death

Her visitor gave a groan of retrospective anguish And but for mebut for
todayyou would have

I should have thought it my duty

Oh by Georgeby George he repeated subdued afresh by the inadequacy
of speech

She continued to watch him in silence At length he jumped up and
impulsively caught her by both hands

Hes bigger and bigger he almost shouted He simply leads the field
Youll help me go to the bottom of this wont you We must turn out all
the papersletters journals memoranda He must have made notes He
must have left some record of what led up to this We must leave nothing
unexplored By Jove he cried looking up at her with his bright
convincing smile do you know youre the granddaughter of a Great Man

Her color flickered like a girls Are yousure of him she whispered
as though putting him on his guard against a possible betrayal of trust

Sure Sure My dear lady he measured her again with his quick confident
glance Dont you believe in him

She drew back with a confused murmur Iused to She had left her
hands in his their pressure seemed to send a warm current to her heart
It ruined my life she cried with sudden passion He looked at her
perplexedly

I gave up everything she went on wildly to keep him alive I
sacrificed myselfothersI nursed his glory in my bosom and it diedand
left meleft me here alone She paused and gathered her courage with a
gasp Dont make the same mistake she warned him

He shook his head still smiling No danger of that Youre not alone my
dear lady Hes here with youhes come back to you today Dont you see
whats happened Dont you see that its your love that has kept him alive
If youd abandoned your post for an instantlet things pass into other
handsif your wonderful tenderness hadnt perpetually kept guardthis
might have beenmust have beenirretrievably lost He laid his hand on
the pamphlet And thenthen he would have been dead

Oh she said dont tell me too suddenly And she turned away and sank
into a chair

The young man stood watching her in an awed silence For a long time she
sat motionless with her face hidden and he thought she must be weeping

At length he said almost shyly Youll let me come back then Youll
help me work this thing out

She rose calmly and held out her hand Ill help you she declared

Ill come tomorrow then Can we get to work early

As early as you please

At eight oclock then he said briskly Youll have the papers ready

Ill have everything ready She added with a halfplayful hesitancy And
the fire shall be lit for you

He went out with his bright nod She walked to the window and watched his
buoyant figure hastening down the elmshaded street When she turned back
into the empty room she looked as though youth had touched her on the lips




THE RECOVERY


To the visiting stranger Hillbridges first question was Have you seen
Kenistons things Keniston took precedence of the colonial State House
the Gilbert Stuart Washington and the Ethnological Museum nay he ran neck
and neck with the President of the University a prehistoric relic who had
known Emerson and who was still sent about the country in cottonwool to
open educational institutions with a toothless oration on Brook Farm

Keniston was sent about the country too he opened art exhibitions laid
the foundation of academies and acted in a general sense as the spokesman
and apologist of art Hillbridge was proud of him in his peripatetic
character but his fellowtownsmen let it be understood that to know
Keniston one must come to Hillbridge Never was work more dependent for its
effect on atmosphere on milieu Hillbridge was Kenistons milieu
and there was one lady a devotee of his art who went so far as to assert
that once at an exhibition in New York she had passed a Keniston without
recognizing it It simply didnt want to be seen in such surroundings it
was hiding itself under an incognito she declared

It was a source of special pride to Hillbridge that it contained all the
artists best works Strangers were told that Hillbridge had discovered
him The discovery had come about in the simplest manner Professor
Driffert who had a reputation for collecting had one day hung a sketch
on his drawingroom wall and thereafter Mrs Drifferts visitors always
a little flurried by the sense that it was the kind of house in which one
might be suddenly called upon to distinguish between a drypoint and an
etching or between Raphael Mengs and Raphael Sanzio were not infrequently
subjected to the Professors offhand inquiry Bytheway have you seen
my Keniston The visitors perceptibly awed would retreat to a critical
distance and murmur the usual guarded generalities while they tried to
keep the name in mind long enough to look it up in the Encyclopdia The
name was not in the Encyclopdia but as a compensating fact it became
known that the man himself was in Hillbridge Hillbridge then owned an
artist whose celebrity it was the proper thing to take for granted Some
one else emboldened by the thought bought a Keniston and the next
year on the occasion of the Presidents golden jubilee the Faculty by
unanimous consent presented him with a Keniston Two years later there
was a Keniston exhibition to which the artcritics came from New York
and Boston and not long afterward a wellknown Chicago collector vainly
attempted to buy Professor Drifferts sketch which the art journals cited
as a rare example of the painters first or silvery manner Thus there
gradually grew up a small circle of connoisseurs known in artistic circles
as men who collected Kenistons

Professor Wildmarsh of the chair of Fine Arts and Archaeology was the
first critic to publish a detailed analysis of the masters methods and
purpose The article was illustrated by engravings which though they had
cost the magazine a fortune were declared by Professor Wildmarsh to give
but an imperfect suggestion of the esoteric significance of the originals
The Professor with a tact that contrived to make each reader feel himself
included among the exceptions went on to say that Kenistons work would
never appeal to any but exceptional natures and he closed with the usual
assertion that to apprehend the full meaning of the masters message it
was necessary to see him in the surroundings of his own home at Hillbridge

Professor Wildmarshs article was read one spring afternoon by a young
lady just speeding eastward on her first visit to Hillbridge and already
flushed with anticipation of the intellectual opportunities awaiting her
In East Onondaigua where she lived Hillbridge was looked on as an Oxford
Magazine writers with the easy American use of the superlative designated
it as the venerable Alma Mater the antique seat of learning and
Claudia Day had been brought up to regard it as the fountainhead of
knowledge and of that mental distinction which is so much rarer than
knowledge An innate passion for all that was thus distinguished and
exceptional made her revere Hillbridge as the native soil of those
intellectual amenities that were of such difficult growth in the
thin air of East Onondaigua At the first suggestion of a visit to
Hillbridgewhither she went at the invitation of a girl friend
who incredible apotheosis had married one of the University
professorsClaudias spirit dilated with the sense of new possibilities
The vision of herself walking under the historic elms toward the Memorial
Library standing rapt before the Stuart Washington or drinking in
from some obscure corner of an academic drawingroom the Presidents
reminiscences of the Concord groupthis vividness of selfprojection into
the emotions awaiting her made her glad of any delay that prolonged so
exquisite a moment

It was in this mood that she opened the article on Keniston She knew about
him of course she was wonderfully well up even for East Onondaigua
She had read of him in the magazines she had met on a visit to New York
a man who collected Kenistons and a photogravure of a Keniston in an
artistic frame hung above her writingtable at home But Professor
Wildmarshs article made her feel how little she really knew of the master
and she trembled to think of the state of relative ignorance in which but
for the timely purchase of the magazine she might have entered Hillbridge
She had for instance been densely unaware that Keniston had already had
three manners and was showing symptoms of a fourth She was equally
ignorant of the fact that he had founded a school and created a formula
and she learned with a thrill that no one could hope to understand him who
had not seen him in his studio at Hillbridge surrounded by his own works
The man and the art interpret each other their exponent declared and
Claudia Day bending a brilliant eye on the future wondered if she were
ever to be admitted to the privilege of that double initiation

Keniston to his other claims to distinction added that of being hard to
know His friends always hastened to announce the fact to strangersadding
after a pause of suspense that they would see what they could do
Visitors in whose favor he was induced to make an exception were further
warned that he never spoke unless he was interestedso that they mustnt
mind if he remained silent It was under these reassuring conditions that
some ten days after her arrival at Hillbridge Miss Day was introduced
to the masters studio She found him a tall listlesslooking man who
appeared middleaged to her youth and who stood before his own pictures
with a vaguely interrogative gaze leaving the task of their interpretation
to the lady who had courageously contrived the visit The studio to
Claudias surprise was bare and shabby It formed a rambling addition to
the small cheerless house in which the artist lived with his mother and
a widowed sister For Claudia it added the last touch to his distinction
to learn that he was poor and that what he earned was devoted to the
maintenance of the two limp women who formed a neutraltinted background to
his impressive outline His pictures of course fetched high prices but he
worked slowlypainfully as his devotees preferred to phrase itwith
frequent intervals of ill health and inactivity and the circle of Keniston
connoisseurs was still as small as it was distinguished The girls fancy
instantly hailed in him that favorite figure of imaginative youth the
artist who would rather starve than paint a potboiler It is known to
comparatively few that the production of successful potboilers is an art
in itself and that such heroic abstentions as Kenistons are not always
purely voluntary On the occasion of her first visit the artist said so
little that Claudia was able to indulge to the full the harrowing sense of
her inadequacy No wonder she had not been one of the few that he cared
to talk to every word she uttered must so obviously have diminished the
inducement She had been cheap trivial conventional at once gushing
and inexpressive eager and constrained She could feel him counting the
minutes till the visit was over and as the door finally closed on the
scene of her discomfiture she almost shared the hope with which she
confidently credited himthat they might never meet again


II

Mrs Davant glanced reverentially about the studio I have always said
she murmured that they ought to be seen in Europe

Mrs Davant was young credulous and emotionally extravagant she reminded
Claudia of her earlier selfthe self that ten years before had first set
an awestruck foot on that very threshold

Not for his sake Mrs Davant continued but for Europes

Claudia smiled She was glad that her husbands pictures were to be
exhibited in Paris She concurred in Mrs Davants view of the importance
of the event but she thought her visitors way of putting the case a
little overcharged Ten years spent in an atmosphere of Kenistonworship
had insensibly developed in Claudia a preference for moderation of speech
She believed in her husband of course to believe in him with an
increasing abandonment and tenacity had become one of the necessary laws
of being but she did not believe in his admirers Their faith in him was
perhaps as genuine as her own but it seemed to her less able to give an
account of itself Some few of his appreciators doubtless measured him
by their own standards but it was difficult not to feel that in the
Hillbridge circle where rapture ran the highest he was accepted on
what was at best but an indirect valuation and now and then she had a
frightened doubt as to the independence of her own convictions That
innate sense of relativity which even East Onondaigua had not been able to
check in Claudia Day had been fostered in Mrs Keniston by the artistic
absolutism of Hillbridge and she often wondered that her husband remained
so uncritical of the quality of admiration accorded him Her husbands
uncritical attitude toward himself and his admirers had in fact been one of
the surprises of her marriage That an artist should believe in his
potential powers seemed to her at once the incentive and the pledge of
excellence she knew there was no future for a hesitating talent What
perplexed her was Kenistons satisfaction in his achievement She had
always imagined that the true artist must regard himself as the imperfect
vehicle of the cosmic emotionthat beneath every difficulty overcome a new
one lurked the vision widening as the scope enlarged To be initiated into
these creative struggles to shed on the toilers path the consolatory ray
of faith and encouragement had seemed the chief privilege of her marriage
But there is something supererogatory in believing in a man obviously
disposed to perform that service for himself and Claudias ardor gradually
spent itself against the dense surface of her husbands complacency She
could smile now at her vision of an intellectual communion which should
admit her to the inmost precincts of his inspiration She had learned
that the creative processes are seldom selfexplanatory and Kenistons
inarticulateness no longer discouraged her but she could not reconcile
her sense of the continuity of all high effort to his unperturbed air
of finishing each picture as though he had despatched a masterpiece to
posterity In the first recoil from her disillusionment she even allowed
herself to perceive that if he worked slowly it was not because he
mistrusted his powers of expression but because he had really so little to
express

Its for Europe Mrs Davant vaguely repeated and Claudia noticed that
she was blushingly intent on tracing with the tip of her elaborate sunshade
the pattern of the shabby carpet

It will be a revelation to them she went on provisionally as though
Claudia had missed her cue and left an awkward interval to fill

Claudia had in fact a sudden sense of deficient intuition She felt that
her visitor had something to communicate which required on her own part
an intelligent cooperation but what it was her insight failed to suggest
She was in truth a little tired of Mrs Davant who was Kenistons latest
worshipper who ordered pictures recklessly who paid for them regally
in advance and whose gallery was figuratively speaking crowded with
the artists unpainted masterpieces Claudias impatience was perhaps
complicated by the uneasy sense that Mrs Davant was too young too rich
too inexperienced that somehow she ought to be warnedWarned of what
That some of the pictures might never be painted Scarcely that since
Keniston who was scrupulous in business transactions might be trusted not
to take any material advantage of such evidence of faith Claudias impulse
remained undefined She merely felt that she would have liked to help Mrs
Davant and that she did not know how

Youll be there to see them she asked as her visitor lingered

In Paris Mrs Davants blush deepened We must all be there together

Claudia smiled My husband and I mean to go abroad some daybut I dont
see any chance of it at present

But he ought to goyou ought both to go this summer Mrs Davant
persisted I know Professor Wildmarsh and Professor Driffert and all the
other critics think that Mr Kenistons never having been to Europe has
given his work much of its wonderful individuality its peculiar flavor
and meaningbut now that his talent is formed that he has full command
of his means of expression Claudia recognized one of Professor
Drifferts favorite formulas they all think he ought to see the work of
the other great mastersthat he ought to visit the home of his
ancestors as Professor Wildmarsh says She stretched an impulsive hand to
Claudia You ought to let him go Mrs Keniston

Claudia accepted the admonition with the philosophy of the wife who is used
to being advised on the management of her husband I shant interfere
with him she declared and Mrs Davant instantly caught her up with a cry
of Oh its too lovely of you to say that With this exclamation she
left Claudia to a silent renewal of wonder

A moment later Keniston entered to a mind curious in combinations it
might have occurred that he had met Mrs Davant on the doorstep In one
sense he might for all his wife cared have met fifty Mrs Davants on the
doorstep it was long since Claudia had enjoyed the solace of resenting
such coincidences Her only thought now was that her husbands first words
might not improbably explain Mrs Davants last and she waited for him to
speak

He paused with his hands in his pockets before an unfinished picture on the
easel then as his habit was he began to stroll touristlike from canvas
to canvas standing before each in a musing ecstasy of contemplation that
no readjustment of view ever seemed to disturb Her eye instinctively
joined his in its inspection it was the one point where their natures
merged Thank God there was no doubt about the pictures She was what she
had always dreamed of beingthe wife of a great artist Keniston dropped
into an armchair and filled his pipe How should you like to go to
Europe he asked

His wife looked up quickly When

Nowthis spring I mean He paused to light the pipe I should like to
be over there while these things are being exhibited

Claudia was silent

Well he repeated after a moment

How can we afford it she asked

Keniston had always scrupulously fulfilled his duty to the mother and
sister whom his marriage had dislodged and Claudia who had the atoning
temperament which seeks to pay for every happiness by making it a source
of fresh obligations had from the outset accepted his ties with an
exaggerated devotion Any disregard of such a claim would have vulgarized
her most delicate pleasures and her husbands sensitiveness to it in great
measure extenuated the artistic obtuseness that often seemed to her like a
failure of the moral sense His loyalty to the dull women who depended on
him was after all compounded of finer tissues than any mere sensibility
to ideal demands

Oh I dont see why we shouldnt he rejoined I think we might manage
it

At Mrs Davants expense leaped from Claudia She could not tell why she
had said it some inner barrier seemed to have given way under a confused
pressure of emotions

He looked up at her with frank surprise Well she has been very jolly
about itwhy not She has a tremendous feeling for artthe keenest I
ever knew in a woman Claudia imperceptibly smiled She wants me to let
her pay in advance for the four panels she has ordered for the Memorial
Library That would give us plenty of money for the trip and my having the
panels to do is another reason for my wanting to go abroad just now

Another reason

Yes Ive never worked on such a big scale I want to see how those old
chaps did the trick I want to measure myself with the big fellows over
there An artist ought to once in his life

She gave him a wondering look For the first time his words implied a sense
of possible limitation but his easy tone seemed to retract what they
conceded What he really wanted was fresh food for his selfsatisfaction
he was like an army that moves on after exhausting the resources of the
country

Womanlike she abandoned the general survey of the case for the
consideration of a minor point

Are you sure you can do that kind of thing she asked

What kind of thing

The panels

He glanced at her indulgently his selfconfidence was too impenetrable to
feel the pinprick of such a doubt

Immensely sure he said with a smile

And you dont mind taking so much money from her in advance

He stared Why should I Shell get it backwith interest He laughed
and drew at his pipe It will be an uncommonly interesting experience I
shouldnt wonder if it freshened me up a bit

She looked at him again This second hint of selfdistrust struck her as
the sign of a quickened sensibility What if after all he was beginning
to be dissatisfied with his work The thought filled her with a renovating
sense of his sufficiency


III

They stopped in London to see the National Gallery

It was thus that in their inexperience they had narrowly put it but in
reality every stone of the streets every trick of the atmosphere had
its message of surprise for their virgin sensibilities The pictures were
simply the summing up the final interpretation of the cumulative pressure
of an unimagined world and it seemed to Claudia that long before they
reached the doors of the gallery she had some intuitive revelation of what
awaited them within

They moved about from room to room without exchanging a word The vast
noiseless spaces seemed full of sound like the roar of a distant multitude
heard only by the inner ear Had their speech been articulate their
language would have been incomprehensible and even that faroff murmur
of meaning pressed intolerably on Claudias nerves Keniston took the
onset without outward sign of disturbance Now and then he paused before a
canvas or prolonged from one of the benches his silent communion with some
miracle of line or color but he neither looked at his wife nor spoke to
her He seemed to have forgotten her presence

Claudia was conscious of keeping a furtive watch on him but the sum total
of her impressions was negative She remembered thinking when she first
met him that his face was rather expressionless and he had the habit of
selfengrossed silences

All that evening at the hotel they talked about London and he surprised
her by an acuteness of observation that she had sometimes inwardly accused
him of lacking He seemed to have seen everything to have examined felt
compared with nerves as finely adjusted as her own but he said nothing
of the pictures The next day they returned to the National Gallery and
he began to study the paintings in detail pointing out differences of
technique analyzing and criticising but still without summing up his
conclusions He seemed to have a sort of provincial dread of showing
himself too much impressed Claudias own sensations were too complex too
overwhelming to be readily classified Lacking the craftsmans instinct to
steady her she felt herself carried off her feet by the rush of incoherent
impressions One point she consciously avoided and that was the comparison
of her husbands work with what they were daily seeing Art she inwardly
argued was too various too complex dependent on too many interrelations
of feeling and environment to allow of its being judged by any provisional
standard Even the subtleties of technique must be modified by the artists
changing purpose as this in turn is acted on by influences of which
he is himself unconscious How then was an unprepared imagination to
distinguish between such varied reflections of the elusive vision She took
refuge in a passionate exaggeration of her own ignorance and insufficiency

After a week in London they went to Paris The exhibition of Kenistons
pictures had been opened a few days earlier and as they drove through the
streets on the way to the station an impressionist poster here and there
invited them to the display of the American artists work Mrs Davant who
had been in Paris for the opening had already written rapturously of the
impression produced enclosing commendatory notices from one or two papers
She reported that there had been a great crowd on the first day and that
the critics had been immensely struck

The Kenistons arrived in the evening and the next morning Claudia as a
matter of course asked her husband at what time he meant to go and see the
pictures

He looked up absently from his guidebook

What pictures

Whyyours she said surprised

Oh theyll keep he answered adding with a slightly embarrassed laugh
Well give the other chaps a show first Presently he laid down his book
and proposed that they should go to the Louvre

They spent the morning there lunched at a restaurant near by and returned
to the gallery in the afternoon Keniston had passed from inarticulateness
to an eager volubility It was clear that he was beginning to coordinate
his impressions to find his way about in a corner of the great imaginative
universe He seemed extraordinarily ready to impart his discoveries and
Claudia felt that her ignorance served him as a convenient buffer against
the terrific impact of new sensations

On the way home she asked when he meant to see Mrs Davant

His answer surprised her Does she know were here

Not unless youve sent her word said Claudia with a touch of harmless
irony

Thats all right then he returned simply I want to wait and look
about a day or two longer Shed want us to go sightseeing with her and
Id rather get my impressions alone

The next two days were hampered by the necessity of eluding Mrs Davant
Claudia under different circumstances would have scrupled to share in
this somewhat shabby conspiracy but she found herself in a state of
suspended judgment wherein her husbands treatment of Mrs Davant became
for the moment merely a clue to larger meanings

They had been four days in Paris when Claudia returning one afternoon from
a parenthetical excursion to the Rue de la Paix was confronted on her
threshold by the reproachful figure of their benefactress It was not to
her however that Mrs Davants reproaches were addressed Keniston it
appeared had borne the brunt of them for he stood leaning against the
mantelpiece of their modest salon in that attitude of convicted
negligence when if ever a man is glad to take refuge behind his wife

Claudia had however no immediate intention of affording him such shelter
She wanted to observe and wait

Hes too impossible cried Mrs Davant sweeping her at once into the
central current of her grievance

Claudia looked from one to the other

For not going to see you

For not going to see his pictures cried the other nobly

Claudia colored and Keniston shifted his position uneasily

I cant make her understand he said turning to his wife

I dont care about myself Mrs Davant interjected

I do then its the only thing I do care about he hurriedly
protested I meant to go at onceto writeClaudia wanted to go but I
wouldnt let her He looked helplessly about the pleasant redcurtained
room which was rapidly burning itself into Claudias consciousness as a
visible extension of Mrs Davants claims

I cant explain he broke off

Mrs Davant in turn addressed herself to Claudia

People think its so odd she complained So many of the artists
here are anxious to meet him theyve all been so charming about the
pictures and several of our American friends have come over from London
expressly for the exhibition I told every one that he would be here
for the openingthere was a private view you knowand they were so
disappointedthey wanted to give him an ovation and I didnt know what
to say What am I to say she abruptly ended

Theres nothing to say said Keniston slowly

But the exhibition closes the day after tomorrow

Well I shant closeI shall be here he declared with an effort
at playfulness If they want to see meall these people youre kind
enough to mentionwont there be other chances

But I wanted them to see you among your picturesto hear you talk
about them explain them in that wonderful way I wanted you to interpret
each other as Professor Wildmarsh says

Oh hang Professor Wildmarsh said Keniston softening the commination
with a smile If my pictures are good for anything they oughtnt to need
explaining

Mrs Davant stared But I thought that was what made them so interesting
she exclaimed

Keniston looked down Perhaps it was he murmured

There was an awkward silence which Claudia broke by saying with a glance
at her husband But if the exhibition is to remain open tomorrow could
we not meet you there And perhaps you could send word to some of our
friends

Mrs Davant brightened like a child whose broken toy is glued together
Oh do make him she implored Ill ask them to come in the
afternoonwell make it into a little teaa five oclock Ill
send word at once to everybody She gathered up her beruffled boa and
sunshade settling her plumage like a reassured bird It will be too
lovely she ended in a selfconsoling murmur

But in the doorway a new doubt assailed her You wont fail me she said
turning plaintively to Keniston Youll make him come Mrs Keniston

Ill bring him Claudia promised


IV

When the next morning she appeared equipped for their customary ramble
her husband surprised her by announcing that he meant to stay at home

The fact is Im rather surfeited he said smiling I suppose my
appetite isnt equal to such a plethora I think Ill write some letters
and join you somewhere later

She detected the wish to be alone and responded to it with her usual
readiness

I shall sink to my proper level and buy a bonnet then she said I
havent had time to take the edge off that appetite

They agreed to meet at the Hotel Cluny at midday and she set out alone
with a vague sense of relief Neither she nor Keniston had made any direct
reference to Mrs Davants visit but its effect was implicit in their
eagerness to avoid each other

Claudia accomplished some shopping in the spirit of perfunctoriness that
robs even new bonnets of their bloom and this business despatched she
turned aimlessly into the wide inviting brightness of the streets Never
had she felt more isolated amid that ordered beauty which gives a social
quality to the very stones and mortar of Paris All about her were
evidences of an artistic sensibility pervading every form of life like the
nervous structure of the huge framea sensibility so delicate alert and
universal that it seemed to leave no room for obtuseness or error In such
a medium the faculty of plastic expression must develop as unconsciously
as any organ in its normal surroundings to be artistic must cease to be
an attitude and become a natural function To Claudia the significance of
the whole vast revelation was centred in the light it shed on one tiny
spot of consciousnessthe value of her husbands work There are moments
when to the groping soul the worlds accumulated experiences are but
steppingstones across a private difficulty

She stood hesitating on a street corner It was barely eleven and she had
an hour to spare before going to the Hotel Cluny She seemed to be letting
her inclination float as it would on the crosscurrents of suggestion
emanating from the brilliant complex scene before her but suddenly in
obedience to an impulse that she became aware of only in acting on it she
called a cab and drove to the gallery where her husbands pictures were
exhibited

A magnificent official in gold braid sold her a ticket and pointed the way
up the empty crimsoncarpeted stairs His duplicate on the upper landing
held out a catalogue with an air of recognizing the futility of the offer
and a moment later she found herself in the long noiseless impressive room
full of velvetcovered ottomans and exotic plants It was clear that the
public ardor on which Mrs Davant had expatiated had spent itself earlier
in the week for Claudia had this luxurious apartment to herself Something
about its air of rich privacy its diffusion of that sympathetic quality in
other countries so conspicuously absent from the public showroom seemed
to emphasize its present emptiness It was as though the flowers the
carpet the lounges surrounded their visitors solitary advance with
the mute assurance that they had done all they could toward making the
thing go off and that if they had failed it was simply for lack of
cooperation She stood still and looked about her The pictures struck her
instantly as odd gaps in the general harmony it was selfevident that they
had not cooperated They had not been pushing aggressive discordant
they had merely effaced themselves She swept a startled eye from one
familiar painting to another The canvases were all thereand the
framesbut the miracle the mirage of life and meaning had vanished
like some atmospheric illusion What was it that had happened And had
it happened to her or to the pictures She tried to rally her
frightened thoughts to push or coax them into a semblance of resistance
but argument was swept off its feet by the huge rush of a single
convictionthe conviction that the pictures were bad There was no
standing up against that she felt herself submerged

The stealthy fear that had been following her all these days had her by the
throat now The great vision of beauty through which she had been moving
as one enchanted was turned to a phantasmagoria of evil mocking shapes
She hated the past she hated its splendor its power its wicked magical
vitality She dropped into a seat and continued to stare at the wall
before her Gradually as she stared there stole out to her from the
dimmed humbled canvases a reminder of what she had once seen in them a
spectral appeal to her faith to call them back to life What proof had she
that her present estimate of them was less subjective than the other The
confused impressions of the last few days were hardly to be pleaded as a
valid theory of art How after all did she know that the pictures were
bad On what suddenly acquired technical standard had she thus decided
the case against them It seemed as though it were a standard outside of
herself as though some unheeded inner sense were gradually making her
aware of the presence in that empty room of a critical intelligence that
was giving out a subtle effluence of disapproval The fancy was so vivid
that to shake it off she rose and began to move about again In the
middle of the room stood a monumental divan surmounted by a massif
of palms and azaleas As Claudias muffled wanderings carried her around
the angle of this seat she saw that its farther side was occupied by the
figure of a man who sat with his hands resting on his stick and his head
bowed upon them She gave a little cry and her husband rose and faced her

Instantly the live point of consciousness was shifted and she became aware
that the quality of the pictures no longer mattered It was what he
thought of them that counted her life hung on that

They looked at each other a moment in silence such concussions are not apt
to flash into immediate speech At length he said simply I didnt know
you were coming here

She colored as though he had charged her with something underhand

I didnt mean to she stammered but I was too early for our
appointment

Her words cast a revealing glare on the situation Neither of them looked
at the pictures but to Claudia those unobtruding presences seemed suddenly
to press upon them and force them apart

Keniston glanced at his watch Its twelve oclock he said Shall we go
on


V

At the door he called a cab and put her in it then drawing out his watch
again he said abruptly I believe Ill let you go alone Ill join you at
the hotel in time for luncheon She wondered for a moment if he meant to
return to the gallery but looking back as she drove off she saw him walk
rapidly away in the opposite direction

The cabman had carried her halfway to the Hotel Cluny before she realized
where she was going and cried out to him to turn home There was an acute
irony in this mechanical prolongation of the quest of beauty She had
had enough of it too much of it her one longing was to escape to hide
herself away from its allsuffusing implacable light

At the hotel alone in her room a few tears came to soften her seared
vision but her mood was too tense to be eased by weeping Her whole being
was centred in the longing to know what her husband thought Their short
exchange of words had after all told her nothing She had guessed a faint
resentment at her unexpected appearance but that might merely imply a
dawning sense on his part of being furtively watched and criticised She
had sometimes wondered if he was never conscious of her observation there
were moments when it seemed to radiate from her in visible waves Perhaps
after all he was aware of it on his guard against it as a lurking knife
behind the thick curtain of his complacency and today he must have caught
the gleam of the blade

Claudia had not reached the age when pity is the first chord to vibrate in
contact with any revelation of failure Her one hope had been that Keniston
should be cleareyed enough to face the truth Whatever it turned out to
be she wanted him to measure himself with it But as his image rose before
her she felt a sudden halfmaternal longing to thrust herself between him
and disaster Her eagerness to see him tested by circumstances seemed now
like a cruel scientific curiosity She saw in a flash of sympathy that he
would need her most if he fell beneath his fate

He did not after all return for luncheon and when she came upstairs
from her solitary meal their salon was still untenanted She
permitted herself no sensational fears for she could not at the height of
apprehension figure Keniston as yielding to any tragic impulse but the
lengthening hours brought an uneasiness that was fuel to her pity Suddenly
she heard the clock strike five It was the hour at which they had promised
to meet Mrs Davant at the gallerythe hour of the ovation Claudia
rose and went to the window straining for a glimpse of her husband in the
crowded street Could it be that he had forgotten her had gone to the
gallery without her Or had something happenedthat veiled something
which for the last hour had grimly hovered on the outskirts of her mind

She heard a hand on the door and Keniston entered As she turned to meet
him her whole being was swept forward on a great wave of pity she was so
sure now that he must know

But he confronted her with a glance of preoccupied brightness her first
impression was that she had never seen him so vividly so expressively
pleased If he needed her it was not to bind up his wounds

He gave her a smile which was clearly the lingering reflection of some
inner light I didnt mean to be so late he said tossing aside his hat
and the little red volume that served as a clue to his explorations I
turned in to the Louvre for a minute after I left you this morning and the
place fairly swallowed me upI couldnt get away from it Ive been there
ever since He threw himself into a chair and glanced about for his pipe

It takes time he continued musingly to get at them to make out what
theyre sayingthe big fellows I mean Theyre not a communicative lot
At first I couldnt make much out of their lingoit was too different from
mine But gradually by picking up a hint here and there and piecing them
together Ive begun to understand and today by Jove I got one or two
of the old chaps by the throat and fairly turned them inside outmade them
deliver up their last drop He lifted a brilliant eye to her Lord it
was tremendous he declared

He had found his pipe and was musingly filling it Claudia waited in
silence

At first he began again I was afraid their language was too hard for
methat I should never quite know what they were driving at they seemed
to coldshoulder me to be bent on shutting me out But I was bound I
wouldnt be beaten and now todayhe paused a moment to strike a
matchwhen I went to look at those things of mine it all came over me
in a flash By Jove it was as if Id made them all into a big bonfire to
light me on my road

His wife was trembling with a kind of sacred terror She had been afraid
to pray for light for him and here he was joyfully casting his whole past
upon the pyre

Is there nothing left she faltered

Nothing left Theres everything he exulted Why here I am not much
over forty and Ive found out alreadyalready He stood up and began to
move excitedly about the room My God Suppose Id never known Suppose
Id gone on painting things like that forever Why I feel like those
chaps at revivalist meetings when they get up and say theyre saved Wont
somebody please start a hymn

Claudia with a tremulous joy was letting herself go on the strong
current of his emotion but it had not yet carried her beyond her depth
and suddenly she felt hard ground underfoot

Mrs Davant she exclaimed

He stared as though suddenly recalled from a long distance Mrs Davant

We were to have met herthis afternoonnow

At the gallery Oh thats all right I put a stop to that I went to see
her after I left you I explained it all to her

All

I told her I was going to begin all over again

Claudias heart gave a forward bound and then sank back hopelessly

But the panels

Thats all right too I told her about the panels he reassured her

You told her

That I cant paint them now She doesnt understand of course but shes
the best little woman and she trusts me

She could have wept for joy at his exquisite obtuseness But that isnt
all she wailed It doesnt matter how much youve explained to her It
doesnt do away with the fact that were living on those panels

Living on them

On the money that she paid you to paint them Isnt that what brought us
here Andif you mean to do as you sayto begin all over againhow in
the world are we ever to pay her back

Her husband turned on her an inspired eye Theres only one way that I
know of he imperturbably declared and thats to stay out here till I
learn how to paint them

A DIALOGUE


Mrs Ambrose Daleforty slender still youngsits in her drawingroom
at the teatable The winter twilight is falling a lamp has been lit
there is a fire on the hearth and the room is pleasantly dim and
flowerscented Books are scattered everywheremostly with autograph
inscriptions From the Authorand a large portrait of Mrs Dale
at her desk with papers strewn about her takes up one of the
wallpanels Before Mrs Dale stands Hilda fair and twenty
her hands full of letters

Mrs Dale Ten more applications for autographs Isnt it strange
that people whod blush to borrow twenty dollars dont scruple to beg for
an autograph

Hilda reproachfully Oh

Mrs Dale Whats the difference pray

Hilda Only that your last autograph sold for fifty

Mrs Dale not displeased AhI sent for you Hilda because Im
dining out tonight and if theres nothing important to attend to among
these letters you neednt sit up for me

Hilda You dont mean to work

Mrs Dale Perhaps but I shant need you Youll see that my
cigarettes and coffeemachine are in place and that I dont have to crawl
about the floor in search of my penwiper Thats all Now about these
letters

Mrs Dale Child Ive nothing for you to do I shall be blocking
out the tenth chapter of Winged Purposes and it wont be ready for
you till next week

Hilda It isnt thatbut its so beautiful to sit here watching
and listening all alone in the night and to feel that youre in there
she points to the studydoor creatingImpulsively
What do I care for sleep

Mrs Dale indulgently Childsilly childYes I should have
felt so at your ageit would have been an inspiration

Hilda rapt It is

Mrs Dale But you must go to bed I must have you fresh in the
morning for youre still at the age when one is fresh in the morning
She sighs The letters Abruptly Do you take notes of
what you feel Hildahere all alone in the night as you say

Hilda shyly I have

Mrs Dale smiling For the diary

Hilda nods and blushes

Mrs Dale caressingly GooseWell to business What is there

Hilda Nothing important except a letter from Stroud  Fayerweather
to say that the question of the royalty on Pomegranate Seed has been
settled in your favor The English publishers of Immolation write
to consult you about a sixshilling edition Olafson the Copenhagen
publisher applies for permission to bring out a Danish translation of
The Idols Feet and the editor of the Semaphore wants a new
serialI think thats all except that Womans Sphere and The
Droplight ask for interviewswith photographs

Mrs Dale The same old story Im so tired of it all To
herself in an undertone But how should I feel if it all stopped
The servant brings in a card

Mrs Dale reading it Is it possible Paul Ventnor To the
servant Show Mr Ventnor up To herself Paul Ventnor

Hilda breathless Oh Mrs Dalethe Mr Ventnor

Mrs Dale smiling I fancy theres only one

Hilda The great great poet Irresolute No I dont
dare

Mrs Dale with a tinge of impatience What

Hilda fervently Ask youif I mightoh here in this corner
where he cant possibly notice mestay just a moment Just to see him come
in To see the meeting between youthe greatest novelist and the greatest
poet of the age Oh its too much to ask Its an historic moment

Mrs Dale Why I suppose it is I hadnt thought of it in that
light Well smiling for the diary

Hilda Oh thank you thank you Ill be off the very instant
Ive heard him speak

Mrs Dale The very instant mind She rises looks at herself
in the glass smooths her hair sits down again and rattles the
teacaddy Isnt the room very warmShe looks over at her
portrait Ive grown stouter since that was painted Youll make a
fortune out of that diary Hilda

Hilda modestly Four publishers have applied to me already

The Servant announces Mr Paul Ventnor

Tall nearing fifty with an incipient stoutness buttoned into a
masterly frockcoat Ventnor drops his glass and advances vaguely with a
shortsighted stare

Ventnor Mrs Dale

Mrs Dale My dear friend This is kind She looks over her
shoulder at Hilda who vanishes through the door to the left The
papers announced your arrival but I hardly hoped

Ventnor whose shortsighted stare is seen to conceal a deeper
embarrassment You hadnt forgotten me then

Mrs Dale Delicious Do you forget that youre public
property

Ventnor Forgotten I mean that we were old friends

Mrs Dale Such old friends May I remind you that its nearly
twenty years since weve met Or do you find cold reminiscences
indigestible

Ventnor On the contrary Ive come to ask you for a dish of
themwell warm them up together Youre my first visit

Mrs Dale How perfect of you So few men visit their women friends
in chronological order or at least they generally do it the other way
round beginning with the present day and working backif theres timeto
prehistoric woman

Ventnor But when prehistoric woman has become historic woman

Mrs Dale Oh its the reflection of my glory that has guided you
here then

Ventnor Its a spirit in my feet that has led me at the first
opportunity to the most delightful spot I know

Mrs Dale Oh the first opportunity

Ventnor I might have seen you very often before but never just in
the right way

Mrs Dale Is this the right way

Ventnor It depends on you to make it so

Mrs Dale What a responsibility What shall I do

Ventnor Talk to memake me think youre a little glad to see me
give me some tea and a cigarette and say youre out to everyone else

Mrs Dale Is that all She hands him a cup of tea The
cigarettes are at your elbow And do you think I shouldnt have been glad
to see you before

Ventnor No I think I should have been too glad to see you

Mrs Dale Dear me what precautions I hope you always wear
goloshes when it looks like rain and never by any chance expose yourself
to a draught But I had an idea that poets courted the emotions

Ventnor Do novelists

Mrs Dale If you ask meon paper

Ventnor Just so thats safest My best things about the sea have
been written on shore He looks at her thoughtfully But it
wouldnt have suited us in the old days would it

Mrs Dale sighing When we were real people

Ventnor Real people

Mrs Dale Are you now I died years ago What you see
before you is a figment of the reporters braina monster manufactured out
of newspaper paragraphs with ink in its veins A keen sense of copyright
is my nearest approach to an emotion

Ventnor sighing Ah well yesas you say were public property

Mrs Dale If one shared equally with the public But the last shred
of my identity is gone

Ventnor Most people would be glad to part with theirs on such
terms I have followed your work with immense interest Immolation
is a masterpiece I read it last summer when it first came out

Mrs Dale with a shade less warmth Immolation has been out
three years

Ventnor Oh by Joveno Surely notBut one is so overwhelmedone
loses count Reproachfully Why have you never sent me your books

Mrs Dale For that very reason

Ventnor deprecatingly You know I didnt mean it for you And
my first bookdo you rememberwas dedicated to you

Mrs Dale Silver Trumpets

Ventnor much interested Have you a copy still by any chance The
first edition I mean Mine was stolen years ago Do you think you could
put your hand on it

Mrs Dale taking a small shabby book from the table at her side
Its here

Ventnor eagerly May I have it Ah thanks This is very
interesting The last copy sold in London for  and they tell me the
next will fetch twice as much Its quite introuvable

Mrs Dale I know that A pause She takes the book from him
opens it and reads half to herself

  How much we two have seen together
    Of other eyes unwist
  Dear as in days of leafless weather
    The willows saffron mist

  Strange as the hour when Hesper swings
    Asea in beryl green
  While overhead on dalliant wings
    The daylight hangs serene

  And thrilling as a meteors fall
    Through depths of lonely sky
  When each to each two watchers call
    I saw itSo did I

Ventnor Thin thinthe troubadour tinkle Odd how little promise
there is in first volumes

Mrs Dale with irresistible emphasis I thought there was a
distinct promise in this

Ventnor seeing his mistake Ahthe one you would never let me
fulfil Sentimentally How inexorable you were You never
dedicated a book to me

Mrs Dale I hadnt begun to write when we werededicating things
to each other

Ventnor Not for the publicbut you wrote for me and wonderful as
you are youve never written anything since that I care for half as much
as

Mrs Dale interested Well

Ventnor Your letters

Mrs Dale in a changed voice My lettersdo you remember them

Ventnor When I dont I reread them

Mrs Dale incredulous You have them still

Ventnor unguardedly You havent mine then

Mrs Dale playfully Oh you were a celebrity already Of course I
kept them Smiling Think what they are worth now I always keep
them locked up in my safe over there She indicates a cabinet

Ventnor after a pause I always carry yours with me

Mrs Dale laughing You

Ventnor Wherever I go A longer pause She looks at him
fixedly I have them with me now

Mrs Dale agitated Youhave them with younow

Ventnor embarrassed Why not One never knows

Mrs Dale Never knows

Ventnor humorously Gadwhen the bankexaminer may come round
You forget Im a married man

Mrs Dale Ahyes

Ventnor sits down beside her I speak to you as I couldnt to
anyone elsewithout deserving a kicking You know how it all came about
A pause Youll bear witness that it wasnt till you denied me all
hope

Mrs Dale a little breathless Yes yes

Ventnor Till you sent me from you

Mrs Dale Its so easy to be heroic when one is young One doesnt
realize how long life is going to last afterward Musing Nor what
weary work it is gathering up the fragments

Ventnor But the time comes when one sends for the chinamender and
has the bits riveted together and turns the cracked side to the wall

Mrs Dale And denies that the article was ever damaged

Ventnor Eh Well the great thing you see is to keep ones self
out of reach of the housemaids brush A pause If youre married
you cantalways Smiling Dont you hate to be taken down and
dusted

Mrs Dale with intention You forget how long ago my husband died
Its fifteen years since Ive been an object of interest to anybody but the
public

Ventnor smiling The only one of your admirers to whom youve ever
given the least encouragement

Mrs Dale Say rather the most easily pleased

Ventnor Or the only one you cared to please

Mrs Dale Ah you havent kept my letters

Ventnor gravely Is that a challenge Look here then He
drams a packet from his pocket and holds it out to her

Mrs Dale taking the packet and looking at him earnestly Why have
you brought me these

Ventnor I didnt bring them they came because I camethats all
Tentatively Are we unwelcome

Mrs Dale who has undone the packet and does not appear to hear
him The very first I ever wrote youthe day after we met at the
concert How on earth did you happen to keep it She glances over
it How perfectly absurd Well its not a compromising document

Ventnor Im afraid none of them are

Mrs Dale quickly Is it to that they owe their immunity Because
one could leave them about like safety matchesAh heres another I
rememberI wrote that the day after we went skating together for the first
time She reads it slowly How odd How very odd

Ventnor What

Mrs Dale Why its the most curious thingI had a letter of this
kind to do the other day in the novel Im at work on nowthe letter of a
woman who is justjust beginning

Ventnor Yesjust beginning

Mrs Dale And do you know I find the best phrase in it the
phrase I somehow regarded as the fruit ofwell of all my subsequent
discoveriesis simply plagiarized word for word from this

Ventnor eagerly I told you so You were all there

Mrs Dale critically But the rest of its poorly donevery
poorly Reads the letter over HmI didnt know how to leave
off It takes me forever to get out of the door

Ventnor gayly Perhaps I was there to prevent you After a
pause I wonder what I said in return

Mrs Dale interested Shall we look She rises Shall
wereally I have them all here you know She goes toward the
cabinet

Ventnor following her with repressed eagerness Ohall

Mrs Dale throws open the door of the cabinet revealing a number of
packets Dont you believe me now

Ventnor Good heavens How I must have repeated myself But then you
were so very deaf

Mrs Dale takes out a packet and returns to her seat Ventnor extends
an impatient hand for the letters Nono wait I want to find your
answer to the one I was just reading After a pause Here it
isyes I thought so

Ventnor What did you think

Mrs Dale triumphantly I thought it was the one in which you
quoted Epipsychidion

Ventnor Mercy Did I quote things I dont wonder you were
cruel

Mrs Dale Ah and heres the otherthe one Ithe one I didnt
answerfor a long time Do you remember

Ventnor with emotion Do I remember I wrote it the morning after
we heard Isolde

Mrs Dale disappointed Nono That wasnt the one I
didnt answer Herethis is the one I mean

Ventnor takes it curiously Ahhmthis is very like unrolling a
mummyhe glances at herwith a live grain of wheat in it
perhapsOh by Jove

Mrs Dale What

Ventnor Why this is the one I made a sonnet out of afterward By
Jove Id forgotten where that idea came from You may know the lines
perhaps Theyre in the fourth volume of my Complete EditionIts the
thing beginning

  Love came to me with unrelenting eyes

one of my best I rather fancy Of course here its very crudely putthe
values arent brought outah this touch is good thoughvery good Hm I
daresay there might be other material He glances toward the
cabinet

Mrs Dale drily The live grain of wheat as you said

Ventnor Ah wellmy first harvest was sown on rocky
groundnow I plant for the fowls of the air Rising and walking
toward the cabinet When can I come and carry off all this rubbish

Mrs Dale Carry it off

Ventnor embarrassed My dear lady surely between you and me
explicitness is a burden You must see that these letters of ours cant be
left to take their chance like an ordinary correspondenceyou said
yourself we were public property

Mrs Dale To take their chance Do you suppose that in my keeping
your letters take any chances Suddenly Do minein yours

Ventnor still more embarrassed Helen He takes a turn
through the room You force me to remind you that you and I are
differently situatedthat in a moment of madness I sacrificed the only
right you ever gave methe right to love you better than any other
woman in the world A pause She says nothing and he continues with
increasing difficulty You asked me just now why I carried your
letters about with mekept them literally in my own hands Well suppose
its to be sure of their not falling into some one elses

Mrs Dale Oh

Ventnor throws himself into a chair For Gods sake dont pity me

Mrs Dale after a long pause Am I dullor are you trying to say
that you want to give me back my letters

Ventnor starting up I Give you back God forbid Your letters
Not for the world The only thing I have left But you cant dream that in
my hands

Mrs Dale suddenly You want yours then

Ventnor repressing his eagerness My dear friend if Id ever
dreamed that youd kept them

Mrs Dale accusingly You do want them A pause He
makes a deprecatory gesture Why should they be less safe with me than
mine with you I never forfeited the right to keep them

Ventnor after another pause Its compensation enough almost
to have you reproach me He moves nearer to her but she makes no
response You forget that Ive forfeited all my rightseven
that of letting you keep my letters

Mrs Dale You do want them She rises throws all the
letters into the cabinet locks the door and puts the key in her
pocket Theres my answer

Ventnor Helen

Mrs Dale Ah I paid dearly enough for the right to keep them and
I mean to She turns to him passionately Have you ever asked
yourself how I paid for it With what months and years of solitude what
indifference to flattery what resistance to affectionOh dont smile
because I said affection and not love Affections a warm cloak in cold
weather and I have been cold and I shall keep on growing colder
Dont talk to me about living in the hearts of my readers We both know
what kind of a domicile that is Why before long I shall become a classic
Bound in sets and kept on the top bookshelfbrr doesnt that sound
freezing I foresee the day when I shall be as lonely as an Etruscan
museum She breaks into a laugh Thats what Ive paid for the
right to keep your letters She holds out her hand And now give
me mine

Ventnor Yours

Mrs Dale haughtily Yes I claim them

Ventnor in the same tone On what ground

Mrs Dale Hear the manBecause I wrote them of course

Ventnor But it seems to me thatunder your inspiration I admitI
also wrote mine

Mrs Dale Oh I dont dispute their authenticityits yours I
deny

Ventnor Mine

Mrs Dale You voluntarily ceased to be the man who wrote me those
lettersyouve admitted as much You traded paper for flesh and blood I
dont dispute your wisdomonly you must hold to your bargain The letters
are all mine

Ventnor groping between two tones Your arguments are as
convincing as ever He hazards a faint laugh Youre a marvellous
dialecticianbut if were going to settle the matter in the spirit of an
arbitration treaty why there are accepted conventions in such cases Its
an odious way to put it but since you wont help me one of them is

Mrs Dale One of them is

Ventnor That it is usualthat technically I mean the
letterbelongs to its writer

Mrs Dale after a pause Such letters as these

Ventnor Such letters especially

Mrs Dale But you couldnt have written them if I hadntbeen
willing to read them Surely theres more of myself in them than of you

Ventnor Surely theres nothing in which a man puts more of himself
than in his loveletters

Mrs Dale with emotion But a womans loveletters are like her child
They belong to her more than to anybody else

Ventnor And a mans

Mrs Dale with sudden violence Are all he risksThere take
them She flings the key of the cabinet at his feet and sinks into a
chair

Ventnor starts as though to pick up the key then approaches and bends
over her Helenoh Helen

Mrs Dale she yields her hands to him murmuring Paul
Suddenly she straightens herself and draws back illuminated What
a fool I am I see it all now You want them for your memoirs

Ventnor disconcerted Helen

Mrs Dale agitated Come comethe rule is to unmask when the
signals given You want them for your memoirs

Ventnor with a forced laugh What makes you think so

Mrs Dale triumphantly Because I want them for mine

Ventnor in a changed tone Ah He moves away from her and
leans against the mantelpiece She remains seated with her eyes fixed on
him

Mrs Dale I wonder I didnt see it sooner Your reasons were lame
enough

Ventnor ironically Yours were masterly Youre the more
accomplished actor of the two I was completely deceived

Mrs Dale Oh Im a novelist I can keep up that sort of thing for
five hundred pages

Ventnor I congratulate you A pause

Mrs Dale moving to her seat behind the teatable Ive never
offered you any tea She bends over the kettle Why dont you take
your letters

Ventnor Because youve been clever enough to make it impossible for
me He picks up the key and hands it to her Then abruptlyWas it
all actingjust now

Mrs Dale By what right do you ask

Ventnor By right of renouncing my claim to my letters Keep
themand tell me

Mrs Dale I give you back your claimand I refuse to tell you

Ventnor sadly Ah Helen if you deceived me you deceived
yourself also

Mrs Dale What does it matter now that were both undeceived I
played a losing game thats all

Ventnor Why losingsince all the letters are yours

Mrs Dale The letters Slowly Id forgotten the letters

Ventnor exultant Ah I knew youd end by telling me the truth

Mrs Dale The truth Where is the truth Half to
herself I thought I was lying when I beganbut the lies turned into
truth as I uttered them She looks at Ventnor I did want
your letters for my memoirsI did think Id kept them for that
purposeand I wanted to get mine back for the same reasonbut now she
puts out her hand and picks up some of her letters which are lying
scattered on the table near herhow fresh they seem and how they
take me back to the time when we lived instead of writing about life

Ventnor smiling The time when we didnt prepare our impromptu
effects beforehand and copyright our remarks about the weather

Mrs Dale Or keep our epigrams in cold storage and our adjectives
under lock and key

Ventnor When our emotions werent worth ten cents a word and a
signature wasnt an autograph Ah Helen after all theres nothing like
the exhilaration of spending ones capital

Mrs Dale Of wasting it you mean She points to the
letters Do you suppose we could have written a word of these if wed
known we were putting our dreams out at interest She sits musing with
her eyes on the fire and he watches her in silence Paul do you
remember the deserted garden we sometimes used to walk in

Ventnor The old garden with the high wall at the end of the village
street The garden with the ruined boxborders and the brokendown arbor
Why I remember every weed in the paths and every patch of moss on the
walls

Mrs Dale WellI went back there the other day The village is
immensely improved Theres a new hotel with gasfires and a trolley in
the main street and the garden has been turned into a public park where
excursionists sit on castiron benches admiring the statue of an
Abolitionist

Ventnor An Abolitionisthow appropriate

Mrs Dale And the man who sold the garden has made a fortune that
he doesnt know how to spend

Ventnor rising impulsively Helen he approaches and lays his
hand on her letters lets sacrifice our fortune and keep the
excursionists out

Mrs Dale with a responsive movement Paul do you really mean it

Ventnor gayly Mean it Why I feel like a landed proprietor
already Its more than a gardenits a park

Mrs Dale Its more than a park its a worldas long as we keep
it to ourselves

Ventnor Ah yeseven the pyramids look small when one sees a
Cooks tourist on top of them He takes the key from the table unlocks
the cabinet and brings out his letters which he lays beside hers
Shall we burn the key to our garden

Mrs Dale Ah then it will indeed be boundless Watching him
while he throws the letters into the fire

Ventnor turning back to her with a halfsad smile But not too big
for us to find each other in

Mrs Dale Since we shall be the only people there He takes
both her hands and they look at each other a moment in silence Then he
goes out by the door to the right As he reaches the door she takes a step
toward him impulsively then turning back she leans against the
chimneypiece quietly watching the letters burn




THE REMBRANDT


Youre so artistic my cousin Eleanor Copt began

Of all Eleanors exordiums it is the one I most dread When she tells me
Im so clever I know this is merely the preamble to inviting me to meet the
last literary obscurity of the moment a trial to be evaded or endured as
circumstances dictate whereas her calling me artistic fatally connotes
the request to visit in her company some distressed gentlewoman whose
future hangs on my valuation of her old Saxe or of her grandfathers
Marc Antonios Time was when I attempted to resist these compulsions of
Eleanors but I soon learned that short of actual flight there was
no refuge from her beneficent despotism It is not always easy for the
curator of a museum to abandon his post on the plea of escaping a pretty
cousins importunities and Eleanor aware of my predicament is none
too magnanimous to take advantage of it Magnanimity is in fact not in
Eleanors line The virtues she once explained to me are like bonnets
the very ones that look best on other people may not happen to suit ones
own particular style and she added with a slight deflection of metaphor
that none of the readymade virtues ever had fitted her they all
pinched somewhere and shed given up trying to wear them

Therefore when she said to me Youre so artistic emphasizing the
conjunction with a tap of her dripping umbrella Eleanor is out in all
weathers the elements are as powerless against her as man I merely
stipulated Its not old Saxe again

She shook her head reassuringly A picturea Rembrandt

Good Lord Why not a Leonardo

Wellshe smiledthat of course depends on you

On me

On your attribution I dare say Mrs Fontage would consent to the
changethough shes very conservative

A gleam of hope came to me and I pronounced One cant judge of a picture
in this weather

Of course not Im coming for you tomorrow

Ive an engagement tomorrow

Ill come before or after your engagement

The afternoon paper lay at my elbow and I contrived a furtive consultation
of the weatherreport It said Rain tomorrow and I answered briskly
All right then come at tenrapidly calculating that the clouds on
which I counted might lift by noon

My ingenuity failed of its due reward for the heavens as if in league
with my cousin emptied themselves before morning and punctually at ten
Eleanor and the sun appeared together in my office

I hardly listened as we descended the Museum steps and got into Eleanors
hansom to her vivid summingup of the case I guessed beforehand that the
lady we were about to visit had lapsed by the most distressful degrees from
opulence to a hallbedroom that her grandfather if he had not been
Minister to France had signed the Declaration of Independence that the
Rembrandt was an heirloom sole remnant of disbanded treasures that for
years its possessor had been unwilling to part with it and that even now
the question of its disposal must be approached with the most diplomatic
obliquity

Previous experience had taught me that all Eleanors cases presented a
harrowing similarity of detail No circumstance tending to excite the
spectators sympathy and involve his action was omitted from the history of
her beneficiaries the lights and shades were indeed so skilfully adjusted
that any impartial expression of opinion took on the hue of cruelty I
could have produced closetfuls of heirlooms in attestation of this fact
for it is one more mark of Eleanors competence that her friends usually
pay the interest on her philanthropy My one hope was that in this case the
object being a picture might reasonably be rated beyond my means and
as our cab drew up before a blistered brownstone doorstep I formed the
selfdefensive resolve to place an extreme valuation on Mrs Fontages
Rembrandt It is Eleanors fault if she is sometimes fought with her own
weapons

The house stood in one of those shabby provisionallooking New York streets
that seem resignedly awaiting demolition It was the kind of house that
in its high days must have had a bowwindow with a bronze in it The
bowwindow had been replaced by a plumbers devanture and one might
conceive the bronze to have gravitated to the limbo where Mexican onyx
tables and bricabrac in buffalohorn await the first signs of our next
aesthetic reaction

Eleanor swept me through a hall that smelled of poverty up unlit stairs to
a bare slit of a room And she must leave this in a month she whispered
across her knock

I had prepared myself for the limp widows weed of a woman that one figures
in such a setting and confronted abruptly with Mrs Fontages whitehaired
erectness I had the disconcerting sense that I was somehow in her presence
at my own solicitation I instinctively charged Eleanor with this reversal
of the situation but a moment later I saw it must be ascribed to a
something about Mrs Fontage that precluded the possibility of her asking
any one a favor It was not that she was of forbidding or even majestic
demeanor but that one guessed under her aquiline prettiness a dignity
nervously on guard against the petty betrayal of her surroundings The
room was unconcealably poor the little faded relics the highstocked
ancestral silhouettes the steelengravings after Raphael and Correggio
grouped in a vain attempt to hide the most obvious stains on the
wallpaper served only to accentuate the contrast of a past evidently
diversified by foreign travel and the enjoyment of the arts Even Mrs
Fontages dress had the air of being a last expedient the ultimate outcome
of a muchtaxed ingenuity in darning and turning One felt that all the
poor ladys barriers were falling save that of her impregnable manner

To this manner I found myself conveying my appreciation of being admitted
to a view of the Rembrandt

Mrs Fontages smile took my homage for granted It is always she
conceded a privilege to be in the presence of the great masters Her
slim wrinkled hand waved me to a dusky canvas near the window

Its so interesting dear Mrs Fontage I heard Eleanor
exclaiming and my cousin will be able to tell you exactly Eleanor in
my presence always admits that she knows nothing about art but she gives
the impression that this is merely because she hasnt had time to look into
the matterand has had me to do it for her

Mrs Fontage seated herself without speaking as though fearful that a
breath might disturb my communion with the masterpiece I felt that she
thought Eleanors reassuring ejaculations illtimed and in this I was of
one mind with her for the impossibility of telling her exactly what I
thought of her Rembrandt had become clear to me at a glance

My cousins vivacities began to languish and the silence seemed to shape
itself into a receptacle for my verdict I stepped back affecting a more
distant scrutiny and as I did so my eye caught Mrs Fontages profile Her
lids trembled slightly I took refuge in the familiar expedient of asking
the history of the picture and she waved me brightly to a seat

This was indeed a topic on which she could dilate The Rembrandt it
appeared had come into Mr Fontages possession many years ago while
the young couple were on their weddingtour and under circumstances so
romantic that she made no excuse for relating them in all their parenthetic
fulness The picture belonged to an old Belgian Countess of redundant
quarterings whom the extravagances of an ungovernable nephew had compelled
to part with her possessions in the most private manner about the time of
the Fontages arrival By a really remarkable coincidence it happened that
their courier an exceptionally intelligent and superior man was an old
servant of the Countesss and had thus been able to put them in the way of
securing the Rembrandt under the very nose of an English Duke whose agent
had been sent to Brussels to negotiate for its purchase Mrs Fontage could
not recall the Dukes name but he was a great collector and had a famous
Highland castle where somebody had been murdered and which she herself
had visited by moonlight when she had travelled in Scotland as a girl
The episode had in short been one of the most interesting experiences of
a tour almost chromolithographic in vivacity of impression and they had
always meant to go back to Brussels for the sake of reliving so picturesque
a moment Circumstances of which the narrators surroundings declared the
nature had persistently interfered with the projected return to Europe
and the picture had grown doubly valuable as representing the highwater
mark of their artistic emotions Mrs Fontages moist eye caressed the
canvas There is only she added with a perceptible effort one slight
drawback the picture is not signed But for that the Countess of course
would have sold it to a museum All the connoisseurs who have seen it
pronounce it an undoubted Rembrandt in the artists best manner but the
museumsshe arched her brows in smiling recognition of a wellknown
weaknessgive the preference to signed examples

Mrs Fontages words evoked so touching a vision of the young tourists of
fifty years ago entrusting to an accomplished and versatile courier the
direction of their helpless zeal for art that I lost sight for a moment
of the point at issue The old Belgian Countess the wealthy Duke with a
feudal castle in Scotland Mrs Fontages own maiden pilgrimage to Arthurs
Seat and Holyrood all the accessories of the naf transaction seemed
a part of that vanished Europe to which our young race carried its
indiscriminate ardors its tender romantic credulity the legendary
castellated Europe of keepsakes brigands and old masters that
compensated by one such experience as Mrs Fontages for an afterlife
of aesthetic privation

I was restored to the present by Eleanors looking at her watch The action
mutely conveyed that something was expected of me I risked the temporizing
statement that the picture was very interesting but Mrs Fontages polite
assent revealed the poverty of the expedient Eleanors impatience
overflowed

You would like my cousin to give you an idea of its value she suggested

Mrs Fontage grew more erect No one she corrected with great
gentleness can know its value quite as well as I who live with it

We murmured our hasty concurrence

But it might be interesting to hearshe addressed herself to meas a
mere matter of curiositywhat estimate would be put on it from the purely
commercial point of viewif such a term may be used in speaking of a work
of art

I sounded a note of deprecation

Oh I understand of course she delicately anticipated me that that
could never be your view your personal view but since occasions
may arisedo arisewhen it becomes necessary toto put a price on
the priceless as it wereI have thoughtMiss Copt has suggested

Some day Eleanor encouraged her you might feel that the picture ought
to belong to some one who has moremore opportunity of showing itletting
it be seen by the publicfor educational reasons

I have tried Mrs Fontage admitted to see it in that light

The crucial moment was upon me To escape the challenge of Mrs Fontages
brilliant composure I turned once more to the picture If my courage needed
reinforcement the picture amply furnished it Looking at that lamentable
canvas seemed the surest way of gathering strength to denounce it but
behind me all the while I felt Mrs Fontages shuddering pride drawn
up in a final effort of selfdefense I hated myself for my sentimental
perversion of the situation Reason argued that it was more cruel to
deceive Mrs Fontage than to tell her the truth but that merely proved the
inferiority of reason to instinct in situations involving any concession to
the emotions Along with her faith in the Rembrandt I must destroy not only
the whole fabric of Mrs Fontages past but even that lifelong habit of
acquiescence in untested formulas that makes the best part of the average
feminine strength I guessed the episode of the picture to be inextricably
interwoven with the traditions and convictions which served to veil Mrs
Fontages destitution not only from others but from herself Viewed in
that light the Rembrandt had perhaps been worth its purchasemoney and I
regretted that works of art do not commonly sell on the merit of the moral
support they may have rendered

From this unavailing flight I was recalled by the sense that something
must be done To place a fictitious value on the picture was at best a
provisional measure while the brutal alternative of advising Mrs Fontage
to sell it for a hundred dollars at least afforded an opening to the
charitably disposed purchaser I intended if other resources failed
to put myself forward in that light but delicacy of course forbade my
coupling my unflattering estimate of the Rembrandt with an immediate offer
to buy it All I could do was to inflict the wound the healing unguent
must be withheld for later application

I turned to Mrs Fontage who sat motionless her finelylined cheeks
touched with an expectant color her eyes averted from the picture which
was so evidently the one object they beheld

My dear madam I began Her vivid smile was like a light held up to
dazzle me It shrouded every alternative in darkness and I had the flurried
sense of having lost my way among the intricacies of my contention Of
a sudden I felt the hopelessness of finding a crack in her impenetrable
conviction My words slipped from me like broken weapons The picture
I faltered would of course be worth more if it were signed As it is
II hardly thinkon a conservative estimateit can be valued atat
morethana thousand dollars say

My deflected argument ran on somewhat aimlessly till it found itself
plunging full tilt against the barrier of Mrs Fontages silence She sat
as impassive as though I had not spoken Eleanor loosed a few fluttering
words of congratulation and encouragement but their flight was suddenly
cut short Mrs Fontage had risen with a certain solemnity

I could never she said gentlyher gentleness was adamantineunder any
circumstances whatever consider for a moment even the possibility of
parting with the picture at such a price


II

Within three weeks a tremulous note from Mrs Fontage requested the favor
of another visit If the writing was tremulous however the writers tone
was firm She named her own day and hour without the conventional
reference to her visitors convenience

My first impulse was to turn the note over to Eleanor I had acquitted
myself of my share in the ungrateful business of coming to Mrs Fontages
aid and if as her letter denoted she had now yielded to the closer
pressure of need the business of finding a purchaser for the Rembrandt
might well be left to my cousins ingenuity But here conscience put in
the uncomfortable reminder that it was I who in putting a price on the
picture had raised the real obstacle in the way of Mrs Fontages rescue
No one would give a thousand dollars for the Rembrandt but to tell
Mrs Fontage so had become as unthinkable as murder I had in fact on
returning from my first inspection of the picture refrained from imparting
to Eleanor my opinion of its value Eleanor is porous and I knew that
sooner or later the unnecessary truth would exude through the loose texture
of her dissimulation Not infrequently she thus creates the misery she
alleviates and I have sometimes suspected her of paining people in order
that she might be sorry for them I had at all events cut off retreat in
Eleanors direction and the remaining alternative carried me straight to
Mrs Fontage

She received me with the same commanding sweetness The room was even barer
than beforeI believe the carpet was gonebut her manner built up about
her a palace to which I was welcomed with high state and it was as a mere
incident of the ceremony that I was presently made aware of her decision to
sell the Rembrandt My previous unsuccess in planning how to deal with Mrs
Fontage had warned me to leave my farther course to chance and I listened
to her explanation with complete detachment She had resolved to travel for
her health her doctor advised it and as her absence might be indefinitely
prolonged she had reluctantly decided to part with the picture in order
to avoid the expense of storage and insurance Her voice drooped at the
admission and she hurried on detailing the vague itinerary of a journey
that was to combine longpromised visits to impatient friends with various
interesting opportunities less definitely specified The poor ladys
skill in rearing a screen of verbiage about her enforced avowal had
distracted me from my own share in the situation and it was with dismay
that I suddenly caught the drift of her assumptions She expected me to
buy the Rembrandt for the Museum she had taken my previous valuation as a
tentative bid and when I came to my senses she was in the act of accepting
my offer

Had I had a thousand dollars of my own to dispose of the bargain would
have been concluded on the spot but I was in the impossible position of
being materially unable to buy the picture and morally unable to tell her
that it was not worth acquiring for the Museum

I dashed into the first evasion in sight I had no authority I explained
to purchase pictures for the Museum without the consent of the committee

Mrs Fontage coped for a moment in silence with the incredible fact
that I had rejected her offer then she ventured with a kind of pale
precipitation But I understoodMiss Copt tells me that you practically
decide such matters for the committee I could guess what the effort had
cost her

My cousin is given to generalizations My opinion may have some weight
with the committee

Well then she timidly prompted

For that very reason I cant buy the picture

She said with a drooping note I dont understand

Yet you told me I reminded her that you knew museums didnt buy
unsigned pictures

Not for what they are worth Every one knows that But II
understoodthe price you named Her pride shuddered back from the
abasement Its a misunderstanding then she faltered

To avoid looking at her I glanced desperately at the Rembrandt Could
I But reason rejected the possibility Even if the committee had been
blindand they all were but CrozierI simply shouldnt have dared
to do it I stood up feeling that to cut the matter short was the only
alleviation within reach

Mrs Fontage had summoned her indomitable smile but its brilliancy
dropped as I opened the door like a candle blown out by a draught

If theres any one elseif you knew any one who would care to see the
picture I should be most happy She kept her eyes on me and I saw that
in her case it hurt less than to look at the Rembrandt I shall have to
leave here you know she panted if nobody cares to have it


III

That evening at my club I had just succeeded in losing sight of Mrs
Fontage in the fumes of an excellent cigar when a voice at my elbow evoked
her harassing image

I want to talk to you the speaker said about Mrs Fontages
Rembrandt

There isnt any I was about to growl but looking up I recognized the
confiding countenance of Mr Jefferson Rose

Mr Rose was known to me chiefly as a young man suffused with a vague
enthusiasm for Virtue and my cousin Eleanor

One glance at his glossy exterior conveyed the assurance that his morals
were as immaculate as his complexion and his linen Goodness exuded from
his moist eye his liquid voice the warm damp pressure of his trustful
hand He had always struck me as one of the most uncomplicated organisms
I had ever met His ideas were as simple and inconsecutive as the
propositions in a primer and he spoke slowly with a kind of uniformity
of emphasis that made his words stand out like the raised type for the
blind An obvious incapacity for abstract conceptions made him peculiarly
susceptible to the magic of generalization and one felt he would have been
at the mercy of any Cause that spelled itself with a capital letter It was
hard to explain how with such a superabundance of merit he managed to be
a good fellow I can only say that he performed the astonishing feat as
naturally as he supported an invalid mother and two sisters on the slender
salary of a bankers clerk He sat down beside me with an air of bright
expectancy

Its a remarkable picture isnt it he said

Youve seen it

Ive been so fortunate Miss Copt was kind enough to get Mrs Fontages
permission we went this afternoon I inwardly wished that Eleanor
had selected another victim unless indeed the visit were part of a
plan whereby some third person better equipped for the cultivation of
delusions was to be made to think the Rembrandt remarkable Knowing the
limitations of Mr Roses resources I began to wonder if he had any rich
aunts

And her buying it in that way too he went on with his limpid smile
from that old Countess in Brussels makes it all the more interesting
doesnt it Miss Copt tells me its very seldom old pictures can be traced
back for more than a generation I suppose the fact of Mrs Fontages
knowing its history must add a good deal to its value

Uncertain as to his drift I said In her eyes it certainly appears to

Implications are lost on Mr Rose who glowingly continued Thats the
reason why I wanted to talk to you about itto consult you Miss Copt
tells me you value it at a thousand dollars

There was no denying this and I grunted a reluctant assent

Of course he went on earnestly your valuation is based on the fact
that the picture isnt signedMrs Fontage explained that and it does
make a difference certainly But the thing isif the pictures really
goodought one to take advantage I meanone can see that Mrs Fontage
is in a tight place and I wouldnt for the world

My astonished stare arrested him

You wouldnt

I meanyou see its just this way he coughed and blushed I cant
give more than a thousand dollars myselfits as big a sum as I can manage
to scrape togetherbut before I make the offer I want to be sure Im not
standing in the way of her getting more money

My astonishment lapsed to dismay Youre going to buy the picture for a
thousand dollars

His blush deepened Why yes It sounds rather absurd I suppose It isnt
much in my line of course I can see the pictures very beautiful but Im
no judgeit isnt the kind of thing naturally that I could afford to go
in for but in this case Im very glad to do what I can the circumstances
are so distressing and knowing what you think of the picture I feel its a
pretty safe investment

I dont think I blurted out

You

I dont think the pictures worth a thousand dollars I dont think its
worth ten cents I simply lied about it thats all

Mr Rose looked as frightened as though I had charged him with the offense

Hang it man cant you see how it happened I saw the poor womans pride
and happiness hung on her faith in that picture I tried to make her
understand that it was worthlessbut she wouldnt I tried to tell her
sobut I couldnt I behaved like a maudlin ass but you shant pay for my
infernal bunglingyou mustnt buy the picture

Mr Rose sat silent tapping one glossy boottip with another Suddenly he
turned on me a glance of stored intelligence But you know he said
goodhumoredly I rather think I must

You haventalready

Oh no the offers not made

Well then

His look gathered a brighter significance

But if the pictures worth nothing nobody will buy it

I groaned

Except he continued some fellow like me who doesnt know anything
I think its lovely you know I mean to hang it in my mothers
sittingroom He rose and clasped my hand in his adhesive pressure Im
awfully obliged to you for telling me this but perhaps you wont mind my
asking you not to mention our talk to Miss Copt It might bother her you
know to think the picture isnt exactly up to the mark and it wont make
a rap of difference to me


IV

Mr Rose left me to a sleepless night The next morning my resolve was
formed and it carried me straight to Mrs Fontages She answered my knock
by stepping out on the landing and as she shut the door behind her I
caught a glimpse of her devastated interior She mentioned with a careful
avoidance of the note of pathos on which our last conversation had closed
that she was preparing to leave that afternoon and the trunks obstructing
the threshold showed that her preparations were nearly complete They were
I felt certain the same trunks that strapped behind a rattling vettura
had accompanied the bride and groom on that memorable voyage of discovery
of which the booty had till recently adorned her walls and there was a
dim consolation in the thought that those early finds in coral and Swiss
woodcarving in lava and alabaster still lay behind the worn locks in
the security of worthlessness

Mrs Fontage on the landing among her strapped and corded treasures
maintained the same air of stability that made it impossible even under
such conditions to regard her flight as anything less dignified than
a departure It was the moral support of what she tacitly assumed that
enabled me to set forth with proper deliberation the object of my visit
and she received my announcement with an absence of surprise that struck
me as the very flower of tact Under cover of these mutual assumptions the
transaction was rapidly concluded and it was not till the canvas passed
into my hands that as though the physical contact had unnerved her
Mrs Fontage suddenly faltered Its the giving it up she stammered
disguising herself to the last and I hastened away from the collapse of
her splendid effrontery

I need hardly point out that I had acted impulsively and that reaction
from the most honorable impulses is sometimes attended by moral
perturbation My motives had indeed been mixed enough to justify some
uneasiness but this was allayed by the instinctive feeling that it is more
venial to defraud an institution than a man Since Mrs Fontage had to be
kept from starving by means not wholly defensible it was better that the
obligation should be borne by a rich institution than an impecunious youth
I doubt in fact if my scruples would have survived a nights sleep had
they not been complicated by some uncertainty as to my own future It was
true that subject to the purely formal assent of the committee I had
full power to buy for the Museum and that the one member of the committee
likely to dispute my decision was opportunely travelling in Europe but the
picture once in place I must face the risk of any expert criticism to which
chance might expose it I dismissed this contingency for future study
stored the Rembrandt in the cellar of the Museum and thanked heaven that
Crozier was abroad

Six months later he strolled into my office I had just concluded under
conditions of exceptional difficulty and on terms unexpectedly benign
the purchase of the great Bartley Reynolds and this circumstance by
relegating the matter of the Rembrandt to a lower stratum of consciousness
enabled me to welcome Crozier with unmixed pleasure My security
was enhanced by his appearance His smile was charged with amiable
reminiscences and I inferred that his trip had put him in the humor
to approve of everything or at least to ignore what fell short of his
approval I had therefore no uneasiness in accepting his invitation to dine
that evening It is always pleasant to dine with Crozier and never more so
than when he is just back from Europe His conversation gives even the food
a flavor of the Caf Anglais

The repast was delightful and it was not till we had finished a Camembert
which he must have brought over with him that my host said in a tone of
afterdinner perfunctoriness I see youve picked up a picture or two
since I left

I assented The Bartley Reynolds seemed too good an opportunity to miss
especially as the French government was after it I think we got it
cheap

Connu connu said Crozier pleasantly I know all about the
Reynolds It was the biggest kind of a haul and I congratulate you Best
stroke of business weve done yet But tell me about the other picturethe
Rembrandt

I never said it was a Rembrandt I could hardly have said why but I felt
distinctly annoyed with Crozier

Of course not Theres Rembrandt on the frame but I saw youd
modified it to Dutch School I apologize He paused but I offered no
explanation What about it he went on Where did you pick it up As
he leaned to the flame of the cigarlighter his face seemed ruddy with
enjoyment

I got it for a song I said

A thousand I think

Have you seen it I asked abruptly

Went over the place this afternoon and found it in the cellar Why hasnt
it been hung by the way

I paused a moment Im waiting

To

To have it varnished

Ah He leaned back and poured himself a second glass of Chartreuse The
smile he confided to its golden depths provoked me to challenge him with

What do you think of it

The Rembrandt He lifted his eyes from the glass Just what you do

It isnt a Rembrandt

I apologize again You call it I believe a picture of the same period

Im uncertain of the period

Hm He glanced appreciatively along his cigar What are you certain
of

That its a damned bad picture I said savagely

He nodded Just so Thats all we wanted to know

We

WeIthe committee in short You see my dear fellow if you hadnt
been certain it was a damned bad picture our position would have been a
little awkward As it is my remaining dutyI ought to explain that in
this matter Im acting for the committeeis as simple as its agreeable

Ill be hanged I burst out if I understand one word youre saying

He fixed me with a kind of cruel joyousness You willyou will he
assured me at least youll begin to when you hear that Ive seen Miss
Copt

Miss Copt

And that she has told me under what conditions the picture was bought

She doesnt know anything about the conditions That is I added
hastening to restrict the assertion she doesnt know my opinion of the
picture I thirsted for five minutes with Eleanor

Are you quite sure Crozier took me up Mr Jefferson Rose does

AhI see

I thought you would he reminded me As soon as Id laid eyes on
the RembrandtI beg your pardonI saw that itwell required some
explanation

You might have come to me

I meant to but I happened to meet Miss Copt whose encyclopdic
information has often before been of service to me I always go to Miss
Copt when I want to look up anything and I found she knew all about the
Rembrandt

All

Precisely The knowledge was in fact causing her sleepless nights Mr
Rose who was suffering from the same form of insomnia had taken her into
his confidence and sheultimatelytook me into hers

Of course

I must ask you to do your cousin justice She didnt speak till it became
evident to her uncommonly quick perceptions that your buying the picture on
its merits would have been infinitely worse forfor everybodythan your
diverting a small portion of the Museums funds to philanthropic uses Then
she told me the moving incident of Mr Rose Good fellow Rose And the
old ladys case was desperate Somebody had to buy that picture I moved
uneasily in my seat Wait a moment will you I havent finished my cigar
Theres a little head of Il Fiammingos that you havent seen by the way
I picked it up the other day in Parma Well go in and have a look at it
presently But meanwhile what I want to say is that Ive been chargedin
the most informal wayto express to you the committees appreciation of
your admirable promptness and energy in capturing the Bartley Reynolds We
shouldnt have got it at all if you hadnt been uncommonly wideawake and
to get it at such a price is a double triumph Wed have thought nothing of
a few more thousands

I dont see I impatiently interposed that as far as Im concerned
that alters the case

The case

Of Mrs Fontages Rembrandt I bought the picture because as you say the
situation was desperate and I couldnt raise a thousand myself What I did
was of course indefensible but the money shall be refunded tomorrow

Crozier raised a protesting hand Dont interrupt me when Im talking ex
cathedra The moneys been refunded already The fact is the Museum has
sold the Rembrandt

I stared at him wildly Sold it To whom

Whyto the committeeHold on a bit pleaseWont you take another
cigar Then perhaps I can finish what Ive got to sayWhy my dear
fellow the committees under an obligation to youthats the way we look
at it Ive investigated Mrs Fontages case andwell the picture had to
be bought Shes eating meat now I believe for the first time in a year
And theyd have turned her out into the street that very day your cousin
tells me Something had to be done at once and youve simply given a
number of welltodo and selfindulgent gentlemen the opportunity of
performing at very small individual expense a meritorious action in
the nick of time Thats the first thing Ive got to thank you for And
thenyoull remember please that I have the floorthat Im still
speaking for the committeeand secondly as a slight recognition of your
services in securing the Bartley Reynolds at a very much lower figure than
we were prepared to pay we beg youthe committee begs youto accept the
gift of Mrs Fontages Rembrandt Now well go in and look at that little
head




THE MOVING FINGER


The news of Mrs Grancys death came to me with the shock of an immense
blunderone of fates most irretrievable acts of vandalism It was as
though all sorts of renovating forces had been checked by the clogging of
that one wheel Not that Mrs Grancy contributed any perceptible momentum
to the social machine her unique distinction was that of filling to
perfection her special place in the world So many people are like
badlycomposed statues overlapping their niches at one point and leaving
them vacant at another Mrs Grancys niche was her husbands life and if
it be argued that the space was not large enough for its vacancy to leave a
very big gap I can only say that at the last resort such dimensions must
be determined by finer instruments than any readymade standard of utility
Ralph Grancys was in short a kind of disembodied usefulness one of those
constructive influences that instead of crystallizing into definite forms
remain as it were a medium for the development of clear thinking and fine
feeling He faithfully irrigated his own dusty patch of life and the
fruitful moisture stole far beyond his boundaries If to carry on the
metaphor Grancys life was a sedulouslycultivated enclosure his wife was
the flower he had planted in its midstthe embowering tree rather which
gave him rest and shade at its foot and the wind of dreams in its upper
branches

We had allhis small but devoted band of followersknown a moment when it
seemed likely that Grancy would fail us We had watched him pitted against
one stupid obstacle after anotherillhealth poverty misunderstanding
and worst of all for a man of his texture his first wifes soft insidious
egotism We had seen him sinking under the leaden embrace of her affection
like a swimmer in a drowning clutch but just as we despaired he had always
come to the surface again blinded panting but striking out fiercely for
the shore When at last her death released him it became a question as to
how much of the man she had carried with her Left alone he revealed numb
withered patches like a tree from which a parasite has been stripped But
gradually he began to put out new leaves and when he met the lady who
was to become his second wifehis one real wife as his friends
reckonedthe whole man burst into flower

The second Mrs Grancy was past thirty when he married her and it was
clear that she had harvested that crop of middle joy which is rooted in
young despair But if she had lost the surface of eighteen she had kept
its inner light if her cheek lacked the gloss of immaturity her eyes were
young with the stored youth of half a lifetime Grancy had first known her
somewhere in the EastI believe she was the sister of one of our consuls
out thereand when he brought her home to New York she came among us as
a stranger The idea of Grancys remarriage had been a shock to us all
After one such calcining most men would have kept out of the fire but we
agreed that he was predestined to sentimental blunders and we awaited
with resignation the embodiment of his latest mistake Then Mrs Grancy
cameand we understood She was the most beautiful and the most complete
of explanations We shuffled our defeated omniscience out of sight and gave
it hasty burial under a prodigality of welcome For the first time in years
we had Grancy off our minds Hell do something great now the least
sanguine of us prophesied and our sentimentalist emended He has
done itin marrying her

It was Claydon the portraitpainter who risked this hyperbole and who
soon afterward at the happy husbands request prepared to defend it in a
portrait of Mrs Grancy We were alleven Claydonready to concede that
Mrs Grancys unwontedness was in some degree a matter of environment Her
graces were complementary and it needed the mates call to reveal the flash
of color beneath her neutraltinted wings But if she needed Grancy to
interpret her how much greater was the service she rendered him Claydon
professionally described her as the right frame for him but if she defined
she also enlarged if she threw the whole into perspective she also cleared
new ground opened fresh vistas reclaimed whole areas of activity that had
run to waste under the harsh husbandry of privation This interaction of
sympathies was not without its visible expression Claydon was not alone
in maintaining that Grancys presenceor indeed the mere mention of his
namehad a perceptible effect on his wifes appearance It was as though a
light were shifted a curtain drawn back as though to borrow another of
Claydons metaphors Love the indefatigable artist were perpetually seeking
a happier pose for his model In this interpretative light Mrs Grancy
acquired the charm which makes some womens faces like a book of which
the last page is never turned There was always something new to read in
her eyes What Claydon read thereor at least such scattered hints of
the ritual as reached him through the sanctuary doorshis portrait in
due course declared to us When the picture was exhibited it was at once
acclaimed as his masterpiece but the people who knew Mrs Grancy smiled
and said it was flattered Claydon however had not set out to paint
their Mrs Grancyor ours evenbut Ralphs and Ralph knew his own
at a glance At the first confrontation he saw that Claydon had understood
As for Mrs Grancy when the finished picture was shown to her she turned
to the painter and said simply Ah youve done me facing the east

The picture then for all its value seemed a mere incident in the
unfolding of their double destiny a footnote to the illuminated text of
their lives It was not till afterward that it acquired the significance
of last words spoken on a threshold never to be recrossed Grancy a year
after his marriage had given up his town house and carried his bliss an
hours journey away to a little place among the hills His various duties
and interests brought him frequently to New York but we necessarily saw him
less often than when his house had served as the rallyingpoint of kindred
enthusiasms It seemed a pity that such an influence should be withdrawn
but we all felt that his long arrears of happiness should be paid in
whatever coin he chose The distance from which the fortunate couple
radiated warmth on us was not too great for friendship to traverse and our
conception of a glorified leisure took the form of Sundays spent in the
Grancys library with its sedative rural outlook and the portrait of Mrs
Grancy illuminating its studious walls The picture was at its best in that
setting and we used to accuse Claydon of visiting Mrs Grancy in order to
see her portrait He met this by declaring that the portrait was
Mrs Grancy and there were moments when the statement seemed unanswerable
One of us indeedI think it must have been the novelistsaid that
Clayton had been saved from falling in love with Mrs Grancy only by
falling in love with his picture of her and it was noticeable that he to
whom his finished work was no more than the shed husk of future effort
showed a perennial tenderness for this one achievement We smiled afterward
to think how often when Mrs Grancy was in the room her presence
reflecting itself in our talk like a gleam of sky in a hurrying current
Claydon averted from the real woman would sit as it were listening to the
picture His attitude at the time seemed only a part of the unusualness
of those picturesque afternoons when the most familiar combinations of
life underwent a magical change Some human happiness is a landlocked lake
but the Grancys was an open sea stretching a buoyant and illimitable
surface to the voyaging interests of life There was room and to spare on
those waters for all our separate ventures and always beyond the sunset
a mirage of the fortunate isles toward which our prows bent


II

It was in Rome that three years later I heard of her death The notice
said suddenly I was glad of that I was glad toobasely perhapsto be
away from Grancy at a time when silence must have seemed obtuse and speech
derisive

I was still in Rome when a few months afterward he suddenly arrived
there He had been appointed secretary of legation at Constantinople and
was on the way to his post He had taken the place he said frankly to
get away Our relations with the Porte held out a prospect of hard work
and that he explained was what he needed He could never be satisfied to
sit down among the ruins I saw that like most of us in moments of extreme
moral tension he was playing a part behaving as he thought it became a
man to behave in the eye of disaster The instinctive posture of grief is
a shuffling compromise between defiance and prostration and pride feels
the need of striking a worthier attitude in face of such a foe Grancy by
nature musing and retrospective had chosen the rle of the man of action
who answers blow for blow and opposes a mailed front to the thrusts of
destiny and the completeness of the equipment testified to his inner
weakness We talked only of what we were not thinking of and parted after
a few days with a sense of relief that proved the inadequacy of friendship
to perform in such cases the office assigned to it by tradition

Soon afterward my own work called me home but Grancy remained several
years in Europe International diplomacy kept its promise of giving
him work to do and during the year in which he acted as charg
daffaires he acquitted himself under trying conditions with
conspicuous zeal and discretion A political redistribution of matter
removed him from office just as he had proved his usefulness to the
government and the following summer I heard that he had come home and
was down at his place in the country

On my return to town I wrote him and his reply came by the next post He
answered as it were in his natural voice urging me to spend the following
Sunday with him and suggesting that I should bring down any of the old
set who could be persuaded to join me I thought this a good sign and
yetshall I own itI was vaguely disappointed Perhaps we are apt to
feel that our friends sorrows should be kept like those historic monuments
from which the encroaching ivy is periodically removed

That very evening at the club I ran across Claydon I told him of Grancys
invitation and proposed that we should go down together but he pleaded an
engagement I was sorry for I had always felt that he and I stood nearer
Ralph than the others and if the old Sundays were to be renewed I should
have preferred that we two should spend the first alone with him I said as
much to Claydon and offered to fit my time to his but he met this by a
general refusal

I dont want to go to Grancys he said bluntly I waited a moment but
he appended no qualifying clause

Youve seen him since he came back I finally ventured

Claydon nodded

And is he so awfully bad

Bad No hes all right

All right How can he be unless hes changed beyond all recognition

Oh youll recognize him said Claydon with a puzzling deflection
of emphasis

His ambiguity was beginning to exasperate me and I felt myself shut out
from some knowledge to which I had as good a right as he

Youve been down there already I suppose

Yes Ive been down there

And youve done with each otherthe partnership is dissolved

Done with each other I wish to God we had He rose nervously and tossed
aside the review from which my approach had diverted him Look here
he said standing before me Ralphs the best fellow going and theres
nothing under heaven I wouldnt do for himshort of going down there
again And with that he walked out of the room

Claydon was incalculable enough for me to read a dozen different meanings
into his words but none of my interpretations satisfied me I determined
at any rate to seek no farther for a companion and the next Sunday I
travelled down to Grancys alone He met me at the station and I saw at
once that he had changed since our last meeting Then he had been in
fighting array but now if he and grief still housed together it was
no longer as enemies Physically the transformation was as marked but
less reassuring If the spirit triumphed the body showed its scars At
fiveandforty he was gray and stooping with the tired gait of an old man
His serenity however was not the resignation of age I saw that he did
not mean to drop out of the game Almost immediately he began to speak of
our old interests not with an effort as at our former meeting but simply
and naturally in the tone of a man whose life has flowed back into its
normal channels I remembered with a touch of selfreproach how I had
distrusted his reconstructive powers but my admiration for his reserved
force was now tinged by the sense that after all such happiness as his
ought to have been paid with his last coin The feeling grew as we neared
the house and I found how inextricably his wife was interwoven with my
remembrance of the place how the whole scene was but an extension of that
vivid presence

Within doors nothing was changed and my hand would have dropped without
surprise into her welcoming clasp It was luncheontime and Grancy led me
at once to the diningroom where the walls the furniture the very plate
and porcelain seemed a mirror in which a moment since her face had been
reflected I wondered whether Grancy under the recovered tranquillity
of his smile concealed the same sense of her nearness saw perpetually
between himself and the actual her bright unappeasable ghost He spoke of
her once or twice in an easy incidental way and her name seemed to hang
in the air after he had uttered it like a chord that continues to vibrate
If he felt her presence it was evidently as an enveloping medium the moral
atmosphere in which he breathed I had never before known how completely
the dead may survive

After luncheon we went for a long walk through the autumnal fields and
woods and dusk was falling when we reentered the house Grancy led the
way to the library where at this hour his wife had always welcomed
us back to a bright fire and a cup of tea The room faced the west and
held a clear light of its own after the rest of the house had grown dark
I remembered how young she had looked in this pale gold light which
irradiated her eyes and hair or silhouetted her girlish outline as she
passed before the windows Of all the rooms the library was most peculiarly
hers and here I felt that her nearness might take visible shape Then all
in a moment as Grancy opened the door the feeling vanished and a kind
of resistance met me on the threshold I looked about me Was the room
changed Had some desecrating hand effaced the traces of her presence No
here too the setting was undisturbed My feet sank into the same deeppiled
Daghestan the bookshelves took the firelight on the same rows of rich
subdued bindings her armchair stood in its old place near the teatable
and from the opposite wall her face confronted me

Her facebut was it hers I moved nearer and stood looking up at
the portrait Grancys glance had followed mine and I heard him move to my
side

You see a change in it he said

What does it mean I asked

It meansthat five years have passed

Over her

Why notLook at me He pointed to his gray hair and furrowed temples
What do you think kept her so young It was happiness But now
he looked up at her with infinite tenderness I like her better so he
said Its what she would have wished

Have wished

That we should grow old together Do you think she would have wanted to be
left behind

I stood speechless my gaze travelling from his worn griefbeaten features
to the painted face above It was not furrowed like his but a veil
of years seemed to have descended on it The bright hair had lost its
elasticity the cheek its clearness the brow its light the whole woman
had waned

Grancy laid his hand on my arm You dont like it he said sadly

Like it IIve lost her I burst out

And Ive found her he answered

In that I cried with a reproachful gesture

Yes in that He swung round on me almost defiantly The other had
become a sham a lie This is the way she would have lookeddoes look I
mean Claydon ought to know oughtnt he

I turned suddenly Did Claydon do this for you

Grancy nodded

Since your return

Yes I sent for him after Id been back a week He turned away and gave
a thrust to the smouldering fire I followed glad to leave the picture
behind me Grancy threw himself into a chair near the hearth so that the
light fell on his sensitive variable face He leaned his head back shading
his eyes with his hand and began to speak


III

You fellows knew enough of my early history to A guess what my second
marriage meant to me I say guess because no one could understandreally
Ive always had a feminine streak in me I suppose the need of a pair of
eyes that should see with me of a pulse that should keep time with mine
Life is a big thing of course a magnificent spectacle but I got so tired
of looking at it alone Still its always good to live and I had plenty
of happinessof the evolved kind What Id never had a taste of was the
simple inconscient sort that one breathes in like the air

WellI met her It was like finding the climate in which I was meant to
live You know what she washow indefinitely she multiplied ones points
of contact with life how she lit up the caverns and bridged the abysses
Well I swear to you though I suppose the sense of all that was latent in
me that what I used to think of on my way home at the end of the day was
simply that when I opened this door shed be sitting over there with the
lamplight falling in a particular way on one little curl in her neck
When Claydon painted her he caught just the look she used to lift to mine
when I came inIve wondered sometimes at his knowing how she looked
when she and I were aloneHow I rejoiced in that picture I used to say
to her Youre my prisoner nowI shall never lose you If you grew tired
of me and left me youd leave your real self there on the wall It was
always one of our jokes that she was going to grow tired of me

Three years of itand then she died It was so sudden that there was
no change no diminution It was as if she had suddenly become fixed
immovable like her own portrait as if Time had ceased at its happiest
hour just as Claydon had thrown down his brush one day and said I cant
do better than that

I went away as you know and stayed over there five years I worked as
hard as I knew how and after the first black months a little light stole
in on me From thinking that she would have been interested in what I was
doing I came to feel that she was interestedthat she was there and
that she knew Im not talking any psychical jargonIm simply trying to
express the sense I had that an influence so full so abounding as hers
couldnt pass like a spring shower We had so lived into each others
hearts and minds that the consciousness of what she would have thought
and felt illuminated all I did At first she used to come back shyly
tentatively as though not sure of finding me then she stayed longer and
longer till at last she became again the very air I breathed There
were bad moments of course when her nearness mocked me with the loss of
the real woman but gradually the distinction between the two was effaced
and the mere thought of her grew warm as flesh and blood

Then I came home I landed in the morning and came straight down here The
thought of seeing her portrait possessed me and my heart beat like a
lovers as I opened the library door It was in the afternoon and the room
was full of light It fell on her picturethe picture of a young and
radiant woman She smiled at me coldly across the distance that divided us
I had the feeling that she didnt even recognize me And then I caught
sight of myself in the mirror over therea grayhaired broken man whom she
had never known

For a week we two lived togetherthe strange woman and the strange man
I used to sit night after night and question her smiling face but no
answer ever came What did she know of me after all We were irrevocably
separated by the five years of life that lay between us At times as I
sat here I almost grew to hate her for her presence had driven away my
gentle ghost the real wife who had wept aged struggled with me during
those awful years It was the worst loneliness Ive ever known Then
gradually I began to notice a look of sadness in the pictures eyes a
look that seemed to say Dont you see that I am lonely too And
all at once it came over me how she would have hated to be left behind I
remembered her comparing life to a heavy book that could not be read with
ease unless two people held it together and I thought how impatiently her
hand would have turned the pages that divided usSo the idea came to me
Its the picture that stands between us the picture that is dead and not
my wife To sit in this room is to keep watch beside a corpse As this
feeling grew on me the portrait became like a beautiful mausoleum in which
she had been buried alive I could hear her beating against the painted
walls and crying to me faintly for help

One day I found I couldnt stand it any longer and I sent for Claydon He
came down and I told him what Id been through and what I wanted him to do
At first he refused pointblank to touch the picture The next morning I
went off for a long tramp and when I came home I found him sitting here
alone He looked at me sharply for a moment and then he said Ive changed
my mind Ill do it I arranged one of the north rooms as a studio and he
shut himself up there for a day then he sent for me The picture stood
there as you see it nowit was as though shed met me on the threshold and
taken me in her arms I tried to thank him to tell him what it meant to
me but he cut me short

Theres an up train at five isnt there he asked Im booked for a
dinner tonight I shall just have time to make a bolt for the station and
you can send my traps after me I havent seen him since

I can guess what it cost him to lay hands on his masterpiece but after
all to him it was only a picture lost to me it was my wife regained


IV

After that for ten years or more I watched the strange spectacle of a
life of hopeful and productive effort based on the structure of a dream
There could be no doubt to those who saw Grancy during this period that
he drew his strength and courage from the sense of his wifes mystic
participation in his task When I went back to see him a few months later I
found the portrait had been removed from the library and placed in a small
study upstairs to which he had transferred his desk and a few books He
told me he always sat there when he was alone keeping the library for his
Sunday visitors Those who missed the portrait of course made no comment on
its absence and the few who were in his secret respected it Gradually all
his old friends had gathered about him and our Sunday afternoons regained
something of their former character but Claydon never reappeared among us

As I look back now I see that Grancy must have been failing from the time
of his return home His invincible spirit belied and disguised the signs of
weakness that afterward asserted themselves in my remembrance of him He
seemed to have an inexhaustible fund of life to draw on and more than one
of us was a pensioner on his superfluity

Nevertheless when I came back one summer from my European holiday and
heard that he had been at the point of death I understood at once that we
had believed him well only because he wished us to

I hastened down to the country and found him midway in a slow
convalescence I felt then that he was lost to us and he read my thought at
a glance

Ah he said Im an old man now and no mistake I suppose we shall have
to go halfspeed after this but we shant need towing just yet

The plural pronoun struck me and involuntarily I looked up at Mrs
Grancys portrait Line by line I saw my fear reflected in it It was the
face of a woman who knows that her husband is dying My heart stood still
at the thought of what Claydon had done

Grancy had followed my glance Yes its changed her he said quietly
For months you know it was touch and go with mewe had a long fight of
it and it was worse for her than for me After a pause he added Claydon
has been very kind hes so busy nowadays that I seldom see him but when I
sent for him the other day he came down at once

I was silent and we spoke no more of Grancys illness but when I took
leave it seemed like shutting him in alone with his deathwarrant

The next time I went down to see him he looked much better It was a Sunday
and he received me in the library so that I did not see the portrait
again He continued to improve and toward spring we began to feel that as
he had said he might yet travel a long way without being towed

One evening on returning to town after a visit which had confirmed my
sense of reassurance I found Claydon dining alone at the club He asked me
to join him and over the coffee our talk turned to his work

If youre not too busy I said at length you ought to make time to go
down to Grancys again

He looked up quickly Why he asked

Because hes quite well again I returned with a touch of cruelty His
wifes prognostications were mistaken

Claydon stared at me a moment Oh she knows he affirmed with a
smile that chilled me

You mean to leave the portrait as it is then I persisted

He shrugged his shoulders He hasnt sent for me yet

A waiter came up with the cigars and Claydon rose and joined another group

It was just a fortnight later that Grancys housekeeper telegraphed for me
She met me at the station with the news that he had been taken bad and
that the doctors were with him I had to wait for some time in the deserted
library before the medical men appeared They had the baffled manner of
empirics who have been superseded by the great Healer and I lingered only
long enough to hear that Grancy was not suffering and that my presence
could do him no harm

I found him seated in his armchair in the little study He held out his
hand with a smile

You see she was right after all he said

She I repeated perplexed for the moment

My wife He indicated the picture Of course I knew she had no hope from
the first I saw thathe lowered his voiceafter Claydon had been here
But I wouldnt believe it at first

I caught his hands in mine For Gods sake dont believe it now I
adjured him

He shook his head gently Its too late he said I might have known
that she knew

But Grancy listen to me I began and then I stopped What could I say
that would convince him There was no common ground of argument on which we
could meet and after all it would be easier for him to die feeling that
she had known Strangely enough I saw that Claydon had missed his
mark


V

Grancys will named me as one of his executors and my associate having
other duties on his hands begged me to assume the task of carrying out our
friends wishes This placed me under the necessity of informing Claydon
that the portrait of Mrs Grancy had been bequeathed to him and he replied
by the next post that he would send for the picture at once I was staying
in the deserted house when the portrait was taken away and as the door
closed on it I felt that Grancys presence had vanished too Was it his
turn to follow her now and could one ghost haunt another

After that for a year or two I heard nothing more of the picture and
though I met Claydon from time to time we had little to say to each other
I had no definable grievance against the man and I tried to remember that
he had done a fine thing in sacrificing his best picture to a friend but
my resentment had all the tenacity of unreason

One day however a lady whose portrait he had just finished begged me
to go with her to see it To refuse was impossible and I went with the
less reluctance that I knew I was not the only friend she had invited
The others were all grouped around the easel when I entered and after
contributing my share to the chorus of approval I turned away and began
to stroll about the studio Claydon was something of a collector and his
things were generally worth looking at The studio was a long tapestried
room with a curtained archway at one end The curtains were looped back
showing a smaller apartment with books and flowers and a few fine bits of
bronze and porcelain The teatable standing in this inner room proclaimed
that it was open to inspection and I wandered in A bleu poudr
vase first attracted me then I turned to examine a slender bronze
Ganymede and in so doing found myself face to face with Mrs Grancys
portrait I stared up at her blankly and she smiled back at me in all
the recovered radiance of youth The artist had effaced every trace of
his later touches and the original picture had reappeared It throned
alone on the panelled wall asserting a brilliant supremacy over its
carefullychosen surroundings I felt in an instant that the whole room was
tributary to it that Claydon had heaped his treasures at the feet of the
woman he loved Yesit was the woman he had loved and not the picture and
my instinctive resentment was explained

Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder

Ah how could you I cried turning on him

How could I he retorted How could I not Doesnt she belong to
me now

I moved away impatiently

Wait a moment he said with a detaining gesture The others have gone
and I want to say a word to youOh I know what youve thought of meI
can guess You think I killed Grancy I suppose

I was startled by his sudden vehemence I think you tried to do a cruel
thing I said

Ahwhat a little way you others see into life he murmured Sit down a
momenthere where we can look at herand Ill tell you

He threw himself on the ottoman beside me and sat gazing up at the picture
with his hands clasped about his knee

Pygmalion he began slowly turned his statue into a real woman
I turned my real woman into a picture Small compensation you
thinkbut you dont know how much of a woman belongs to you after youve
painted herWell I made the best of it at any rateI gave her the best
I had in me and she gave me in return what such a woman gives by merely
being And after all she rewarded me enough by making me paint as I shall
never paint again There was one side of her though that was mine alone
and that was her beauty for no one else understood it To Grancy even
it was the mere expression of herselfwhat language is to thought Even
when he saw the picture he didnt guess my secrethe was so sure she was
all his As though a man should think he owned the moon because it was
reflected in the pool at his door

Wellwhen he came home and sent for me to change the picture it was like
asking me to commit murder He wanted me to make an old woman of herof
her who had been so divinely unchangeably young As if any man who really
loved a woman would ask her to sacrifice her youth and beauty for his sake
At first I told him I couldnt do itbut afterward when he left me alone
with the picture something queer happened I suppose it was because I was
always so confoundedly fond of Grancy that it went against me to refuse
what he asked Anyhow as I sat looking up at her she seemed to say Im
not yours but his and I want you to make me what he wishes And so I did
it I could have cut my hand off when the work was doneI daresay he told
you I never would go back and look at it He thought I was too busyhe
never understood

Welland then last year he sent for me againyou remember It was after
his illness and he told me hed grown twenty years older and that he
wanted her to grow older toohe didnt want her to be left behind The
doctors all thought he was going to get well at that time and he thought
so too and so did I when I first looked at him But when I turned to
the pictureah now I dont ask you to believe me but I swear it was
her face that told me he was dying and that she wanted him to know
it She had a message for him and she made me deliver it

He rose abruptly and walked toward the portrait then he sat down beside me
again

Cruel Yes it seemed so to me at first and this time if I resisted
it was for his sake and not for mine But all the while I felt her
eyes drawing me and gradually she made me understand If shed been there
in the flesh she seemed to say wouldnt she have seen before any of us
that he was dying Wouldnt he have read the news first in her face And
wouldnt it be horrible if now he should discover it instead in strange
eyesWellthat was what she wanted of me and I did itI kept them
together to the last He looked up at the picture again But now she
belongs to me he repeated




THE CONFESSIONAL


When I was a young man I thought a great deal of local color At that
time it was still a pigment of recent discovery and supposed to have
a peculiarly stimulating effect on the mental eye As an aid to the
imagination its value was perhaps overrated but as an object of pursuit
to that vagrant faculty it had all the merits claimed for it I certainly
never hunted any game better worth my powder and to a young man with rare
holidays and long working hours its value was enhanced by the fact that
one might bring it down at any turn if only one kept ones eye alert and
ones hand on the trigger

Even the large manufacturing city where for some years my young
enthusiasms were chained to an accountants desk was not without its
romantic opportunities Many of the millhands at Dunstable were Italians
and a foreign settlement had formed itself in that unsavory and unsanitary
portion of the town known as the Point The Point like more aristocratic
communities had its residential and commercial districts its church its
theatre and its restaurant When the craving for local color was on me it
was my habit to resort to the restaurant a lowbrowed wooden building with
the appetizing announcement

Aristi di montone

pasted in one of its flyblown windowpanes Here the consumption of tough
macaroni or of an ambiguous frittura sufficed to transport me to the
Cappello dOro in Venice while my cup of coffee and a waspwaisted cigar
with a straw in it turned my greasy tablecloth into the marble top of
one of the little round tables under the arcade of the Caff Pedrotti at
Padua This feat of the imagination was materially aided by Agostino the
holloweyed and lowcollared waiter whose slimy napkin never lost its
Latin flourish and whose zeal for my comfort was not infrequently displayed
by his testing the warmth of my soup with his finger Through Agostino I
became acquainted with the inner history of the colony heard the details
of its feuds and vendettas and learned to know by sight the leading
characters in these domestic dramas

The restaurant was frequented by the chief personages of the community
the overseer of the Italian hands at the Meriton Mills the doctor his
wife the levatrice a plump Neapolitan with greasy ringlets a plush
picturehat and a charm against the evileye hanging in a crease of her
neck and lastly by Don Egidio the parocco of the little church
across the street The doctor and his wife came only on feast days but
the overseer and Don Egidio were regular patrons The former was a quiet
saturninelooking man of accomplished manners but reluctant speech and I
depended for my diversion chiefly on Don Egidio whose large looselyhung
lips were always ajar for conversation The remarks issuing from them
were richly tinged by the gutturals of the Bergamasque dialect and it
needed but a slight acquaintance with Italian types to detect the Lombard
peasant under the priests rusty cassock This inference was confirmed
by Don Egidios telling me that he came from a village of Val Camonica
the radiant valley which extends northward from the lake of Iseo to
the Adamello glaciers His stepfather had been a laborer on one of
the fruitfarms of a Milanese count who owned large estates in the Val
Camonica and that gentleman taking a fancy to the lad whom he had seen
at work in his orchards had removed him to his villa on the lake of Iseo
and had subsequently educated him for the Church

It was doubtless to this picturesque accident that Don Egidio owed the
mingling of ease and simplicity that gave an inimitable charm to his
stout shabby presence It was as though some wild mountainfruit had been
transplanted to the Counts orchards and had mellowed under cultivation
without losing its sylvan flavor I have never seen the social art carried
farther without suggestion of artifice The fact that Don Egidios
amenities were mainly exercised on the millhands composing his parish
proved the genuineness of his gift It is easier to simulate gentility
among gentlemen than among navvies and the plain man is a touchstone who
draws out all the alloy in the gold

Among his parishioners Don Egidio ruled with the cheerful despotism of the
good priest On cardinal points he was inflexible but in minor matters he
had that elasticity of judgment which enables the Catholic discipline to
fit itself to every inequality of the human conscience There was no appeal
from his verdict but his judgmentseat was a revolving chair from which he
could view the same act at various angles His influence was acknowledged
not only by his flock but by the policeman at the corner the barkeep
in the dive the ward politician in the corner grocery The general verdict
of Dunstable was that the Point would have been hell without the priest
It was perhaps not precisely heaven with him but such light of the upper
sky as pierced its murky atmosphere was reflected from Don Egidios
countenance It is hardly possible for any one to exercise such influence
without taking pleasure in it and on the whole the priest was probably
a contented man though it does not follow that he was a happy one On
this point the first stages of our acquaintance yielded much food for
conjecture At first sight Don Egidio was the image of cheerfulness He had
all the physical indications of a mind at ease the leisurely rolling gait
the ready laugh the hospitable eye of the man whose sympathies are always
on the latch It took me some time to discover under his surface garrulity
the impenetrable reticence of his profession and under his enjoyment of
trifles a levelling melancholy which made all enjoyment trifling Don
Egidios aspect and conversation were so unsuggestive of psychological
complexities that I set down this trait to poverty or homesickness There
are few classes of men more frugal in tastes and habit than the village
priest in Italy but Don Egidio by his own account had been introduced
at an impressionable age to a way of living that must have surpassed his
wildest dreams of selfindulgence To whatever privations his parochial
work had since accustomed him the influences of that earlier life were
too perceptible in his talk not to have made a profound impression on his
tastes and he remained for all his apostolic simplicity the image of the
family priest who has his seat at the rich mans table

It chanced that I had used one of my short European holidays to explore
afoot the romantic passes connecting the Valtelline with the lake of Iseo
and my remembrance of that enchanting region made it seem impossible
that Don Egidio should ever look without a reminiscent pang on the grimy
perspective of his parochial streets The transition was too complete too
ironical from those rich glades and Titianesque acclivities to the brick
hovels and fissured sidewalks of the Point

This impression was confirmed when Don Egidio in response to my urgent
invitation paid his first visit to my modest lodgings He called one
winter evening when a woodfire in its happiest humor was giving a
factitious lustre to my bookshelves and bringing out the values of the one
or two old prints and Chinese porcelains that accounted for the perennial
shabbiness of my wardrobe

Ah said he with a murmur of satisfaction as he laid aside his shiny hat
and bulging umbrella it is a long time since I have been in a casa
signorile

My remembrance of his own room he lodged with the doctor and the
levatrice saved this epithet from the suggestion of irony and kept
me silent while he sank into my armchair with the deliberation of a tired
traveller lowering himself gently into a warm bath

Good good he repeated looking about him Books porcelains objects
of virtI am glad to see that there are still such things in the
world And he turned a genial eye on the glass of Marsala that I had
poured out for him

Don Egidio was the most temperate of men and never exceeded his one glass
but he liked to sit by the hour puffing at my Cabaas which I suspected
him of preferring to the black weed of his native country Under the
influence of my tobacco he became even more blandly garrulous and I
sometimes fancied that of all the obligations of his calling none could
have placed such a strain on him as that of preserving the secrets of the
confessional He often talked of his early life at the Counts villa where
he had been educated with his patrons two sons till he was of age to be
sent to the seminary and I could see that the years spent in simple and
familiar intercourse with his benefactors had been the most vivid chapter
in his experience The Italian peasants inarticulate tenderness for the
beauty of his birthplace had been specialized in him by contact with
cultivated tastes and he could tell me not only that the Count had a
stupendous collection of pictures but that the chapel of the villa
contained a sepulchral monument by Bambaja and that the artcritics were
divided as to the authenticity of the Leonardo in the family palace at
Milan

On all these subjects he was inexhaustibly voluble but there was one point
which he always avoided and that was his reason for coming to America I
remember the round turn with which he brought me up when I questioned him

A priest said he is a soldier and must obey orders like a soldier
He set down his glass of Marsala and strolled across the room I had not
observed he went on that you have here a photograph of the Sposalizio
of the Brera What a picture  stupendo and he turned back to his
seat and smilingly lit a fresh cigar

I saw at once that I had hit on a point where his native garrulity was
protected by the chainmail of religious discipline that every Catholic
priest wears beneath his cassock I had too much respect for my friend
to wish to penetrate his armor and now and then I almost fancied he was
grateful to me for not putting his reticence to the test

Don Egidio must have been past sixty when I made his acquaintance but it
was not till the close of an exceptionally harsh winter some five or six
years after our first meeting that I began to think of him as an old man
It was as though the longcontinued cold had cracked and shrivelled him He
had grown bent and hollowchested and his lower lip shook like an unhinged
door The summer heat did little to revive him and in September when I
came home from my vacation I found him just recovering from an attack of
pneumonia That autumn he did not care to venture often into the night air
and now and then I used to go and sit with him in his little room to which
I had contributed the unheardof luxuries of an easychair and a gasstove

My engagements however made these visits infrequent and several weeks
had elapsed without my seeing the parocco when one snowy November
morning I ran across him in the railwaystation I was on my way to New
York for the day and had just time to wave a greeting to him as I jumped
into the railwaycarriage but a moment later to my surprise I saw him
stiffly clambering into the same train I found him seated in the common
car with his umbrella between his knees and a bundle done up in a red
cotton handkerchief on the seat at his side The caution with which at my
approach he transferred this bundle to his arms caused me to glance at it
in surprise and he answered my look by saying with a smile

They are flowers for the deadthe most exquisite flowersfrom the
greenhouses of Mr Meritonsi figuri And he waved a descriptive
hand One of my lads Gianpietro is employed by the gardener there and
every year on this day he brings me a beautiful bunch of flowersfor such
a purpose it is no sin he added with the charming Italian pliancy of
judgment

And why are you travelling in this snowy weather signor parocco
I asked as he ended with a cough

He fixed me gravely with his simple shallow eye Because it is the day of
the dead my son he said and I go to place these on the grave of the
noblest man that ever lived

You are going to New York

To Brooklyn

I hesitated a moment wishing to question him yet uncertain whether his
replies were curtailed by the persistency of his cough or by the desire to
avoid interrogation

This is no weather to be travelling with such a cough I said at length

He made a deprecating gesture

I have never missed the daynot once in eighteen years But for me he
would have no one He folded his hands on his umbrella and looked away
from me to hide the trembling of his lip

I resolved on a last attempt to storm his confidence Your friend is
buried in Calvary cemetery

He signed an assent

That is a long way for you to go alone signor parocco The streets
are sure to be slippery and there is an icy wind blowing Give me your
flowers and let me send them to the cemetery by a messenger I give you my
word they shall reach their destination safely

He turned a quiet look on me My son you are young he said and you
dont know how the dead need us He drew his breviary from his pocket and
opened it with a smile Mi scusi he murmured

The business which had called me to town obliged me to part from him as
soon as the train entered the station and in my dash for the street I
left his unwieldy figure laboring far behind me through the crowd on the
platform Before we separated however I had learned that he was returning
to Dunstable by the four oclock train and had resolved to despatch my
business in time to travel home with him When I reached Wall Street I was
received with the news that the man I had appointed to meet was ill and
detained in the country My business was off and I found myself with
the rest of the day at my disposal I had no difficulty in deciding how
to employ my time I was at an age when in such contingencies there is
always a feminine alternative and even now I dont know how it was that
on my way to a certain hospitable luncheontable I suddenly found myself
in a cab which was carrying me at fullspeed to the Twentythird Street
ferry It was not till I had bought my ticket and seated myself in the
varnished tunnel of the ferryboat that I was aware of having been diverted
from my purpose by an overmastering anxiety for Don Egidio I rapidly
calculated that he had not more than an hours advance on me and that
allowing for my greater agility and for the fact that I had a cab at my
call I was likely to reach the cemetery in time to see him under shelter
before the gusts of sleet that were already sweeping across the river had
thickened to a snowstorm

At the gates of the cemetery I began to take a less sanguine view of my
attempt The commemorative anniversary had filled the silent avenues
with visitors and I felt the futility of my quest as I tried to fix the
gatekeepers attention on my delineation of a stout Italian priest with a
bad cough and a bunch of flowers tied up in a red cotton handkerchief The
gatekeeper showed that delusive desire to oblige that is certain to send
its victims in the wrong direction but I had the presence of mind to go
exactly contrary to his indication and thanks to this precaution I came
after half an hours search on the figure of my poor parocco
kneeling on the wet ground in one of the humblest byways of the great
necropolis The mound before which he knelt was strewn with the spoils of
Mr Meritons conservatories and on the weatherworn tablet at its head I
read the inscription

IL CONTE SIVIANO
DA MILANO

Super flumina Babylonis illic sedimus et flevimus

So engrossed was Don Egidio that for some moments I stood behind him
unobserved and when he rose and faced me grief had left so little room
for any minor emotion that he looked at me almost without surprise

Don Egidio I said I have a carriage waiting for you at the gate You
must come home with me

He nodded quietly and I drew his hand through my arm

He turned back to the grave One moment my son he said It may be for
the last time He stood motionless his eyes on the heapedup flowers
which were already bruised and blackened by the cold To leave him
aloneafter sixty years But God is everywhere he murmured as I led him
away

On the journey home he did not care to talk and my chief concern was to
keep him wrapped in my greatcoat and to see that his bed was made ready as
soon as I had restored him to his lodgings The levatrice brought a
quilted coverlet from her own room and hovered over him as gently as though
he had been of the sex to require her services while Agostino at my
summons appeared with a bowl of hot soup that was heralded down the
street by a reviving waft of garlic To these ministrations I left the
parocco intending to call for news of him the next evening but an
unexpected pressure of work kept me late at my desk and the following day
some fresh obstacle delayed me

On the third afternoon as I was leaving the office an agateeyed infant
from the Point hailed me with a message from the doctor The parocco
was worse and had asked for me I jumped into the nearest car and ten
minutes later was running up the doctors greasy stairs

To my dismay I found Don Egidios room cold and untenanted but I was
reassured a moment later by the appearance of the levatrice who
announced that she had transferred the blessed man to her own apartment
where he could have the sunlight and a good bed to lie in There in fact
he lay weak but smiling in a setting which contrasted oddly enough with
his own monastic surroundings a cheerful grimy room hung with anecdotic
chromos photographs of ladypatients proudly presenting their offspring
to the camera and innumerable Neapolitan santolini decked out with
shrivelled palmleaves

The levatrice whispered that the good man had the pleurisy and
that as she phrased it he was nearing his last milestone I saw that he
was in fact in a bad way but his condition did not indicate any pressing
danger and I had the presentiment that he would still as the saying is
put up a good fight It was clear however that he knew what turn the
conflict must take and the solemnity with which he welcomed me showed that
my summons was a part of that spiritual strategy with which the Catholic
opposes the surprise of death

My son he said when the levatrice had left us I have a favor
to ask you You found me yesterday bidding goodbye to my best friend
His cough interrupted him I have never told you he went on the name
of the family in which I was brought up It was Siviano and that was
the grave of the Counts eldest son with whom I grew up as a brother
For eighteen years he has lain in that strange groundin terra
alienaand when I die there will be no one to care for his grave

I saw what he waited for I will care for it signor parocco

I knew I should have your promise my child and what you promise you
keep But my friend is a stranger to youyou are young and at your age
life is a mistress who kisses away sad memories Why should you remember
the grave of a stranger I cannot lay such a claim on you But I will tell
you his storyand then I think that neither joy nor grief will let you
forget him for when you rejoice you will remember how he sorrowed and
when you sorrow the thought of him will be like a friends hand in yours


II

You tell me Don Egidio began that you know our little lake and if you
have seen it you will understand why it always used to remind me of the
garden enclosed of the Canticles

Hortus inclusus columba mea in foraminibus petr the words used
to come back to me whenever I returned from a days journey across the
mountains and looking down saw the blue lake far below hidden in its
hills like a happy secret in a stern heart We were never envious of
the glory of the great lakes They are like the show pictures that some
nobleman hangs in his public gallery but our Iseo is the treasure that
he hides in his inner chamber

You tell me you saw it in summer when it looks up like a saints eye
reflecting the whole of heaven It was then too that I first saw it
My future friend the old Count had found me at work on one of his
fruitfarms up the valley and hearing that I was illtreated by my
stepfathera drunken pedlar from the Val Mastellone whom my poor mother
a year or two earlier had come across at the fair of Loverehe had taken
me home with him to Iseo I used to serve mass in our hillvillage of
Cerveno and the village children called me the little priest because
when my work was done I often crept back to the church to get away from
my stepfathers blows and curses I will make a real priest of him
the Count declared and that afternoon perched on the box of his
travellingcarriage I was whirled away from the dark scenes of my
childhood into a world where as it seemed to me every one was as happy
as an angel on a presepio

I wonder if you remember the Counts villa It lies on the shore of the
lake facing the green knoll of Monte Isola and overlooked by the village
of Siviano and by the old parishchurch where I said mass for fifteen happy
years The village hangs on a ledge of the mountain but the villa dips its
foot in the lake smiling at its reflection like a bather lingering on the
brink What Paradise it seemed to me that day In our church up the valley
there hung an old brown picture with a Saint Sabastian in the foreground
and behind him the most wonderful palace with terraced gardens adorned
with statues and fountains where fine folk in resplendent dresses walked
up and down without heeding the blessed martyrs pangs The Counts villa
with its terraces its roses its marble steps descending to the lake
reminded me of that palace only instead of being inhabited by wicked
people engrossed in their selfish pleasures it was the home of the kindest
friends that ever took a poor lad by the hand

The old Count was a widower when I first knew him He had been twice
married and his first wife had left him two children a son and a
daughter The eldest Donna Marianna was then a girl of twenty who
kept her fathers house and was a mother to the two lads She was not
handsome or learned and had no taste for the world but she was like the
lavenderplant in a poor mans windowjust a little gray flower but a
sweetness that fills the whole house Her brother Count Roberto had been
ailing from his birth and was a studious lad with a melancholy musing face
such as you may see in some of Titians portraits of young men He looked
like an exiled prince dressed in mourning There was one child by the
second marriage Count Andrea a boy of my own age handsome as a Saint
George but not as kind as the others No doubt being younger he was less
able to understand why an uncouth peasant lad should have been brought to
his fathers table and the others were so fearful of hurting my feelings
that but for his teasing I might never have mended my clumsy manners or
learned how to behave in the presence of my betters Count Andrea was not
sparing in such lessons and Count Roberto in spite of his weak arms
chastised his brother roundly when he thought the discipline had been too
severe but for my part it seemed to me natural enough that such a godlike
being should lord it over a poor clodhopper like myself

WellI will not linger over the beginning of my new life for my story has
to do with its close Only I should like to make you understand what the
change meant to mean ignorant peasant lad coming from hard words and
blows and a smokeblackened hut in the hills to that great house full of
rare and beautiful things and of beings who seemed to me even more rare
and beautiful Do you wonder I was ready to kiss the ground they trod and
would have given the last drop of my blood to serve them

In due course I was sent to the seminary at Lodi and on holidays I used
to visit the family in Milan Count Andrea was growing up to be one of
the handsomest young men imaginable but a trifle wild and the old Count
married him in haste to the daughter of a Venetian noble who brought as
her dower a great estate in Istria The Countess Gemma as this lady was
called was as light as thistledown and had an eye like a babys but while
she was cooing for the moon her pretty white hands were always stealing
toward something within reach that she had not been meant to have The old
Count was not alert enough to follow these manoeuvres and the Countess hid
her designs under a torrent of guileless chatter as pickpockets wear long
sleeves to conceal their movements Her only fault he used to say was
that one of her aunts had married an Austrian and this event having taken
place before she was born he laughingly acquitted her of any direct share
in it She confirmed his good opinion of her by giving her husband two
sons and Roberto showing no inclination to marry these boys naturally
came to be looked on as the heirs of the house

Meanwhile I had finished my course of studies and the old Count on my
twentyfirst birthday had appointed me priest of the parish of Siviano It
was the year of Count Andreas marriage and there were great festivities at
the villa Three years later the old Count died to the sorrow of his two
eldest children Donna Marianna and Count Roberto closed their apartments
in the palace at Milan and withdrew for a year to Siviano It was then
that I first began to know my friend Before that I had loved him without
understanding him now I learned of what metal he was made His bookish
tastes inclined him to a secluded way of living and his younger brother
perhaps fancied that he would not care to assume the charge of the estate
But if Andrea thought this he was disappointed Roberto resolutely took up
the tradition of his fathers rule and as if conscious of lacking the
old Counts easy way with the peasants made up for it by a redoubled zeal
for their welfare I have seen him toil for days to adjust some trifling
difficulty that his father would have set right with a ready word like the
sainted bishop who when a beggar asked him for a penny cried out Alas
my brother I have not a penny in my purse but here are two gold pieces
if they can be made to serve you instead We had many conferences over
the condition of his people and he often sent me up the valley to look
into the needs of the peasantry on the fruitfarms No grievance was too
trifling for him to consider it no abuse too deepseated for him to root
it out and many an hour that other men of his rank would have given to
books or pleasure was devoted to adjusting a quarrel about boundarylines
or to weighing the merits of a complaint against the taxcollector I
often said that he was as much his peoples priest as I and he smiled and
answered that every landowner was a king and that in old days the king was
always a priest

Donna Marianna was urgent with him to marry but he always declared that
he had a family in his tenantry and that as for a wife she had never
let him feel the want of one He had that musing temper which gives a man
a name for coldness though in fact he may all the while be storing fuel
for a great conflagration But to me he whispered another reason for not
marrying A man he said does not take wife and rejoice while his mother
is on her deathbed and Italy his mother lay dying with the foreign
vultures waiting to tear her apart

You are too young to know anything of those days my son and how can any
one understand them who did not live through them Italy lay dying indeed
but Lombardy was her heart and the heart still beat and sent the faint
blood creeping to her cold extremities Her torturers weary of their
work had allowed her to fall into a painless stupor but just as she was
sinking from sleep to death heaven sent Radetsky to scourge her back to
consciousness and at the first sting of his lash she sprang maimed and
bleeding to her feet

Ah those days those days my son ItalyItalywas the word on our
lips but the thought in our hearts was just Austria We clamored
for liberty unity the franchise but under our breath we prayed only to
smite the whitecoats Remove the beam from our eye we cried and we shall
see our salvation clearly enough We priests in the north were all liberals
and worked with the nobles and the men of letters Gioberti was our
breviary and his Holiness the new Pope was soon to be the Tancred of our
crusade But meanwhile mind you all this went on in silence underground
as it were while on the surface Lombardy still danced feasted married
and took office under the Austrian In the ironmines up our valley there
used to be certain miners who stayed below ground for months at a time
and like one of these Roberto remained buried in his purpose while life
went its way overhead Though I was not in his confidence I knew well
enough where his thoughts were for he went among us with the eye of a
lover the visionary look of one who hears a Voice We all heard that
Voice to be sure mingling faintly with the other noises of life but to
Roberto it was already as the roar of mighty waters drowning every other
sound with its thunder

On the surface as I have said things looked smooth enough An Austrian
cardinal throned in Milan and an Austrianhearted Pope ruled in Rome In
Lombardy Austria couched like a beast of prey ready to spring at our
throats if we stirred or struggled The Moderates to whose party Count
Roberto belonged talked of prudence compromise the education of the
masses but if their words were a velvet sheath their thought was a dagger
For many years as you know the Milanese had maintained an outward show of
friendliness with their rulers The nobles had accepted office under the
viceroy and in the past there had been frequent intermarriage between
the two aristocracies But now one by one the great houses had closed
their doors against official society Though some of the younger and more
careless those who must dance and dine at any cost still went to the
palace and sat beside the enemy at the opera fashion was gradually taking
sides against them and those who had once been laughed at as old fogeys
were now applauded as patriots Among these of course was Count Roberto
who for several years had refused to associate with the Austrians and
had silently resented his easygoing brothers disregard of political
distinctions Andrea and Gemma belonged to the moth tribe who flock to
the brightest light and Gemmas Istrian possessions and her familys
connection with the Austrian nobility gave them a pretext for fluttering
about the viceregal candle Roberto let them go their way but his own
course was a tacit protest against their conduct They were always welcome
at the palazzo Siviano but he and Donna Marianna withdrew from society in
order to have an excuse for not showing themselves at the Countess Gemmas
entertainments If Andrea and Gemma were aware of his disapproval they were
clever enough to ignore it for the rich elder brother who paid their debts
and never meant to marry was too important a person to be quarrelled with
on political grounds They seemed to think that if he married it would be
only to spite them and they were persuaded that their future depended on
their giving him no cause to take such reprisals I shall never be more
than a plain peasant at heart and I have little natural skill in discerning
hidden motives but the experience of the confessional gives every priest
a certain insight into the secret springs of action and I often wondered
that the worldly wisdom of Andrea and Gemma did not help them to a clearer
reading of their brothers character For my part I knew that in Robertos
heart no great passion could spring from a mean motive and I had always
thought that if he ever loved any woman as he loved Italy it must be from
his countrys hand that he received his bride And so it came about

Have you ever noticed on one of those still autumn days before a storm
how here and there a yellow leaf will suddenly detach itself from the bough
and whirl through the air as though some warning of the gale had reached
it So it was then in Lombardy All round was the silence of decay but now
and then a word a look a trivial incident fluttered ominously through
the stillness It was in  Only a year earlier the glorious death of the
Bandiera brothers had sent a long shudder through Italy In the Romagna
Renzi and his comrades had tried to uphold by action the protest set forth
in the Manifesto of Rimini and their failure had sowed the seed which
dAzeglio and Cavour were to harvest Everywhere the forces were silently
gathering and nowhere was the hush more profound the least reverberation
more audible than in the streets of Milan

It was Count Robertos habit to attend early mass in the Cathedral and one
morning as he was standing in the aisle a young girl passed him with her
father Roberto knew the father a beggarly Milanese of the noble family of
Intelvi who had cut himself off from his class by accepting an appointment
in one of the government offices As the two went by he saw a group of
Austrian officers looking after the girl and heard one of them say Such
a choice morsel as that is too good for slaves and another answer with a
laugh Yes its a dish for the masters table

The girl heard too She was as white as a windflower and he saw the words
come out on her cheek like the red mark from a blow She whispered to
her father but he shook his head and drew her away without so much as
a glance at the Austrians Roberto heard mass and then hastened out and
placed himself in the porch of the Cathedral A moment later the officers
appeared and they too stationed themselves near the doorway Presently the
girl came out on her fathers arm Her admirers stepped forward to greet
Intelvi and the cringing wretch stood there exchanging compliments with
them while their insolent stare devoured his daughters beauty She
poor thing shook like a leaf and her eyes in avoiding theirs suddenly
encountered Robertos Her look was a wounded bird that flew to him for
shelter He carried it away in his breast and its live warmth beat against
his heart He thought that Italy had looked at him through those eyes for
love is the wiliest of masqueraders and has a thousand disguises at his
command

Within a month Faustina Intelvi was his wife Donna Marianna and I
rejoiced for we knew he had chosen her because he loved her and she
seemed to us almost worthy of such a choice As for Count Andrea and his
wife I leave you to guess what ingredients were mingled in the kiss with
which they welcomed the bride They were all smiles at Robertos marriage
and had only words of praise for his wife Donna Marianna who had
sometimes taxed me with suspecting their motives rejoiced in this fresh
proof of their magnanimity but for my part I could have wished to see them
a little less kind All such twilight fears however vanished in the flush
of my friends happiness Over some natures love steals gradually as the
morning light widens across a valley but it had flashed on Roberto like
the leap of dawn to a snowpeak He walked the world with the wondering
step of a blind man suddenly restored to sight and once he said to me with
a laugh Love makes a Columbus of every one of us

And the Countess The Countess my son was eighteen and her husband was
forty Count Roberto had the heart of a poet but he walked with a limp and
his skin was sallow Youth plucks the fruit for its color rather than its
flavor and first love does not serenade its mistress on a churchorgan In
Italy girls are married as land is sold if two estates adjoin two lives
are united As for the portionless girl she is a knickknack that goes to
the highest bidder Faustina was handed over to her purchaser as if she
had been a picture for his gallery and the transaction doubtless seemed
as natural to her as to her parents She walked to the altar like an
Iphigenia but pallor becomes a bride and it looks well for a daughter to
weep on leaving her mother Perhaps it would have been different if she had
guessed that the threshold of her new home was carpeted with love and its
four corners hung with tender thoughts of her but her husband was a silent
man who never called attention to his treasures

The great palace in Milan was a gloomy house for a girl to enter Roberto
and his sister lived in it as if it had been a monastery going nowhere and
receiving only those who labored for the Cause To Faustina accustomed to
the easy Austrian society the Sunday evening receptions at the palazzo
Siviano must have seemed as dreary as a scientific congress It pleased
Roberto to regard her as a victim of barbarian insolence an embodiment of
his country desecrated by the desire of the enemy but though like any
handsome penniless girl Faustina had now and then been exposed to a free
look or a familiar word I doubt if she connected such incidents with the
political condition of Italy She knew of course that in marrying Siviano
she was entering a house closed against the Austrian One of Sivianos
first cares had been to pension his fatherinlaw with the stipulation
that Intelvi should resign his appointment and give up all relations with
the government and the old hypocrite only too glad to purchase idleness
on such terms embraced the liberal cause with a zeal which left his
daughter no excuse for halfheartedness But he found it less easy than he
had expected to recover a footing among his own people In spite of his
patriotic bluster the Milanese held aloof from him and being the kind of
man who must always take his glass in company he gradually drifted back
to his old associates It was impossible to forbid Faustina to visit her
parents and in their house she breathed an air that was at least tolerant
of Austria

But I must not let you think that the young Countess appeared ungrateful or
unhappy She was silent and shy and it needed a more enterprising temper
than Robertos to break down the barrier between them They seemed to talk
to one another through a conventgrating rather than across a hearth but
if Roberto had asked more of her than she could give outwardly she was
a model wife She chose me at once as her confessor and I watched over
the first steps of her new life Never was younger sister tenderer to her
elder than she to Donna Marianna never was young wife more mindful of her
religious duties kinder to her dependents more charitable to the poor
yet to be with her was like living in a room with shuttered windows She
was always the caged bird the transplanted flower for all Robertos care
she never bloomed or sang

Donna Marianna was the first to speak of it The child needs more light
and air she said

Light Air Roberto repeated Does she not go to mass every morning
Does she not drive on the Corso every evening

Donna Marianna was not called clever but her heart was wiser than most
womens heads

At our age brother said she the windows of the mind face north and
look out on a landscape full of lengthening shadows Faustina needs another
outlook She is as pale as a hyacinth grown in a cellar

Roberto himself turned pale and I saw that she had uttered his own thought

You want me to let her go to Gemmas he exclaimed

Let her go wherever there is a little careless laughter

Laughternow he cried with a gesture toward the sombre line of
portraits above his head

Let her laugh while she can my brother

That evening after dinner he called Faustina to him

My child he said go and put on your jewels Your sister Gemma gives a
ball tonight and the carriage waits to take you there I am too much of a
recluse to be at ease in such scenes but I have sent word to your father
to go with you

Andrea and Gemma welcomed their young sisterinlaw with effusion and from
that time she was often in their company Gemma forbade any mention of
politics in her drawingroom and it was natural that Faustina should be
glad to escape from the solemn conclaves of the palazzo Siviano to a house
where life went as gaily as in that villa above Florence where Boccaccios
careless storytellers took refuge from the plague But meanwhile the
political distemper was rapidly spreading and in spite of Gemmas Austrian
affiliations it was no longer possible for her to receive the enemy openly
It was whispered that her door was still ajar to her old friends but
the rumor may have risen from the fact that one of the Austrian cavalry
officers stationed at Milan was her own cousin the son of the aunt on
whose misalliance the old Count had so often bantered her No one could
blame the Countess Gemma for not turning her own flesh and blood out of
doors and the social famine to which the officers of the garrison were
reduced made it natural that young Welkenstern should press the claims of
consanguinity

All this must have reached Robertos ears but he made no sign and his wife
came and went as she pleased When they returned the following year to the
old dusky villa at Siviano she was like the voice of a brook in a twilight
wood one could not look at her without ransacking the spring for new
similes to paint her freshness With Roberto it was different I found him
older more preoccupied and silent but I guessed that his preoccupations
were political for when his eye rested on his wife it cleared like the
lake when a cloudshadow lifts from it

Count Andrea and his wife occupied an adjoining villa and during the
villeggiatura the two households lived almost as one family
Roberto however was often absent in Milan called thither on business of
which the nature was not hard to guess Sometimes he brought back guests to
the villa and on these occasions Faustina and Donna Marianna went to Count
Andreas for the day I have said that I was not in his confidence but
he knew my sympathies were with the liberals and now and then he let fall
a word of the work going on underground Meanwhile the new Pope had been
elected and from Piedmont to Calabria we hailed in him the Banner that was
to lead our hosts to war

So time passed and we reached the last months of  The villa on Iseo had
been closed since the end of August Roberto had no great liking for his
gloomy palace in Milan and it had been his habit to spend nine months
of the year at Siviano but he was now too much engrossed in his work to
remain away from Milan and his wife and sister had joined him there as
soon as the midsummer heat was over During the autumn he had called me
once or twice to the city to consult me on business connected with his
fruitfarms and in the course of our talks he had sometimes let fall a
hint of graver matters It was in July of that year that a troop of Croats
had marched into Ferrara with muskets and cannon loaded The lighted
matches of their cannon had fired the sleeping hate of Austria and the
whole country now echoed the Lombard cry Out with the barbarian All
talk of adjustment compromise reorganization shrivelled on lips that
the live coal of patriotism had touched Italy for the Italians and
thenmonarchy federation republic it mattered not what

The oppressors grip had tightened on our throats and the clearsighted
saw well enough that Metternichs policy was to provoke a rebellion and
then crush it under the Croat heel But it was too late to cry prudence in
Lombardy With the first days of the new year the tobacco riots had drawn
blood in Milan Soon afterward the Lions Club was closed and edicts were
issued forbidding the singing of Pio Nonos hymn the wearing of white and
blue the collecting of subscriptions for the victims of the riots To each
prohibition Milan returned a fresh defiance The ladies of the nobility put
on mourning for the rioters who had been shot down by the soldiery Half
the members of the Guardia Nobile resigned and Count Borromeo sent back
his Golden Fleece to the Emperor Fresh regiments were continually pouring
into Milan and it was no secret that Radetsky was strengthening the
fortifications Late in January several leading liberals were arrested and
sent into exile and two weeks later martial law was proclaimed in Milan
At the first arrests several members of the liberal party had hastily left
Milan and I was not surprised to hear a few days later that orders had
been given to reopen the villa at Siviano The Count and Countess arrived
there early in February

It was seven months since I had seen the Countess and I was struck with
the change in her appearance

She was paler than ever and her step had lost its lightness Yet she
did not seem to share her husbands political anxieties one would have
said that she was hardly aware of them She seemed wrapped in a veil of
lassitude like Iseo on a still gray morning when dawn is bloodred on the
mountains but a mist blurs its reflection in the lake I felt as though her
soul were slipping away from me and longed to win her back to my care but
she made her illhealth a pretext for not coming to confession and for the
present I could only wait and carry the thought of her to the altar She
had not been long at Siviano before I discovered that this drooping mood
was only one phase of her humor Now and then she flung back the cowl of
melancholy and laughed life in the eye but next moment she was in shadow
again and her muffled thoughts had given us the slip She was like the
lake on one of those days when the wind blows twenty ways and every
promontory holds a gust in ambush

Meanwhile there was a continual coming and going of messengers between
Siviano and the city They came mostly at night when the household slept
and were away again with the last shadows but the news they brought stayed
and widened shining through every cranny of the old house The whole of
Lombardy was up From Pavia to Mantua from Como to Brescia the streets
ran blood like the arteries of one great body At Pavia and Padua the
universities were closed The frightened viceroy was preparing to withdraw
from Milan to Verona and Radetsky continued to pour his men across the
Alps till a hundred thousand were massed between the Piave and the Ticino
And now every eye was turned to Turin Ah how we watched for the blue
banner of Piedmont on the mountains Charles Albert was pledged to our
cause his whole people had armed to rescue us the streets echoed with
avanti Savoia and yet Savoy was silent and hung back Each day was
a lifetime strained to the crackingpoint with hopes and disappointments
We reckoned the hours by rumors the very minutes by hearsay Then
suddenlyah it was worth living throughword came to us that Vienna
was in revolt The points of the compass had shifted and our sun had risen
in the north I shall never forget that day at the villa Roberto sent for
me early and I found him smiling and resolute as becomes a soldier on
the eve of action He had made all his preparations to leave for Milan and
was awaiting a summons from his party The whole household felt that great
events impended and Donna Marianna awed and tearful had pleaded with
her brother that they should all receive the sacrament together the next
morning Roberto and his sister had been to confession the previous day
but the Countess Faustina had again excused herself I did not see her
while I was with the Count but as I left the house she met me in the
laurelwalk The morning was damp and cold and she had drawn a black scarf
over her hair and walked with a listless dragging step but at my approach
she lifted her head quickly and signed to me to follow her into one of the
recesses of clipped laurel that bordered the path

Don Egidio she said you have heard the news

I assented

The Count goes to Milan tomorrow

It seems probable your excellency

There will be fightingwe are on the eve of war I mean

We are in Gods hands your excellency

In Gods hands she murmured Her eyes wandered and for a moment we stood
silent then she drew a purse from her pocket I was forgetting she
exclaimed This is for that poor girl you spoke to me about the other
daywhat was her name The girl who met the Austrian soldier at the fair
at Peschiera

Ah Vannina I said but she is dead your excellency

Dead She turned white and the purse dropped from her hand I picked it
up and held it out to her but she put back my hand That is for masses
then she said and with that she moved away toward the house

I walked on to the gate but before I had reached it I heard her step
behind me

Don Egidio she called and I turned back

You are coming to say mass in the chapel tomorrow morning

That is the Counts wish

She wavered a moment I am not well enough to walk up to the village this
afternoon she said at length Will you come back later and hear my
confession here

Willingly your excellency

Come at sunset then She looked at me gravely It is a long time since I
have been to confession she added

My child the door of heaven is always unlatched

She made no answer and I went my way

I returned to the villa a little before sunset hoping for a few words
with Roberto I felt with Faustina that we were on the eve of war and the
uncertainty of the outlook made me treasure every moment of my friends
company I knew he had been busy all day but hoped to find that his
preparations were ended and that he could spare me a half hour I was not
disappointed for the servant who met me asked me to follow him to the
Counts apartment Roberto was sitting alone with his back to the door at
a table spread with maps and papers He stood up and turned an ashen face
on me

Roberto I cried as if we had been boys together

He signed to me to be seated

Egidio he said suddenly my wife has sent for you to confess her

The Countess met me on my way home this morning and expressed a wish to
receive the sacrament tomorrow morning with you and Donna Marianna and I
promised to return this afternoon to hear her confession

Roberto sat silent staring before him as though he hardly heard At length
he raised his head and began to speak

You have noticed lately that my wife has been ailing he asked

Every one must have seen that the Countess is not in her usual health She
has seemed nervous out of spiritsI have fancied that she might be
anxious about your excellency

He leaned across the table and laid his wasted hand on mine Call me
Roberto he said

There was another pause before he went on Since I saw you this morning
he said slowly something horrible has happened After you left I sent for
Andrea and Gemma to tell them the news from Vienna and the probability of
my being summoned to Milan before night You know as well as I that we have
reached a crisis There will be fighting within twentyfour hours if I
know my people and war may follow sooner than we think I felt it my duty
to leave my affairs in Andreas hands and to entrust my wife to his care
Dont look startled he added with a faint smile No reasonable man goes
on a journey without setting his house in order and if things take the
turn I expect it may be some months before you see me back at SivianoBut
it was not to hear this that I sent for you He pushed his chair aside and
walked up and down the room with his short limping step My God he broke
out wildly how can I say itWhen Andrea had heard me I saw him
exchange a glance with his wife and she said with that infernal sweet
voice of hers Yes Andrea it is our duty

Your duty I asked What is your duty

Andrea wetted his lips with his tongue and looked at her again and her
look was like a blade in his hand

Your wife has a lover he said

She caught my arm as I flung myself on him He is ten times stronger than
I but you remember how I made him howl for mercy in the old days when he
used to bully you

Let me go I said to his wife He must live to unsay it

Andrea began to whimper Oh my poor brother I would give my hearts
blood to unsay it

The secret has been killing us she chimed in

The secret Whose secret How dare you

Gemma fell on her knees like a tragedy actress Strike mekill meit is
I who am the offender It was at my house that she met him

Him

Franz Welkensternmy cousin she wailed

I suppose I stood before them like a stunned ox for they repeated the
name again and again as if they were not sure of my having heard itNot
hear it he cried suddenly dropping into a chair and hiding his face in
his hands Shall I ever on earth hear anything else again

He sat a long time with his face hidden and I waited My head was like a
great bronze bell with one thought for the clapper

After a while he went on in a low deliberate voice as though his words
were balancing themselves on the brink of madness With strange composure
he repeated each detail of his brothers charges the meetings in the
Countess Gemmas drawingroom the innocent friendliness of the two
young people the talk of mysterious visits to a villa outside the Porta
Ticinese the everwidening circle of scandal that had spread about their
names At first Andrea said he and his wife had refused to listen to the
reports which reached them Then when the talk became too loud they had
sent for Welkenstern remonstrated with him implored him to exchange into
another regiment but in vain The young officer indignantly denied the
reports and declared that to leave his post at such a moment would be
desertion

With a laborious accuracy Roberto went on detailing one by one each
incident of the hateful story till suddenly he cried out springing from
his chairAnd now to leave her with this lie unburied

His cry was like the lifting of a gravestone from my breast You must not
leave her I exclaimed

He shook his head I am pledged

This is your first duty

It would be any other mans not an Italians

I was silent in those days the argument seemed unanswerable

At length I said No harm can come to her while you are away Donna
Marianna and I are here to watch over her And when you come back

He looked at me gravely If I come back

Roberto

We are men Egidio we both know what is coming Milan is up already and
there is a rumor that Charles Albert is moving This year the spring rains
will be red in Italy

In your absence not a breath shall touch her

And if I never come back to defend her They hate her as hell hates
EgidioThey kept repeating He is of her own age and youth draws
youth She is in their way Egidio

Consider my son They do not love her perhaps but why should they hate
her at such cost She has given you no child

No child He paused But what if She has ailed lately he cried and
broke off to grapple with the stabbing thought

Roberto Roberto I adjured him

He jumped up and gripped my arm

Egidio You believe in her

Shes as pure as a lily on the altar

Those eyes are wells of truthand she has been like a daughter to
MariannaEgidio do I look like an old man

Quiet yourself Roberto I entreated

Quiet myself With this sting in my blood A loverand an Austrian lover
Oh Italy Italy my bride

I stake my life on her truth I cried and who knows better than I Has
her soul not lain before me like the bed of a clear stream

And if what you saw there was only the reflection of your faith in her

My son I am a priest and the priest penetrates to the soul as the angel
passed through the walls of Peters prison I see the truth in her heart as
I see Christ in the host

No no she is false he cried

I sprang up terrified Roberto be silent

He looked at me with a wild incredulous smile Poor simple man of God he
said

I would not exchange my simplicity for yoursthe dupe of envys first
malicious whisper

Envyyou think that

Is it questionable

You would stake your life on it

My life

Your faith

My faith

Your vows as a priest

My vows I stopped and stared at him He had risen and laid his hand on
my shoulder

You see now what I would be at he said quietly I must take your place
presently

My place

When my wife comes down You understand me

Ah now you are quite mad I cried breaking away from him

Am I he returned maintaining his strange composure Consider a moment
She has not confessed to you before since our return from Milan

Her illhealth

He cut me short with a gesture Yet today she sends for you

In order that she may receive the sacrament with you on the eve of your
first separation

If that is her only reason her first words will clear her I must hear
those words Egidio

You are quite mad I repeated

Strange he said slowly You stake your life on my wifes innocence yet
you refuse me the only means of vindicating it

I would give my life for any one of youbut what you ask is not mine to
give

The priest firstthe man afterward he sneered

Long afterward

He measured me with a contemptuous eye We laymen are ready to give the
last shred of flesh from our bones but you priests intend to keep your
cassocks whole

I tell you my cassock is not mine I repeated

And by God he cried you are right for its mine Who put it on your
back but my father What kept it there but my charity Peasant beggar
Hear his holiness pontificate Yes I said I was a peasant and a
beggar when your father found me and if he had left me one I might have
been excused for putting my hand to any ugly job that my betters required
of me but he made me a priest and so set me above all of you and laid on
me the charge of your souls as well as mine

He sat down shaken with dreadful tears Ah he broke out would you have
answered me thus when we were boys together and I stood between you and
Andrea

If God had given me the strength

You call it strength to make a womans soul your steppingstone to
heaven

Her soul is in my care not yours my son She is safe with me

She But I I go out to meet death and leave a worse death behind me
He leaned over and clutched my arm It is not for myself I plead but for
herfor her Egidio Dont you see to what a hell you condemn her if I
dont come back What chance has she against that slow unsleeping hate
Their lies will fasten themselves to her and suck out her life You and
Marianna are powerless against such enemies

You leave her in Gods hands my son

Easily saidbut ah priest if you were a man What if their poison
works in me and I go to battle thinking that every Austrian bullet may be
sent by her lovers hand What if I die not only to free Italy but to free
my wife as well

I laid my hand on his shoulder My son I answer for her Leave your faith
in her in my hands and I will keep it whole

He stared at me strangely And what if your own fail you

In her Never I call every saint to witness

And yetand yetah this is a blind he shouted you know all and
perjure yourself to spare me

At that my son I felt a knife in my breast I looked at him in anguish
and his gaze was a wall of metal Mine seemed to slip away from it like a
clawless thing struggling up the sheer side of a precipice

You know all he repeated and you dare not let me hear her

I dare not betray my trust

He waved the answer aside

Is this a time to quibble over church discipline If you believed in her
you would save her at any cost

I said to myself Eternity can hold nothing worse than this for me and
clutched my resolve again like a cross to my bosom

Just then there was a hand on the door and we heard Donna Marianna

Faustina has sent to know if the signar parocco is here

He is here Bid her come down to the chapel Roberto spoke quietly and
closed the door on her so that she should not see his face We heard her
patter away across the brick floor of the salone

Roberto turned to me Egidio he said and all at once I was no more than
a straw on the torrent of his will

The chapel adjoined the room in which we sat He opened the door and in
the twilight I saw the light glimmering before the Virgins shrine and the
old carved confessional standing like a cowled watcher in its corner But
I saw it all in a dream for nothing in heaven or earth was real to me but
the iron grip on my shoulder

Quick he said and drove me forward I heard him shoot back the bolt of
the outer door and a moment later I stood alone in the garden The sun had
set and the cold spring dusk was falling Lights shone here and there in
the long front of the villa the statues glimmered gray among the thickets
Through the windowpane of the chapel I caught the faint red gleam of the
Virgins lamp but I turned my back on it and walked away

                                   

All night I lay like a heretic on the fire Before dawn there came a call
from the villa The Count had received a second summons from Milan and was
to set out in an hour I hurried down the cold dewy path to the lake All
was new and hushed and strange as on the day of resurrection and in the
dark twilight of the garden alleys the statues stared at me like the
shrouded dead

In the salone where the old Counts portrait hung I found the
family assembled Andrea and Gemma sat together a little pinched I
thought but decent and selfcontained like mourners who expect to
inherit Donna Marianna drooped near them with something black over her
head and her face dim with weeping Roberto received me calmly and then
turned to his sister

Go fetch my wife he said

While she was gone there was silence We could hear the cold drip of the
gardenfountain and the patter of rats in the wall Andrea and his wife
stared out of window and Roberto sat in his fathers carved seat at the
head of the long table Then the door opened and Faustina entered

When I saw her I stopped breathing She seemed no more than the shell of
herself a hollow thing that grief has voided Her eyes returned our images
like polished agate but conveyed to her no sense of our presence Marianna
led her to a seat and she crossed her hands and nailed her dull gaze on
Roberto I looked from one to another and in that spectral light it seemed
to me that we were all souls come to judgment and naked to each other as to
God As to my own wrongdoing it weighed on me no more than dust The only
feeling I had room for was feara fear that seemed to fill my throat and
lungs and bubble coldly over my drowning head

Suddenly Roberto began to speak His voice was clear and steady and I
clutched at his words to drag myself above the surface of my terror He
touched on the charge that had been made against his wifehe did not say
by whomthe foul rumor that had made itself heard on the eve of their
first parting Duty he said had sent him a double summons to fight for
his country and for his wife He must clear his wifes name before he was
worthy to draw sword for Italy There was no time to tame the slander
before throttling it he had to take the shortest way to its throat At
this point he looked at me and my soul shook Then he turned to Andrea and
Gemma

When you came to me with this rumor he said quietly you agreed to
consider the family honor satisfied if I could induce Don Egidio to let me
take his place and overhear my wifes confession and if that confession
convinced me of her innocence Was this the understanding

Andrea muttered something and Gemma tapped a sullen foot

After you had left Roberto continued I laid the case before Don Egidio
and threw myself on his mercy He looked at me fixedly So strong was his
faith in my wifes innocence that for her sake he agreed to violate the
sanctity of the confessional I took his place

Marianna sobbed and crossed herself and a strange look flitted over
Faustinas face

There was a moments pause then Roberto rising walked across the room to
his wife and took her by the hand

Your seat is beside me Countess Siviano he said and led her to the
empty chair by his own

Gemma started to her feet but her husband pulled her down again

Jesus Mary We heard Donna Marianna moan

Roberto raised his wifes hand to his lips You forgive me he said the
means I took to defend you And turning to Andrea he added slowly I
declare my wife innocent and my honor satisfied You swear to stand by my
decision

What Andrea stammered out what hissing serpents of speech Gemmas clinched
teeth bit back I never knewfor my eyes were on Faustina and her face
was a wonder to behold

She had let herself be led across the room like a blind woman and had
listened without change of feature to her husbands first words but as
he ceased her frozen gaze broke and her whole body seemed to melt against
his breast He put his arm out but she slipped to his feet and Marianna
hastened forward to raise her up At that moment we heard the stroke
of oars across the quiet water and saw the Counts boat touch the
landingsteps Four strong oarsmen from Monte Isola were to row him down
to Iseo to take horse for Milan and his servant knapsack on shoulder
knocked warningly at the terrace window

No time to lose excellency he cried

Roberto turned and gripped my hand Pray for me he said low and with a
brief gesture to the others ran down the terrace to the boat

Marianna was bathing Faustina with happy tears

Look up dear Think how soon he will come back And there is the
sunrisesee

Andrea and Gemma had slunk away like ghosts at cockcrow and a red dawn
stood over Milan

                                   

If that sun rose red it set scarlet It was the first of the Five Days in
Milanthe Five Glorious Days as they are called Roberto reached the city
just before the gates closed So much we knewlittle more We heard of him
in the Broletto whence he must have escaped when the Austrians blew in
the door and in the Casa Vidiserti with Casati Cattaneo and the rest
but after the barricading began we could trace him only as having been
seen here and there in the thick of the fighting or tending the wounded
under Bertanis orders His place one would have said was in the
councilchamber with the soberer heads but that was an hour when every
man gave his blood where it was most needed and Cernuschi Dandolo
Anfossi della Porta fought shoulder to shoulder with students artisans
and peasants Certain it is that he was seen on the fifth day for among
the volunteers who swarmed after Manara in his assault on the Porta Tosa
was a servant of palazzo Siviano and this fellow swore he had seen his
master charge with Manara in the last assaulthad watched him sword
in hand press close to the gates and then as they swung open before
the victorious dash of our men had seen him drop and disappear in the
inrushing tide of peasants that almost swept the little company off its
feet After that we heard nothing There was savage work in Milan in those
days and more than one wellknown figure lay lost among the heaps of dead
hacked and disfeatured by Croat blades

At the villa we waited breathless News came to us hour by hour the very
wind seemed to carry it and it was swept to us on the incessant rush of
the rain On the twentythird Radetsky had fled from Milan to face Venice
rising in his path On the twentyfourth the first Piedmontese had crossed
the Ticino and Charles Albert himself was in Pavia on the twentyninth
The bells of Milan had carried the word from Turin to Naples from Genoa to
Ancona and the whole country was pouring like a floodtide into Lombardy
Heroes sprang up from the bloody soil as thick as wheat after rain and
every day carried some new name to us but never the one for which we
prayed and waited Weeks passed We heard of Pastrengo Goito Rivoli of
Radetsky hemmed into the Quadrilateral and our troops closing in on him
from Rome Tuscany and Venetia Months passedand we heard of Custozza We
saw Charles Alberts broken forces flung back from the Mincio to the Oglio
from the Oglio to the Adda We followed the dreadful retreat from Milan
and saw our rescuers dispersed like dust before the wind But all the while
no word came to us of Roberto

These were dark days in Lombardy and nowhere darker than in the old villa
on Iseo In September Donna Marianna and the young Countess put on black
and Count Andrea and his wife followed their example In October the
Countess gave birth to a daughter Count Andrea then took possession of the
palazzo Siviano and the two women remained at the villa I have no heart
to tell you of the days that followed Donna Marianna wept and prayed
incessantly and it was long before the baby could snatch a smile from her
As for the Countess Faustina she went among us like one of the statues in
the garden The child had a wetnurse from the village and it was small
wonder there was no milk for it in that marble breast I spent much of
my time at the villa comforting Donna Marianna as best I could but
sometimes in the long winter evenings when we three sat in the dimlylit
salone with the old Counts portrait overhead and I looked up and
saw the Countess Faustina in the tall carved seat beside her husbands
empty chair my spine grew chill and I felt a cold wind in my hair

The end of it was that in the spring I went to see my bishop and laid my
sin before him He was a saintly and merciful old man and gave me a
patient hearing

You believed the lady innocent he asked when I had ended

Monsignore on my soul

You thought to avert a great calamity from the house to which you owed
more than your life

It was my only thought

He laid his hand on my shoulder

Go home my son You shall learn my decision

Three months later I was ordered to resign my living and go to America
where a priest was needed for the Italian mission church in New York I
packed my possessions and set sail from Genoa I knew no more of America
than any peasant up in the hills I fully expected to be speared by naked
savages on landing and for the first few months after my arrival I wished
at least once a day that such a blessed fate had befallen me But it is
no part of my story to tell you what I suffered in those early days The
Church had dealt with me mercifully as is her wont and her punishment
fell far below my deserts

I had been some four years in New York and no longer thought of looking
back from the plough when one day word was brought me that an Italian
professor lay ill and had asked for a priest There were many Italian
refugees in New York at that time and the greater number being
welleducated men earned a living by teaching their language which was
then included among the accomplishments of fashionable New York The
messenger led me to a poor boardinghouse and up to a small bare room on
the top floor On the visitingcard nailed to the door I read the name De
Roberti Professor of Italian Inside a grayhaired haggard man tossed on
the narrow bed He turned a glazed eye on me as I entered and I recognized
Roberto Siviano

I steadied myself against the doorpost and stood staring at him without a
word

Whats the matter asked the doctor who was bending over the bed I
stammered that the sick man was an old friend

He wouldnt know his oldest friend just now said the doctor The
fevers on him but it will go down toward sunset

I sat down at the head of the bed and took Robertos hand in mine

Is he going to die I asked

I dont believe so but he wants nursing

I will nurse him

The doctor nodded and went out I sat in the little room with Robertos
burning hand in mine Gradually his skin cooled the fingers grew quiet
and the flush faded from his sallow cheekbones Toward dusk he looked up
at me and smiled

Egidio he said quietly

I administered the sacrament which he received with the most fervent
devotion then he fell into a deep sleep

During the weeks that followed I had no time to ask myself the meaning of
it all My one business was to keep him alive if I could I fought the
fever day and night and at length it yielded For the most part he raved
or lay unconscious but now and then he knew me for a moment and whispered
Egidio with a look of peace

I had stolen many hours from my duties to nurse him and as soon as the
danger was past I had to go back to my parish work Then it was that I
began to ask myself what had brought him to America but I dared not face
the answer

On the fourth day I snatched a moment from my work and climbed to his
room I found him sitting propped against his pillows weak as a child but
cleareyed and quiet I ran forward but his look stopped me

Signor parocco he said the doctor tells me that I owe my life
to your nursing and I have to thank you for the kindness you have shown to
a friendless stranger

A stranger I gasped

He looked at me steadily I am not aware that we have met before he
said

For a moment I thought the fever was on him but a second glance convinced
me that he was master of himself

Roberto I cried trembling

You have the advantage of me he said civilly But my name is Roberti
not Roberto

The floor swam under me and I had to lean against the wall

You are not Count Roberto Siviano of Milan

I am Tommaso de Roberti professor of Italian from Modena

And you have never seen me before

Never that I know of

Were you never at Siviano on the lake of Iseo I faltered

He said calmly I am unacquainted with that part of Italy

My heart grew cold and I was silent

You mistook me for a friend I suppose he added

Yes I cried I mistook you for a friend and with that I fell on my
knees by his bed and cried like a child

Suddenly I felt a touch on my shoulder Egidio said he in a broken
voice look up

I raised my eyes and there was his old smile above me and we clung to
each other without a word Presently however he drew back and put me
quietly aside

Sit over there Egidio My bones are like water and I am not good for much
talking yet

Let us wait Roberto Sleep nowwe can talk tomorrow

No What I have to say must be said at once He examined me thoughtfully
You have a parish here in New York

I assented

And my work keeps me here I have pupils It is too late to make a
change

A change

He continued to look at me calmly It would be difficult for me he
explained to find employment in a new place

But why should you leave here

I shall have to he returned deliberately if you persist in recognizing
in me your former friend Count Siviano

Roberto

He lifted his hand Egidio he said I am alone here and without
friends The companionship the sympathy of my parish priest would be a
consolation in this strange city but it must not be the companionship of
the parocco of Siviano You understand

Roberto I cried it is too dreadful to understand

Be a man Egidio said he with a touch of impatience The choice lies
with you and you must make it now If you are willing to ask no questions
to name no names to make no allusions to the past let us live as friends
together in Gods name If not as soon as my legs can carry me I must be
off again The world is wide luckilybut why should we be parted

I was on my knees at his side in an instant We must never be parted I
cried Do as you will with me Give me your orders and I obeyhave I not
always obeyed you

I felt his hand close sharply on mine Egidio he admonished me

NonoI shall remember I shall say nothing

Think nothing

Think nothing I said with a last effort

God bless you he answered

My son for eight years I kept my word to him We met daily almost we ate
and walked and talked together we lived like David and Jonathanbut
without so much as a glance at the past How he had escaped from Milanhow
he had reached New YorkI never knew We talked often of Italys
liberationas what Italians would notbut never touched on his share in
the work Once only a word slipped from him and that was when one day he
asked me how it was that I had been sent to America The blood rushed to my
face and before I could answer he had raised a silencing hand

I see he said it was your penance too

During the first years he had plenty of work to do but he lived so
frugally that I guessed he had some secret use for his earnings It was
easy to conjecture what it was All over the world Italian exiles were
toiling and saving to further the great cause He had political friends in
New York and sometimes he went to other cities to attend meetings and make
addresses His zeal never slackened and but for me he would often have
gone hungry that some shivering patriot might dine I was with him heart
and soul but I had the parish on my shoulders and perhaps my long
experience of men had made me a little less credulous than Christian
charity requires for I could have sworn that some of the heroes who hung
on him had never had a whiff of Austrian blood and would have fed out of
the same trough with the whitecoats if there had been polenta enough to go
round Happily my friend had no such doubts He believed in the patriots as
devoutly as in the cause and if some of his hardearned dollars travelled
no farther than the nearest winecellar or cigarshop he never suspected
the course they took

His health was never the same after the fever and by and by he began to
lose his pupils and the patriots cooled off as his pockets fell in Toward
the end I took him to live in my shabby attic He had grown weak and had a
troublesome cough and he spent the greater part of his days indoors Cruel
days they must have been to him but he made no sign and always welcomed
me with a cheerful word When his pupils dropped off and his health made
it difficult for him to pick up work outside he set up a letterwriters
sign and used to earn a few pennies by serving as amanuensis to my poor
parishioners but it went against him to take their money and half the
time he did the work for nothing I knew it was hard for him to live on
charity as he called it and I used to find what jobs I could for him
among my friends the negozianti who would send him letters to copy
accounts to make up and what not but we were all poor together and the
master had licked the platter before the dog got it

So lived that just man my son and so after eight years of exile he died
one day in my arms God had let him live long enough to see Solferino and
Villafranca and was perhaps never more merciful than in sparing him Monte
Rotondo and Mentana But these are things of which it does not become me to
speak The new Italy does not wear the face of our visions but it is
written that God shall know His own and it cannot be that He shall misread
the hearts of those who dreamed of fashioning her in His image

As for my friend he is at peace I doubt not and his just life and holy
death intercede for me who sinned for his sake alone
