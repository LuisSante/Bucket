INTRODUCTION


THIRTY years have passed like a watch in the night since the earlier of
the two sets of verses here reprinted Ballades in Blue China was
published  At first there were but twentytwo Ballades ten more were
added later  They appeared in a little white vellum wrapper with a
little blue Chinese singer copied from a porcelain jar and the
frontispiece was a little design by an etcher now famous

Thirty years ago blue china was a kind of fetish in some circles
sthetic circles of which the balladist was not a member

The ballade was an old French form of verse in France revived by
Thodore de Banville and restored to an England which had long forgotten
the Middle Ages by my friends Mr Austin Dobson and Mr Edmund Gosse
They so far as I can trust my memory were the first to reintroduce
these pleasant old French nugae while an anonymous author let loose
upon the town a whole winged flock of ballades of amazing dexterity
This unknown balladist was Mr Henley perhaps he was the first
Englishman who ever burst into a double ballade and his translations
of two of Villons ballades into modern thieves slang were marvels of
dexterity  Mr Swinburne wrote a serious ballade but the form I
venture to think is not wholly serious of its nature in modern days
and he did not persevere  Nor did the taste for these trifles long
endure  A good ballade is almost as rare as a good sonnet but a
middling ballade is almost as easily written as the majority of
sonnets  Either form readily becomes mechanical cheap and facile  I
have heard Mr George Meredith improvise a sonnet a Petrarchian sonnet
obedient to the rules without pen and paper  He spoke and the numbers
came he sonneted as easily as a living poet in his Eton days
improvised Latin elegiacs and Greek hexameters

The sonnet endures  Mr Horace Hutchinson wrote somewhere When you
have read a sonnet you feel that though there does not seem to be much
of it you have done a good deal as when you have eaten a cold
hardboiled egg  Still people keep on writing sonnets because the
sonnet is wholly serious  In an English sonnet you cannot easily be
flippant of pen  A few great poets have written immortal sonnetsamong
them are Milton Wordsworth and Keats  Thus the sonnet is a thing which
every poet thinks it worth while to try at like Felix Arvers he may be
made immortal by a single sonnet  Even I have written one too many
Every anthologist wants to anthologise it The Odyssey it never was a
favourite of my own though it had the honour to be kindly spoken of by
Mr Matthew Arnold

On the other hand no man since Franois Villon has been immortalised by
a single balladeMais o sont les neiges dantan

To speak in any detail about these poor ballades would be to indite a
part of an autobiography  Looking back at the little book what
memories it stirs in one to whom

    Fate has done this wrong
    That I should write too much and live too long

The Ballade of the Tweed and the Rhymes  la Mode were dedicated to
the dearest of kinsmen a cricketer and angler  The Ballade of
Roulette was inscribed to R R a gallant veteran of the Indian Mutiny
a leader of Light Horse whose father was a friend of Sir Walter Scott
He was himself a Borderer in whose defeats on the green field of
Roulette I often shared long long ago

So many have gone into the world of light that it is a happiness to
think of him to whom The Ballade of Golf was dedicated and to remember
that he is still capable of scoring his double century at cricket and of
lifting the ball high over the trees beyond the boundaries of a great
cricketfield  Perhaps Mr Leslie BalfourMelville will pardon me for
mentioning his name linked as it is with so many common memories  One
is taken and another left

A different sort of memory attaches itself to A Ballade of Dead Cities
It was written in a Theocritean amoebean way in competition with Mr
Edmund Gosse he need not be ashamed of the circumstance for another
shepherd who was umpire awarded the prize two kids just severed from
their dams to his victorious muse

The Ballade of the Midnight Forest the Ballade of the Huntress
Artemis was translated from Thodore de Banville whose beautiful poem
came so near the Greek that when the late Provost of Oriel translated a
part of its English shadow into Greek hexameters you might suppose as
you read that they were part of a lost Homeric Hymn

I never wrote a double ballade and stanzas four and five of the
Double Ballade of Primitive Man were contributed by the learned doyen
of Anthropology Mr E B Tylor author of Primitive Culture

 tout seigneur tout honneur

In Ballade of his Choice of a Sepulchre the Windburg is a hill in
Teviotdale  A Portrait of  was written on a French engraving after
Morland and Benedetta Ramus was addressed to a mezzotint an artists
proof very rare  It is after Romney and is My Beauty as Charles
Lamb said once unluckily to a Scot of an engraving after Lionardo
of some fair dead lady

The sonnet Natural Theology is the germ of what the author has since
written in The Making of Religion on the long neglected fact that
many of the lowest savages known share the belief in a benevolent All
Father and Judge of men

Concerning verses in Rhymes  la Mode visitors to St Andrews may be
warned not to visit St Leonards Chapel described in the second stanza
of Almae Matres  In the writers youth and even in middle age

    He loitered idly where the tall
       Freshbudded mountainashes blow
    Within its desecrated wall

The once beautiful ruins carpeted with grass and wild flowers have been
doubly desecrated by persons academic persons having authority and a
plentiful lack of taste  The slim mountainashes fair as the young
palmtree that Odysseus saw beside the shrine of Apollo in Delos have
been cut down by the academic persons to whom power is given  The grass
and flowers have been rooted up  Hideous little wooden fences enclose
the grave slabs a roof of a massive kind has been dumped down on the old
walls and the windows once so graceful in their airy lines have been
glazed in a horrible manner while the ugly iron gate precludes entrance
to a shrine which is now a black and dismal dungeon

    Oh be that roof as lead to lead
    Above the dull Restorers head
    A Minstrels malison is said

Notes explanatory are added to the Rhymes and their information however
valuable need not here be repeated

A BALLADE OF XXXII BALLADES


   Friend when you bear a caredulled eye
   And brow perplexed with things of weight
   And fain would bid some charm untie
   The bonds that hold you all too strait
   Behold a solace to your fate
   Wrapped in this covers china blue
   These ballades fresh and delicate
   This dainty troop of Thirtytwo

   The mind unwearied longs to fly
   And commune with the wise and great
   But that same ether rare and high
   Which glorifies its worthy mate
   To breath forspent is disparate
   Laughing and light and airynew
   These come to tickle the dull pate
   This dainty troop of Thirtytwo

   Most welcome then when you and I
   Forestalling days for mirth too late
   To quips and cranks and fantasy
   Some choice halfhour dedicate
   They weave their dance with measured rate
   Of rhymes enlinked in order due
   Till frowns relax and cares abate
   This dainty troop of Thirtytwo

                                  ENVOY

   Princes of toys that please your state
   Quainter are surely none to view
   Than these which pass with tripping gait
   This dainty troop of Thirtytwo

                                                                     F P

BALLADE TO THEOCRITUS IN WINTER


                              

                                                             Id viii 

   Ah leave the smoke the wealth the roar
   Of London and the bustling street
   For still by the Sicilian shore
   The murmur of the Muse is sweet
   Still still the suns of summer greet
   The mountaingrave of Helik
   And shepherds still their songs repeat
   Where breaks the blue Sicilian sea

   What though they worship Pan no more
   That guarded once the shepherds seat
   They chatter of their rustic lore
   They watch the wind among the wheat
   Cicalas chirp the young lambs bleat
   Where whispers pine to cypress tree
   They count the waves that idly beat
   Where breaks the blue Sicilian sea

   Theocritus thou canst restore
   The pleasant years and overfleet
   With thee we live as men of yore
   We rest where running waters meet
   And then we turn unwilling feet
   And seek the worldso must it be
   We may not linger in the heat
   Where breaks the blue Sicilian sea

                                  ENVOY

   Masterwhen rain and snow and sleet
   And northern winds are wild to thee
   We come we rest in thy retreat
   Where breaks the blue Sicilian sea



BALLADE OF CLEOPATRAS NEEDLE


   Ye giant shades of RA and TUM
   Ye ghosts of gods Egyptian
   If murmurs of our planet come
   To exiles in the precincts wan
   Where fetish or Olympian
   To help or harm no more ye list
   Look down if look ye may and scan
   This monument in London mist

   Behold the hieroglyphs are dumb
   That once were read of him that ran
   When seistron cymbal trump and drum
   Wild music of the Bull began
   When through the chanting priestly clan
   Walkd Ramses and the high sun kissd
   This stone with blessing scored and ban
   This monument in London mist

   The stone endures though gods be numb
   Though human effort plot and plan
   Be sifted drifted like the sum
   Of sands in wastes Arabian
   What king may deem him more than man
   What priest says Faith can Time resist
   While this endures to mark their span
   This monument in London mist

                                  ENVOY

   Prince the stones shade on your divan
   Falls it is longer than ye wist
   It preaches as Times gnomon can
   This monument in London mist



BALLADE OF ROULETTE


                                 TO R R

   This lifeone was thinking today
   In the midst of a medley of fancies
   Is a game and the board where we play
   Green earth with her poppies and pansies
   Let manque be faded romances
   Be passe remorse and regret
   Hearts dance with the wheel as it dances
   The wheel of Dame Fortunes roulette

   An Englishman punts with his pay

BALLADE OF SLEEP


   The hours are passing slow
   I hear their weary tread
   Clang from the tower and go
   Back to their kinsfolk dead
   Sleep deaths twin brother dread
   Why dost thou scorn me so
   The winds voice overhead
   Long wakeful here I know
   And music from the steep
   Where waters fall and flow
   Wilt thou not hear me Sleep

   All sounds that might bestow
   Rest on the feverd bed
   All slumbrous sounds and low
   Are mingled here and wed
   And bring no drowsihed
   Shy dreams flit to and fro
   With shadowy hair dispread
   With wistful eyes that glow
   And silent robes that sweep
   Thou wilt not hear me no
   Wilt thou not hear me Sleep

   What cause hast thou to show
   Of sacrifice unsped
   Of all thy slaves below
   I most have labourd
   With service sung and said
   Have culld such buds as blow
   Soft poppies white and red
   Where thy still gardens grow
   And Lethes waters weep
   Why then art thou my foe
   Wilt thou not hear me Sleep

                                  ENVOY

   Prince ere the dark be shred
   By golden shafts ere low
   And long the shadows creep
   Lord of the wand of lead
   Softfooted as the snow
   Wilt thou not hear me Sleep



BALLADE OF THE MIDNIGHT FOREST


                       AFTER THODORE DE BANVILLE

   Still sing the mocking fairies as of old
   Beneath the shade of thorn and hollytree
   The west wind breathes upon them pure and cold
   And wolves still dread Diana roaming free
   In secret woodland with her company
   Tis thought the peasants hovels know her rite
   When now the wolds are bathed in silver light
   And first the moonrise breaks the dusky grey
   Then down the dells with blown soft hair and bright
   And through the dim wood Dian threads her way

   With waterweeds twined in their locks of gold
   The strange cold forestfairies dance in glee
   Sylphs overtimorous and overbold
   Haunt the dark hollows where the dwarf may be
   The wild red dwarf the nixies enemy
   Then mid their mirth and laughter and affright
   The sudden Goddess enters tall and white
   With one long sigh for summers passd away
   The swift feet tear the ivy nets outright
   And through the dim wood Dian threads her way

   She gleans her silvan trophies down the wold
   She hears the sobbing of the stags that flee
   Mixed with the music of the hunting rolld
   But her delight is all in archery
   And naught of ruth and pity wotteth she
   More than her hounds that follow on the flight
   The goddess draws a golden bow of might
   And thick she rains the gentle shafts that slay
   She tosses loose her locks upon the night
   And through the dim wood Dian threads her way

                                  ENVOY

   Prince let us leave the din the dust the spite
   The gloom and glare of towns the plague the blight
   Amid the forest leaves and fountain spray
   There is the mystic home of our delight
   And through the dim wood Dian threads her way

BALLADE OF THE BOOKHUNTER


   In torrid heats of late July
   In March beneath the bitter bise
   He bookhunts while the loungers fly
   He bookhunts though December freeze
   In breeches baggy at the knees
   And heedless of the public jeers
   For these for these he hoards his fees
   Aldines Bodonis Elzevirs

   No dismal stall escapes his eye
   He turns oer tomes of low degrees
   There soiled romanticists may lie
   Or Restoration comedies
   Each tract that flutters in the breeze
   For him is charged with hopes and fears
   In mouldy novels fancy sees
   Aldines Bodonis Elzevirs

   With restless eyes that peer and spy
   Sad eyes that heed not skies nor trees
   In dismal nooks he loves to pry
   Whose motto evermore is Spes
   But ah the fabled treasure flees
   Grown rarer with the fleeting years
   In rich mens shelves they take their ease

BALLADE OF THE VOYAGE TO CYTHERA


                       AFTER THODORE DE BANVILLE

   I know Cythera long is desolate
   I know the winds have strippd the gardens green
   Alas my friends beneath the fierce suns weight
   A barren reef lies where Loves flowers have been
   Nor ever lover on that coast is seen
   So be it but we seek a fabled shore
   To lull our vague desires with mystic lore
   To wander where Loves labyrinths beguile
   There let us land there dream for evermore
   It may be we shall touch the happy isle

   The sea may be our sepulchre  If Fate
   If tempests wreak their wrath on us serene
   We watch the bolt of heaven and scorn the hate
   Of angry gods that smite us in their spleen
   Perchance the jealous mists are but the screen
   That veils the fairy coast we would explore
   Come though the sea be vexd and breakers roar
   Come for the air of this old world is vile
   Haste we and toil and faint not at the oar
   It may be we shall touch the happy isle

   Grey serpents trail in temples desecrate
   Where Cypris smiled the golden maid the queen
   And ruined is the palace of our state
   But happy Loves flit round the mast and keen
   The shrill wind sings the silken cords between
   Heroes are we with wearied hearts and sore
   Whose flower is faded and whose locks are hoar
   Yet haste light skiffs where myrtle thickets smile
   Loves panthers sleep mid roses as of yore
   It may be we shall touch the happy isle

                                  ENVOY

   Sad eyes the blue sea laughs as heretofore
   Ah singing birds your happy music pour
   Ah poets leave the sordid earth awhile
   Flit to these ancient gods we still adore
   It may be we shall touch the happy isle



BALLADE OF THE SUMMER TERM


 Being a Petition in the form of a Ballade praying the University
                Commissioners to spare the Summer Term

   When Lent and Responsions are ended
   When May with fritillaries waits
   When the flower of the chestnut is splendid
   When drags are at all of the gates
   Those drags the philosopher slates
   With a scorn that is truly sublime 
   Life wins from the grasp of the Fates
   Sweet hours and the fleetest of time

   When wickets are bowld and defended
   When Isis is glad with the Eights
   When music and sunset are blended
   When Youth and the summer are mates
   When Freshmen are heedless of Greats
   And when notebooks are coverd with rhyme
   Ah these are the hours that one rates
   Sweet hours and the fleetest of time

   When the brow of the Dean is unbended
   At luncheons and mild ttettes
   When the Tutors in love nor offended
   By blunders in tenses or dates
   When bouquets are purchased of Bates
   When the bells in their melody chime
   When unheeded the Lecturer prates
   Sweet hours and the fleetest of time

                                  ENVOY

   Reformers of Schools and of States
   Is mirth so tremendous a crime

   The man whom once Melpomene
   Thou lookst on with benignant sight
   Shall never at the Isthmus be
   A boxer eminent in fight
   Nor fares he foremost in the flight
   Of Grecian cars to victory
   Nor goes with Delian laurels dight
   The man thou lovst Melpomene

   Not him the Capitol shall see
   As who hath crushd the threats and might
   Of monarchs march triumphantly
   But Fame shall crown him in his right
   Of all the Roman lyre that smite
   The first so woods of Tivoli
   Proclaim him so her waters bright
   The man thou lovst Melpomene

   The sons of queenly Rome count me
   Me too with them whose chants delight
   The poets kindly company
   Now broken is the tooth of spite
   But thou that temperest aright
   The golden lyre all all to thee
   He oweslife fame and fortunes height
   The man thou lovst Melpomene

                                  ENVOY

   Queen that to mute lips couldst unite
   The wild swans dying melody

BALLADE AGAINST THE JESUITS


                            AFTER LA FONTAINE

   Rome does right well to censure all the vain
   Talk of Jansenius and of them who preach
   That earthly joys are damnable  Tis plain
   We need not charge at Heaven as at a breach
   No amble on  Well gain it one and all
   The narrow paths a dream fantastical
   And Arnaulds quite superfluously driven
   Mirth from the world  Well scale the heavenly wall
   Escobar makes a primrose path to heaven

   He does not hold a man may well be slain
   Who vexes with unseasonable speech
   You may do murder for five ducats gain
   Not for a pin a ribbon or a peach
   He ventures most consistently to teach
   That there are certain cases that befall
   When perjury need no good man appal
   And life of love he says may keep a leaven
   Sure hearing this a grateful world will bawl
   Escobar makes a primrose path to heaven

   For Gods sake read me somewhat in the strain
   Of his most cheering volumes I beseech
   Why should I name them all a mighty train
   So many none may know the name of each
   Make these your compass to the heavenly beach
   These only in your library instal
   Burn Pascal and his fellows great and small
   Dolts that in vain with Escobar have striven
   I tell you and the common voice doth call
   Escobar makes a primrose path to heaven

                                  ENVOY

   Satan that pride did hurry to thy fall
   Thou porter of the grim infernal hall
   Thou keeper of the courts of souls unshriven
   To shun thy shafts to scape thy hellish thrall
   Escobar makes a primrose path to heaven

   Of Babel on the desert wold
   The loves of Corinth and the lust
   Orchomenos increased with gold
   The town of Jason overbold
   And Cherson smitten in her prime
   What are they but a dream halftold
   Where are the cities of old time

   In towns that were a kingdoms trust
   In dim Atlantic forests fold
   The marble wasteth to a crust
   The granite crumbles into mould
   Oer theseleft nameless from of old
   As over Shinars brick and slime
   One vast forgetfulness is rolld
   Where are the cities of old time

   The lapse of ages and the rust
   The fire the frost the waters cold
   Efface the evil and the just
   From Thebes that Eriphyle sold
   To drownd CaerIs whose sweet bells tolld
   Beneath the wave a dreamy chime
   That echod from the mountainhold

DOUBLE BALLADE OF PRIMITIVE MAN


                             TO J A FARRER

   He lived in a cave by the seas
   He lived upon oysters and foes
   But his list of forbidden degrees
   An extensive morality shows
   Geological evidence goes
   To prove he had never a pan
   But he shaved with a shell when he chose
   Twas the manner of Primitive Man

   He worshippd the rain and the breeze
   He worshippd the river that flows
   And the Dawn and the Moon and the trees
   And bogies and serpents and crows
   He buried his dead with their toes
   Tuckedup an original plan
   Till their knees came right under their nose
   Twas the manner of Primitive Man

   His communal wives at his ease
   He would curb with occasional blows
   Or his State had a queen like the bees
   As another philosopher trows
   When he spoke it was never in prose
   But he sang in a strain that would scan
   For to doubt it perchance were morose
   Twas the manner of Primitive Man

   On the coasts that incessantly freeze
   With his stones and his bones and his bows
   On luxuriant tropical leas
   Where the summer eternally glows
   He is found and his habits disclose
   Let theology say what she can
   That he lived in the long long agos
   Twas the manner of Primitive Man

   From a status like that of the Crees
   Our societys fabric arose
   Developd evolved if you please
   But deluded chronologists chose
   In a fancied accordance with Mos
   es  BC for the span
   When he rushed on the world and its woes
   Twas the manner of Primitive Man

   But the mild anthropologisthes
   Not recent inclined to suppose
   Flints Palolithic like these
   Quaternary bones such as those
   In Rhinoceros Mammoth and Cos
   First epoch the Human began
   Theologians all to expose
   Tis the mission of Primitive Man

   MAX proudly your Aryans pose
   But their rigs they undoubtedly ran

BALLADE OF AUTUMN


   We built a castle in the air
   In summer weather you and I
   The wind and sun were in your hair
   Gold hair against a sapphire sky
   When Autumn came with leaves that fly
   Before the storm across the plain
   You fled from me with scarce a sigh
   My Love returns no more again

   The windy lights of Autumn flare
   I watch the moonlit sails go by
   I marvel how men toil and fare
   The weary business that they ply
   Their voyaging is vanity
   And fairy gold is all their gain
   And all the winds of winter cry
   My Love returns no more again

   Here in my castle of Despair
   I sit alone with memory
   The windfed wolf has left his lair
   To keep the outcast company
   The brooding owl he hoots hard by
   The hare shall kindle on thy hearthstane
   The Rhymers soothest prophecy
   My Love returns no more again

                                  ENVOY

   Lady my home until I die
   Is here where youth and hope were slain

BALLADE OF TRUE WISDOM


   While others are asking for beauty or fame
   Or praying to know that for which they should pray
   Or courting Queen Venus that affable dame
   Or chasing the Muses the weary and grey
   The sage has found out a more excellent way
   To Pan and to Pallas his incense he showers
   And his humble petition puts up day by day
   For a house full of books and a garden of flowers

   Inventors may bow to the God that is lame
   And crave from the fire on his stithy a ray
   Philosophers kneel to the God without name
   Like the people of Athens agnostics are they
   The hunter a fawn to Diana will slay
   The maiden wild roses will wreathe for the Hours
   But the wise man will ask ere libation he pay
   For a house full of books and a garden of flowers

   Oh grant me a life without pleasure or blame
   As mortals count pleasure who rush through their day
   With a speed to which that of the tempest is tame
   O grant me a house by the beach of a bay
   Where the waves can be surly in winter and play
   With the seaweed in summer ye bountiful powers
   And Id leave all the hurry the noise and the fray
   For a house full of books and a garden of flowers

                                  ENVOY

   Gods grant or withhold it your yea and your nay
   Are immutable heedless of outcry of ours

   Money moves the merchants all
   While the tides shall ebb and flow
   Money maketh Evil show
   Like the Good and Truth like lies
   These alone can neer bestow
   Youth and health and Paradise

   Money maketh festival
   Wine she buys and beds can strow
   Round the necks of captains tall
   Money wins them chains to throw
   Marches soldiers to and fro
   Gaineth ladies with sweet eyes
   These alone can neer bestow
   Youth and health and Paradise

   Money wins the priest his stall
   Money mitres buys I trow
   Red hats for the Cardinal
   Abbeys for the novice low
   Money maketh sin as snow
   Place of penitence supplies
   These alone can neer bestow
   Youth and health and Paradise

BALLADE OF THE BOOKWORM


   Far in the Past I peer and see
   A Child upon the Nursery floor
   A Child with books upon his knee
   Who asks like Oliver for more
   The number of his years is IV
   And yet in Letters hath he skill
   How deep he dives in Fairylore
   The Books I loved I love them still

   One gift the Fairies gave me Three
   They commonly bestowed of yore
   The Love of Books the Golden Key
   That opens the Enchanted Door
   Behind it BLUEBEARD lurks and oer
   And oer doth JACK his Giants kill
   And there is all ALADDINS store
   The Books I loved I love them still

   Take all but leave my Books to me
   These heavy creels of old we bore
   We fill not now nor wander free
   Nor wear the heart that once we wore
   Not now each River seems to pour
   His waters from the Muses hill
   Though somethings gone from stream and shore
   The Books I loved I love them still

                                  ENVOY

   Fate that art Queen by shore and sea
   We bow submissive to thy will
   Ah grant by some benign decree
   The Books I lovedto love them still



VALENTINE IN FORM OF BALLADE


   The soft wind from the south land sped
   He set his strength to blow
   From forests where Adonis bled
   And lily flowers arow
   He crossed the straits like streams that flow
   The ocean dark as wine
   To my true love to whisper low
   To be your Valentine

   The Spring halfraised her drowsy head
   Besprent with drifted snow
   Ill send an April day she said
   To lands of wintry woe
   He camethe winters overthrow
   With showers that sing and shine
   Pied daisies round your path to strow
   To be your Valentine

   Where sands of Egypt swart and red
   Neath suns Egyptian glow
   In places of the princely dead
   By the Niles overflow
   The swallow preened her wings to go
   And for the North did pine
   And fain would brave the frost her foe
   To be your Valentine

                                  ENVOY

   Spring Swallow South Wind even so
   Their various voice combine
   But that they crave on me bestow
   To be your Valentine



BALLADE OF OLD PLAYS

   When these Old Plays were new the King
   Beside the Cardinals chair
   Applauded mid the courtly ring
   The verses of Molire
   Pointlace was then the only wear
   Old Corneille came to woo
   And bright Du Parc was young and fair
   When these Old Plays were new

                               LA COMDIE

   How shrill the butchers catcalls ring
   How loud the lackeys swear
   Black pipebowls on the stage they fling
   At Brcourt fuming there
   The Porters stabbed a Mousquetaire
   Breaks in with noisy crew
   Twas all a commonplace affair
   When these Old Plays were new

                                LA VILLE

   When these Old Plays were new  They bring
   A host of phantoms rare
   Old jests that float old jibes that sting
   Old faces peaked with care
   Mnages smirk de Viss stare
   The thefts of Jean Ribou
   Ah publishers were hard to bear
   When these Old Plays were new

                                  ENVOY

   Ghosts at your Poets word ye dare
   To break Deaths dungeons through
   And frisk as in that golden air
   When these Old Plays were new



BALLADE OF HIS BOOKS


   Here stand my books line upon line
   They reach the roof and row by row
   They speak of faded tastes of mine
   And things I did but do not know
   Old school books useless long ago
   Old Logics where the spirit railed in
   Could scarcely answer yes or no
   The many things Ive tried and failed in

   Heres Villon in morocco fine
   The Poet starved in mud and snow
   Glatigny does not crave to dine
   And Rens tears forget to flow
   And heres a work by Mrs Crowe
   With hosts of ghosts and bogies jailed in
   Ah all my ghosts have gone below
   The many things Ive tried and failed in

   Hes touched this mouldy Greek divine
   The Princess DEstes hand of snow
   And here the arms of DHoym shine
   And theres a tearbestained Rousseau
   Heres Carlyle shrieking woe on woe
   The first edition this he wailed in
   I once believed in himbut oh
   The many things Ive tried and failed in

                                  ENVOY

   Prince tastes may differ mine and thine
   Quite other balances are scaled in
   May you succeed though I repine
   The many things Ive tried and failed in



BALLADE OF THE DREAM


   Swift as sound of music fled
   When no more the organ sighs
   Sped as all old days are sped
   So your lips love and your eyes
   So your gentlevoiced replies
   Mine one hour in sleep that seem
   Rise and flit when slumber flies
   Following darkness like a dream

   Like the scent from roses red
   Like the dawn from golden skies
   Like the semblance of the dead
   From the living love that hies
   Like the shifting shade that lies
   On the moonlightsilvered stream
   So you rise when dreams arise
   Following darkness like a dream

   Could some spell or sung or said
   Could some kindly witch and wise
   Lull for aye this dreaming head
   In a mist of memories
   I would lie like him who lies
   Where the lights on Latmos gleam
   Wake not find not Paradise
   Following darkness like a dream

                                  ENVOY

   Sleep that givst what Life denies
   Shadowy bounties and supreme
   Bring the dearest face that flies
   Following darkness like a dream



BALLADE OF THE SOUTHERN CROSS


   Fair islands of the silver fleece
   Hoards of unsunned uncounted gold
   Whose havens are the haunts of Peace
   Whose boys are in our quarrel bold
   Our bolt is shot our tale is told
   Our ship of state in storms may toss
   But ye are young if we are old
   Ye Islands of the Southern Cross

   Ay we must dwindle and decrease
   Such fates the ruthless years unfold
   And yet we shall not wholly cease
   We shall not perish unconsoled
   Nay still shall Freedom keep her hold
   Within the seas inviolate fosse
   And boast her sons of English mould
   Ye Islands of the Southern Cross

   All empires tumbleRome and Greece
   Their swords are rust their altars cold
   For us the Children of the Seas
   Who ruled whereer the waves have rolled
   For us in Fortunes books enscrolled
   I read no runes of hopeless loss
   Norwhile ye lastour knell is tolled
   Ye Islands of the Southern Cross

                                  ENVOY

   Britannia when thy hearths acold
   When oer thy grave has grown the moss
   Still Rule Australia shall be trolled
   In Islands of the Southern Cross



BALLADE OF AUCASSIN


   Where smooth the southern waters run
   By rustling leagues of poplars grey
   Beneath a veiled soft southern sun
   We wandered out of yesterday
   Went maying through that ancient May
   Whose fallen flowers are fragrant yet
   And loitered by the fountain spray
   With Aucassin and Nicolette

   The grassgrown paths are trod of none
   Where through the woods they went astray
   The spiders traceries are spun
   Across the darkling forest way
   There come no knights that ride to slay
   No pilgrims through the grasses wet
   No shepherd lads that sang their say
   With Aucassin and Nicolette

   Twas here by Nicolette begun
   Her bower of boughs and grasses gay
   Scaped from the cell of marble dun
   Twas here the lover found the fay
   Ah lovers fond ah foolish play
   How hard we find it to forget
   Who fain would dwell with them as they
   With Aucassin and Nicolette

                                  ENVOY

   Prince tis a melancholy lay
   For youth for love we both regret
   How fair they seem how far away
   With Aucassin and Nicolette



BALLADE AMOUREUSE


                             AFTER FROISSART

   Not Jason nor Medea wise
   I crave to see nor win much lore
   Nor list to Orpheus minstrelsies
   Nor Hercles would I see that oer
   The wide world roamed from shore to shore
   Nor by St James Penelope
   Nor pure Lucrece such wrong that bore
   To see my Love suffices me

   Virgil and Cato no man vies
   With them in wealth of clerkly store
   I would not see them with mine eyes
   Nor him that sailed sans sail nor oar
   Across the barren sea and hoar
   And all for love of his ladye
   Nor pearl nor sapphire takes me more
   To see my Love suffices me

   I heed not Pegasus that flies
   As swift as shafts the bowmen pour
   Nor famed Pygmalions artifice
   Whereof the like was neer before
   Nor Olus that drank of yore
   The salt wave of the whole great sea
   Why dost thou ask  Tis as I swore
   To see my Love suffices me



BALLADE OF QUEEN ANNE


   The modish Airs
   The Tansey Brew
   The Swains and Fairs
   In curtained Pew

   We buy her Chairs
   Her China blue
   Her redbrick Squares
   We build anew
   But ah we rue
   When all is said
   The tale oertrue
   QUEEN ANNE is dead

BALLADE OF BLIND LOVE


                       AFTER LYONNET DE COISMES

   Who have loved and ceased to love forget
   That ever they loved in their lives they say
   Only remember the fever and fret
   And the pain of Love that was all his pay
   All the delight of him passes away
   From hearts that hoped and from lips that met
   Too late did I love you my love and yet
   I shall never forget till my dying day

   Too late were we ware of the secret net
   That meshes the feet in the flowers that stray
   There were we taken and snared Lisette
   In the dungeon of La Fausse Amisti
   Help was there none in the wide worlds fray
   Joy was there none in the gift and the debt
   Too late we knew it too long regret
   I shall never forget till my dying day

   We must live our lives though the sun be set
   Must meet in the masque where parts we play
   Must cross in the maze of Lifes minuet
   Our yea is yea and our nay is nay
   But while snows of winter or flowers of May
   Are the sad years shroud or coronet
   In the season of rose or of violet
   I shall never forget till my dying day

                                  ENVOY

   Queen when the clay is my coverlet
   When I am dead and when you are grey
   Vow where the grass of the grave is wet
   I shall never forget till my dying day



BALLADE OF HIS CHOICE OF A SEPULCHRE


   Here Id come when weariest
      Here the breast
   Of the Windburgs tufted over
   Deep with bracken here his crest
      Takes the west
   Where the widewinged hawk doth hover

   Silent here are lark and plover
      In the cover
   Deep below the cushat best
   Loves his mate and croons above her
      Oer their nest
   Where the widewinged hawk doth hover

   Bring me here Lifes tiredout guest
      To the blest
   Bed that waits the weary rover
   Here should failure be confessed
      Ends my quest
   Where the widewinged hawk doth hover

                                  ENVOY

   Friend or stranger kind or lover
   Ah fulfil a last behest
      Let me rest
   Where the widewinged hawk doth hover



DIZAIN


   As to the pipe with rhythmic feet
   In windings of some oldworld dance
   The smiling couples cross and meet
   Join hands and then in line advance
   So to these fair old tunes of France
   Through all their maze of toandfro
   The lightheeled numbers laughing go
   Retreat return and ere they flee
   One moment pause in panting row
   And seem to sayVos plaudite

A PORTRAIT OF 


   Your hair and chin are like the hair
   And chin BurneJoness ladies wear
   You were unfashionably fair
      In 
   And sad you were when girls are gay
   You read a book about Le vrai
   Mrite de lhomme alone in May
   What can it be
   Le vrai mrite de lhomme  Not gold
   Not titles that are bought and sold
   Not wit that flashes and is cold
      But Virtue merely
   Instructed by JeanJacques Rousseau
   And JeanJacques surely ought to know
   You bade the crowd of foplings go
      You glanced severely
   Dreaming beneath the spreading shade
   Of that vast hat the Graces made 
   So Rouget sangwhile yet he played
      With courtly rhyme
   And hymned great Doisis red perruque
   And Nices eyes and Zulms look
   And dead canaries ere he shook
      The sultry time
   With strains like thunder  Loud and low
   Methinks I hear the murmur grow
   The tramp of men that come and go
      With fire and sword
   They war against the quick and dead
   Their flying feet are dashed with red
   As theirs the vintaging that tread
      Before the Lord
   O head unfashionably fair
   What end was thine for all thy care
   We only see thee dreaming there
      We cannot see
   The breaking of thy vision when
   The Rights of Man were lords of men
   When virtue won her own again
      In 



THE MOONS MINION


                    FROM THE PROSE OF C BAUDELAIRE

   Thine eyes are like the sea my dear
      The wandring waters green and grey
   Thine eyes are wonderful and clear
      And deep and deadly even as they
   The spirit of the changeful sea
      Informs thine eyes at night and noon
   She sways the tides and the heart of thee
      The mystic sad capricious Moon

   The Moon came down the shining stair
      Of clouds that fleck the summer sky
   She kissed thee saying Child be fair
      And madden mens hearts even as I
   Thou shalt love all things strange and sweet
      That know me and are known of me
   The lover thou shalt never meet
      The land where thou shalt never be

   She held thee in her chill embrace
      She kissed thee with cold lips divine
   She left her pallor on thy face
      That mystic ivory face of thine
   And now I sit beside thy feet
      And all my heart is far from thee
   Dreaming of her I shall not meet
      And of the land I shall not see



IN ITHACA


    And now am I greatly repenting that ever I left my life with thee
    and the immortality thou didst promise meLetter of Odysseus to
    Calypso  Luciani Vera Historia

   Tis thought Odysseus when the strife was oer
      With all the waves and wars a weary while
      Grew restless in his disenchanted isle
   And still would watch the sunset from the shore
   Go down the ways of gold and evermore
      His sad heart followed after mile on mile
      Back to the Goddess of the magic wile
   Calypso and the love that was of yore

   Thou too thy haven gained must turn thee yet
      To look across the sad and stormy space
      Years of a youth as bitter as the sea
   Ah with a heavy heart and eyelids wet
      Because within a fair forsaken place
      The life that might have been is lost to thee



HOMER


   Homer thy song men liken to the sea
      With all the notes of music in its tone
      With tides that wash the dim dominion
   Of Hades and light waves that laugh in glee
   Around the isles enchanted nay to me
      Thy verse seems as the River of source unknown
      That glasses Egypts temples overthrown
   In his skynurtured stream eternally

   No wiser we than men of heretofore
      To find thy sacred fountains guarded fast
   Enough thy flood makes green our human shore
      As Nilus Egypt rolling down his vast
   His fertile flood that murmurs evermore
      Of gods dethroned and empires in the past



THE BURIAL OF MOLIRE


                           AFTER J TRUFFIER

   Deadhe is dead  The rouge has left a trace
      On that thin cheek where shone perchance a tear
      Even while the people laughed that held him dear
   But yesterday  He diedand not in grace
   And many a blackrobed caitiff starts apace
      To slander him whose Tartuffe made them fear
      And gold must win a passage for his bier
   And bribe the crowd that guards his restingplace

   Ah Molire for that last time of all
      Mans hatred broke upon thee and went by
   And did but make more fair thy funeral
      Though in the dark they hid thee stealthily
   Thy coffin had the cope of night for pall
      For torch the stars along the windy sky



BION


   The wail of Moschus on the mountains crying
      The Muses heard and loved it long ago
   They heard the hollows of the hills replying
      They heard the weeping waters overflow
   They winged the sacred strainthe song undying
      The song that all about the world must go
   When poets for a poet dead are sighing
      The minstrels for a minstrel friend laid low

   And dirge to dirge that answers and the weeping
      For Adonais by the summer sea
   The plaints for Lycidas and Thyrsis sleeping
      Far from the forest ground called Thessaly
   These hold thy memory Bion in their keeping
      And are but echoes of the moan for thee



SPRING


                            AFTER MELEAGER

   Now the bright crocus flames and now
      The slim narcissus takes the rain
   And straying oer the mountains brow
      The daffodilies bud again
      The thousand blossoms wax and wane
   On wold and heath and fragrant bough
   But fairer than the flowers art thou
      Than any growth of hill or plain

   Ye gardens cast your leafy crown
   That my Loves feet may tread it down
      Like lilies on the lilies set
   My Love whose lips are softer far
   Than drowsy poppy petals are
      And sweeter than the violet



BEFORE THE SNOW


                         AFTER ALBERT GLATIGNY

   The winter is upon us not the snow
      The hills are etched on the horizon bare
      The skies are iron grey a bitter air
   The meagre cloudlets shudder to and fro
   One yellow leaf the listless wind doth blow
      Like some strange butterfly unclassed and rare
      Your footsteps ring in frozen alleys where
   The black trees seem to shiver as you go

   Beyond lie church and steeple with their old
      And rusty vanes that rattle as they veer
   A sharper gust would shake them from their hold
      Yet up that path in summer of the year
   And past that melancholy pile we strolled
      To pluck wild strawberries with merry cheer



VILLANELLE


                                TO LUCIA

   Apollo left the golden Muse
      And shepherded a mortals sheep
   Theocritus of Syracuse

   To mock the giant swain that woos
      The seanymph in the sunny deep
   Apollo left the golden Muse

   Afield he drove his lambs and ewes
      Where Milon and where Battus reap
   Theocritus of Syracuse

   To watch thy tunnyfishers cruise
      Below the dim Sicilian steep
   Apollo left the golden Muse

   Ye twain did loiter in the dews
      Ye slept the swains unfeverd sleep
   Theocritus of Syracuse

   That Time might half with his confuse
      Thy songslike his that laugh and leap
   Theocritus of Syracuse
      Apollo left the golden Muse

   Once CAGN was like a father kind and good
      But He was spoiled by fighting many things
   He wars upon the lions in the wood
      And breaks the Thunderbirds tremendous wings
   But still we cry to HimWe are thy brood
      O Cagn be merciful and us He brings
   To herds of elands and great store of food
      And in the desert opens watersprings

   So Qing King Nqshas Bushman hunter spoke
      Beside the campfire by the fountain fair
   When all were weary and soft clouds of smoke
      Were fading fragrant in the twilit air
   And suddenly in each mans heart there woke
      A pang a sacred memory of prayer



THE ODYSSEY


   As one that for a weary space has lain
      Lulled by the song of Circe and her wine
      In gardens near the pale of Proserpine
   Where that an isle forgets the main
   And only the low lutes of love complain
      And only shadows of wan lovers pine
      As such an one were glad to know the brine
   Salt on his lips and the large air again
   So gladly from the songs of modern speech
      Men turn and see the stars and feel the free
         Shrill wind beyond the close of heavy flowers
         And through the music of the languid hours
   They hear like ocean on a western beach
      The surge and thunder of the Odyssey



IDEAL


Suggested by a female head in wax of unknown date but supposed to
be either of the best Greek age or a work of Raphael or Leonardo
It is now in the Lille Museum

   Ah mystic child of Beauty nameless maid
      Dateless and fatherless how long ago
   A Greek with some rare sadness overweighed
      Shaped thee perchance and quite forgot his woe
      Or Raphael thy sweetness did bestow
   While magical his fingers oer thee strayed
      Or that great pupil taught of Verrocchio
   Redeemed thy still perfection from the shade

   That hides all fair things lost and things unborn
      Where one has fled from me that wore thy grace
      And that grave tenderness of thine awhile
   Nay still in dreams I see her but her face
      Is pale is wasted with a touch of scorn
      And only on thy lips I find her smile



THE FAIRYS GIFT


                      Take short viewsSYDNEY SMITH

   The Fays that to my christning came
      For come they did my nurses taught me
   They did not bring me wealth or fame
      Tis very little that they brought me
   But one the crossest of the crew
      The ugly old one uninvited
   Said I shall be avenged on you
      My child you shall grow up shortsighted
   With magic juices did she lave
      Mine eyes and wrought her wicked pleasure
   Well of all gifts the Fairies gave
      Hers is the present that I treasure

   The bore whom others fear and flee
      I do not fear I do not flee him
   I pass him calm as calm can be
      I do not cutI do not see him
   And with my feeble eyes and dim
      Where you see patchy fields and fences
   For me the mists of Turner swim
      My azure distance soon commences
   Nay as I blink about the streets
      Of this befogged and miry city
   Why almost every girl one meets
      Seems preternaturally pretty
   Try spectacles ones friends intone
      Youll see the world correctly through them
   But I have visions of my own
      And not for worlds would I undo them



BENEDETTA RAMUS


                              AFTER ROMNEY

   Mysterious Benedetta who
   That Reynolds or that Romney drew
   Was ever half so fair as you
      Or is so well forgot
   These eyes of melancholy brown
   These woven locks a shadowy crown
   Must surely have bewitched the town
      Yet youre remembered not

   Through all that prattle of your age
   Through lore of fribble and of sage
   Ive read and chiefly Walpoles page
      Wherein are beauties famous
   Ive haunted ball and rout and sale
   Ive heard of Devonshire and Thrale
   And all the Gunnings wondrous tale
      But nothing of Miss Ramus

   And yet on many a lattice pane
   Fair Benedetta scrawled in vain
   By lovers diamonds must remain
      To tell us you were cruel 
   But who of all that sighed and swore
   Wits poets courtiers by the score
   Did win and on his bosom wore
      This hard and lovely jewel

   Why dilettante records say
   An Alderman who came that way
   Wood you and made you Lady Day
      You crowned his civic flame
   It suits a melancholy song
   To think your heart had suffered wrong
   And that you lived not very long
      To be a City dame

   Perchance you were a Mourning Bride
   And conscious of a heart that died
   With one who fell by Rodneys side
      In bloodstained Spanish bays
   Perchance twas no such thing and you
   Dwelt happy with your knight and true
   And like Aurora watched a crew
      Of rosy little Days

   Oh lovely face and innocent
   Whatever way your fortunes went
   And if to earth your life was lent
      For little space or long
   In your kind eyes we seem to see
   What Woman at her best may be
   And offer to your memory
      An unavailing song



PARTANT POUR LA SCRIBIE


Scribie on the northeast littoral of Bohemia is the land of stage
conventions  It is named after the discoverer M Scribe

   A pleasant land is Scribie where
      The light comes mostly from below
   And seems a sort of symbol rare
      Of things at large and how they go
   In rooms where doors are everywhere
      And cupboards shelter friend or foe

   This is a realm where people tell
      Each other when they chance to meet
   Of things that long ago befell
      And do most solemnly repeat
   Secrets they both know very well
      Aloud and in the public street

   A land where lovers go in fours
      Master and mistress man and maid
   Where people listen at the doors
      Or neath a tables friendly shade
   And comic Irishmen in scores
      Roam oer the scenes all undismayed

   A land where Virtue in distress
      Owes much to uncles in disguise
   Where British sailors frankly bless
      Their limbs their timbers and their eyes
   And where the villain doth confess
      Conveniently before he dies

   A land of lovers false and gay
      A land where people dread a curse
   A land of letters gone astray
      Or intercepted which is worse
   Where weddings false fond maids betray
      And all the babes are changed at nurse

   Oh happy land where things come right
      We of the world where things go ill
   Where lovers love but dont unite
      Where no one finds the Missing Will
   Dominion of the hearts delight
      Scribie weve loved and love thee still



ST ANDREWS BAY


                                  NIGHT

   Ah listen through the music from the shore
   The melancholy longwithdrawing roar
   Beneath the Minster and the windy caves
   The wide North Ocean marshalling his waves
   Even so forlornin worlds beyond our ken
   May sigh the seas that are not heard of men
   Even so forlorn prophetic of mans fate
   Sounded the cold seawave disconsolate
   When none but God might hear the boding tone
   As God shall hear the long lament alone
   When all is done when all the tale is told
   And the gray seawave echoes as of old

                                 MORNING

   This was the burden of the Night
      The saying of the sea
   But lo the hours have brought the light
   The laughter of the waves the flight
   Of dipping seabirds foamy white
      That are so glad to be
   Forget the happy creatures cry
      Forget Nights monotone
   With us be glad in sea and sky
   The days are thine the days that fly
   The days God gives to know him by
      And not the Night alone



WOMAN AND THE WEED


                     FOUNDED ON A NEW ZEALAND MYTH

   In the Morning of Time when his fortunes began
   How bleak how unGreek was the Nature of Man
   From his wigwam if ever he ventured to roam
   There was nobody waiting to welcome him home
   For the Man had been made but the woman had not
   And Earth was a highly detestable spot
   Man hated his neighbours they met and they scowled
   They did not converse but they struggled and howled
   For Man had no tacthe would neer take a hint
   And his notions he backed with a hatchet of flint

   So Man was alone and he wished he could see
   On the Earth some one like him but fairer than he
   With locks like the red gold a smile like the sun
   To welcome him back when his hunting was done
   And he sighed for a voice that should answer him still
   Like the affable Echo he heard on the hill
   That should answer him softly and always agree
   And oh Man reflected how nice it would be

   So he prayed to the Gods and they stooped to his prayer
   And they spoke to the Sun on his way through the air
   And he married the Echo one fortunate morn
   And Woman their beautiful daughter was born
   The daughter of Sunshine and Echo she came
   With a voice like a song with a face like a flame
   With a face like a flame and a voice like a song
   And happy was Man but it was not for long

   For weathers a painfully changeable thing
   Not always the child of the Echo would sing
   And the face of the Sun may be hidden with mist
   And his child can be terribly cross if she list
   And unfortunate Man had to learn with surprise
   That a frowns not peculiar to masculine eyes
   That the sweetest of voices can scold and can sneer
   And cannot be answeredlike menwith a spear

   So Man went and called to the Gods in his woe
   And they answered himSir you would needs have it so
   And the thing must go on as the thing has begun
   Shes immortalyour child of the Echo and Sun
   But well send you another and fairer is she
   This maiden with locks that are flowing and free
   This maiden so gentle so kind and so fair
   With a flower like a star in the night of her hair
   With her eyes like the smoke that is misty and blue
   With her heart that is heavenly and tender and true
   She will die in the night but no need you should mourn
   You shall bury her body and thence shall be born
   A weed that is green that is fragrant and fair
   With a flower like the star in the night of her hair
   And the leaves must ye burn till they offer to you
   Soft smoke like her eyes that are misty and blue

   And the smoke shall ye breathe and no more shall ye fret
   But the child of the Echo and Sun shall forget
   Shall forget all the trouble and torment she brings
   Shall bethink ye of none but delectable things
   And the sound of the wars with your brethren shall cease
   While ye smoke by the campfire the great pipe of peace
   So the last state of Man was by no means the worst
   The second gift softened the sting of the first

   Nor the child of the Echo and Sun doth he heed
   When he dreams with the Maid that was changed to the weed
   Though the Echo be silent the Sun in a mist
   The Maid is the fairest that ever was kissed
   And when tempests are over and ended the rain
   And the child of the Sunshine is sunny again
   He comes back glad at heart and again is at one
   With the changeable child of the Echo and Sun

   THE painted Briton built his mound
   And left his celts and clay
   On yon fair slope of sunlit ground
   That fronts your garden gay
   The Roman came he bore the sway
   He bullied bought and sold
   Your fountain sweeps his works away
   Beside your manor old

   But still his crumbling urns are found
   Within the windowbay
   Where once he listened to the sound
   That lulls you day by day
   The sound of summer winds at play
   The noise of waters cold
   To Yarty wandering on their way
   Beside your manor old

   The Roman fell his firmset bound
   Became the Saxons stay
   The bells made music all around
   For monks in cloisters grey
   Till fled the monks in disarray
   From their warm chantrys fold
   Old Abbots slumber as they may
   Beside your manor old

   Creeds empires peoples all decay
   Down into darkness rolled

THE FORTUNATE ISLANDS


THE FORTUNATE ISLANDS


                             A DREAM IN JUNE

   IN twilight of the longest day
      I lingered over Lucian
   Till ere the dawn a dreamy way
      My spirit found untrod of man
   Between the green sky and the grey

   Amid the soft dusk suddenly
      More light than air I seemed to sail
   Afloat upon the ocean sky
      While through the faint blue clear and pale
   I saw the mountain clouds go by
      My barque had thought for helm and sail
   And one mist wreath for canopy

   Like torches on a marble floor
      Reflected so the wild stars shone
   Within the abysmal hyaline
      Till the day widened more and more
   And sank to sunset and was gone
   And then as burning beacons shine
      On summits of a mountain isle
         A light to folk on sea that fare
      So the skys beacons for a while
         Burned in these islands of the air

   Then from a starry island set
      Where one swift tide of wind there flows
   Came scent of lily and violet
      Narcissus hyacinth and rose
   Laurel and myrtle buds and vine
   So delicate is the air and fine
   And forests of all fragrant trees
      Sloped seaward from the central hill
   And ever clamorous were these
   With singing of glad birds and still
      Such music came as in the woods
   Most lonely consecrate to Pan
      The Wind makes in his many moods
   Upon the pipes some shepherd Man
      Hangs up in thanks for victory
   On these shall mortals play no more
      But the Wind doth touch them over and oer
   And the Winds breath in the reeds will sigh

   Between the daylight and the dark
      That island lies in silver air
   And suddenly my magic barque
      Wheeled and ran in and grounded there
   And by me stood the sentinel
      Of them who in the island dwell
         All smiling did he bind my hands
         With rushes green and rosy bands
   They have no harsher bonds than these
      The people of the pleasant lands
   Within the wash of the airy seas

   Then was I to their city led
      Now all of ivory and gold
   The great walls were that garlanded
   The temples in their shining fold
      Each fane of beryl built and each
      Girt with its grove of shadowy beech
   And all about the town and through
   There flowed a River fed with dew
      As sweet as roses and as clear
         As mountain crystals pure and cold
   And with his waves that water kissed
   The gleaming altars of amethyst
      That smoke with victims all the year
   And sacred are to the Gods of old

   There sat three Judges by the Gate
      And I was led before the Three
   And they but looked on me and straight
      The rosy bonds fell down from me
      Who being innocent was free
   And I might wander at my will
   About that City on the hill
      Among the happy people clad
         In purple weeds of woven air
   Hued like the webs that Twilight weaves
   At shut of languid summer eves
      So light their raiment seemed and glad
   Was every face I looked on there

   There was no heavy heat no cold
      The dwellers there wax never old
         Nor wither with the waning time
   But each man keeps that age he had
         When first he won the fairy clime
   The Night falls never from on high
      Nor ever burns the heat of noon
   But such soft light eternally
      Shines as in silver dawns of June
   Before the Sun hath climbed the sky

   Within these pleasant streets and wide
      The souls of Heroes go and come
   Even they that fell on either side
      Beneath the walls of Ilium
   And sunlike in that shadowy isle
   The face of Helen and her smile
      Makes glad the souls of them that knew
   Grief for her sake a little while
   And all true Greeks and wise are there
   And with his hand upon the hair
      Of Phaedo saw I Socrates
   About him many youths and fair
      Hylas Narcissus and with these
   Him whom the quoit of Phoebus slew
      By fleet Eurotas unaware

   All these their mirth and pleasure made
      Within the plain Elysian
         The fairest meadow that may be
   With all green fragrant trees for shade
      And every scented wind to fan
         And sweetest flowers to strew the lea
   The soft Winds are their servants fleet
      To fetch them every fruit at will
      And water from the river chill
   And every bird that singeth sweet
      Throstle and merle and nightingale
      Brings blossoms from the dewy vale
   Lily and rose and asphodel
      With these doth each guest twine his crown
      And wreathe his cup and lay him down
         Beside some friend he loveth well

   There with the shining Souls I lay
   When lo a Voice that seemed to say
      In faroff haunts of Memory
   Whoso doth taste the Dead Mens bread
   Shall dwell for ever with these Dead
   Nor ever shall his body lie
   Beside his friends on the grey hill
   Where rains weep and the curlews shrill
   And the brown water wanders by

   Then did a new soul in me wake
   The dead mens bread I feared to break
   Their fruit I would not taste indeed
   Were it but a pomegranate seed
   Nay not with these I made my choice
   To dwell for ever and rejoice
   For otherwhere the River rolls
   That girds the home of Christian souls
   And these my whole heart seeks are found
   On otherwise enchanted ground

   Even so I put the cup away
      The vision wavered dimmed and broke
      And nowise sorrowing I woke
   While grey among the ruins grey
   Chill through the dwellings of the dead
      The Dawn crept oer the Northern sea
   Then in a moment flushed to red
      Flushed all the broken minster old
      And turned the shattered stones to gold
   And wakened half the world with me

                                 LENVOI

                               To E W G

Who also had rhymed on the Fortunate Islands of Lucian

   Each in the selfsame field we glean
   The field of the Samosatene
   Each something takes and something leaves
      And this must choose and that forego
   In Lucians visionary sheaves
      To twine a modern posy so
   But all my gleanings truth to tell
   Are mixed with mournful asphodel
   While yours are wreathed with poppies red
      With flowers that Helens feet have kissed
   With leaves of vine that garlanded
      The Syrian Pantagruelist
   The sage who laughed the world away
      Who mocked at Gods and men and care
   More sweet of voice than Rabelais
      And lighterhearted than Voltaire

                   ST ANDREWS   OXFORD 

   ST Andrews by the Northern sea
      A haunted town it is to me
   A little city worn and grey
      The grey North Ocean girds it round
   And oer the rocks and up the bay
      The long searollers surge and sound
   And still the thin and biting spray
      Drives down the melancholy street
   And still endure and still decay
      Towers that the salt winds vainly beat
   Ghostlike and shadowy they stand
   Dim mirrored in the wet seasand

   St Leonards chapel long ago
      We loitered idly where the tall
   Fresh budded mountain ashes blow
      Within thy desecrated wall
   The tough roots rent the tomb below
      The April birds sang clamorous
   We did not dream we could not know
      How hardly Fate would deal with us

   O broken minster looking forth
      Beyond the bay above the town
   O winter of the kindly North
      O college of the scarlet gown
   And shining sands beside the sea
      And stretch of links beyond the sand
   Once more I watch you and to me
      It is as if I touched his hand

   And therefore art thou yet more dear
      O little city grey and sere
   Though shrunken from thine ancient pride
      And lonely by thy lonely sea
   Than these fair halls on Isis side
      Where Youth an hour came back to me

   A land of waters green and clear
      Of willows and of poplars tall
   And in the spring time of the year
      The white may breaking over all
   And Pleasure quick to come at call
      And summer rides by marsh and wold
   And Autumn with her crimson pall
      About the towers of Magdalen rolled
   And strange enchantments from the past
      And memories of the friends of old
   And strong Tradition binding fast
      The flying terms with bands of gold

   All these hath Oxford all are dear
      But dearer far the little town
   The drifting surf the wintry year
      The college of the scarlet gown
         St Andrews by the Northern sea
         That is a haunted town to me



DESIDERIUM


                           IN MEMORIAM S F A

   THE call of homing rooks the shrill
      Song of some bird that watches late
   The cries of children break the still
      Sad twilight by the churchyard gate

   And oer your faroff tomb the grey
      Sad twilight broods and from the trees
   The rooks call on their homeward way
      And are you heedless quite of these

   The clustered rowan berries red
      And Autumns may the clematis
   They droop above your dreaming head
      And these and all things must you miss

   Ah you that loved the twilight air
      The dim lit hour of quiet best
   At last at last you have your share
      Of what life gave so seldom rest

   Yes rest beyond all dreaming deep
      Or labour nearer the Divine
   And pure from fret and smooth as sleep
      And gentle as thy soul is thine

   So let it be  But could I know
      That thou in this soft autumn eve
   This hush of earth that pleased thee so
      Hadst pleasure still I might not grieve

BALLADE OF MIDDLE AGE


   OUR youth began with tears and sighs
   With seeking what we could not find
   Our verses all were threnodies
   In elegiacs still we whined
   Our ears were deaf our eyes were blind
   We sought and knew not what we sought
   We marvel now we look behind
   Lifes more amusing than we thought

   Oh foolish youth untimely wise
   Oh phantoms of the sickly mind
   What not content with seas and skies
   With rainy clouds and southern wind
   With common cares and faces kind
   With pains and joys each morning brought
   Ah old and worn and tired we find
   Lifes more amusing than we thought

   Though youth turns spectrethin and dies
   To mourn for youth were not inclined
   We set our souls on salmon flies
   We whistle where we once repined
   Confound the woes of humankind
   By Heaven were well deceived I wot
   Who hum contented or resigned
   Lifes more amusing than we thought

                                  ENVOY

   O nate mecum worn and lined
   Our faces show but that is naught
   Our hearts are young neath wrinkled rind

THE LAST CAST


                          THE ANGLERS APOLOGY

   JUST one cast more how many a year
      Beside how many a pool and stream
   Beneath the falling leaves and sere
      Ive sighed reeled up and dreamed my dream

   Dreamed of the sport since April first
      Her hands fulfilled of flowers and snow
   Adown the pastoral valleys burst
      Where Ettrick and where Teviot flow

   Dreamed of the singing showers that break
      And sting the lochs or near or far
   And rouse the trout and stir the take
      From Urigil to Lochinvar

   Dreamed of the kind propitious sky
      Oer Ari Innes brooding grey
   The sea trout rushing at the fly
      Breaks the black wave with sudden spray

                                    

   Brief are mans days at best perchance
      I waste my own who have not seen
   The castled palaces of France
      Shine on the Loire in summer green

   And clear and fleet Eurotas still
      You tell me laves his reedy shore
   And flows beneath his fabled hill
      Where Dian drave the chase of yore

   And like a horse unbroken yet
      The yellow stream with rush and foam
   Neath tower and bridge and parapet
      Girdles his ancient mistress Rome

   I may not see them but I doubt
      If seen Id find them half so fair
   As ripples of the rising trout
      That feed beneath the elms of Yair

   Nay Spring Id meet by Tweed or Ail
      And Summer by Loch Assynts deep
   And Autumn in that lonely vale
      Where wedded Avons westward sweep

   Or where amid the empty fields
      Among the bracken of the glen
   Her yellow wreath October yields
      To crown the crystal brows of Ken

   Unseen Eurotas southward steal
      Unknown Alpheus westward glide
   You never heard the ringing reel
      The music of the water side

   Though Gods have walked your woods among
      Though nymphs have fled your banks along
   You speak not that familiar tongue
      Tweed murmurs like my cradle song

   My cradle songnor other hymn
      Id choose nor gentler requiem dear
   Than Tweeds that through deaths twilight dim
      Mourned in the latest Minstrels ear

      Through the grey
      The winds way
   The seas moan
   Sound alone
      For the day
      These repay
   And atone

   Scarce I know
   Listening so
      To the streams
         Of the sea
      If old dreams

   When midnight dances are murdering sleep
   Then comes in the sweet o the year
   And far from Fleet Street far from here
   The Summer is Queen in the length of the land
   And moonlit nights they are soft and clear
   When fans for a penny are sold in the Strand

   When clamour that doves in the lindens keep
   Mingles with musical plash of the weir
   Where drowned green tresses of crowsfoot creep
   Then comes in the sweet o the year
   And better a crust and a beaker of beer
   With rosehung hedges on either hand
   Than a palace in town and a princes cheer
   When fans for a penny are sold in the Strand

   When big trout late in the twilight leap
   When cuckoo clamoureth far and near
   When glittering scythes in the hayfield reap
   Then comes in the sweet o the year
   And its oh to sail with the wind to steer
   Where kine knee deep in the water stand
   On a Highland loch on a Lowland mere
   When fans for a penny are sold in the Strand

BALLADE OF CHRISTMAS GHOSTS


   BETWEEN the moonlight and the fire
   In winter twilights long ago
   What ghosts we raised for your desire
   To make your merry blood run slow
   How old how grave how wise we grow
   No Christmas ghost can make us chill
   Save those that troop in mournful row
   The ghosts we all can raise at will

   The beasts can talk in barn and byre
   On Christmas Eve old legends know
   As year by year the years retire
   We men fall silent then I trow
   Such sights hath Memory to show
   Such voices from the silence thrill
   Such shapes return with Christmas snow
   The ghosts we all can raise at will

   Oh children of the village choir
   Your carols on the midnight throw
   Oh bright across the mist and mire
   Ye ruddy hearths of Christmas glow
   Beat back the dread beat down the woe
   Lets cheerily descend the hill
   Be welcome all to come or go
   The ghosts we all can raise at will

   In her accents perhaps she is weak
      Ladies are one observes with a sigh
   But in Algebrathere shes unique
      But her fortes to evaluate 

   She can talk about putting a spirt on
      I admit an unmaidenly freak
   And she dearly delighteth to flirt on
      A punt in some shadowy creek
   Should her bark by mischance spring a leak
      She can swim as a swallow can fly
   She can fence she can put with a cleek
      But her fortes to evaluate 

   She has lectured on Scopas and Myrton
      Coins vases mosaics the antique
   Old tiles with the secular dirt on
      Old marbles with noses to seek
   And her Cobet she quotes by the week
      And shes written on  and on 
   And her service is swift and oblique

RONSARDS GRAVE


   YE wells ye founts that fall
      From the steep mountain wall
   That fall and flash and fleet
            With silver feet

   Ye woods ye streams that lave
   The meadows with your wave
      Ye hills and valley fair
            Attend my prayer

   When Heaven and Fate decree
   My latest hour for me
      When I must pass away
            From pleasant day

   I ask that none may break
   The marble for my sake
      Wishful to make more fair
            My sepulchre

   Only a laurel tree
   Shall shade the grave of me
      Only Apollos bough
            Shall guard me now

   Now shall I be at rest
   Among the spirits blest
      The happy dead that dwell
            Wherewho may tell

   The snow and wind and hail
   May never there prevail
      Nor ever thunder fall
            Nor storm at all

   But always fadeless there
   The woods are green and fair
      And faithful ever more
            Spring to that shore

   There shall I ever hear
   Alcaeus music clear
      And sweetest of all things
            There SAPPHO sings


SAN TERENZO


     The village in the bay of Spezia near which Shelley was living
                   before the wreck of the Don Juan

   MID April seemed like some November day
      When through the glassy waters dull as lead
   Our boat like shadowy barques that bear the dead
      Slipped down the long shores of the Spezian bay
      Rounded a pointand San Terenzo lay
   Before us that gay village yellow and red
   The roof that covered Shelleys homeless head
      His house a place deserted bleak and grey

   The waves broke on the doorstep fishermen
      Cast their long nets and drew and cast again
      Deep in the ilex woods we wandered free
   When suddenly the forest glades were stirred
      With waving pinions and a great sea bird
   Flew forth like Shelleys spirit to the sea

                                                                     


ROMANCE


   MY Love dwelt in a Northern land
      A grey tower in a forest green
   Was hers and far on either hand
      The long wash of the waves was seen
   And leagues on leagues of yellow sand
      The woven forest boughs between

   And through the silver Northern night
      The sunset slowly died away
   And herds of strange deer lilywhite
      Stole forth among the branches grey
   About the coming of the light
      They fled like ghosts before the day

   I know not if the forest green
      Still girdles round that castle grey
   I know not if the boughs between
      The white deer vanish ere the day
   Above my Love the grass is green
      My heart is colder than the clay


BALLADE OF HIS OWN COUNTRY


   I scribbled on a flybooks leaves
      Among the shining salmonflies
   A song for summertime that grieves
      I scribbled on a flybooks leaves
      Between grey sea and golden sheaves
   Beneath the soft wet Morvern skies
   I scribbled on a flybooks leaves
      Among the shining salmonflies

                            TO C H ARKCOLL

   LET them boast of Arabia oppressed
      By the odour of myrrh on the breeze
   In the isles of the East and the West
      That are sweet with the cinnamon trees
   Let the sandalwood perfume the seas
      Give the roses to Rhodes and to Crete
   We are more than content if you please
      With the smell of bogmyrtle and peat

   Though Dan Virgil enjoyed himself best
      With the scent of the limes when the bees
   Hummed low round the doves in their nest
      While the vintagers lay at their ease
   Had he sung in our northern degrees
      Hed have sought a securer retreat
   Hed have dwelt where the heart of us flees
      With the smell of bogmyrtle and peat

   Oh the broom has a chivalrous crest
      And the daffodils fair on the leas
   And the soul of the Southron might rest
      And be perfectly happy with these
   But we that were nursed on the knees
      Of the hills of the North we would fleet
   Where our hearts might their longing appease
      With the smell of bogmyrtle and peat

                                  ENVOY

   Ah Constance the land of our quest
      It is far from the sounds of the street
   Where the Kingdom of Galloways blest
      With the smell of bogmyrtle and peat


VILLANELLE


          TO M JOSEPH BOULMIER AUTHOR OF LES VILLANELLES

   VILLANELLE why art thou mute
      Hath the singer ceased to sing
   Hath the Master lost his lute

   Many a pipe and scrannel flute
      On the breeze their discords fling
   Villanelle why art thou mute

   Sound of tumult and dispute
   Noise of war the echoes bring
   Hath the Master lost his lute

   Once he sang of bud and shoot
      In the season of the Spring
   Villanelle why art thou mute

   Fading leaf and falling fruit
      Say The year is on the wing
   Hath the Master lost his lute

   Ere the axe lie at the root
      Ere the winter come as king
   Villanelle why art thou mute
   Hath the Master lost his lute

   ALAS for us no second spring
      Like mallows in the gardenbed
   For these the grave has lost his sting
      Alas for us no second spring
      Who sleep without awakening
   And dead for ever more are dead
      Alas for us no second spring
         Like mallows in the gardenbed

   Alas the strong the wise the brave
      That boast themselves the sons of men
   Once they go down into the grave
      Alas the strong the wise the brave
      They perish and have none to save
      They are sown and are not raised again
   Alas the strong the wise the brave
      That boast themselves the sons of men


BALLADE OF CRICKET


                              TO T W LANG

   THE burden of hard hitting slog away
   Here shalt thou make a five and there a four
   And then upon thy bat shalt lean and say
   That thou art in for an uncommon score
   Yea the loud ring applauding thee shall roar
   And thou to rival THORNTON shalt aspire
   When lo the Umpire gives thee leg before
   This is the end of every mans desire

   The burden of much bowling when the stay
   Of all thy team is collared swift or slower
   When bailers break not in their wonted way
   And yorkers come not off as heretofore
   When length balls shoot no more ah never more
   When all deliveries lose their former fire
   When bats seem broader than the broad barndoor
   This is the end of every mans desire

   The burden of long fielding when the clay
   Clings to thy shoon in sudden showers downpour
   And running still thou stumblest or the ray
   Of blazing suns doth bite and burn thee sore
   And blind thee till forgetful of thy lore
   Thou dost most mournfully misjudge a skyer
   And lose a match the Fates cannot restore
   This is the end of every mans desire

                                  ENVOY

   Alas yet liefer on Youths hither shore
   Would I be some poor Player on scant hire
   Than King among the old who play no more
   This is the end of every mans desire


THE LAST MAYING


    It is told of the last Lovers which watched Maynight in the
    forest before men brought the tidings of the Gospel to this land
    that
    they beheld no Fairies nor Dwarfs nor no such Thing but the very
    Venus herself who bade them make such cheer as they might
    for said she I shall live no more in these Woods nor shall ye
    endure to see another May timeEDMUND GORLIOT Of Phantasies and
    Omens p   

   WHENCE do ye come with the dew on your hair
   From what far land are the boughs ye bear
      The blossoms and buds upon breasts and tresses
   The light burned white in your faces fair

   In a falling fane have we built our house
   With the dying Gods we have held carouse
      And our lips are wan from their wild caresses
   Our hands are filled with their holy boughs

   As we crossed the lawn in the dying day
   No fairy led us to meet the May
      But the very Goddess loved by lovers
   In mourning raiment of green and grey

   She was not decked as for glee and game
   She was not veiled with the veil of flame
      The saffron veil of the Bride that covers
   The face that is flushed with her joy and shame

   On the laden branches the scent and dew
   Mingled and met and as snow to strew
      The woodland rides and the fragrant grasses
   White flowers fell as the night wind blew

   Tears and kisses on lips and eyes
   Mingled and met amid laughter and sighs
      For grief that abides and joy that passes
   For pain that tarries and mirth that flies

   It chanced as the dawning grew to grey
   Pale and sad on our homeward way
      With weary lips and palled with pleasure
   The Goddess met us farewell to say

   Ye have made your choice and the better part
   Ye chose she said and the wiser art
      In the wild May night drank all the measure
   The perfect pleasure of heart and heart

   Ye shall walk no more with the May she said
   Shall your love endure though the Gods be dead
      Shall the flitting flocks mine own my chosen
   Sing as of old and be happy and wed

   Yea they are glad as of old but you
   Fair and fleet as the dawn or the dew
      Abide no more for the springs are frozen
   And fled the Gods that ye loved and knew

   Ye shall never know Summer again like this
   Ye shall play no more with the Fauns I wis
      No more in the nymphs and dryads playtime
   Shall echo and answer kiss and kiss

   Though the flowers in your golden hair be bright
   Your golden hair shall be waste and white
      On faded brows ere another May time
         Bring the spring but no more delight


HOMERIC UNITY


   THE sacred keep of Ilion is rent
      By shaft and pit foiled waters wander slow
   Through plains where Simois and Scamander went
      To war with Gods and heroes long ago
      Not yet to tired Cassandra lying low
   In rich Mycen do the Fates relent
      The bones of Agamemnon are a show
   And ruined is his royal monument

   The dust and awful treasures of the Dead
      Hath Learning scattered wide but vainly thee
   Homer she meteth with her tool of lead
      And strives to rend thy songs too blind to see
   The crown that burns on thine immortal head
      Of indivisible supremacy


IN TINTAGEL


                                   LUI

   AH lady lady leave the creeping mist
      And leave the iron castle by the sea

                                  ELLE

   Nay from the sea there came a ghost that kissed
      My lips and so I cannot come to thee

                                   LUI

   Ah lady leave the cruel landward wind
      That crusts the blighted flowers with bitter foam

                                  ELLE

   Nay for his arms are cold and strong to bind
      And I must dwell with him and make my home

                                   LUI

   Come for the Spring is fair in Joyous Guard
      And down deep alleys sweet birds sing again

                                  ELLE

   But I must tarry with the winter hard
      And with the bitter memory of pain
   Although the Spring be fair in Joyous Guard
      And in the gardens glad birds sing again


PISIDIC


The incident is from the Love Stories of Parthenius who preserved
fragments of a lost epic on the expedition of Achilles against Lesbos an
island allied with Troy

   THE daughter of the Lesbian king
      Within her bower she watched the war
   Far off she heard the arrows ring
      The smitten harness ring afar
   And fighting from the foremost car
      Saw one that smote where all must flee
   More fair than the Immortals are
      He seemed to fair Pisidic

   She saw she loved him and her heart
      Before Achilles Peleus son
   Threw all its guarded gates apart
      A maiden fortress lightly won
   And ere that day of fight was done
      No more of land or faith recked she
   But joyed in her new life begun
      Her life of love Pisidic

   She took a gift into her hand
      As one that had a boon to crave
   She stole across the ruined land
      Where lay the dead without a grave
   And to Achilles hand she gave
      Her gift the secret posterns key
   Tomorrow let me be thy slave
      Moaned to her love Pisidic

   Ere dawn the Argives clarion call
      Rang down Methymnas burning street
   They slew the sleeping warriors all
      They drove the women to the fleet
   Save one that to Achilles feet
      Clung but in sudden wrath cried he
   For her no doom but death is meet
      And there men stoned Pisidic

   In havens of that haunted coast
      Amid the myrtles of the shore
   The moon sees many a maiden ghost
      Loves outcast now and evermore
   The silence hears the shades deplore
      Their hour of dearbought love but thee
   The waves lull neath thine olives hoar
      To dreamless rest Pisidic


FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST


   RETURNING from what other seas
      Dost thou renew thy murmuring
   Weak Tide and hast thou aught of these
      To tell the shores where float and cling
   My love my hope my memories

   Say does my lady wake to note
      The gold light into silver die
   Or do thy waves make lullaby
      While dreams of hers like angels float
   Through starsown spaces of the sky

   Ah would such angels came to me
      That dreams of mine might speak with hers
   Nor wake the slumber of the sea
      With words as low as winds that be
   Awake among the gossamers


LOVE THE VAMPIRE


                              

      THE level sands and grey
      Stretch leagues and leagues away
   Down to the border line of sky and foam
      A spark of sunset burns
      The grey tidewater turns
   Back like a ghost from her forbidden home

      Here without pyre or bier
      Light Love was buried here
   Alas his grave was wide and deep enough
      Thrice with averted head
      We cast dust on the dead
   And left him to his rest  An end of Love

      No stone to roll away
      No seal of snow or clay
   Only soft dust above his wearied eyes
      But though the sudden sound
      Of Doom should shake the ground
   And graves give up their ghosts he will not rise

      So each to each we said
      Ah but to either bed
   Set far apart in lands of North and South
      Love as a Vampire came
      With haggard eyes aflame
   And kissed us with the kisses of his mouth

      Thenceforth in dreams must we
      Each others shadow see
   Wandring unsatisfied in empty lands
      Still the desird face
      Fleets from the vain embrace
   And still the shape evades the longing hands


BALLADE OF THE BOOKMANS PARADISE


   THERE is a Heaven or here or there
   A Heaven there is for me and you
   Where bargains meet for purses spare
   Like ours are not so far and few
   Thuanus bees go humming through
   The learned groves neath rainless skies
   Oer volumes old and volumes new
   Within that Bookmans Paradise

   There treasures bound for Longepierre
   Keep brilliant their morocco blue
   There Hookes Amanda is not rare
   Nor early tracts upon Peru
   Racine is common as Rotrou
   No Shakespeare Quarto search defies
   And Caxtons grow as blossoms grew
   Within that Bookmans Paradise

   Theres Evenot our first mother fair
   But Clovis Eve a binder true
   Thither does Bauzonnet repair
   Derome Le Gascon Padeloup
   But never come the cropping crew
   That dock a volumes honest size
   Nor they that letter backs askew
   Within that Bookmans Paradise

                                  ENVOY

   Friend do not Heber and De Thou
   And Scott and Southey kind and wise
   La chasse au bouquin still pursue

BALLADE OF NEGLECTED MERIT 


   I HAVE scribbled in verse and in prose
   I have painted arrangements in greens
   And my name is familiar to those
   Who take in the high class magazines
   I compose Ive invented machines
   I have written an Essay on Rhyme
   For my county I played in my teens
   ButI am not in Men of the Time

   I have lived as a chief with the Crows
   I have interviewed Princes and Queens
   I have climbed the Caucasian snows
   I abstain like the ancients from beans
   Ive a guess what Pythagoras means
   When he says that to eat thems a crime
   I have lectured upon the Essenes
   ButI am not in Men of the Time

   Ive a fancy as morbid as Poes
   I can tell what is meant by Shebeens
   I have breasted the river that flows
   Through the land of the wild Gadarenes
   I can gossip with Burton on skenes
   I can imitate Irving the Mime
   And my sketches are quainter than Keenes
   ButI am not in Men of the Time

                                  ENVOY

   Like the Pisan and mud is its lime

      And revel in a cultured style

      From Boston to the banks of Nile
   Rejoice in antiBritish bile
      And weep for fickle heros woe
   These twain have shortened many a mile
      Miss Braddon and Gaboriau

   Give me your villains deeply vile
      Give me Lecoq Jottrat and Co
   Great artists of the ruse and wile
      Miss Braddon and Gaboriau

   Oh novel readers tell me this
      Can prose thats polished by the file

      Wet days and weary ways beguile
   And man to living reconcile
      Like these whose every trick we know
   The agony how high they pile

                            Socrates speaks

   HITHER come hither ye Clouds renowned and unveil yourselves here
   Come though ye dwell on the sacred crests of Olympian snow
   Or whether ye dance with the Nereid choir in the gardens clear
   Or whether your golden urns are dipped in Niles overflow
   Or whether you dwell by Motis mere
   Or the snows of Mimas arise appear
   And hearken to us and accept our gifts ere ye rise and go

                            The Clouds sing

   Immortal Clouds from the echoing shore
   Of the father of streams from the sounding sea
   Dewy and fleet let us rise and soar
   Dewy and gleaming and fleet are we
   Let us look on the treeclad mountain crest
      On the sacred earth where the fruits rejoice
   On the waters that murmur east and west
      On the tumbling sea with his moaning voice
   For unwearied glitters the Eye of the Air
      And the bright rays gleam
   Then cast we our shadows of mist and fare
   In our deathless shapes to glance everywhere
      From the height of the heaven on the land and air
         And the Ocean stream

   Let us on ye Maidens that bring the Rain
      Let us gaze on Pallas citadel
         In the country of Cecrops fair and dear
         The mystic land of the holy cell
      Where the Rites unspoken securely dwell
         And the gifts of the Gods that know not stain
   And a people of mortals that know not fear
   For the temples tall and the statues fair
   And the feasts of the Gods are holiest there
   The feasts of Immortals the chaplets of flowers
      And the Bromian mirth at the coming of spring
   And the musical voices that fill the hours
      And the dancing feet of the Maids that sing


BALLADE OF LITERARY FAME

   OH where are the endless Romances
   Our grandmothers used to adore
   The Knights with their helms and their lances
   Their shields and the favours they wore
   And the Monks with their magical lore
   They have passed to Oblivion and Nox
   They have fled to the shadowy shore
   They are all in the Fourpenny Box

   And where the poetical fancies
   Our fathers rejoiced in of yore
   The lyrics melodious expanses
   The Epics in cantos a score
   They have been and are not no more
   Shall the shepherds drive silvery flocks
   Nor the ladies their languors deplore
   They are all in the Fourpenny Box

   And the Music  The songs and the dances
   The tunes that Time may not restore
   And the tomes where Divinity prances
   And the pamphlets where Heretics roar
   They have ceased to be even a bore
   The Divine and the Sceptic who mocks
   They are cropped they are foxed to the core
   They are all in the Fourpenny Box

                                  ENVOY

   Suns beat on them tempests downpour
   On the chest without cover or locks
   Where they lie by the Booksellers door
   They are all in the Fourpenny Box


 


   I WOULD my days had been in other times
   A moment in the long unnumbered years
   That knew the sway of Horus and of hawk
   In peaceful lands that border on the Nile

   I would my days had been in other times
   Lulled by the sacrifice and mumbled hymn
   Between the Five great Rivers or in shade
   And shelter of the cool Himlayan hills

   I would my days had been in other times
   That I in some old abbey of Touraine
   Had watched the rounding grapes and lived my life
   Ere ever Luther came or Rabelais

   I would my days had been in other times
   When quiet life to death not terrible
   Drifted as ashes of the Santhal dead
   Drift down the sacred Rivers to the Sea



SCIENCE


THE BARBAROUS BIRDGODS A SAVAGE PARABASIS


In the Aves of Aristophanes the Bird Chorus declare that they are
older than the Gods and greater benefactors of men  This idea recurs in
almost all savage mythologies and I have made the savage Birdgods state
their own case

                            The Birds sing

   WE would have you to wit that on eggs though we sit and are spiked
   on the spit and are baked in the pan
   Birds are older by far than your ancestors are and made love and made
   war ere the making of Man
   For when all things were dark not a glimmer nor spark and the world
   like a barque without rudder or sail
   Floated on through the night twas a Bird struck a light twas a
   flash from the bright featherd Tonatius  tail
   Then the Hawk a with some dry wood flew up in the sky and afar
   safe and high the Hawk lit Sun and Moon
   And the Birds of the air they rejoiced everywhere and they recked not
   of care that should come on them soon
   For the Hawk so they tell was then known as Pundjel b and
   amusing he fell at the close of the day
   Then he went on the quest as we thought of a nest with some bark of
   the best and a clawful of clay c
   And with these did he frame two birds lacking a name without feathers
   his game was a puzzle to all
   Next around them he fluttered adancing and muttered and lastly he
   uttered a magical call
   Then the figures of clay as they featherless lay they leaped up who
   but they and embracing they fell
   And this was the baking of Man and his making but now hes
   forsaking his Father Pundjel
   Now these creatures of mire they kept whining for fire and to crown
   their desire who was found but the Wren
   To the high heaven he came from the Sun stole he flame and for this
   has a name in the memory of men a
   And in India who for the Soma juice flew and to men brought it
   through without falter or fail
   Why the Hawk twas again and great Indra to men would appear now and
   then in the shape of a Quail
   While the Thlinkeets delight is the Bird of the Night the beak and
   the bright ebon plumage of Yehl b
   And who for mans need brought the famed Suttungs mead why tis told
   in the creed of the Sagamen strong
   Twas the Eagle god who brought the drink from the blue and gave
   mortals the brew thats the fountain of song a
   Next who gave men their laws and what reason or cause the young
   brave overawes when in need of a squaw
   Till he thinks it a shame to wed one of his name and his conduct you
   blame if he thus breaks the law
   For you still hold it wrong if a lubra b belong to the
   selfsame kobong c that is Father of you
   To take her as a bride to your ebony side nay you give her a wide
   berth quite right of you too
   For her father you know is your father the Crow and no
   blessing but woe from the wedding would spring
   Well these rules they were made in the wattlegum shade and were
   strictly obeyed when the Crow was the King d
   Thus on Earths little ball to the Birds you owe all yet your
   gratitudes small for the favours theyve done
   And their feathers you pill and you eat them at will yes you
   plunder and kill the bright birds one by one
   Theres a price on their head and the Dodo is dead and the Moa has
   fled from the sight of the sun


MAN AND THE ASCIDIAN


                               A MORALITY

   THE Ancestor remote of Man
   Says Darwin is th Ascidian
   A scanty sort of waterbeast
   That ninety million years at least
   Before Gorillas came to be
   Went swimming up and down the sea

   Their ancestors the pious praise
   And like to imitate their ways
   How then does our first parent live
   What lesson has his life to give

   Th Ascidian tadpole young and gay
   Doth Life with one bright eye survey
   His consciousness has easy play
   Hes sensitive to grief and pain
   Has tail and spine and bears a brain
   And everything that fits the state
   Of creatures we call vertebrate
   But age comes on with sudden shock
   He sticks his head against a rock
   His tail drops off his eye drops in
   His brains absorbed into his skin
   He does not move nor feel nor know
   The tidal waters ebb and flow
   But still abides unstirred alone
   A sucker sticking to a stone

   And we his children truly we
   In youth are like the Tadpole free
   And where we would we blithely go
   Have brains and hearts and feel and know
   Then Age comes on  To Habit we
   Affix ourselves and are not free
   Th Ascidians rooted to a rock
   And we are bondslaves of the clock
   Our rocks are MedicineLettersLaw
   From these our heads we cannot draw
   Our loves drop off our hearts drop in
   And daily thicker grows our skin

   Ah scarce we live we scarcely know
   The wide worlds moving ebb and flow
   The clanging currents ring and shock
   But we are rooted to the rock
   And thus at ending of his span
   Blind deaf and indolent does Man
   Revert to the Ascidian


BALLADE OF THE PRIMITIVE JEST


    What did the darkhaired Iberian laugh at before the tall blonde
    Aryan drove him into the corners of EuropeBrander Matthews

   I AM an ancient Jest
   Palolithic man
   In his arboreal nest
   The sparks of fun would fan
   My outline did he plan
   And laughed like one possessed
   Twas thus my course began
   I am a Merry Jest

   I am an early Jest
   Man delved and built and span
   Then wandered South and West
   The peoples Aryan
   I journeyed in their van
   The Semites too confessed
   From Beersheba to Dan
   I am a Merry Jest

   I am an ancient Jest
   Through all the human clan
   Red black white free oppressed
   Hilarious I ran
   Im found in Lucian
   In Poggio and the rest
   Im dear to Moll and Nan
   I am a Merry Jest

                                  ENVOY

   Prince you may storm and ban
   Joe Millers are a pest
   Suppress me if you can
   I am a Merry Jest



CAMEOS
SONNETS FROM THE ANTIQUE


These versions from classical passages are pretty close to the original
except where compression was needed as in the sonnets from Pausanias and
Apuleius or where as in the case of fragments of schylus and
Sophocles a little expansion was required


CAMEOS


   THE graver by Apollos shrine
      Before the Gods had fled would stand
      A shell or onyx in his hand
   To copy there the face divine
   Till earnest touches line by line
      Had wrought the wonder of the land
      Within a beryls golden band
   Or on some fiery opal fine
   Ah would that as some ancient ring
   To us on shell or stone doth bring
      Arts marvels perished long ago
   So I within the sonnets space
      The large Hellenic lines might trace
         The statue in the cameo


HELEN ON THE WALLS


                           Iliad iii 

   FAIR Helen to the Scan portals came
   Where sat the elders peers of Priamus
   Thymoetas Hiketaon Panthus
   And many another of a noble name
   Famed warriors now in council more of fame
   Always above the gates in converse thus
   They chattered like cicalas garrulous
   Who marking Helen swore it is no shame
   That armed Achan knights and Ilian men
   For such a womans sake should suffer long
   Fair as a deathless goddess seemeth she
   Nay but aboard the redprowed ships again
   Home let her pass in peace not working wrong
   To us and childrens children yet to be


THE ISLES OF THE BLESSED


   Pindar Fr    B     B  

   NOW the light of the sun in the night of the Earth on the souls of
   the True
      Shines and their city is girt with the meadow where reigneth the
   rose
   And deep is the shade of the woods and the wind that flits oer them
   and through
      Sings of the sea and is sweet from the isles where the
   frankincense blows
   Green is their garden and orchard with rare fruits golden it glows
      And the souls of the Blessed are glad in the pleasures on Earth
   that they knew
   And in chariots these have delight and in dice and in minstrelsy
   those
      And the savour of sacrifice clings to the altars and rises anew

   But the Souls that Persephone cleanses from ancient pollution and
   stain
      These at the end of the age be they prince be they singer or
   seer
   These to the world shall be born as of old shall be sages again
      These of their hands shall be hardy shall live and shall die and
   shall hear
   Thanks of the people and songs of the minstrels that praise them
   amain
      And their glory shall dwell in the land where they dwelt while
   year calls unto year


DEATH


                          sch Fr 

   OF all Gods Death alone
      Disdaineth sacrifice
   No man hath found or shown
      The gift that Death would prize
      In vain are songs or sighs
   Pan or praise or moan
      Alone beneath the skies
   Hath Death no altarstone

   There is no head so dear
      That men would grudge to Death
   Let Death but ask we give
   All gifts that we may live
   But though Death dwells so near
      We know not what he saith


NYSA


                Soph Fr  sch Fr 

   ON these Nysan shores divine
      The clusters ripen in a day
      At dawn the blossom shreds away
   The berried grapes are green and fine
   And full by noon in days decline
      Theyre purple with a bloom of grey
      And eer the twilight plucked are they
   And crushed by nightfall into wine

   But through the night with torch in hand
      Down the dusk hills the Mnads fare
      The bullvoiced mummers roar and blare
   The muffled timbrels swell and sound
      And drown the clamour of the band
   Like thunder moaning underground


COLONUS


                          d Col 

                                    I

   HERE be the fairest homes the land can show
      The silverycliffed Colonus always here
   The nightingale doth haunt and singeth clear
   For well the deep green gardens doth she know
   Groves of the God where winds may never blow
      Nor men may tread nor noontide sun may peer
      Among the myriadberried ivy dear
   Where Dionysus wanders to and fro

   For here he loves to dwell and here resort
   These Nymphs that are his nurses and his court
   And golden eyed beneath the dewy boughs
      The crocus burns and the narcissus fair
      Clusters his blooms to crown thy clustered hair
   Demeter and to wreathe the Maidens brows

                                   II

   YEA here the dew of Heaven upon the grain
      Fails never nor the ceaseless waterspring
      Near neighbour of Cephisus wandering
   That day by day revisiteth the plain
   Nor do the Goddesses the grove disdain
      But chiefly here the Muses quire and sing
      And here they love to weave their dancing ring
   With Aphrodite of the golden rein

   And here there springs a plant that knoweth not
      The Asian mead nor that great Dorian isle
   Unsown untilled within our garden plot
      It dwells the greyleaved olive neer shall guile
   Nor force of foemen root it from the spot
      Zeus and Athene guarding it the while


THE PASSING OF DIPOUS


                         d Col 

   HOW dipous departed who may tell
      Save Theseus only for there neither came
      The burning bolt of thunder and the flame
   To blast him into nothing nor the swell
   Of seatide spurred by tempest on him fell
      But some diviner herald none may name
      Called him or inmost Earths abyss became
   The painless place where such a soul might dwell

   Howeer it chanced untouched of malady
      Unharmed by fear unfollowed by lament
   With comfort on the twilight way he went
      Passing if ever man did wondrously
   From this worlds death to life divinely rent
      Unschooled in Times last lesson how we die


THE TAMING OF TYRO


                          Soph Fr 

Sidero the stepmother of Tyro daughter of Salmoneus cruelly entreated
her in all things and chiefly in this that she let sheer her beautiful
hair

   AT fierce Sideros word the thralls drew near
      And shore the locks of Tyrolike ripe corn
      They fell in golden harvestbut forlorn
   The maiden shuddered in her pain and fear
      Like some wild mare that cruel grooms in scorn
   Hunt in the meadows and her mane they sheer
   And drive her where within the waters clear
      She spies her shadow and her shame doth mourn

   Ah hard were he and pitiless of heart
      Who marking that wild thing made weak and tame
         Broken and grieving for her glory gone
   Could mock her grief but scornfully apart
      Sidero stood and watched a wind that came
   And tossed the curls like fire that flew and shone


TO ARTEMIS


                      Hippol Eurip 

   FOR thee soft crowns in thine untrampled mead
      I wove my lady and to thee I bear
   Thither no shepherd drives his flocks to feed
      Nor scythe of steel has ever laboured there
      Nay through the spring among the blossoms fair
   The brown bee comes and goes and with good heed
   Thy maiden Reverence sweet streams doth lead
      About the grassy close that is her care

   Souls only that are gracious and serene
      By gift of God in human lore unread
   May pluck these holy blooms and grasses green
      That now I wreathe for thine immortal head
   I that may walk with thee thyself unseen
      And by thy whispered voice am comforted


CRITICISM OF LIFE


                     Hippol Eurip 

   LONG life hath taught me many things and shown
      That lukewarm loves for men who die are best
      Weak wine of liking let them mix alone
   Not Love that stings the soul within the breast
   Happy who wears his lovebonds lightliest
      Now cherished now away at random thrown
      Grievous it is for others grief to moan
   Hard that my soul for thine should lose her rest

   Wise ruling this of life but yet again
      Perchance too rigid diet is not well
   He lives not best who dreads the coming pain
      And shunneth each delight desirable
   Flee thou extremes this word alone is plain
      Of all that God hath given to Man to spell


AMARYLLIS


                        Theocritus Idyll iii

   FAIR Amaryllis wilt thou never peep
      From forth the cave and call me and be mine
   Lo apples ten I bear thee from the steep
      These didst thou long for and all these are thine
   Ah would I were a honeybee to sweep
      Through ivy and the bracken and woodbine
   To watch thee waken Love and watch thee sleep
      Within thy grot below the shadowy pine
   Now know I Love a cruel god is he
      The wild beast bare him in the wild wood drear
   And truly to the bone he burneth me
      But blackbrowed Amaryllis neer a tear
   Nor sigh nor blush nor aught have I from thee
      Nay nor a kiss a little gift and dear


THE CANNIBAL ZEUS


                                AD 

               
       o v oPaus viii 

   NONE elder city doth the Sun behold
      Than ancient Lycosura twas begun
      Ere Zeus the meat of mortals learned to shun
   And here hath he a grove whose haunted fold
   The driven deer seek and huntsmen dread tis told
      That whoso fares within that forest dun
      Thenceforth shall cast no shadow in the Sun
   Ay and within the year his life is cold

   Hard by dwelt he  who while the Gods deigned eat
   At good mens tables gave them dreadful meat
      A child he slewhis mountain altar green
   Here still hath Zeus with rites untold of me
   Piteous but as they are let these things be
      And as from the beginning they have been


INVOCATION OF ISIS


                      Apuleius Metamorph XI

   THOU that art sandalled on immortal feet
      With leaves of palm the prize of Victory
   Thou that art crowned with snakes and blossoms sweet
      Queen of the silver dews and shadowy sky
      I pray thee by all names men name thee by
   Demeter come and leave the yellow wheat
      Or Aphrodite let thy lovers sigh
   Or Dian from thine Asian temple fleet

   Or yet more dread divine Persephone
      From worlds of wailing spectres ah draw near
   Approach Selene from thy subject sea
      Come Artemis and this night spare the deer
   By all thy names and rites I summon thee
      By all thy rites and names Our Lady hear


THE COMING OF ISIS


   SO Lucius prayed and sudden from afar
      Floated the locks of Isis shone the bright
   Crown that is tressed with berry snake and star
      She came in deep blue raiment of the night
      Above her robes that now were snowy white
   Now golden as the moons of harvest are
   Now red now flecked with many a cloudy bar
      Now stained with all the lustre of the light

   Then he who saw her knew her and he knew
      The awful symbols borne in either hand
   The golden urn that laves Demeters dew
      The handles wreathed with asps the mystic wand
   The shaken seistrons music tinkling through
      The temples of that old Osirian land



THE SPINET


   MY hearts an old Spinet with strings
      To laughter chiefly tuned but some
      That Fate has practised hard on dumb
   They answer not whoever sings
   The ghosts of halfforgotten things
      Will touch the keys with fingers numb
      The little mocking spirits come
   And thrill it with their fairy wings

   A jingling harmony it makes
      My heart my lyre my old Spinet
   And now a memory it wakes
      And now the music means forget
   And little heed the player takes
      Howeer the thoughtful critic fret




NOTES


Page   The Fortunate Islands  This piece is a rhymed loose version
of a passage in the Vera Historia of Lucian  The humorist was unable
to resist the temptation to introduce passages of mockery which are here
omitted  Part of his description of the Isles of the Blest has a close
and singular resemblance to the New Jerusalem of the Apocalypse  The
clear River of Life and the prodigality of gold and of precious stones
may especially be noticed

Page   Whoso doth taste the Dead Mens bread c  This belief
that the living may visit on occasion the dwellings of the dead but
can never return to earth if they taste the food of the departed is
expressed in myths of worldwide distribution  Because she ate the
pomegranate seed Persephone became subject to the spell of Hades  In
Apuleius Psyche when she visits the place of souls is advised to
abstain from food  Kohl found the myth among the Ojibbeways Mr
Codrington among the Solomon Islanders it occurs in Samoa in the
Finnish Kalewala where Wainamoinen in Pohjola refrains from touching
meat or drink and the belief has left its mark on the medival ballad
of Thomas of Ercildoune  When he is in Fairy Land the Fairy Queen
supplies him with the bread and wine of earth and will not suffer him to
touch the fruits which grow in this countrie  See also Wandering
Willie in Redgauntlet

Page   The latest minstrel  The sound of all others dearest to
his ear the gentle ripple of Tweed over its pebbles was distinctly
audible as we knelt around the bed and his eldest son kissed and closed
his eyesLockharts Life of Scott vii 

Page   Ronsards Grave  This version ventures to condense the
original which like most of the works of the Pleiad is unnecessarily
long

Page   The snow and wind and hail  Ronsards rendering of
the famous passage in Odyssey vi about the dwellings of the Olympians
The vision of a Paradise of learned lovers and poets constantly recurs in
the poetry of Joachim du Bellay and of Ronsard

Page   Romance  Suggested by a passage in La Faustin by M E
de Goncourt a curious moment of poetry in a repulsive piece of
naturalisme

Page   M Boulmier author of Les Villanelles died shortly after
this villanelle was written he had not published a larger collection
on which he had been at work

Page   Edmund Gorliot  The bibliophile will not easily procure
Gorliots book which is not in the catalogues  Throughout The Last
Maying there is reference to the Pervigilium Veneris

Page   BirdGods  Apparently Aristophanes preserved in a
burlesque form the remnants of a genuine myth  Almost all savage
religions have their birdgods and it is probable that Aristophanes did
not invent but only used a surviving myth of which there are scarcely
any other traces in Greek literature

Page   Spinet  The accent is on the last foot even when the word
is written spinnet  Compare the remarkable Liberty which Pamela took
with the th Psalm

   My Joys and Hopes all overthrown
      My Heartstrings almost broke
   Unfit my Mind for Melody
      Much more to bear a Joke
   But yet if from my Innocence
   I even in Thought should slide
   Then let my fingers quite forget
      The sweet Spinnet to guide

necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition
