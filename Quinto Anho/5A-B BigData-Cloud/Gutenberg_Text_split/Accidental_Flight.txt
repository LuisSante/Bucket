Cameron frowned intently at the top of the desk It was difficult to
concentrate under the circumstances Your request was turned over to
the Medicouncil he said After studying it they reported back to
the Solar Committee

Docchi edged forward his face literally lighting up

Dr Cameron kept his eyes averted the man was damnably disconcerting
You know what the answer is A flat no for the present

Docchi leaned back We should have expected that he said wearily

Its not entirely hopeless Decisions like this can always be
changed

Sure said Docchi Weve got centuries His face was
flushedblazing would be a better description

Absently Cameron lowered the lights in the room as much as he could
It was still uncomfortably bright Docchi was a nuisance

But why asked Docchi You know that were capable Why did they
refuse

Cameron had tried to avoid that question Now it had to be answered
with blunt brutality Did you think you would be chosen Or Nona or
Jordan or Anti

Docchi winced Maybe not But weve told you that were willing to
abide by what the experts say Surely from a thousand of us they can
select one qualified crew

Perhaps so said Cameron He switched on the lights and resumed
staring at the top of the desk Most of you are biocompensators
Ninety per cent I believe I concede that we ought to be able to get
together a competent crew He sighed But youre wasting your time
discussing this with me Im not responsible for the decision I cant
do anything about it

Docchi stood up His face was colorless and bright

Dr Cameron looked at him directly for the first time I suggest you
calm down Be patient and wait you may get your chance

You wait said Docchi We dont intend to

The door opened for him and closed behind him

Cameron concentrated on the desk Actually he was trying to look
through it He wrote down the card sequence he expected to find He
opened a drawer and gazed at the contents then grimaced in
disappointment No matter how many times he tried he never got better
than strictly average results Maybe there was something to telepathy
but he hadnt found it yet

He dismissed it from his mind It was a private game a method of
avoiding involvement while Docchi was present But Docchi was gone
now and he had better come up with some answers The right ones

He switched on the telecom Get me Medicouncilor Thorton he told
the robot operator Direct if you can indirect if you have to Ill
wait

With an approximate mean diameter of thirty miles the asteroid was
listed on the charts as Handicap Haven The regular inhabitants were
willing to admit the handicap part of the name but they didnt call
it haven There were other terms none of them suggesting sanctuary

It was a hospital of course but even more like a convalescent home
the permanent kind A healthy and vigorous humanity had built it for
those few who were less fortunate A splendid gesture but like many
such gestures the reality fell somewhat short of the original
intentions

The robot operator interrupted his thoughts Medicouncilor Thorton
will speak to you

The face of an older man filled the screen On my way to the
satellites of Jupiter Ill be in direct range for the next half
hour At such distance transmission and reception were practically
instantaneous You wanted to speak to me about the Solar Committee
reply

I do I informed Docchi a few minutes ago

How did he react

He didnt like it As a matter of fact he was mad all the way
through

That speaks well for his mental resiliency

They all seem to have enough spirit though and nothing to use it
on said Dr Cameron I confess I didnt look at him often in spite
of the fact that he was quite presentable Handsome even in a
startling way

Thorton nodded Presentable That means he had arms

He did Is that important

I think it is He expected a favorable reply and wanted to look his
best As nearly normal as possible

Trouble

I dont see how said the medicouncilor uncertainly In any event
not immediately It will take them some time to get over the shock of
refusal They cant do anything really Individually theyre
helpless Collectivelythere arent parts for a dozen sound bodies on
the asteroid

Ive looked over the records said Dr Cameron Not one accidental
has ever liked being on Handicap Haven and that covers quite a few
years But there has never been so much open discontent as there is
now

Someone is organizing them Find out who and keep a close watch

I know who Docchi Nona Anti and Jordan But it doesnt do any
good merely to watch them I want your permission to break up that
combination Humanely of course

How do you propose to do it

Docchi for instance With prosthetic arms he appears physically
normal except for that uncanny luminescence That is repulsive to the
average person Medically theres nothing we can do about it but
psychologically we might be able to make it into an asset Youre
aware that Gland Opera is the most popular program in the Solar
System Telepaths teleports pyrotics and so forth are the heroes
All fake of course makeup and trick camera shots But Docchi can be
made into a real live star The deathray man say When his face
shines men fall dead or paralyzed Hed have a chance to return to
normal society under conditions that would be mentally acceptable to
him

Acceptable to him perhaps but not to society reflected the
medicouncilor An ingenious idea one which does credit to your
humanitarian outlook Only it wont work You have Docchis medical
record but you probably dont know his complete history He was an
electrochemical engineer specializing in cold lighting He seemed on
his way to a brilliant career when a particularly messy accident
occurred The details arent important He was badly mangled and
tossed into a tank of cold lighting fluid by automatic machinery It
was some time before he was discovered

There was a spark of life left and we managed to save him We had to
amputate his arms and ribs practically to his spinal column The
problem of regeneration wasnt as easy as it usually is We were able
to build up a new rib case thats as much as we could do Under such
conditions prosthetic arms are merely ornaments They can be fastened
to him and they look all right but he cant use them He has no back
or shoulder muscles to anchor them to

And add to that the adaptation his body made while he was in the
tank The basic cold lighting fluid as you know is semiorganic It
permeated every tissue in his body By the time we got him it was
actually a necessary part of his metabolism A corollary I suppose
of the fundamental biocompensation theory

The medicouncilor paused and shook his head Im afraid your idea is
out Dr Cameron I dont doubt that he would be successful on the
program you mention But there is more to life on the outside than
success Can you picture the dead silence when he walks into a room of
normal people

I see said Cameron though he didnt at least not eye to eye The
medicouncilor was convinced and there was nothing Cameron could do to
alter that conviction The other one I had in mind was Nona he
added

I thought so Thorton glanced at the solar chronometer I havent
much time but Id better explain Youre new to the post and I dont
think youve learned yet to evaluate the patients and their problems
properly In a sense Nona is more impossible than Docchi He was once
a normal person She never was Her appearance is satisfactory
perhaps shes quite pretty though you must remember that youre
seeing her under circumstances that may make her seem more attractive
than she really is

She cant talk or hear She never will She doesnt have a larynx
and it wouldnt help if we gave her one She simply doesnt have the
nervous system necessary for speech or hearing Her brain is
definitely not structurally normal As far as were concerned that
abnormality is not in the nature of a mutation Its more like an
anomaly Once cleft palates were frequentprenatal nutritional
deficiencies or traumas Occasionally we still run into cases like
that but our surgical techniques are always adequate Not with Nona
however

She cant be taught to read or write weve tried it We dug out the
old Helen Keller techniques and brought them up to date with no
results Apparently her mind doesnt work in a human fashion We
question whether very much of it works at all

That might be a starting point said Cameron If her brain

Gland Opera stuff interrupted Thorton Or Rhine Opera if youll
permit me to coin a term Weve thought of it but it isnt true
Weve tested her for every telepathic quality that the Rhine people
list Again no results She has no special mental capacities Just to
make sure of that weve given her periodic checkups One last year
in fact

Cameron frowned in frustration Then its your opinion that shes not
able to survive in a normal society

Thats it answered the medicouncilor bluntly Youll have to face
the truthyou cant get rid of any of them

With or without their cooperation Ill manage said Cameron

Im sure you will The medicouncilors manner didnt ooze
confidence Of course if you need help we can send reinforcements

The implication was clear enough Ill keep them out of trouble
Cameron promised

The picture and the voice were fading Its up to you If it turns
out to be too difficult get in touch with the Medicouncil

The robot operator broke in The ship is beyond direct telecom range
If you wish to continue the conversation it will have to be relayed
through the nearest main station At present that is Mars

Aside from the time element which was considerable it wasnt likely
that he would get any better answers than he could supply for himself
Cameron shook his head We are through thanks

He got heavily to his feet That wasnt a psychological reaction at
all He really was heavier He made a mental note He would have to
investigate

In a way they were patheticthe patchwork humans the half or quarter
men and women the fractional organisms masquerading as peoplean
illusion which died hard for them Medicine and surgery were partly to
blame Techniques were too good or not good enough depending on the
viewpoint

Too good in that the most horribly injured person if he were still
alive could be kept alive Not good enough because a percentage of
the injured couldnt be returned to society completely sound and
whole There werent many like that but there were some and all of
them were on the asteroid

They didnt like it At least they didnt like being confined to
Handicap Haven It wasnt that they wanted to go back to the society
of the normals for they realized how conspicuous theyd be among the
multitudes of beautiful healthy people on the planets

What the accidentals did want was ridiculous They desired they
hoped they petitioned to be the first to make the long hard journey
to Alpha and Proxima Centauri in rockets Trails of glory for those
that went a vicarious share in it for those who couldnt

Nonsense The broken people those without a face they could call
their own those who wore their hearts not on their sleeves but in a
bloodpumping chamber those either without limbs or organsor too
many The categories seemed endless

The accidentals were qualified true In fact of all the billions of
solar citizens they alone could make the journey and return But
there were other factors that ruled them out The first point was
never safe to discuss with them especially if the second had to be
explained It would take a sadistic nature that Cameron didnt
possess

                                   

Docchi sat beside the pool It was pleasant enough a pastoral scene
transplanted from Earth A small tree stretched shade overhead Waves
lapped and made gurgling sounds against the sides No plant life of
any kind grew and no fish swam in the liquid It looked like water
but it wasnt It was acid In it floated something that monstrously
resembled a woman

Illustration

They turned us down Anti Docchi said bitterly

Didnt you expect it the creature in the pool asked

I guess I didnt

You dont know the Medicouncil very well

Evidently I dont He stared sullenly at the faintly blue fluid
Why did they turn us down

Dont you know

All right I know he said Theyre pretty irrational

Of course irrational Let them be that way as long as we dont
follow their example

I wish I knew what to do he said Cameron suggested we wait

Biocompensation murmured Anti stirring restlessly Theyve always
said that Up to now its always worked

What else can we do asked Docchi Angrily he kicked at an anemic
tuft of grass Draw up another request

Memorandum number ten Lets not be naive about it Things get lost
so easily in the Medicouncils filing system

Or distorted grunted Docchi

Maybe we should give the Medicouncil a rest Theyre tired of hearing
us anyway

I see what you mean said Docchi rising

Better talk to Jordan about it

I intend to Ill need arms

Good Ill see you when you leave for far Centauri

Sooner than that Anti Much sooner

Stars were beginning to wink Twilight brought out shadows and tracery
of the structure that supported the transparent dome overhead Soon
controlled slow rotation would bring darkness to this side of the
asteroid

                                   

Cameron leaned back and looked speculatively at the gravital engineer
Vogel The man could give him considerable assistance if he would
There was no reason why he shouldnt but any man who had voluntarily
remained on Handicap Haven as long as Vogel had was a doubtful
quantity

Usually we maintain about half Earthnormal gravity Cameron said
Isnt that correct

Engineer Vogel nodded

It isnt important why those limits were set Cameron continued
Perhaps its easier on the weakened bodies of the accidentals There
may be economic factors

No reason for those limits except the gravital units themselves
Vogel said Theoretically it should be easy to get any gravity you
want Practically though we get between a quarter and almost full
Earth gravity Now take the fluctuations The gravital computer is set
at fifty per cent Sometimes we get fifty per cent and sometimes
seventyfive Whatever it is it just is and we have to be satisfied

The big engineer shrugged I hear the units were designed especially
for this asteroid he went on Some fancy medical reason Easier on
the accidentals to have less gravity change you say Me I dunno Id
guess the designers couldnt help it and the reason was dug up later

Cameron concealed his irritation He wanted information not a
hearttoheart confession All practical sciences try to justify
whatever they cant escape but would like to Medicine Im sure is
no exception He paused thoughtfully Now there are three separate
gravital units on the asteroid One runs for fortyfive minutes while
the other two are idle Then it cuts off and another takes over This
is supposed to be synchronized I dont have to tell you that it
isnt You felt your weight increase suddenly at the same time I did
What is wrong

Nothing wrong said the engineer Thats what you get with
gravital

You mean theyre supposed to run that way Overlapping so that for
five minutes we have Earth or Earthandahalf gravity and then none

Its not supposed to be that way said Vogel But nobody ever
built a setup like this that worked any better He added defensively
Of course if you want you can check with the company that makes
these units

Im not trying to challenge your knowledge and Im not anxious to
make myself look silly I have a sound reason for asking these
questions There is a possibility of sabotage

The engineers grin was wider than the remark seemed to require

All right said Cameron tiredly Suppose you tell me why sabotage
is so unlikely

Well explained the gravital engineer it would have to be someone
living here and he wouldnt like it if he suddenly got double or
triple gravity or maybe none at all But theres another reason Now
take a gravital unit Any gravital unit Most people think of it as
just thata unit It isnt really that at all It has three parts

One part is a power source that can be anything as long as its big
enough Our power source is a nuclear pile buried deep in the
asteroid Youd have to take Handicap Haven apart to get to it Part
two is the gravital coil which actually produces the gravity and is
simple and just about indestructible Part three is the gravital
control It calculates the relationship between the amount of power
flowing through the gravital coil and the strength of the created
gravity field in any one microsecond It uses the computed
relationship to alter the power flowing through in the next
microsecond to get the same gravity No change of power no gravity I
guess you could call the control unit a computer as good a one as is
made for any purpose

The engineer rubbed his chin Fatigue he continued The gravital
control is an intricate computer thats subject to fatigue Thats why
it has to rest an hour and a half to do fortyfive minutes of work
Naturally they dont want anyone tinkering with it Its
nonrepairable Crack the case open and it wont work But first you
have to open it Mind you that can be done But I wouldnt want to
try it without a highpowered lab setup

If it didnt seem completely foolproof neither did it seem a likely
source of trouble Then we can forget about the gravital units said
Cameron arising But what about hand weapons Are there any
available

You mean toasters

Anything thats lethal

Nothing No knives even Maybe a stray bar or so of metal Vogel
scratched his head There is something dangerous though Dangerous
if you know how to take hold of it

Instantly Cameron was alert Whats that

Why the asteroid itself You cant physically touch any part of the
gravital unit But if you could somehow sneak an impulse into the
computer and change the direction of the field Vogel was very
grave You could pick up Handicap Haven and throw it anywhere you
wanted At the Earth say Thirty miles in diameter is a big hunk of
rock

It was this kind of information Cameron was looking for though the
engineer seemed to regard the occasion as merely a social call Is
there any possibility of that occurring he asked quietly

The engineer grinned Never happened but theyre ready for things
like that with any gravital system They got monitor stations all
overthe moons of Jupiter Mars Earth Venus

Any time the gravital computer gets dizzy the monitor overrides it
If that fails they send a jammer impulse and freeze it up tight It
wont work until they let loose

Cameron sighed He was getting very little help or information from
Vogel All right he said Youve told me what I wanted to know

He watched the engineer depart for the gravitygenerating chamber far
below the surface of the asteroid

                                   

The post on Handicap Haven wasnt pleasant it wasnt an experience a
normal human would desire It did have advantagesadvancement came in
sizes directly proportional to the disagreeableness of the place

Ten months to go on a years assignment If Cameron could survive that
period with nothing to mar his administration he was in line for
better positions A suicide or any other kind of unpleasantness that
would focus the attention of the outside world on the forgotten
asteroid was definitely unwelcome

He flipped on the telecom Rocket dome Get me the pilot

When the robot finally answered it wasnt encouraging Im sorry
There is no answer

Then trace him he snapped If hes not in the rocket dome hes in
the main dome I want you to get him at once

A few seconds of silence followed There is no record of the pilot
leaving the rocket dome

His heart skipped with an effort he spoke carefully Scan the whole
area Understand Youve got to find him

Scanning is not possible The system is out of operation in that
area

All right he said starting to shake Send out repair robots
They were efficient in the sense they always did the work they were
set to do but not in terms of speed

The robots were dispatched as soon as scanning failed to work Are
there any other instructions

He thought about that He needed help plenty of it Vogel Hed be
ready and willing but that would leave the gravitygenerating setup
unprotected Better do without him

Who else The sour old nurse whod signed up because she wanted quick
credits toward retirement Or the sweet young thing who had bravely
volunteered because someone ought to help those poor unfortunate men
Not the women of course She had a bad habit of fainting when she saw
blood Probably that was why she couldnt get a position in a regular
planetary hospital

That was all except the robots who werent much help in a case like
this That and the rocket pilot For some reason he wasnt available

The damned place was undermanned Always had been Nobody wanted to
come except the mildly psychotic the inefficient and lazy or
conceivably an ambitious young doctor like himself Mentally Cameron
berated the last category If anything serious happened here such a
doctor might end his career bandaging scratches at a childrens
playground

Instructions he said Yes Leave word in gravitygenerating for
Vogel Tell him to throw everything hes got around the units Watch
them

Is that all

Not quite Send six general purpose robots Ill pick them up at the
entrance to the rocket dome

Repair robots are already in that area Will they do as well

They will not I want geepees for another reason They wouldnt be
much help true but the best he could manage

                                   

Docchi waited near the rocket dome Not hiding merely inconspicuous
among the carefully nurtured shrubbery that was supposed to give the
illusion of Earth If the plants failed in that respect at least they
contributed to the oxygen supply of the asteroid

Good girl said Docchi That Nona is wonderful

Jordan could feel him relax A regular mechanical marvel he agreed
But we can gas about that later Lets get going

Docchi glanced around and then walked boldly into the passageway that
connected the main dome with the much smaller adjacent rocket dome
Normally it was never dark in the inhabited parts of the asteroid a
modulated twilight was considered more conducive to the slumber of the
handicapped But it wasnt twilight as they neared the rocket domeit
was a fullscale rehearsal for the darkness of interplanetary space

Docchi stopped before the emergency airlock which loomed solidly in
front of them I hope Nona was able to cut this out of the circuit
he said anxiously

She understood didnt she asked Jordan He reached out and the
great slab moved easily aside in its grooves The trouble with you is
that you lack confidence

Docchi listening with a frown didnt answer

Okay I hear it too whispered Jordan Wed better get well inside
before he reaches us

Docchi walked rapidly into the darkness of the rocket dome He allowed
his face to become faintly luminescent the one part of his altered
metabolism that he had learned to control when he wasnt under
emotional strain

He was nervous now but his control had to be right Enough light so
that hed be noticed not so much that details of his appearance would
be plain

The footsteps came nearer accompanied by a steady volume of
profanity Docchi flashed his face once and then lowered the intensity
almost immediately

The footsteps stopped Docchi

No Just a lonely little light bulb out for an evening stroll

The rocket pilots laughter wasnt altogether friendly I know its
you I meant what are you doing here

I saw the lights in the rocket dome go out The entrance was open so
I came in Maybe I can help

Theyre off all right Everything Even the standby system The
rocket pilot moved closer The deadly little toaster was in his hand
You cant help Youd better get out Its against regulations for
you to be in here

Docchi ignored the weapon What happened Did a meteor strike

The pilot grunted Not likely He peered intently at the barely
visible silhouette Well I see youre getting smart You should do
that all the time You look better that way even if theyre not
usable arms You look His voice faded away

Sure almost human Docchi finished for him Not like a pair of
legs and a spinal column with a lightning bug stuck on top

I didnt say that So youre sensitive about it eh Maybe thats not
your fault Anyway youd better get going

But I dont want to go said Docchi deliberately Im not afraid of
the dark Are you

Cut the psycho talk Docchi All your circuits are working and you
know it Now get out of here before I take your fake hand and drag you
out

Now youve hurt my feelings declared Docchi reproachfully nimbly
stepping away

You asked for it growled the pilot lunging after him What he took
hold of wasnt an imitation hand made of plastic It was flesh and
blood That was why the pilot screamed once before he was lifted off
his feet and slammed to the floor

Docchi bent double The dark figure on his back came over his head
like a sword from a scabbard

Jor

Yeah said Jordan

He wrapped one arm around the pilots throat and clamped it tight
With the other he felt for the toaster the pilot still held
Effortlessly he tore it away and used the butt with just enough force
to knock the pilot unconscious without smashing the skull Docchi
stood by until it was over All he could offer was an ineffectual
kick not balanced by arms

It wasnt needed

Let there be light ordered Jordan laughing and there was a
feeble flickering illumination from Docchi

Jordan was balancing himself on his hands A strong head massive
powerful arms and shoulders His body ended at his chest A round
metal capsule contained his digestive system

Dead Docchi looked down at the pilot

Jordan rocked forward and listened for the heartbeat Nah he said
I remembered in time that we cant afford to kill anyone

Good said Docchi and stifled an exclamation as something coiled
around his leg His reactions were fast he broke loose almost
instantly

Repair robot said Jordan looking around The place is lousy with
them

Docchi blinked on and off involuntarily and the robot came toward him

Friendly creature observed Jordan Hes offering to fix your
lighting system for you

Docchi ignored the squat contrivance and stared at the pilot Now
what he asked

Agreed said Jordan He needs attention Not the kind I gave
him He balanced the toaster in his hand and burned a small hole in
the little wheeled monster Tentacles emerged from the side of the
machine and felt puzzledly at the damaged area The tentacles were
withdrawn and presently reappeared with a small torch and began
welding

Jordan pulled the unconscious pilot toward him He leaned against the
machine raised the inert form over his head and laid it gently on the
top flat surface Another tentacle reached out to investigate the body
of the pilot Jordan welded the joints solid with the toaster Three
times he repeated the process until the pilot was fastened to the
robot

The thing will stay here repairing itself until its completely
sound again remarked Jordan However that can be fixed He
adjusted the toaster beam to an imperceptible thickness Deftly he
sliced through the control case and removed a circular section He
reached inside and ripped out circuits No further selfrepair he
said cheerfully Now Im going to need your help From a time
standpoint I think its a good idea to run the robot around the
main dome a few times before it delivers the pilot to the hospital No
point in giving ourselves away before were ready

Docchi bent over the robot and with his help the proper sequence was
implanted The machine scurried erratically away

Docchi watched it go Time for us to be on our way He bent double
for Jordan The arms folded around his neck but Jordan made no effort
to climb up onto his back For a panic moment Docchi knew how the
pilot felt when strength where there shouldnt have been strength
reached out from the darkness and gripped his throat

He shook the thought from his mind Get on my back he insisted

Illustration

Youre tired said Jordan Half gravity or not you cant carry me
any farther His fingers worked swiftly and the carrying harness fell
to the floor Stay down growled Jordan Listen

Docchi listened Geepees

Yeah said Jordan Now get to the rocket

What can I do when I get there Youll have to help me

Youll figure something out when the time comes Hurry up

Not without you said Docchi stubbornly without moving

Illustration

A huge paw clamped around the back of his skull Listen to me
whispered Jordan fiercely Together we were a better man than the
pilotyour legs and my arms Its up to us to prove that separately
we are a match for Cameron and his geepees

Were not trying to prove anything said Docchi

A brilliant light sliced through the darkness and swept around the
rocket dome

Maybe we are said Jordan Impatiently he hitched himself along the
ground I think I am

What are you going to do

Im going up With no legs thats where I belong

He grasped the structural steel member in his great hands and in the
light gravity ascended rapidly

Careful warned Docchi

This is no time to be careful His voice floated down from high in
the lacy structure It wasnt completely dark the lights were getting
nearer Docchi decided it was possible for Jordan to see what he was
doing

They hadnt expected to be discovered so soon But the issue had not
yet been settled against them Docchi settled into a long stride
avoiding the lowslung repair robots that seemed to be everywhere If
Jordan refused to give up Docchi had to try

He stayed well ahead of the oncoming general purpose robots

                                   

He reached the rocket and barely had time to look around It was
enough however The ships passenger and freight locks were closed
Nona had either not understood all their instructions or she hadnt
been able to carry them out The first probably She had put the
light and scanning circuits out of commission with no tools except her
hands That and her uncanny knowledge of the inner workings of
machines It was too much to expect that she should also have the ship
ready and waiting for them

It was up to him to get in If he had the toaster theyd taken from
the pilot he might have been able to soften the proper area of the
passenger lock But he didnt Not having arms he couldnt have used
it For that reason Jordan had kept the weapon

The alternative was to search the surrounding mechanical jungle for an
external control of the rocket There had to be one at least for the
airlocks Then it was a matter of luck whether he could work it

The approaching lights warned him that he no longer had that
alternative If Cameron hadnt tried to search the rocket dome as he
came along the geepees would be solidly ringed around the ship now
That was Camerons mistake however and he might make more

In all probability Jordan was still at large Perhaps nearby Would
Cameron know that He might not

Docchi descended into the shallow landing pit Until both of them were
caught there was always a chance He had to hide but the landing pit
seemed remarkably illsuited for that purpose

He leaned against the stern tube cluster and tried to shake his brain
into activity The metal pressed hard into the thin flesh that covered
his back In the smooth glazed surface of the landing pit the only
answer was the tubes

He straightened up and looked into them A small boy might climb
inside and crawl out of sight Or a grown man who had no shoulders or
arms to get wedged in the narrow cylinder

Out in space the inner ends of the tubes were closed with a
combustion cap wherein the fuel was ignited But in the dome where
the ship was not used for months at a time

Yes there was that possibility

He tried a lower tube He lay on the floor and thrust his head inside
He wriggled and shoved with his feet until he had forced himself
entirely in It was dark and terrifying but no time for
claustrophobia

He stopped momentarily and listened A geepee descended noisily into
the landing pit The absence of any other sound indicated to Docchi
that it was radiocontrolled

He drove himself on though it was slow progress The walls were
smooth and it was difficult to get much purchase The going became
even tougherthe tube was getting smaller Not much but enough to
matter

Again he stopped Outside there was the characteristic sputter like
frying that the toaster beam made when it struck metal A great
clatter followed

Get him shouted Cameron Hes up there

Jordan had arrived and had picked off a geepee And it wasnt going to
be easy for Cameron to capture him The diversion would help

Dont use heat ordered Cameron Get your lights on him Blind him
Drive him in a corner and then go up and get him

Docchi had been wrong the geepees were controlled by voice not
radio That would make it easier for him once he got inside the ship
If he did

It looked as though he would The tube wasnt getting narrower More
important the air was not noticeably stale The combustion cap had
been retracted which was a lucky break His feet slipped It didnt
matter somehow he inched along Blood was pounding in his veins from
the constriction but his head emerged in the rocket

He stared at the retracted combustion cap a few feet away If he had
arms he could grasp it and pull himself free But if he had arms he
would never have gotten this far He wriggled until his body was
nearly out and only his legs were in the tube He kicked hard fell to
the floor

He lay there while his head cleared then rolled to his feet and
staggered forward to the control compartment The rocket was his but
he didnt want it for himself alone

He stared thoughtfully at the instrument panel It had been a long
time since he had operated a ship When he understood the controls he
bent down and thrust his chin against the gravital dial Laboriously
he turned it to the proper setting Then he sat down and kicked on a
switch The ship rocked and rose a few inches

Chances were that Cameron wouldnt notice that in the confusion
outside If he did he had thirty seconds in which to stop Docchi
That wouldnt be enough for Cameron

Rocket landing said Docchi when the allotted time passed
Emergency instructions Emergency instructions Stand by Strictly
speaking that wasnt necessary for the frequency he was using
assured him of complete control

All energized geepees lend assistance This order supersedes previous
orders Additional equipment necessary After listing the equipment
he sat back and chuckled

With his knee he turned on the external lights got up and walked to
the passenger lock brushing against the switch The airlock opened
He stood boldly at the threshold and looked out The rocket dome was
floodlighted by the ship

All right Jordan you can come down now he called

Jordan appeared overhead hanging from a beam He swung along it until
he reached a column down which he descended He propelled himself
over the floor and up the ramp in his awkward fashion Balancing on
his hands he gazed up at Docchi

Well monster how did you do it

Monster yourself said Docchi Do what

I saw you crawl in the rocket tubes said Jordan But what did you
do after you got inside

Camerons a medic said Docchi not mechanically inclined He
forgot that an emergency rocket landing cancels any verbal orders So
I took the ship up a few inches Geepees arent very bright that
satisfied them that I was coming in for a landing What Cameron should
have done was splash some heat against a gravital unit and then
having created an artificial emergency condition in the main dome he
could have directed the geepees from the gravity control center After
that he would have had top priority not me

But they rushed off carrying Cameron with them Jordan looked
puzzled

Easy I told the geepees that there was danger of crashing and that
they must remove any human beings nearby whether they were willing or
not You werent nearby and that let you out They took Cameron
because he was

Its ours breathed Jordan But what about Anti and Nona

Antis taken care of As far as the geepees are concerned she comes
under the heading of emergency landing material Theyll bring her
Nona is supposed to be waiting with Anti Docchi frowned Theres
nothing we can do if she isnt Meanwhile youd better get ready to
take the ship off

Jordan swung himself inside

Docchi remained at the passenger lock waiting He heard the geepees
first and saw them seconds later They came into sight half pushing
half carrying a huge rectangular tank With unexpected robotic
ingenuity they had mounted it on four of their smaller brethren the
squat repair robots which served to support the tremendous weight

The tank was filled with blue liquid Twisted pipes dangled from the
ends it had been torn and lifted from its foundation Broken plants
still clung to the narrow ledge on top and moist soil adhered to the
sides Five geepees pushed it rapidly toward the ship mechanically
oblivious to the disheveled man who frustratedly shouted and struck at
them

Jordan open the freight lock

In response the ship rose a few more inches and hung quivering A
section of the ship hinged outward and downward to form a ramp The
ship was ready to take on cargo

Docchi stood at his post That damn fool Cameron should have stayed in
the main dome where the geepees had released him His presence added
an unwelcome complication Still it should be easy enough to get rid
of him when the time came

It was Nona who really worried him She wasnt anywhere to be seen He
took an uncertain step down the ramp came back shaking his head It
was impossible to look for her now though he wanted to

The tank neared the ship A few feet of it projected onto the ramp
The geepees stopped their efforts lost momentum They looked
bewildered

The tank rolled backward The geepees shook buzzed and looked around
primarily at Docchi He didnt wait any longer He leaped into the
ship

Close the passenger lock he shouted

Jordan looked up questioningly from the controls

Vogel the engineer explained Docchi He must have seen the
geepees on scanning when they entered the main dome Hes trying to do
what Cameron should have done but didnt have enough sense to do

The passenger lock swung ponderously shut behind him

Now what Jordan asked worried

First lets see what you can get on the telecom said Docchi

The angle was impossible so close to the ship but they did manage to
get a corner of the tank on the screen Apparently it was resting
where Docchi had last seen it though it was difficult to be sure
because the curve of the ship loomed so large

Maybe wed better get out of here suggested Jordan nervously

Without the tank Not a chance Vogel hasnt got complete control of
them yet That seemed to be true The geepees were nearly motionless
paralyzed

What shall I do asked Jordan

Give me full power on the radio said Docchi Burn it out if you
have to I think the engineer is at the wrong angle to broadcast much
power to them Besides the intervening structure is absorbing most of
his signal

He waited until Jordan had complied The tank must be placed in the
ship he added

Geepees were not designed to sift contradictory commands that were
nearly at the same level of urgency Their reasoning power was feeble
but the mechanism was complicated enough In that respect they
resembled humans Borderline decisions were difficult

More power whispered Docchi

Sweating Jordan obeyed

Marionettes This string led toward a certain action Another
intrinsically more important but suddenly far less powerful pulled
for something else Circuits burned within electronic brains
Microrelays fluttered under the stress

Choice

Stiffly the geepees moved and grasped the tank The quality of
decision in this case was strained Inch by inch the tank rolled up
the ramp

When its completely on raise the ramp Docchi whispered to Jordan
in an even lower voice

One geepee wavered and fell Motionless it lay there The remaining
four were barely equal to the task

Now said Docchi

The freight ramp began to rise The tank picked up speed as it rolled
into the ship

Geepees save yourselves shouted Docchi

They leaped from the ramp

Jordan breathed deeply I dont think they can hurt us now

Docchi nodded Get me shiptoasteroid communication if theres any
radio left

There is Jordan made the adjustment

Vogel were going out Give us the proper sequence and save the dome
some damage

There was no reply

Hes trying to bluff said Jordan He knows the airlocks to the
main dome will automatically close if we do break through

Sure said Docchi Everyone in the main dome is safe if
everyone is in there Vogel well give you time to think about
that

Jordan gave him the time until it hurt waiting Meanwhile he flipped
on the telecom and searched the rocket dome Nothing was moving no
geepee was in sight Docchi watched the screen with interest What he
thought didnt show on his face

Still there was no reply from Vogel

All right Docchi said in a low hard voice Jordan take it out
Hit the shell with the bow of the rocket

The ship hardly quivered as it ripped through the transparent covering
of the rocket dome The worst sound was unheard the hiss of air
escaping through the great hole in the envelope

Jordan sat at the controls gripping the levers I couldnt tell he
said slowly It happened too fast for me to be sure Maybe Vogel did
have the inner shell out of the way In that event its all right
because it would close immediately The outer shell is supposed to be
selfsealing but I doubt if it could handle that much damage

He twisted the lever and the ship leaped forward

Cameron I dont mind He had enough time to get out if he wanted to
But I keep thinking that Nona might be in there

Docchi avoided his eyes There was no light at all in his face He
walked away

Jordan rocked back and forth The hemisphere that held what remained
of his body was well suited for that He set the autocontrols and
reduced the gravity to onequarter Earth normal He bent his great
arms and shoved himself into the air deftly catching hold of a guide
rail He would have to go with Docchi But not at the moment He felt
bad

That is he did until he saw a light blinking at a cabin door He had
to investigate that first

                                   

Jordan caught up before Docchi reached the cargo hold In the lesser
gravity of the ship Jordan was truly at home

Docchi turned and waited for him Jordan still carried the weapon he
had taken from the pilot It was clipped to the sacklike garment he
wore dangling from his midsection which for him was just below his
shoulders Down the corridor he flew swinging from the guide rails
lightly though gravity on the ship was as erratic as on the asteroid

Docchi braced himself Locomotion was not so easy for him

Jordan halted beside him and dangled from one hand We have another
passenger

Docchi stiffened Who

I could describe her said Jordan But why when a name will do at
least as well

Nona said Docchi He slumped in sudden relief against the wall
How did she get in the ship

A good question said Jordan Remind me to ask her that sometime
when shes able to answer But since I dont know Ill have to use my
imagination My guess is that after she jammed the lights and
scanners in the rocket dome she walked to the ship and tapped the
passenger lock three times in the right places or something just as
improbable The lock opened for her whether it was supposed to or
not

As good a guess as any agreed Docchi

We may as well make our assumptions complete Once inside she felt
tired She found a comfortable cabin and fell asleep in it She
remained asleep throughout our skirmish with the geepees

She deserves a rest said Docchi

She does But if she had waited a few minutes to take it shed have
saved you the trouble of crawling through the tubes

She did her part and more Docchi argued We depend too much on
her Next well expect her to escort us personally to the stars He
straightened up Lets go Anti is waiting for us

The cargo hold was sizable It had to be to contain the tank battered
and twisted though it was Equipment had been jarred from storage
racks and lay in tangled heaps on the floor

Anti called Docchi

Here

Are you hurt

Never felt a thing came the cheerful reply

                                   

Jordan scaled the side of the tank He reached the top and peered
over She seems all right he called down Part of the acids gone
Otherwise no damage

Damage enough however Acid was a matter of life for Anti It had
been splashed from the tank and where it had spilled metal was
corroding rapidly The wall against which the tank had crashed was
bent and partly eaten through That was no reason for alarm the
scavenging system of the ship would handle acid The real question was
what to do for Anti

Ive stewed in this soup for years said Anti Get me out of here

How

If you werent as stupid as doctors pretend to be youd know how No
gravity of course Ive got muscles more than you think I can walk
as long as my bones dont break from the weight

No gravity would be rough on Docchi having no arms he would be
virtually helpless The prospect of floating free without being able
to grasp something was terrifying

As soon as we can manage it he said forcing down his fear First
weve got to drain and store the acid

Jordan had anticipated that Hed swung off the tank and was busy
expelling the water from an auxiliary compartment into space As soon
as the compartment was empty he led a hose from it to the tank

The pumps sucked and the acid level fell slowly

Docchi felt the ship lurch familiarly Hurry he called out to
Jordan

The gravital unit was acting up Presumably it was getting ready to
cut out If it didwell a freefloating globe of acid would be as
destructive to the ship and those in it as a high velocity meteor
cluster

Jordan jammed the lever as far as it would go and held it there All
out said Jordan presently and let the hose roll back into the wall
Done in plenty of time The gravital unit remained in operation for a
full minute

As soon as she was weightless Anti rose out of the tank

In all the time Docchi had known her he had seen no more than a face
framed in blue acid Periodic surgery where it was necessary had
trimmed the flesh from her face For the rest she lived submerged in
a corrosive liquid that destroyed the wild tissue as fast as it grew
Or nearly as fast

Docchi averted his eyes

Well junkman look at a real monster snapped Anti

                                   

Humans were not meant to grow that large But it was not obscene to
Docchi merely unbelievable Jupiter is not repulsive because it is
the bulging giant of planets it is overwhelming and so was Anti

How will you live out of the acid he stammered

How really unobservant some men are said Anti loftily I
anticipated our little journey and prepared for it If you look
closely you will notice I have on a special surgery robe Its the
only thing in the Solar System that will fit me Its fabricated from
a spongelike substance and holds enough acid to last me about
thirtysix hours

She grasped a rail and propelled herself toward the corridor Normally
that was a spacious passageway For her it was a close fit

Satellites one glowing and the other swinging in an eccentric orbit
followed after her

                                   

Nona was standing before the instrument panel when they came back
There was an impressive array of dials lights and levers in front of
her but she wasnt interested in these A single small dial separate
from the rest held her complete attention She seemed disturbed by
what she saw or didnt see Disturbed or excited it was difficult to
say which

Anti stopped Look at her If I didnt know shes a freak like the
rest of us the only one in fact who was born that way it would be
easy to hate hershes so disgustingly normal

Normal True and yet not true Surgical techniques that could take a
body apart and put it back together again with a skill once reserved
for the repair of machines had made beauty commonplace No more
sagging muscles wrinkles even the aged were attractive and
youthfulseeming until the day they died No more illformed limbs
misshapen bodies Everyone was handsome or beautiful No exceptions

None to speak of at least

The accidentals didnt belong of course In another day most of them
would have been candidates for a waxworks or the formaldehyde of a
specimen bottle

Nona fitted neither category she wasnt a repair job Looking at her
closelyand why notshe was an original work as far from the normal
in one direction as Anti for example was in the other

Why is she staring at the little dial asked Anti as the others
slipped past her and came into the compartment Is there something
wrong with it She shrugged I would be interested in the big dials
The ones with colored lights

Thats Nona Docchi smiled Im sure shes never been in the
control room of a rocket before and yet she went straight to the most
curious thing in it Shes looking at the gravital indicator Directly
behind it is the gravital unit

How do you know Does it say so

It doesnt You have to be trained to recognize it or else be Nona

Anti dismissed that intellectual feat What are you waiting for You
know she cant hear us Go stand in front of her

How do I get there Docchi had risen a few inches from the floor
now that Jordan had released him from his grip

A good engineer would have enough sense to put on magneslippers Nona
did Anti grasped his jacket How she was able to move was uncertain
The tissues that surrounded the woman were too vast to permit the
perception of individual motions Nevertheless she proceeded to the
center of the compartment and with her came Docchi

Nona turned before they reached her

My poor boy sighed Anti You do a very bad job of concealing your
emotions if thats what youre trying to do Anyway stop glowing
like a rainbow and say something

Hello said Docchi

Nona smiled at him though it was Anti that she came to

No not too close child Dont touch the surgery robe unless you
want your pretty face to peel off like a plastiwrapper

Nona stopped she said nothing

Anti shook her head hopelessly I wish you would learn to read lips
or at least recognize written words Its so difficult to communicate
with you

She knows facial expressions and actions I think said Docchi
Shes good at emotions Words are a foreign concept to her

What other concepts does anyone think with asked Anti dubiously

Maybe mathematical relationships answered Docchi Though she
doesnt Theyve tested her for that He frowned I dont know what
concepts she does think with I wish I did

Save some of that worry and apply it to our present situation said
Anti The object of your concern doesnt seem to be interested in
it

That was true Nona had wandered back and was staring at the gravital
indicator again What she saw to hold her attention was a puzzle

In some ways she seemed irresponsible and childlike That was an
elusive thought though whose child Not really of course Her
parents were obscure technicians and mechanics descendants of a long
line of mechanics and technicians The question he had asked himself
was this where and how does she belong He couldnt answer

With an effort Docchi came back to reality We appealed to the
Medicouncil he said We asked for a ship to go to the nearest star
It would have to be a rocket naturally Even allowing for a better
design than any we now have the journey would take a long time forty
or fifty years going and the same length of time back Thats entirely
too long for a normal but it wouldnt matter to a biocompensator

Why a rocket interrupted Jordan Why not some form of gravity
drive

An attractive idea admitted Docchi Theoretically theres no
limit to gravity drive except light speed and even thats not
certain If it would work the time element could be cut to a
fraction But the last twenty years have proved that gravity drives
wont work at all outside the Solar System They function very poorly
even when the ship is as far out as Jupiters orbit

I thought the gravity drive on a ship was nearly the same as the
gravital unit on the asteroid said Jordan Why wont they
function

I dont know why answered Docchi impatiently If I did I wouldnt
be marooned on Handicap Haven Arms or no arms biocompensator or not
Id be the most important scientist on Earth

With a multitude of pretty women competing for your affections
added Anti

I think hed settle for one A certain one suggested Jordan

Poor unimaginative boy said Anti In my youth

Weve heard about your youth said Jordan

Youth and love are long since past for both of you Talk about them
privately if you want but not now Docchi glowered at them
Anyway he resumed gravity drive is out One time they had hopes
for it but no longer It should be able to drive this ship Actually
its sole function is to provide an artificial gravity inside the
ship for passenger comfort So rocket ship it is Thats what we
asked for The Medicouncil refused Therefore were going to appeal to
a higher authority

Fine said Anti How

Weve discussed it answered Docchi Ultimately the Medicouncil is
responsible to the Solar Government And in turn

All right Im in favor of it said Anti I just wanted to know

Mars is closer continued Docchi But Earth is the seat of
government As soon as we get there He stopped suddenly and
listened

Anti listened with him and waited until she could stand it no longer
Whats the matter she asked I dont hear anything

Jordan leaned forward in his seat and looked at the instrument panel
Thats the trouble Anti Youre not supposed to hear anything But
you should be able to feel the vibration from the rocket exhaust as
long as its on

I dont feel anything either

Yeah said Jordan He looked at Docchi Theres plenty of fuel

                                   

Momentum of the ship didnt cease when the rockets stopped of course
They were still moving but not very fast and not in the direction
they wanted to go Gingerly Docchi tried out the magneslippers he
was clumsy but no longer helpless in the gravityless ship He stared
futilely at the instruments as if he could wring more secrets than the
panel had electronic access to

Its mechanical trouble of some sort he said uneasily Theres one
way of finding out

Before he could move Anti was in the corridor that led away from the
control compartment

Stay here Anti he said Ill see whats wrong

She reached nearly from the floor to the ceiling She missed by scant
inches the sides of the passageway Locomotion was easy enough for
her turning around wasnt Anti didnt turn

Look honey her voice floated back You brought me along for the
ride Thats fine but Im not satisfied with it I want to earn my
fare You stay and run the ship because you know how and I dont Ill
find out whats wrong

But you wont know what to do Anti There was no answer All
right he said in defeat Both of us ought to go Jordan you stay
at the controls

Anti led the way because Docchi couldnt get around her Determinedly
he shuffled along There was a trick to magneslippers that he had
nearly forgotten Slowly it was coming back to himshuffle instead of
striding

It was a dingy poorly lighted passageway in an older ship Handicap
Haven definitely didnt rate the best equipment that was produced On
one side was the hull of the ship on the other a few small cabins
None were occupied Anti stopped The passageway ended in a cross
corridor that led to the other side of the ship

Wed better check the stern rocket tubes he said still unable to
see around her Open it up and well take a look

I cant said Anti There are handles but the thing wont open
Theres a red light too Does that mean anything

His heart sank It does Dont try to open it With your strength
you might be unlucky enough to do it

Thats a man for you said Anti sharply First he wants me to open
it and then he tells me not to

Theres a vacuum in there The combustion cap has been retracted
Thats the only thing that will actuate the warning signal Youd die
in a few seconds if you somehow managed to open the lock to the rocket
compartment

What are we waiting for Lets get busy and fix it

Sure fix it You see Anti that didnt happen by itself Someone
or something was responsible

Who

Did you see anyone when we were loading your tank in the ship

Nothing I heard Cameron shouting a lot of noise All I could see
was what was directly overhead What does that have to do with it

I think it has to do with a geepee I thought they all dropped
outside Maybe there was one that didnt

Why a geepee she asked blankly

In the first place no man is strong enough to move the combustion
cap But if he should somehow manage to exert superhuman effort as
soon as the cap cleared the tubes rocket action would cease The air
in the compartment would exhaust into space and anyone in there would
die

So we have a dead geepee in there

A geepee doesnt die Not even become inactive it doesnt need air
Docchi tried to think the thing through Not only that a geepee
might be able to escape from the compartment The lock would close as
soon as the pressure dropped But a geepee

Anti settled down grimly Then theres a geepee on the loose intent
on sabotage

Im afraid so he admitted worriedly

What are we standing here for Well go back to controls and pick up
the robot on radio What it damaged it can repair She was partly
turned around now and saw Docchis face Dont tell me she said I
suppose I should have thought of it The signal doesnt work inside
the ship

Docchi nodded It doesnt Robots are never used aboard so the
control is set in the bow antenna and the ship of course is
insulated

Well said Anti happily weve got a robot hunt ahead of us

We do And our bare hands to hunt it with

Oh come now Its not as bad as all that Look the geepee was back
here when the rockets stopped Could it get by the control compartment
without our seeing it

It couldnt There are two corridors leading through the compartment
one on each side of the ship

Thats what I thought We came down one corridor and no geepee was in
it It has to be in the other If it goes into a cabin a light will
shine on the outside It cant really hide from us

Sure well find out where it is But what are we going to do with it
when we find it

I was thinking said Anti Can you get around me when Im standing
like this

I cant

Neither can a geepee All I need is a toaster or something that
looks like one and I can drive the robot into the control compartment
for Jordan to pick off Determinedly she began to move toward the
opposite corridor Hurry back to Jordan and tell him what were
doing There ought to be another toaster on the ship Probably theres
one somewhere in the control compartment Bring it back to me

Docchi bit his lip and stared at the back of the huge woman All
right he answered But stay where you are Dont try anything until
I get back

Anti laughed I value my big fat life she said There were other
things she valued but she didnt mention them

Docchi went as fast as the magneslippers would allow which wasnt
very fast The strategy was simple but it didnt follow that it was
sounda toaster for Jordan and one for Anti if another could be
found

Anti would block the corridor A geepee might go through her but it
could never squeeze past her The robot would have to run for it If
it came toward Anti she might be able to burn it down But she would
be firing directly into the control room If she missed even
partially

The instruments were delicate

It wasnt better if Jordan got the chance to bring down the robot
Anti would be in the line of fire No that wasnt good either
Theyd have to think of something else

Jordan called Docchi as he entered the control compartment Jordan
wasnt there Nona was still gazing serenely at the gravity
indicator

Lights were streaming from the corridor on the opposite side of the
compartment Docchi hurried over Jordan was just inside the entrance
the toaster clutched grimly in his hand He was hitching his truncated
body slowly toward the stern

Coming to meet him was Antiunarmed enormously fat Anti She wasnt
walking somehow it seemed more like swimming a bulbous flabby sea
animal moving through the air She waved her fins against the wall and
propelled herself forward

Melt him down she cried

It was difficult to make out the vaguely human form of the geepee The
powerful shining body blended into the structure of the ship
itselfunintentional camouflage though the robot wasnt aware of
that It was crouched at the threshold of a cabin hesitating between
the approaching dangers

Jordan raised the weapon and as instantly lowered it Get out of the
way he told Anti

There was no place for her to go She was too big to enter a cabin
too massive to let the geepee squeeze by her even if she wanted it to

Never mind that Get him she answered

A geepee was not a genius even by robot standards It didnt need to
be Heat is deadly a human body is a fragile thing This it knew It
ran toward Anti Unlike man it didnt need magneslippers It had
magnetic metal feet which could move fast and did

Docchi couldnt close his eyes though he wanted to He had to watch
The geepee torpedoed into Anti And it was the robot that was thrown
back Relative mass favored the monstrous woman

The electronic brain obeyed its original instructions whatever those
were It got to its feet and rushed toward Anti Metal arms shot out
with dazzling speed and crashed against the flesh of the fat woman
Docchi could hear the thud No ordinary person could take that kind of
punishment and live

Anti wasnt ordinary she was strange even for an accidental living
far inside a deep armor of flesh It was possible that she never felt
the crushing force of those blows Amazingly she grasped the robot
and drew it to her And the geepee lost the advantage of leverage The
bright arms didnt flash so fast nor with such lethal power

Gravity cried Anti All youve got

She leaned against the struggling machine

Gravity That was something he could do Docchi turned took two steps
before the surge of gravity hit him It came in waves the sequence of
which he was never able to disentangle The first wave staggered him
at the second his knees buckled and he sank to the floor After that
his eardrums hurt He thought he could feel the ship quiver He knew
dazedly that an artificial gravity field of this magnitude was
impossible but that knowledge didnt help him move

It vanished as suddenly as it had come Painfully his lungs expanded
Each muscle ached He rolled to his feet and lurched past Jordan

He didnt find the mass of broken flesh he expected Anti was already
standing

Oof she grunted and gazed with satisfaction at the twisted
grotesque shape at her feet The electronic brain had been smashed
the body flattened

Illustration

Are you hurt asked Docchi gently awed

She waggled the extremities of her body Nope I cant feel anything
broken she said solemnly She moved back to get a better view of the
robot Id call that throwing my weight around At the right time of
course The secrets timing And I must say you picked up your cue
with the gravity well Her laughter rolled through the ship

It wasnt I said Docchi

Jordan No hes just getting up Then who

Nona said Docchi It had to be her She saw what had to be done
and did it But how she got that amount of gravity

Ask her said Anti with fond irony

Docchi grimaced and limped back into the control room followed by
Anti and Jordan Nona was at the gravity panel her face pleasant and
childlike

Gravity can be turned on or off said Docchi puzzledly searching
her face for some sign And regulated within certain narrow limits
But somehow you doubled or tripled the normal amount How

Nona smiled questioningly

Gravity engineers would like to know that too said Jordan

Everybody would like to know Anti interrupted irritably Except
me Im too pragmatic I suppose but I want to know when we start the
rockets and be on our way

It isnt that easy sighed Jordan A retracted combustion cap in
flight generally means at least one burnedout tube He made his way
to the instrument panel and looked at it glumly Three

A factor Docchi nodded But I was thinking about the robot

Anti was impatient An interesting subject no doubt What about it

Where did it get instructions Not radio the hull of the ship cuts
off all radiation The last we knew it was in our control

All right how

Voice said Docchi Camerons voice to be exact

But he was in the rocket dome Jordan objected

Think back to when we were loading the tank We had to look through
the telecom and the angle of vision was bad We couldnt see much of
the cargo lock Anti couldnt see anything that wasnt directly
overhead Both Cameron and the geepee managed to get inside and we
didnt know it

Jordan hefted his weapon Looks like weve got another hunt on our
hands This time a nice normal doctor

Keep it handy said Docchi glancing at the toaster But be careful
how you use it One homicide and we can forget what we came for I
think hell be ready to surrender The ships temporarily disabled
hell consider that damage enough

                                   

Jordan found the doctor in the forward section of the ship Cameron
knew better than to argue with a toaster In a matter of minutes he
was in the control room

Now that youve got me what are you going to do with me he asked

Docchi swiveled away from the instrument panel I dont expect active
cooperation of course but I like to think youll give your word not
to hinder us hereafter

Cameron glared I promise nothing of the kind

We can chain him to Anti suggested Jordan That will keep him out
of trouble

Like leading a poodle on a leash Nope said Anti indignantly A
girl has to have some privacy

Dont wince Cameron objected Docchi She really was a girl once
an attractive one

We can put him in a spacesuit and lock his hands behind his back
said Jordan Something like an ancient straitjacket

Cameron laughed

No thats inhuman said Docchi

Jordan juggled the toaster I can weld with this Lets put him in a
cabin and weld the door closed We can cut a slot to shove food in A
very narrow slot

Excellent I think you have the solution That is unless Dr Cameron
will reconsider his decision

Cameron shrugged Theyll pick you up in a day or less anyway I
suppose Im not compromising myself by agreeing to your terms

Good

A doctors word is as good as his oath observed Anti Hippocratic
or hypocritic

Now Anti dont be cynical Doctors have an economic sense as well
as the next person said Docchi gravely He turned to Cameron You
see after Anti grew too massive for her skeletal structure doctors
reasoned shed be most comfortable in the absence of gravity That was
in the early days before successful ship gravital units were
developed They put her on an interplanetary ship and kept
transferring her before each landing

But that grew troublesome andexpensive They devised a new
treatment the asteroid and the tank of acid Not being aquatic by
nature Anti resented the change She still does

I knew nothing about that Cameron pointed out defensively

It was before your time Docchi frowned at the doctor Tell me why
did you laugh when Jordan mentioned a spacesuit

Cameron grinned That was my project while you were busy with the
robot

To do what Jordan

But Jordan was already on his way He was gone for some time

Well asked Docchi on his return It really wasnt necessary
Jordans gloomy face told the story

Cut to ribbons

All of them

Every one Beyond repair

Whats the excitement about rumbled Anti We dont need spacesuits
unless something happens to the ship and we have to go outside

Exactly Anti How do you suppose we go about replacing the defective
tubes From the outside of course By destroying the spacesuits
Cameron made sure we cant

Anti opened her mouth with surprise and closed it in anger She
glowered at the doctor

Were still in the asteroid zone said Cameron In itself thats
not dangerous Without power to avoid stray rocks it is I advise you
to contact the Medicouncil Theyll send a ship to pick us up and tow
us in

No thanks I dont like Handicap Haven as well as you do Anti said
brusquely She turned to Docchi Maybe Im stupid for asking but
exactly what is it thats deadly about being out in space without a
spacesuit

Cold Lack of air pressure Lack of oxygen

Is that all Nothing else

His laugh was too loud Isnt that enough

I wanted to be sure she said

She beckoned to Nona who was standing near Together they went
forward where the spacesuits were kept

Cameron scowled puzzledly and started to follow Jordan waved the
toaster around

All right said the doctor stopping He rubbed his chin What is
she thinking about

I wouldnt know said Docchi Shes not scientifically trained if
thats what you mean But she has a good mind as good as her body
once was

And how good was that

We dont talk about it said Jordan shortly

                                   

It was a long time before the women came backif the weird creature
that floated into the control compartment with Nona was Anti

Cameron stared at her and saw shudderingly that it was You need a
session with the psychocomputer he said When we get back thats
the first thing we do Cant you understand

Be quiet growled Jordan Now Anti explain what youve rigged
up

Any kind of pressure is good enough as far as the outside of the body
is concerned answered Anti flipping back the helmet Mechanical
pressure will do as well as air pressure I had Nona cut the
spacesuits into strips and wind them around mehard Then I found a
helmet that would fit over my head when the damaged part was cut away
It wont hold much air pressure even taped very tight to my skin But
as long as its pure oxygen

It might be satisfactory admitted Docchi But the temperature

Do you think Im going to worry about cold asked Anti Me Way
down below all this flesh

Listen to me said Cameron through his teeth Youve already
seriously threatened my career with all this childish nonsense I
wont permit you to ruin it altogether by a deliberate suicide

You and your stinking career retorted Jordan tiredly Were not
asking your permission to do anything He turned away from the
doctor You understand the risk Anti Its possible that it wont
work at all

Ive thought about it Anti replied soberly On the other hand
Ive thought about the asteroid

All right said Jordan Docchi nodded Nona bobbed her head it was
doubtful that she knew what she was agreeing to

Lets have some telecom viewers outside said Docchi One directly
in back one on each side Weve got to know whats happening

Jordan went to the control panel and flipped levers Theyre out and
working he said gazing at the screen Now Anti go to the freight
lock Close your helmet and wait Ill let the air out slowly The
pressure change will be gradual If anything seems wrong let me know
over the helmet radio and Ill yank you in immediately Once youre
outside Ill give you further instructions Tools and equipment are in
a compartment that opens into space

Anti waddled away

Jordan looked down at his legless body I suppose we have to be
realistic about it

We do answered Docchi Anti is the only one of us who has a chance
of doing the job and surviving

Jordan adjusted a dial It was Cameron who was responsible for it
If Anti doesnt come back you can be damn sure hell join her

No threats please said Docchi When are you going to let her
out

Shes out said Jordan Deliberately he had diverted their
attention while he had taken the burden of emotional strain

Docchi glanced hastily at the telecom Anti was hanging free in space
wrapped and strapped in strips torn from the useless spacesuitsthat
and more flesh than any human had ever borne The helmet sat jauntily
on her head the oxygen cylinder was strapped to her back She was
still intact

How is she he asked anxiously unaware that the microphone was
open

Fine came Antis reply faint and ready The airs thin but its
pure oxygen

Cold asked Docchi

It hasnt penetrated yet No worse than the acid at any rate What
do I do

Jordan gave her directions The others watched It was work to find
the tools and examine the tubes for defectives to loosen the tubes in
the sockets and pull them out and push them spinning into space It
was still harder to replace them though there was no gravity and Anti
was held to the hull by magneslippers

But it seemed more than work To Cameron who was watching an odd
thought occurred In her remote past of which he knew nothing Anti
had done something like this before Ridiculous of course Yet there
was a rhythm to her motions this shapeless giant creature whose bones
would break with her weight if she tried to stand at even only half
Earth gravity Rhythm a sense of purpose a strange pattern an
incredible gargantuan grace

The whale plowing the waves is graceful it cannot be otherwise in its
natural habitat The human race had produced accidentally one
unlikely person to whom interplanetary space was not an alien thing
Anti was at last in her element

Now said Jordan keeping the tension out of his voice go back to
the outside tool compartment Youll find a lever Pull That will set
the combustion cap in place

Done said Anti some minutes later

Thats all You can come in now

Thats all But Im not cold It hasnt reached any nerves yet

Come in repeated Jordan showing the anger of alarm

She walked slowly over the hull to the cargo lock and while she did
Jordan reeled in the telecom viewers The lock was no sooner closed
to the outside and the air hissing into the compartment than Jordan
was there opening the inner lock

Are you all right he asked

She flipped back the helmet There was frost on her eyebrows and her
nose was a bright red Of course My hands arent a bit cold She
stripped off the heated gloves and waggled her fingers

It cant be protested Cameron You should be frozen stiff

Why asked Anti laughing Its a matter of insulation and I have
plenty of that

Cameron turned to Docchi When I was a kid I saw a film of a dancer
She did a ballet Life of the Cold Planets I believe it was called
For some cockeyed reason I thought of it when Anti was out there I
hadnt thought of it in years

He rubbed his hand fretfully over his forehead It fascinated me when
I first saw it I couldnt get it out of my mind When I grew older I
found out a tragic thing happened to the dancer She was on a tour of
Venus and the ship she was in disappeared They sent out searching
parties of course They found her after she had spent a week on a
fungus plain You know what that meant The great ballerina was a
living spore culture medium

Shut up growled Jordan

Cameron didnt seem to hear Naturally she died I cant remember
her name but Ive always remembered the ballet she did And thats
funny because it reminded me of Anti out there

A fist exploded in his face If there had been more behind the blow
than shoulders and a fragment of a body his jaw would have been
broken As it was he floated through the air and crashed against the
wall

Angrily he got to his feet I gave my word I wouldnt cause any
trouble The agreement evidently doesnt work both ways He glanced
significantly at the weapon Jordan carried Maybe youd better be
sure to have that around at all times

I told you to shut up said Jordan After that he ignored the
doctor He didnt have a body with which to do it but somehow Jordan
managed a bow A flawless performance One of your very best
Antoinette

Do you think so sighed Anti The frost had melted from her eyebrows
and was trickling down her cheek She left with Jordan

Cameron remained behind He felt his jaw It was too bad about his
ambitions He knew now that he was never going to be the spectacular
success he had once imagined Not after these accidentals had escaped
from Handicap Haven Still he would always be able to practice
medicine somewhere in the Solar System Hed done his best on the
asteroid and this ship and hed been a complete ass both times

The ballerina hadnt really died as he had been told It would have
been better for her if she had He succeeded in recalling her name It
had been Antoinette

Now it was Anti He could have found that out by checking her case
historyif Handicap Haven had one on file Probably not he
comforted himself Why keep case histories of hopeless cases

                                   

Well stick to the regular lanes said Docchi I think well get
closer They have no reason to suspect that were heading toward
Earth Mars is more logical or one of the moons of Jupiter or
another asteroid

Jordan shifted uneasily Im not in favor of it Theyll pick us up
before we have a chance to say anything

But theres nothing to distinguish us from an ordinary EarthtoMars
rocket We have a ships registry on board Pick out a ship thats in
our class Hereafter were going to be that ship If Traffic blips
us and they probably wont unless we try to land have a recording
ready Something like this ME  zip crackle  reporting Our
communication is acting up We cant hear you Traffic Dont overdo
the static effects but repeat that with suitable variations and I
dont think they will bother us

Shaking his head dubiously Jordan swung away toward the repair shops

You look worried said Anti

Docchi turned around Yeah

Wont it work

Sure Well get close to Earth Theyre not looking for us around
here They dont really know why we escaped in the rocket Thats why
they cant figure out where were going

His face was taut and his eyes were tired Its not that The entire
Solar Police Force has been alerted for us

Which means

Look We planned to bypass the Medicouncil and take our case directly
to the Solar Government If they want us as much as the radio
indicates its not likely theyll be very sympathetic If the Solar
Government doesnt support us all the way well never get another
chance

Well said Anti She seemed trimmer more vigorous What are we
waiting for Lets take the last step first

He raised his head The Solar Government wont like it

They wont but theres nothing they can do about it

I think there issimply shoot us down When we stole the ship we
automatically stepped into the criminal class

We knew that in advance

Is it worth it

I think so said Anti

In that event he said Ill need time to get ready

She scrutinized him carefully Maybe we can fix you up

With fake arms and greasepaint No Theyll have to accept us as we
are

A good idea I hadnt thought of the sympathy angle

Not sympathy Reality I dont want them to approve of us as handsome
accidentals and have them change their minds when they discover what
were really like

Anti looked doubtful but she kept her objections to herself as she
waddled away

Sitting in silence he watched her go She at least would derive
some benefit Dr Cameron apparently hadnt noticed that exposure to
extreme cold had done more to inhibit her unceasing growth than the
acid bath Shed never be normal again that was obvious But some
day if the cold treatment were properly investigated she might be
able to stand gravity

He examined the telecom They were getting closer No longer a bright
point of light Earth was a perceptible disc He could see the outline
of oceans shapes of land he could imagine people

Jordan came in The record is rigged up though we havent had to use
it But we have a friend behind us An official friend

Has he blipped us

Not yet He keeps hanging on

Is he overtaking us

He would like to

Dont let him

With this bag of bolts

Shake it apart if you have to Docchi impatiently said How soon
can you break into a broadcasting orbit

I thought that was our last resort

Right As far as Anti and I are concerned this is it Any argument
against

None that I can think of answered Jordan With a heavy cruiser
behind us no argument at all

                                   

They were all in the control compartment I dont want a focus
exclusively on me Docchi was saying To a world of perfect normals
I may look strange but we have to avoid the family portrait effect

Samples suggested Anti

In a sense yes A lot depends on whether they accept those
samples

Illustration

For the first time Dr Cameron began to realize what they were up to
Wait he exclaimed Youve got to listen to me

Were not going to wait and weve already done enough listening to
you said Docchi Jordan see that Cameron stays out of the telecom
transmitting angle and doesnt interrupt Weve come too far for
that

Sure Jordan promised harshly If he makes a sound Ill melt the
teeth out of his mouth He held the toaster against his side out of
line with the telecom but aimed at Camerons face

Cameron began to shake with urgency but he kept still

Ready Docchi asked

Flip the switch and we will be with everything weve got If they
dont read us itll be because they dont want to

The rocket slipped out of the approach lanes It spun down the stern
tubes pulsing brightly coming toward Earth in a tight trajectory

Illustration

Citizens of the Solar System began Docchi Everyone on Earth This
is an unscheduled broadcast an unauthorized appeal We are using the
emergency bands because for us it is an emergency Who are we
Accidentals of course as you can see by looking at us I know the
sight isnt pretty but we consider other things more important than
appearance Accomplishment for example Contributing to progress in
ways normals cannot do

Shut away on Handicap Haven were denied this right All we can do
there is exist in frustration and boredom kept alive whether we want
to be or not Yet we have a gigantic contribution to make  if we
are allowed to leave the Solar System for Alpha Centauri You cant
travel to the stars now although eventually you will

You must be puzzled knowing how slow our present rockets are No
normal person could make the round trip he would die of old age But
we accidentals can go We would positively not die of old age The
Medicouncil knows that is true  and still will not allow us to go

At the side of the control compartment Cameron opened his mouth to
protest Jordan glancing at him imperceptibly waggled the concealed
weapon Cameron swallowed his words and subsided without a sound

Biocompensation continued Docchi evenly You may know about it
but in case information on it has been suppressed let me explain The
principle of biocompensation has long been a matter of conjecture
This is the first age in which medical technology is advanced enough
to explore it Every cell every organism tends to survive as an
individual as a species Injure it and it strives for survival
according to the seriousness of the injury We accidentals have been
maimed and mutilated almost past belief

Our organisms had the assistance of medical science Real medical
science Blood was supplied as long as we needed it machines did all
our breathing kidneys were replaced hearts furnished glandular
products supplied in the exact quantities necessary nervous and
muscular systems were regenerated In the extremity of our organic
struggle because we had the proper treatment our bodies were wiped
virtually free of death

Sweat ran down his face He longed for hands to wipe it away

Most accidentals are nearly immortal Not quitewell die four or
five hundred years from now Meanwhile there is no reason why we
cant leave the Solar System Rockets are slow you would die before
you got back from Alpha Centauri We wont Time doesnt matter to us

Perhaps better faster rockets will be devised after we leave You
may get to there long before we do We wont mind We will simply have
made our contribution to progress as best we could and that will
satisfy us

With an effort Docchi smiled The instant he did he felt it was a
mistake one that he couldnt rectify Even to himself it felt more
like a snarl

You know where were kept Thats a politer word than imprisoned We
dont call it Handicap Haven our name for it is the junkpile And
to ourselves were junkmen Does this give you a clue to how we feel

I dont know what youll have to do to force the Medicouncil to grant
their permission We appeal to you as our last resort We have tried
all other ways and failed Our future as human beings is at stake
Whether we get what we want and need is something for you to settle
with your conscience

He nudged the switch and sat down

His face was gray

I dont like to bother you said Jordan but what shall we do about
them

Docchi glanced at the telecom They were uncomfortably close and
considerably more numerous than the last time he had looked

Take evasive action he said wearily Swing close to Earth and use
the planets gravity to give us a good push Weve got to keep out of
their hands until people have time to react

I think you ought to know began Cameron There was an odd tone to
his voice

Save it for later said Docchi Im going to sleep His body
sagged Jordan wake me up if anything important happens And
remember that you dont have to listen to this fellow unless you want
to

Jordan nodded and touched the controls Nona leaning against the
gravital panel paid no attention to the scene She seemed to be
listening to something nobody else could hear That was nothing new
but it broke Docchis heart whenever he saw it His breath drew in
almost with a sob as he left the control room

                                   

The race went on Backdrop planets stars darkness The little
flecks of light that edged nearer didnt seem cheerful to Jordan His
lips were fixed in a straight hard line He could hear Docchi come in
behind him

Nice speech said Cameron

Yeah Docchi glanced at the telecom The view didnt inspire further
comment

Thats the trouble it was just a speech It didnt do you any good
My advice is to give up before you get hurt

It would be

Cameron stood at the threshold I may as well tell you he said
reluctantly I tried to before the broadcast as soon as I found out
what you were going to do But you wouldnt listen

He came into the control compartment Nona was huddled in a seat
motionless expressionless Anti was absent

You know why the Medicouncil refused to let you go

Sure said Docchi

The general metabolism of accidentals is further from normal than
that of creatures we dredge from the bottom of the sea Add to that an
enormously elongated life span and you ought to see the Medicouncils
objection

Get to the point

Look at it this way Cameron continued almost desperately The
Centauri group contains quite a few planets From what we know of
cosmology intelligent life probably exists there to a greater or
lesser extent You will be our representatives to them What they
look like isnt important its their concern But our ambassadors
have to meet certain minimum standards They at leastdamn it dont
you see that they at least have to look like human beings

I know you feel that way said Jordan rigid with contempt

Im not talking for myself Cameron said Im a doctor The
medicouncilors are doctors We graft on or regenerate legs and arms
and eyes We work with blood and bones and intestines We know what a
thin borderline separates normal people fromfrom you

Dont you understand Theyre perfect perhaps too much so They
cant tolerate even small blemishes They rush to us with things like
hangnails pimples simple dandruff Healthor rather the appearance
of ithas become a fetish They may think theyre sympathetic to you
but what they actually feel is something else

What are you driving at whispered Docchi

Just this if it were up to the Medicouncil you would be on your way
to the Centauri group But it isnt The decision always had to be
referred back to the Solar System as a whole And the Medicouncil
cant go counter to the mass of public opinion

Docchi turned away in loathing

Dont believe me said Cameron Youre not too far from Earth Pick
up the reaction to your broadcast

Worriedly Jordan looked at Docchi

We may as well find out said Docchi Its settled now one way or
the other

They searched band after band The reaction was always the same
Obscure private citizen or prominent one man or woman they all told
how sorry they were for the accidentals but

Turn it off said Docchi at last

Now what Jordan asked numbly

You have no choice said the doctor

No choice repeated Docchi dully No choice but to give up We
misjudged who our allies were

We knew you had said Cameron It seemed better to let you go on
thinking that way while you were on the asteroid It gave you
something to hope for It made you feel you werent alone The trouble
was that you got farther than we thought you would ever be able to

So we did Docchi said His lethargy seemed to lift a little And
theres no reason to stop now Jordan pick up the ships behind us
Tell them weve got Cameron on board A hostage Play him up as a
hero Basically hes not with those who are against us

Anti came into the control compartment Cheerfulness faded from her
face Whats the matter she asked

Jordan will explain to you Ive got to think

Docchi closed his eyes The ship lurched slightly though the
vibration from the rockets did not change There was no reason for
alarm the flight of a ship was never completely steady Docchi paid
no attention

At last he opened his eyes If we were properly fueled and
provisioned he said without much hope I would be in favor of the
four of us heading for Alpha or Proxima Maybe even Sirius It
wouldnt matter where since we wouldnt intend to come back But we
cant make it with our small fuel reserve If we can shake the ships
behind us we might be able to hide until we can steal the necessary
fuel and food

Whatll we do with Doc asked Jordan

Wed have to raid an unguarded outpost of course Probably a small
mining asteroid We can leave him there

Yeah said Jordan A good idea if we can run away from our
personal escort of bloodhounds Offhand that doesnt seem very
likely They didnt come any closer when I told them we had Doc with
us but they didnt drop back

He stopped and raised his eyes to the telecom He blinked not
believing what he saw

Theyre gone His voice broke with excitement

Almost instantly Docchi was beside him No he corrected Theyre
still following but theyre very far behind Even as he looked the
pursuing ships visibly lost ground

Whats our relative speed asked Jordon He looked at the dials
himself frowned tapped them as if the needles had gone crazy

What did you do to the rockets demanded Docchi

Nothing There wasnt a thing I could do We were already running
at top speed

Were above it Way above it How

There was nothing to explain their astonishing velocity Cameron
Anti and Jordan were in the control compartment Nona still sat
huddled up hands pressed tight against her head There was no
explanation at all yet power was pouring into the gravital unit as a
long unused actually useless dial was indicating

The gravital drive is working Docchi blankly pointed out

Nonsense said Anti I dont feel any weight

You dont answered Docchi You wont The gravital unit was
originally installed to drive the ship When that proved
unsatisfactory it was converted The difference is slight but
important An undirected general field produces weight effects inside
the ship Thats for passenger comfort A directed field outside the
ship will drive it You can have one or the other not both

But I didnt turn on the gravital drive said Jordan in flat
bewilderment I couldnt if I wanted to Its disconnected

I would agree with you except for one thing Its working Docchi
stared at Nona whose eyes were closed Get her attention he said

It was Jordan who gently touched her shoulder She opened her eyes On
the instrument board the needle of a once useless dial rose and fell

Whats the matter with the poor dear asked Anti Shes shaking

Let her alone said Docchi

No one moved No one said anything at all Minutes passed while the
ancient ship creaked and groaned and ran away from the fastest rockets
in the Solar System

I think I know said Docchi at last still frowning Consider the
gravitygenerating plant Part of it is an electronic computer
capable of making the necessary calculations and juggling the
proportion of power required to produce continuously directed or
undirected gravity In other words a brain a complex mechanical
intelligence From the viewpoint of that intelligence why should it
perform ad infinitum a complicated but meaningless routine It
didnt know why and because it didnt very simply it refused to do
so

Now consider Nona Shes deaf cant speak cant communicate In a
way shes comparable to the gravital computer Like it she has a very
high potential intelligence Like it shes had difficulty grasping
the facts of her environment Unlike it though she has learned
something How much I dont know but its far more than the
Medicouncil psychologists credit her with

Yeah said Jordan dubiously But whats happening now

If there were two humans involved you would call it telepathy
answered Docchi hesitantly fumbling for concepts he could only sense
without grasping One intelligence is electronic the other organic
Youll have to coin a new term because the only one I know is
extrasensory perception and thats obviously ridiculous It is isnt
it

Jordan smiled and flexed his arms Under the shapeless garment his
muscles rippled It isnt he said The power was there but were
the only ones who know how to use it Or rather Nona is

Power repeated Anti rising majestically You can keep it I want
just enough to get to Centauri

I think youll get it Docchi promised A lot of things seem
clearer now For example in the past why didnt gravital units work
well at considerable distances from the Sun As a matter of fact the
efficiency of each unit was inversely proportional to the square of
the distance between it and the Sun

The gravital computer is a deaf blind masssensitive brain The
major fact in its existence is the Sun the greatest mass in the Solar
System To such a brain leaving the Solar System would be like
stepping off the edge of a flat world because it couldnt be aware of
stars

Now that it knows about the Galaxy the drive will work anywhere
With Nona to direct it even Sirius isnt far away

Doc said Jordan carelessly youd better be figuring a way to get
off the ship Remember were going faster than man ever went before
He chuckled Unless of course you like our company and dont want
to leave

Weve got to do some figuring ourselves interposed Docchi Such as
where we are heading now

A good idea said Jordan He busied himself with charts and
calculations Gradually his flying fingers slowed His head bent low
over his work At last he stopped and folded his arms

Where asked Docchi

There Jordan dully punched the telecom selector and a view became
fixed on the screen In the center glimmered a tiny world a fragment
of a longexploded planet Their destination was easily recognizable

It was Handicap Haven

But why do we want to go there asked Anti She looked in amazement
at Docchi

Were not going voluntarily he answered his voice flat and spent
Were going where the Medicouncil wants us to go We forgot about the
monitor system When Nona activated the gravital unit that fact was
indicated at some central station All the Medicouncil had to do was
use the monitor to take the gravital drive away from Nona

We thought we were running away from the ships which we were but
only to beat them back to the junkpile asked Anti

Docchi nodded

Well its over We did our best Theres no use crying about it
Yet she was She passed by Nona patting her gently Its all right
darling You tried

Jordan followed her from the compartment

Cameron remained he came over to Docchi Everything isnt lost he
said somewhat awkwardly Youre back where you started from but
Nona at least will benefit

Benefit said Docchi Someone will It wont be Nona

Youre wrong Now that she is an important factor

So is a special experimental machine Very valuable I dont think
shell like that classification

Silence met silence It was Dr Cameron who turned away

That ghastly glow of yours when youre angry always did upset me
Ill come back when its dimmer

Docchi glared after him Cameron was the only normal aware that it was
Nona who controlled the gravital unit All the outside world could
realize was that it was in operation as it had been designed to work
but never had If Cameron could be disposed of

He shook his head It wouldnt solve anything He might fool them for
a while They might think he was responsible In the end theyd find
out Nona wasnt capable of that much deception for she never knew
what a test was

He went over to her Once he had hoped It didnt matter what he
had hoped

She looked up and smiled She had a right to No word had ever broken
the silence of her mind but now she was communicating with something
whatever it was that an electronic brain could say Of course she
didnt understand that the conversation was taking place between two
captives herself and the gravital computer

Abruptly he turned away He stopped at the telecom panel and
methodically kicked it apart Delicate tubes smashed into powder The
emergency radio he thoroughly demolished

The ship was firmly in the grip of the gravital monitor There was
nothing he could do about that All that remained was to protect Nona
from their prying minds as long as he could

She didnt hear the noise or didnt care She sat there head in her
hands calm and smiling

                                   

The outer shell of the rocket dome opened before and closed behind
them Jordan set the controls in neutral and lifted his hands
muttering to himself They were gliding through the lip of the inner
shell Home

Cheer up said Cameron breezily Youre not really prisoners you
know

Nona seemed content though Jordan didnt Docchi said nothing the
light gone from his face Anti wasnt with them she was floating in
the tank of acid The gravity field of the asteroid made that
necessary

The ship scraped gently and they were down Jordan touched a lever
passenger and freight locks were open

Lets go said Dr Cameron I imagine theres a reception committee
for you

There was The little rocket dome held more ships than normally came
in a year The precise confusion of military discipline was everywhere
in evidence Armed guards lined either side of the landing ramp down
which they walked

At the bottom a large telecom unit had been set up If size indicated
anything someone considered this an important occasion From the
screen larger than life Medicouncilor Thorton looked out
approvingly

The procession from the ship halted in front of the telecom unit

A good job Dr Cameron said the medicouncilor We were quite
surprised at the escape of the four accidentals and your
disappearance which coincided with it From what we were able to
piece together you deliberately followed them A splendid example of
quick thinking Doctor You deserve recognition for it

Thank you said Cameron

Im sorry I cant be there to congratulate you in person but I will
be soon The medicouncilor paused discreetly At first the publicity
was bad Very bad We thought it unwise to conceal an affair of such
magnitude Of course the unauthorized broadcast made it impossible
Fortunately the gravital discovery came along at just the right time
I dont mind telling you that the net effect is now in our favor

I hoped it would be said Cameron Nona

Youve spoken about her before The medicouncilor frowned We can
discuss her later For the moment see that she and the rest of the
accidentals are returned to their usual places Bring Docchi to your
office at once I want to question him privately

Cameron stared at him in bewilderment But I thought

No objections Doctor snapped Thorton Important people are
waiting for you That is all The telecom darkened

I think you heard what he said Dr Cameron The officer at his side
was very polite He could afford to be with the rank of three big
planets on his tunic

Very well Cameron answered But as commander of the asteroid I
request that you furnish a guard for the girl

Commander repeated the officer Thats funnymy orders indicate
that I am until further notice I havent got that notice He looked
around at his men and crooked a finger Lieutenant see that the
little fellowJordan I think his name isgets a lift back to the
main dome And you can walk the pretty lady to her room Or whatever
it is she lives in He smiled negligently at Cameron Anything to
oblige another commander

                                   

The medicouncilor Thorton was waiting impatiently on the telecom
when they got to Camerons office

We will arrive in about two hours he said immediately When I say
we I mean a number of top governmental officials and scientists
Meanwhile lets get on with this gravital business He caught sight
of the commander General Judd this is a technical matter I dont
think youll be interested in it

Very well sir Ill stand guard outside

The medicouncilor was silent until the door closed behind General
Judd Sit down Docchi he said with unexpected kindness He paused
to note the effect I can sympathize with you You had everything you
wanted nearly within your reach And after that to return to
Handicap Havenwell I can understand how you feel But since you did
return I think we can arrange to do something for you

Docchi stared at the man on the screen A spot of light pulsed on his
cheek and then flared rapidly over his face

Sure he said casually But there are criminal charges against me

A formality said the medicouncilor With a thing like the
discoveryor rediscoveryof the gravital drive to think about no
one is going to worry much about your unauthorized departure from the
asteroid

Medicouncilor Thorton sounded pleased I dont want to mislead you
We cant do any more for you medically than has already been done
However you will find yourself the center of a more adequate social
life Friends work whatever you want Naturally in return for this
we will expect your full cooperation

Naturally Docchi blinked at him and got to his feet Sounds
interesting Id like to think about it for a minute

Cameron planted himself squarely in front of the screen Maybe I
dont understand I think youve got the wrong person

Dr Cameron Thorton glowered Please explain

It was an easy mistake to make said Cameron Cut off from
communication the gravital drive began to work How Why Mostly who
did it You knew it wasnt I Im a doctor not a physicist Nor
Jordan hes at best a mechanic Therefore it had to be Docchi
because hes an engineer He could make it work But it wasnt Docchi
He had nothing to do with

Look out cried Thorton too late

Cameron fell to his knees The same foot that brought him down crashed
into his chin His head snapped back and he sprawled on the floor
Blood trickled from his face

Docchi shouted Thorton from the screen

Docchi didnt answer He was crashing through the door The commander
was lounging against the wall Head down Docchi ran into him The
toaster fell from his belt to the floor With scarcely a pause Docchi
stamped on it and continued running

The commander got to his feet and retrieved the weapon He aimed it
tentatively at the retreating figure a thought occurred to him and he
lowered it He examined the damaged mechanism After that it went
gingerly into a tunic pocket

Muffled shouts were coming from Camerons office The general broke
in

The medicouncilor glared at him from the screen I can see that you
let him get away

The disheveled officer straightened his uniform Im sorry sir Ill
alert the guards immediately

Never mind now Revive that man

The general wasnt accustomed to giving resuscitation it was out of
his line Nevertheless in a few minutes Cameron was conscious though
somewhat dazed

Now then Doctor if it wasnt Docchi who was responsible for the
sudden functioning of the gravital drive who was it

With satisfaction Cameron told him He had not been wrong about the
girl Listening to the detailed explanation of Nonas mental
abilities the general was perplexed as generals sometimes are

I see The medicouncilor nodded We overlooked that possibility
altogether Not the mechanical genius of an engineer Instead the
strange telepathic sense of a girl That puts the problem in a
different light

It does Cameron pressed his aching jaw She cant tell us how she
does it Well have to experiment Fortunately it wont involve any
danger With the monitor system we can always control the gravital
drive

The medicouncilor leaned perilously backward and shook his head
Youre wrong Its supposed to but it doesnt We tried For a
microsecond the monitor did take over but the gravital computer is
smarter than we thought if it was the computer that figured out the
method It found a way of cutting the power from the monitor circuit
It didnt respond at all

Cameron forgot his jaw If you didnt bring the rocket back on
remote why did she come

Docchi knows growled the medicouncilor He found out in this room
Thats why he escaped He tapped on his desk with blunt fingers She
could have taken the ship anywhere she pleased and we couldnt have
stopped her Since she voluntarily came back its obvious that she
wants the asteroid

Medicouncilor Thorton tried to shove his face out of the screen and
into the room Dont you ever think General There isnt any real
difference between gravital units except size and power What she did
to the ship she can do as easily to the asteroid He thrust out a
finger and pointed angrily Dont stand there General Judd Find
that girl

It was late for that kind of command The great dome overhead trembled
and creaked in countless joints The little world shivered groaned as
if it had lain too long in an ageold orbit It began to move

                                   

Vague shapes stirred crawled walked if they could Fantastic and
nearfantastic figures came to the assembly Huge or tiny on their
own legs or borrowed ones they arrived with or without arms faces
The word had spread by voice by moving lips by sign languages of
every sort

Remember it will be hours or perhaps days before were safe said
Docchi His voice was growing hoarse Its up to us to see that Nona
has all the time she needs

Where is she hiding asked someone from the crowd

I dont know If I did I still wouldnt tell you Its our job to
keep them from finding her

How demanded one near the front Fight the guards

Not directly said Docchi We have no arms in the sense of weapons
Many of us have no arms in any sense All we can hope to do is
obstruct their search Unless someone has a better idea this is what
I plan

I want all the men older women and the younger ones who arent
suitable for reasons Ill explain later The guards wont be here for
another half hourit will take that long to get them together and
give them the orders that the Medicouncil must be working out now
When they do come get in their way

How you do that Ill leave to your imagination Appeal to their
sympathy as long as they have any Put yourself in dangerous
situations They have ethics at first theyll be inclined to help
you When they do try to steal their weapons Avoid physical violence
as much as you can We dont want to force them into retaliation Make
the most of that phase of their behavior It wont last long

Docchi paused and looked over the crowd Each of you will have to
decide for himself when to drop that kind of resistance and start an
active battle campaign We have to disrupt the light and scanning and
ventilation systems for instance Theyll be forced to keep them in
repair Perhaps theyll try to guard these strategic points So much
the better for usthere will be fewer guards to contend with

What about me called a woman from far in back What do I do

You are in for a rough time Docchi promised her Is Jerian here

She elbowed her way to his side through the crowd

Jerian said Docchi to the accidentals is a normal pretty
womanoutwardly She has however no trace of a digestive system
The maximum time she can go without food and fluid injections is ten
hours Thats why shes here

Again Docchi scanned the group I need a cosmetech someone who has
her equipment with her

A legless woman propelled herself forward Docchi conferred with her
She seemed startled but she complied Under her deft fingers Jerian
was transformedinto Nona

She will be the first Nona theyll find explained Docchi because
she can get away with the disguise longer I thinkI hopetheyll
call off the search for a few hours while they test her Eventually
they are sure to find out In Jerians case fingerprints or Xrays
would reveal who she is But that wont occur to them immediately
Nona is impossible to question as you know and Jerian will act
exactly as Nona would

As soon as they discover that Jerian isnt Nonawell they wont
bother to be polite if thats the word for it The guards will like
the idea of finding an attractive girl they can manhandle in the line
of duty especially if they think that will help them find Nona It
wont of course But it will hold up the search and thats what we
want

They stood still no one moving Women looked at each other in silent
apprehension

Lets go said Jordan grimly

Wait advised Docchi I have one volunteer Nona I need about fifty
more It doesnt matter if youre physically sound or notwell raid
the lab for plastissue If you think you can be made up to look like
Nona come forward

Illustration

Slowly singly and by twos and threes they came to him There were
few indeed who wouldnt require liberal use of camouflage

The rest followed Jordan out

Mass production of an individual Not perfect in every instance Good
enough to pass in most Docchi watched approvingly suggesting
occasional touches of makeup

She cant speak or hear he reminded the volunteers Remember that
at all times no matter what they do Hide in difficult places After
Jerian is taken and the search called off and then resumed let
yourselves be found one at a time Every guard that has to take you
for examination is one less to look for the real Nona They have to
find her soon or get off the asteroid

The cosmetechs were busy none stopped There was one who looked up

Get off she asked Why

The Sun is getting smaller

Smaller exclaimed the woman

He nodded Handicap Haven is leaving the Solar System

Her fingers flew and molded the beautiful curve of a jaw where there
had been none Next plastissue lips were applied

Nona was soon hiding in half a hundred places

And one more

Illustration

                                   

The orbit of Neptune was far behind and still the asteroid was
accelerating Two giant gravital units strained at the core of
Handicap Haven The third clamped an abnormally heavy gravity on the
isolated world Prolonged physical exertion was awkward and doubly
exhausting Hours turned into a day but the units never faltered

Have you figured it out as precisely as you should asked Docchi
easily You share our velocity away from the Sun Youll have to
overcome it before you can start going back

The general ignored him If we could only turn off that damned
drive

Engineer Vogel shrugged sickly You try it he suggested I dont
want to be around when you do It sounds easy just a gravital unit
But remember theres a goodsized nuclear pile involved

I know we cant admitted the general morosely looking at the
darkness overhead On the other hand we can take off and blow this
rock apart from a safe distance

And lose all hope of finding her taunted Docchi

Were losing her anyway Cameron commented sourly

Its not as bad as all that consoled Docchi Now that you know
where the difficulty is you can always build another computer and
furnish it with auxiliary senses Or maybe build into it the facts of
elementary astronomy

Cautiously he shifted his frail body under the heavy gravity
Theres another solution though it may not appeal to you I cant
believe Nona is altogether unique There must be others like her
Socalled born mechanics maybe whose understanding of machinery is
a form of empathy weve never suspected Look hard enough and you may
find them perhaps in the most unlikely or unlovely body

General Judd grunted wearily If I thought you knew where she is

You can try to find out Docchi invited glowing involuntarily

Forget about the dramatics General said Cameron in disgust Weve
questioned him thoroughly Resistance we would have had in any event
Hes responsible merely for making it more effective than we thought
possible

He added slowly At the moment obviously hes trying to tear down
our morale He doesnt have to bother The situation is so bad that it
looks hopeless I cant think of a thing we can do that would help
us

The Sun was high in the center of the dome Sun More like a very
bright star It cast no shadows the lights in the dome did They
flickered and with monotonous regularity went out again The general
swore constantly and emotionlessly until service was restored

A guard approached with his captive I think Ive found her sir

Cameron looked at the girl in dismay Guard wheres your decency

Orders sir the man said

Whose orders

Yours sir You said she was sound of body How else could I find
out

Cameron scowled and thrust a scalpel deep into the girls thigh She
looked at him with a tearstained face but didnt move a muscle

Plastissue as any fool can see he commented dourly

The guard looked revolted and started to lead her out

Let her go snapped the doctor Both of you will be safer I
think

The girl darted away The guard followed her shuddering his eyes
filled with a selfloathing that Cameron realized would require hours
of psychiatric work to remove

Docchi smiled I have a request to make

Go ahead and make it snorted the general Were likely to give you
anything you want

You probably will Youre going to leave without her Very soon When
you do go dont take all your ships Well need about three when we
come to another solar system

General Judd opened his mouth in rage

Dont you say anything youll regret cautioned Docchi When you
get back what will you report to your superiors Can you tell them
that you left in good order while there was still time to continue
the search Or will they like it better if they know you stayed until
the last moment So late that you had to abandon some of your ships

The general closed his mouth and stamped away Wordlessly Cameron
dragged after him

                                   

The last ship had blasted off and the rocket trails had faded into
overwhelming darkness The Sun which had been trying to lose itself
among the other stars finally succeeded The asteroid was no longer
the junkpile It was a small world that had become a swift ship

We can survive said Docchi Power and oxygen we have and we can
grow or synthesize our food

He sat beside Antis tank which had been returned to the usual place
A small tree nodded overhead in the artificial breeze It was peaceful
enough But Nona wasnt there

Well get you out of the tank promised Jordan When she comes
back well rig up a place where theres no gravity And well
continue cold treatment

I can wait said Anti On this world Im normal

Docchi stared forlornly about The one thing he wanted to see wasnt
there

If youre worrying about Nona advised Anti dont The guards were
pretty rough with the women but plastissue doesnt feel pain They
didnt find her

How do you know

Listen said Anti The ground shivered with the power of the
gravital units As long as theyre running how can you doubt

If I could be sure

You can start now Jordan said First though youd better get up
and turn around

Docchi scrambled to his feet She was coming toward him

She showed no sign of strain Except for a slight smudge on her
wonderfully smooth and scarless cheek she might just have stepped
out of a beauty cubicle Without question she was the most beautiful
woman in the world This world of course though she could have done
well on any worldif she could have communicated with people as well
as with machines

Where were you hiding Docchi asked expecting no answer

She smiled He wondered with a feeling of helplessness if machines
could sense and appreciate her lovely smile or whether they could
somehow smile themselves

I wish I could take you in my arms he said bitterly

Its not as silly as you think said Anti watching from the surface
of the tank You dont have any arms but she has two You can talk
and hear but she cant Between you youre a complete couple

Except that she would never get the idea he answered unhappily

Jordan rocking on his hands looked up quizzically I must be
something like her They used to call me a born mechanic just put a
wrench in my hand and I can do anything with a piece of machinery
Its as if I sense what the machine wants done to it Not to the
extent that Nona can understand naturally You might say its
reversed that shes the one who can hear while I have to lipread

You never just gabble Docchi prompted You have something in
mind

Jordan hesitated I dont know if its stupid or what I was thinking
of a kind of sign language with machines You know start with the
simple ones like clocks and such and see what they mean to her
Since theyd be basic machines shed probably have pretty basic
reactions Then its just a matter of

You dont have to blueprint it Docchi cut in excitedly That would
be fine for determining elementary reactions but I cant carry around
a machine shop it wouldnt be practical There ought to be one
variable machine that would be portable and yet convey all meanings to
her

An electronic oscillator

Acid waves washed at the sides of the tank as Anti stirred
impatiently Will you two great brains work it out in the lab
please And when you get through with that problem youll have plenty
more to keep you occupied until we get to the stars Jordan and me
for instance What future is there for a girl unless she can get
married

Thats right Docchi said Ive got an idea we can do better than
normal doctors Being accidentals ourselves we wont stop
experimenting till we succeed And we have hundreds of years to do it
in

Glowing literally with pleasure he bent over for Jordan to climb on
his back Then he kissed Nona and headed for the laboratory

Nona smiled and followed

There are some things you dont need words or machines to express
Anti called out Keep that in mind will you

She submerged contentedly in the acid bath Above the dome the stars
gleamed a bright welcome to the little world that flashed through
interstellar space
