      AUTHORrsquoS NOTE
    h
    p
      The six stories in this volume are the result of some three or four years
      of occasional work The dates of their writing are far apart their
      origins are various None of them are connected directly with personal
      experiences In all of them the facts are inherently true by which I mean
      that they are not only possible but that they have actually happened For
      instance the last story in the volume the one I call Pathetic whose
      first title is Il Conde misspelt bytheby is an almost verbatim
      transcript of the tale told me by a very charming old gentleman whom I met
      in Italy I donrsquot mean to say it is only that Anybody can see that it is
      something more than a verbatim report but where he left off and where I
      began must be left to the acute discrimination of the reader who may be
      interested in the problem I donrsquot mean to say that the problem is worth
      the trouble What I am certain of however is that it is not to be
      solved for I am not at all clear about it myself by this time All I can
      say is that the personality of the narrator was extremely suggestive quite
      apart from the story he was telling me I heard a few years ago that he
      had died far away from his beloved Naples where that ldquoabominable
      adventurerdquo did really happen to him
    p
    p
      Thus the genealogy of Il Conde is simple It is not the case with the
      other stories Various strains contributed to their composition and the
      nature of many of those I have forgotten not having the habit of making
      notes either before or after the fact I mean the fact of writing a story
      What I remember best about Gaspar Ruiz is that it was written or at any
      rate begun within a month of finishing Nostromo but apart from the
      locality and that a pretty wide one all the South American Continent
      the novel and the story have nothing in common neither mood nor
      intention and certainly not the style The manner for the most part is
      that of General Santierra and that old warrior I note with satisfaction
      is very true to himself all through Looking now dispassionately at the
      various ways in which this story could have been presented I canrsquot
      honestly think the General superfluous It is he an old man talking of
      the days of his youth who characterizes the whole narrative and gives it
      an air of actuality which I doubt whether I could have achieved without
      his help In the mere writing his existence of course was of no help at
      all because the whole thing had to be carefully kept within the frame of
      his simple mind But all this is but a laborious searching of memories My
      present feeling is that the story could not have been told otherwise The
      hint for Gaspar Ruiz the man I found in a book by Captain Basil Hall
      RN who was for some time between the years  and  senior
      officer of a small British Squadron on the West Coast of South America
      His book published in the thirties obtained a certain celebrity and I
      suppose is to be found still in some libraries The curious who may be
      mistrusting my imagination are referred to that printed document Vol II
      I forget the page but it is somewhere not far from the end Another
      document connected with this story is a letter of a biting and ironic kind
      from a friend then in Burma passing certain strictures upon ldquothe
      gentleman with the gun on his backrdquo which I do not intend to make
      accessible to the public Yet the gun episode did really happen or at
      least I am bound to believe it because I remember it described in an
      extremely matteroffact tone in some book I read in my boyhood and I am
      not going to discard the beliefs of my boyhood for anybody on earth
    p
    p
      The Brute which is the only seastory in the volume is like Il Conde
      associated with a direct narrative and based on a suggestion gathered on
      warm human lips I will not disclose the real name of the criminal ship
      but the first I heard of her homicidal habits was from the late Captain
      Blake commanding a London ship in which I served in  as Second
      Officer Captain Blake was of all my commanders the one I remember with
      the greatest affection I have sketched in his personality without
      however mentioning his name in the first paper of The Mirror of the Sea
      In his young days he had had a personal experience of the brute and it is
      perhaps for that reason that I have put the story into the mouth of a
      young man and made of it what the reader will see The existence of the
      brute was a fact The end of the brute as related in the story is also a
      fact wellknown at the time though it really happened to another ship of
      great beauty of form and of blameless character which certainly deserved
      a better fate I have unscrupulously adapted it to the needs of my story
      thinking that I had there something in the nature of poetical justice I
      hope that little villainy will not cast a shadow upon the general honesty
      of my proceedings as a writer of tales
    p
    p
      Of The Informer and An Anarchist I will say next to nothing The pedigree
      of these tales is hopelessly complicated and not worth disentangling at
      this distance of time I found them and here they are The discriminating
      reader will guess that I have found them within my mind but how they or
      their elements came in there I have forgotten for the most part and for
      the rest I really donrsquot see why I should give myself away more than I have
      done already
    p
    p
      It remains for me only now to mention The Duel the longest story in the
      book That story attained the dignity of publication all by itself in a
      small illustrated volume under the title ldquoThe Point of Honourrdquo That was
      many years ago It has been since reinstated in its proper place which is
      the place it occupies in this volume in all the subsequent editions of my
      work Its pedigree is extremely simple It springs from a tenline
      paragraph in a small provincial paper published in the South of France
      That paragraph occasioned by a duel with a fatal ending between two
      wellknown Parisian personalities referred for some reason or other to
      the ldquowellknown factrdquo of two officers in Napoleonrsquos Grand Army having
      fought a series of duels in the midst of great wars and on some futile
      pretext The pretext was never disclosed I had therefore to invent it
      and I think that given the character of the two officers which I had to
      invent too I have made it sufficiently convincing by the mere force of
      its absurdity The truth is that in my mind the story is nothing but a
      serious and even earnest attempt at a bit of historical fiction I had
      heard in my boyhood a good deal of the great Napoleonic legend I had a
      genuine feeling that I would find myself at home in it and The Duel is
      the result of that feeling or if the reader prefers of that
      presumption Personally I have no qualms of conscience about this piece of
      work The story might have been better told of course All onersquos work
      might have been better done but this is the sort of reflection a worker
      must put aside courageously if he doesnrsquot mean every one of his
      conceptions to remain for ever a private vision an evanescent reverie
      How many of those visions have I seen vanish in my time This one
      however has remained a testimony if you like to my courage or a proof
      of my rashness What I care to remember best is the testimony of some
      French readers who volunteered the opinion that in those hundred pages or
      so I had managed to render ldquowonderfullyrdquo the spirit of the whole epoch
      Exaggeration of kindness no doubt but even so I hug it still to my
      breast because in truth that is exactly what I was trying to capture in
      my small net the Spirit of the Epochmdashnever purely militarist in the
      long clash of arms youthful almost childlike in its exaltation of
      sentimentmdashnaively heroic in its faith

    p
    p
      A revolutionary war raises many strange characters out of the obscurity
      which is the common lot of humble lives in an undisturbed state of
      society
    p
    p
      Certain individualities grow into fame through their vices and their
      virtues or simply by their actions which may have a temporary
      importance and then they become forgotten The names of a few leaders
      alone survive the end of armed strife and are further preserved in
      history so that vanishing from menrsquos active memories they still exist
      in books
    p
    p
      The name of General Santierra attained that cold paperandink
      immortality He was a South American of good family and the books
      published in his lifetime numbered him amongst the liberators of that
      continent from the oppressive rule of Spain
    p
    p
      That long contest waged for independence on one side and for dominion on
      the other developed in the course of years and the vicissitudes of
      changing fortune the fierceness and inhumanity of a struggle for life All
      feelings of pity and compassion disappeared in the growth of political
      hatred And as is usual in war the mass of the people who had the least
      to gain by the issue suffered most in their obscure persons and their
      humble fortunes
    p
    p
      General Santierra began his service as lieutenant in the patriot army
      raised and commanded by the famous San Martin afterwards conqueror of
      Lima and liberator of Peru A great battle had just been fought on the
      banks of the river BioBio Amongst the prisoners made upon the routed
      Royalist troops there was a soldier called Gaspar Ruiz His powerful build
      and his big head rendered him remarkable amongst his fellowcaptives The
      personality of the man was unmistakable Some months before he had been
      missed from the ranks of Republican troops after one of the many
      skirmishes which preceded the great battle And now having been captured
      arms in hand amongst Royalists he could expect no other fate but to be
      shot as a deserter
    p
    p
      Gaspar Ruiz however was not a deserter his mind was hardly active
      enough to take a discriminating view of the advantages or perils of
      treachery Why should he change sides He had really been made a prisoner
      had suffered illusage and many privations Neither side showed tenderness
      to its adversaries There came a day when he was ordered together with
      some other captured rebels to march in the front rank of the Royal
      troops A musket had been thrust into his hands He had taken it He had
      marched He did not want to be killed with circumstances of peculiar
      atrocity for refusing to march He did not understand heroism but it was
      his intention to throw his musket away at the first opportunity Meantime
      he had gone on loading and firing from fear of having his brains blown
      out at the first sign of unwillingness by some noncommissioned officer
      of the King of Spain He tried to set forth these elementary
      considerations before the sergeant of the guard set over him and some
      twenty other such deserters who had been condemned summarily to be shot
    p
    p
      It was in the quadrangle of the fort at the back of the batteries which
      command the roadstead of Valparaiso The officer who had identified him
      had gone on without listening to his protestations His doom was sealed
      his hands were tied very tightly together behind his back his body was
      sore all over from the many blows with sticks and butts of muskets which
      had hurried him along on the painful road from the place of his capture to
      the gate of the fort This was the only kind of systematic attention the
      prisoners had received from their escort during a four daysrsquo journey
      across a scantily watered tract of country At the crossings of rare
      streams they were permitted to quench their thirst by lapping hurriedly
      like dogs In the evening a few scraps of meat were thrown amongst them as
      they dropped down deadbeat upon the stony ground of the haltingplace
    p
    p
      As he stood in the courtyard of the castle in the early morning after
      having been driven hard all night Gaspar Ruizrsquos throat was parched and
      his tongue felt very large and dry in his mouth
    p
    p
      And Gaspar Ruiz besides being very thirsty was stirred by a feeling of
      sluggish anger which he could not very well express as though the vigour
      of his spirit were by no means equal to the strength of his body
    p
    p
      The other prisoners in the batch of the condemned hung their heads
      looking obstinately on the ground But Gaspar Ruiz kept on repeating
      ldquoWhat should I desert for to the Royalists Why should I desert Tell me
      Estabanrdquo
     p
    p
      He addressed himself to the sergeant who happened to belong to the same
      part of the country as himself But the sergeant after shrugging his
      meagre shoulders once paid no further attention to the deep murmuring
      voice at his back It was indeed strange that Gaspar Ruiz should desert
      His people were in too humble a station to feel much the disadvantages of
      any form of government There was no reason why Gaspar Ruiz should wish to
      uphold in his own person the rule of the King of Spain Neither had he
      been anxious to exert himself for its subversion He had joined the side
      of Independence in an extremely reasonable and natural manner A band of
      patriots appeared one morning early surrounding his fatherrsquos ranche
      spearing the watchdogs and hamstringing a fat cow all in the twinkling
      of an eye to the cries of ldquoViva la Libertadrdquo Their officer discoursed of
      Liberty with enthusiasm and eloquence after a long and refreshing sleep
      When they left in the evening taking with them some of Ruiz the
      fatherrsquos best horses to replace their own lamed animals Gaspar Ruiz went
      away with them having been invited pressingly to do so by the eloquent
      officer
    p
    p
      Shortly afterwards a detachment of Royalist troops coming to pacify the
      district burnt the ranche carried off the remaining horses and cattle
      and having thus deprived the old people of all their worldly possessions
      left them sitting under a bush in the enjoyment of the inestimable boon of
      life
    p
    p
      II
    p
    p
      Gaspar Ruiz condemned to death as a deserter was not thinking either of
      his native place or of his parents to whom he had been a good son on
      account of the mildness of his character and the great strength of his
      limbs The practical advantage of this last was made still more valuable
      to his father by his obedient disposition Gaspar Ruiz had an acquiescent
      soul
    p
    p
      But it was stirred now to a sort of dim revolt by his dislike to die the
      death of a traitor He was not a traitor He said again to the sergeant
      ldquoYou know I did not desert Estaban You know I remained behind amongst
      the trees with three others to keep the enemy back while the detachment
      was running awayrdquo
     p
    p
      Lieutenant Santierra little more than a boy at the time and unused as
      yet to the sanguinary imbecilities of a state of war had lingered near
      by as if fascinated by the sight of these men who were to be shot
      presentlymdashldquofor an examplerdquomdashas the Commandante had said
    p
    p
      The sergeant without deigning to look at the prisoner addressed himself
      to the young officer with a superior smile
    p
    p
      ldquoTen men would not have been enough to make him a prisoner mi teniente
      Moreover the other three rejoined the detachment after dark Why should
      he unwounded and the strongest of them all have failed to do sordquo
     p
    p
      ldquoMy strength is as nothing against a mounted man with a lassordquo Gaspar
      Ruiz protested eagerly ldquoHe dragged me behind his horse for half a milerdquo
     p
    p
      At this excellent reason the sergeant only laughed contemptuously The
      young officer hurried away after the Commandante
    p
    p
      Presently the adjutant of the castle came by He was a truculent
      rawboned man in a ragged uniform His spluttering voice issued out of a
      flat yellow face The sergeant learned from him that the condemned men
      would not be shot till sunset He begged then to know what he was to do
      with them meantime
    p
    p
      The adjutant looked savagely round the courtyard and pointing to the door
      of a small dungeonlike guardroom receiving light and air through one
      heavily barred window said ldquoDrive the scoundrels in thererdquo
     p
    p
      The sergeant tightening his grip upon the stick he carried in virtue of
      his rank executed this order with alacrity and zeal He hit Gaspar Ruiz
      whose movements were slow over his head and shoulders Gaspar Ruiz stood
      still for a moment under the shower of blows biting his lip thoughtfully
      as if absorbed by a perplexing mental processmdashthen followed the
      others without haste The door was locked and the adjutant carried off
      the key
    p
    p
      By noon the heat of that vaulted place crammed to suffocation had become
      unbearable The prisoners crowded towards the window begging their guards
      for a drop of water but the soldiers remained lying in indolent attitudes
      wherever there was a little shade under a wall while the sentry sat with
      his back against the door smoking a cigarette and raising his eyebrows
      philosophically from time to time Gaspar Ruiz had pushed his way to the
      window with irresistible force His capacious chest needed more air than
      the others his big face resting with its chin on the ledge pressed
      close to the bars seemed to support the other faces crowding up for
      breath From moaned entreaties they had passed to desperate cries and the
      tumultuous howling of those thirsty men obliged a young officer who was
      just then crossing the courtyard to shout in order to make himself heard
    p
    p
      ldquoWhy donrsquot you give some water to these prisonersrdquo
     p
    p
      The sergeant with an air of surprised innocence excused himself by the
      remark that all those men were condemned to die in a very few hours
    p
    p
      Lieutenant Santierra stamped his foot ldquoThey are condemned to death not
      to torturerdquo he shouted ldquoGive them some water at oncerdquo
     p
    p
      Impressed by this appearance of anger the soldiers bestirred themselves
      and the sentry snatching up his musket stood to attention
    p
    p
      But when a couple of buckets were found and filled from the well it was
      discovered that they could not be passed through the bars which were set
      too close At the prospect of quenching their thirst the shrieks of those
      trampled down in the struggle to get near the opening became very
      heartrending But when the soldiers who had lifted the buckets towards the
      window put them to the ground again helplessly the yell of disappointment
      was still more terrible
    p
    p
      The soldiers of the army of Independence were not equipped with canteens
      A small tin cup was found but its approach to the opening caused such a
      commotion such yells of rage and pain in the vague mass of limbs behind
      the straining faces at the window that Lieutenant Santierra cried out
      hurriedly ldquoNo nomdashyou must open the door sergeantrdquo
     p
    p
      The sergeant shrugging his shoulders explained that he had no right to
      open the door even if he had had the key But he had not the key The
      adjutant of the garrison kept the key Those men were giving much
      unnecessary trouble since they had to die at sunset in any case Why they
      had not been shot at once early in the morning he could not understand
    p
    p
      Lieutenant Santierra kept his back studiously to the window It was at his
      earnest solicitations that the Commandante had delayed the execution This
      favour had been granted to him in consideration of his distinguished
      family and of his fatherrsquos high position amongst the chiefs of the
      Republican party Lieutenant Santierra believed that the General
      commanding would visit the fort some time in the afternoon and he
      ingenuously hoped that his naive intercession would induce that severe man
      to pardon some at least of those criminals In the revulsion of his
      feeling his interference stood revealed now as guilty and futile meddling
      It appeared to him obvious that the general would never even consent to
      listen to his petition He could never save those men and he had only
      made himself responsible for the sufferings added to the cruelty of their
      fate
    p
    p
      ldquoThen go at once and get the key from the adjutantrdquo said Lieutenant
      Santierra
    p
    p
      The sergeant shook his head with a sort of bashful smile while his eyes
      glanced sideways at Gaspar Ruizrsquos face motionless and silent staring
      through the bars at the bottom of a heap of other haggard distorted
      yelling faces
    p
    p
      His worship the adjutant de Plaza the sergeant murmured was having his
      siesta and supposing that he the sergeant would be allowed access to
      him the only result he expected would be to have his soul flogged out of
      his body for presuming to disturb his worshiprsquos repose He made a
      deprecatory movement with his hands and stood stockstill looking down
      modestly upon his brown toes
    p
    p
      Lieutenant Santierra glared with indignation but hesitated His handsome
      oval face as smooth as a girlrsquos flushed with the shame of his
      perplexity Its nature humiliated his spirit His hairless upper lip
      trembled he seemed on the point of either bursting into a fit of rage or
      into tears of dismay
    p
    p
      Fifty years later General Santierra the venerable relic of revolutionary
      times was well able to remember the feelings of the young lieutenant
      Since he had given up riding altogether and found it difficult to walk
      beyond the limits of his garden the generalrsquos greatest delight was to
      entertain in his house the officers of the foreign menofwar visiting the
      harbour For Englishmen he had a preference as for old companions in
      arms English naval men of all ranks accepted his hospitality with
      curiosity because he had known Lord Cochrane and had taken part on board
      the patriot squadron commanded by that marvellous seaman in the cutting
      out and blockading operations before Callaomdashan episode of unalloyed
      glory in the wars of Independence and of endless honour in the fighting
      tradition of Englishmen He was a fair linguist this ancient survivor of
      the Liberating armies A trick of smoothing his long white beard whenever
      he was short of a word in French or English imparted an air of leisurely
      dignity to the tone of his reminiscences

      ldquoYes my friendsrdquo he used to say to his guests ldquowhat would you have A
      youth of seventeen summers without worldly experience and owing my rank
      only to the glorious patriotism of my father may God rest his soul I
      suffered immense humiliation not so much from the disobedience of that
      subordinate who after all was responsible for those prisoners but I
      suffered because like the boy I was I myself dreaded going to the
      adjutant for the key I had felt before his rough and cutting tongue
      Being quite a common fellow with no merit except his savage valour he
      made me feel his contempt and dislike from the first day I joined my
      battalion in garrison at the fort It was only a fortnight before I would
      have confronted him sword in hand but I shrank from the mocking brutality
      of his sneers
    p
    p
      ldquoI donrsquot remember having been so miserable in my life before or since The
      torment of my sensibility was so great that I wished the sergeant to fall
      dead at my feet and the stupid soldiers who stared at me to turn into
      corpses and even those wretches for whom my entreaties had procured a
      reprieve I wished dead also because I could not face them without shame
      A mephitic heat like a whiff of air from hell came out of that dark place
      in which they were confined Those at the window who had heard what was
      going on jeered at me in very desperation one of these fellows gone mad
      no doubt kept on urging me volubly to order the soldiers to fire through
      the window His insane loquacity made my heart turn faint And my feet
      were like lead There was no higher officer to whom I could appeal I had
      not even the firmness of spirit to simply go away
    p
    p
      ldquoBenumbed by my remorse I stood with my back to the window You must not
      suppose that all this lasted a long time How long could it have been A
      minute If you measured by mental suffering it was like a hundred years a
      longer time than all my life has been since No certainly it was not so
      much as a minute The hoarse screaming of those miserable wretches died
      out in their dry throats and then suddenly a voice spoke a deep voice
      muttering calmly It called upon me to turn round
    p
    p
      ldquoThat voice senores proceeded from the head of Gaspar Ruiz Of his body
      I could see nothing Some of his fellowcaptives had clambered upon his
      back He was holding them up His eyes blinked without looking at me That
      and the moving of his lips was all he seemed able to manage in his
      overloaded state And when I turned round this head that seemed more
      than human size resting on its chin under a multitude of other heads
      asked me whether I really desired to quench the thirst of the captives
    p
    p
      ldquoI said lsquoYes yesrsquo eagerly and came up quite close to the window I was
      like a child and did not know what would happen I was anxious to be
      comforted in my helplessness and remorse
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoHave you the authority Senor teniente to release my wrists from their
      bondsrsquo Gaspar Ruizrsquos head asked me
    p
    p
      ldquoHis features expressed no anxiety no hope his heavy eyelids blinked
      upon his eyes that looked past me straight into the courtyard
    p
    p
      ldquoAs if in an ugly dream I spoke stammering lsquoWhat do you mean And how
      can I reach the bonds on your wristsrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoI will try what I can dorsquo he said and then that large staring head
      moved at last and all the wild faces piled up in that window disappeared
      tumbling down He had shaken his load off with one movement so strong he
      was
    p
    p
      ldquoAnd he had not only shaken it off but he got free of the crush and
      vanished from my sight For a moment there was no one at all to be seen at
      the window He had swung about butting and shouldering clearing a space
      for himself in the only way he could do it with his hands tied behind his
      back
    p
    p
      ldquoFinally backing to the opening he pushed out to me between the bars his
      wrists lashed with many turns of rope His hands very swollen with
      knotted veins looked enormous and unwieldy I saw his bent back It was
      very broad His voice was like the muttering of a bull
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoCut Senor teniente Cutrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoI drew my sword my new unblunted sword that had seen no service as yet
      and severed the many turns of the hide rope I did this without knowing
      the why and the wherefore of my action but as it were compelled by my
      faith in that man The sergeant made as if to cry out but astonishment
      deprived him of his voice and he remained standing with his mouth open as
      if overtaken by sudden imbecility
    p
    p
      ldquoI sheathed my sword and faced the soldiers An air of awestruck
      expectation had replaced their usual listless apathy I heard the voice of
      Gaspar Ruiz shouting inside but the words I could not make out plainly I
      suppose that to see him with his arms free augmented the influence of his
      strength I mean by this the spiritual influence that with ignorant
      people attaches to an exceptional degree of bodily vigour In fact he was
      no more to be feared than before on account of the numbness of his arms
      and hands which lasted for some time
    p
    p
      ldquoThe sergeant had recovered his power of speech lsquoBy all the saintsrsquo he
      cried lsquowe shall have to get a cavalry man with a lasso to secure him
      again if he is to be led to the place of execution Nothing less than a
      good enlazador on a good horse can subdue him Your worship was pleased to
      perform a very mad thingrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoI had nothing to say I was surprised myself and I felt a childish
      curiosity to see what would happen next But the sergeant was thinking of
      the difficulty of controlling Gaspar Ruiz when the time for making an
      example would come
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoOr perhapsrsquo the sergeant pursued vexedly lsquowe shall be obliged to
      shoot him down as he dashes out when the door is openedrsquo He was going to
      give further vent to his anxieties as to the proper carrying out of the
      sentence but he interrupted himself with a sudden exclamation snatched a
      musket from a soldier and stood watchful with his eyes fixed on the
      windowrdquo
     p
    p
      IV
    p
    p
      ldquoGaspar Ruiz had clambered up on the sill and sat down there with his
      feet against the thickness of the wall and his knees slightly bent The
      window was not quite broad enough for the length of his legs It appeared
      to my crestfallen perception that he meant to keep the window all to
      himself He seemed to be taking up a comfortable position Nobody inside
      dared to approach him now he could strike with his hands
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoPor Diosrsquo I heard the sergeant muttering at my elbow lsquoI shall shoot
      him through the head now and get rid of that trouble He is a condemned
      manrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoAt that I looked at him angrily lsquoThe general has not confirmed the
      sentencersquo I saidmdashthough I knew well in my heart that these were but
      vain words The sentence required no confirmation lsquoYou have no right to
      shoot him unless he tries to escapersquo I added firmly
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoBut sangre de Diosrsquo the sergeant yelled out bringing his musket up to
      the shoulder lsquohe is escaping now Lookrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoBut I as if that Gaspar Ruiz had cast a spell upon me struck the musket
      upward and the bullet flew over the roofs somewhere The sergeant dashed
      his arm to the ground and stared He might have commanded the soldiers to
      fire but he did not And if he had he would not have been obeyed I
      think just then
    p
    p
      ldquoWith his feet against the thickness of the wall and his hairy hands
      grasping the iron bar Gaspar sat still It was an attitude Nothing
      happened for a time And suddenly it dawned upon us that he was
      straightening his bowed back and contracting his arms His lips were
      twisted into a snarl Next thing we perceived was that the bar of forged
      iron was being bent slowly by the mightiness of his pull The sun was
      beating full upon his cramped unquivering figure A shower of sweatdrops
      burst out of his forehead Watching the bar grow crooked I saw a little
      blood ooze from under his fingernails Then he let go For a moment he
      remained all huddled up with a hanging head looking drowsily into the
      upturned palms of his mighty hands Indeed he seemed to have dozed off
      Suddenly he flung himself backwards on the sill and setting the soles of
      his bare feet against the other middle bar he bent that one too but in
      the opposite direction from the first
    p
    p
      ldquoSuch was his strength which in this case relieved my painful feelings
      And the man seemed to have done nothing Except for the change of position
      in order to use his feet which made us all start by its swiftness my
      recollection is that of immobility But he had bent the bars wide apart
      And now he could get out if he liked but he dropped his legs inwards and
      looking over his shoulder beckoned to the soldiers lsquoHand up the waterrsquo 
      he said lsquoI will give them all a drinkrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoHe was obeyed For a moment I expected man and bucket to disappear
      overwhelmed by the rush of eagerness I thought they would pull him down
      with their teeth There was a rush but holding the bucket on his lap he
      repulsed the assault of those wretches by the mere swinging of his feet
      They flew backwards at every kick yelling with pain and the soldiers
      laughed gazing at the window
    p
    p
      ldquoThey all laughed holding their sides except the sergeant who was
      gloomy and morose He was afraid the prisoners would rise and break outmdashwhich
      would have been a bad example But there was no fear of that and I stood
      myself before the window with my drawn sword When sufficiently tamed by
      the strength of Gaspar Ruiz they came up one by one stretching their
      necks and presenting their lips to the edge of the bucket which the strong
      man tilted towards them from his knees with an extraordinary air of
      charity gentleness and compassion That benevolent appearance was of
      course the effect of his care in not spilling the water and of his
      attitude as he sat on the sill for if a man lingered with his lips glued
      to the rim of the bucket after Gaspar Ruiz had said lsquoYou have had enoughrsquo 
      there would be no tenderness or mercy in the shove of the foot which would
      send him groaning and doubled up far into the interior of the prison
      where he would knock down two or three others before he fell himself They
      came up to him again and again it looked as if they meant to drink the
      well dry before going to their death but the soldiers were so amused by
      Gaspar Ruizrsquos systematic proceedings that they carried the water up to the
      window cheerfully
    p
    p
      ldquoWhen the adjutant came out after his siesta there was some trouble over
      this affair I can assure you And the worst of it was that the general
      whom we expected never came to the castle that dayrdquo
     p
    p
      The guests of General Santierra unanimously expressed their regret that
      the man of such strength and patience had not been saved
    p
    p
      ldquoHe was not saved by my interferencerdquo said the General ldquoThe prisoners
      were led to execution half an hour before sunset Gaspar Ruiz contrary to
      the sergeantrsquos apprehensions gave no trouble There was no necessity to
      get a cavalry man with a lasso in order to subdue him as if he were a
      wild bull of the campo I believe he marched out with his arms free
      amongst the others who were bound I did not see I was not there I had
      been put under arrest for interfering with the prisonerrsquos guard About
      dusk sitting dismally in my quarters I heard three volleys fired and
      thought that I should never hear of Gaspar Ruiz again He fell with the
      others But we were to hear of him nevertheless though the sergeant
      boasted that as he lay on his face expiring or dead in the heap of the
      slain he had slashed his neck with a sword He had done this he said to
      make sure of ridding the world of a dangerous traitor
    p
    p
      ldquoI confess to you senores that I thought of that strong man with a sort
      of gratitude and with some admiration He had used his strength
      honourably There dwelt then in his soul no fierceness corresponding to
      the vigour of his bodyrdquo
     p
    p
      V
    p
    p
      Gaspar Ruiz who could with ease bend apart the heavy iron bars of the
      prison was led out with others to summary execution ldquoEvery bullet has
      its billetrdquo runs the proverb All the merit of proverbs consists in the
      concise and picturesque expression In the surprise of our minds is found
      their persuasiveness In other words we are struck and convinced by the
      shock
    p
    p
      What surprises us is the form not the substance Proverbs are artmdashcheap
      art As a general rule they are not true unless indeed they happen to be
      mere platitudes as for instance the proverb ldquoHalf a loaf is better than
      no breadrdquo or ldquoA miss is as good as a milerdquo Some proverbs are simply
      imbecile others are immoral That one evolved out of the naive heart of
      the great Russian people ldquoMan discharges the piece but God carries the
      bulletrdquo is piously atrocious and at bitter variance with the accepted
      conception of a compassionate God It would indeed be an inconsistent
      occupation for the Guardian of the poor the innocent and the helpless
      to carry the bullet for instance into the heart of a father
    p
    p
      Gaspar Ruiz was childless he had no wife he had never been in love He
      had hardly ever spoken to a woman beyond his mother and the ancient
      negress of the household whose wrinkled skin was the colour of cinders
      and whose lean body was bent double from age If some bullets from those
      muskets fired off at fifteen paces were specifically destined for the
      heart of Gaspar Ruiz they all missed their billet One however carried
      away a small piece of his ear and another a fragment of flesh from his
      shoulder
    p
    p
      A red and unclouded sun setting into a purple ocean looked with a fiery
      stare upon the enormous wall of the Cordilleras worthy witnesses of his
      glorious extinction But it is inconceivable that it should have seen the
      antlike men busy with their absurd and insignificant trials of killing
      and dying for reasons that apart from being generally childish were also
      imperfectly understood It did light up however the backs of the firing
      party and the faces of the condemned men Some of them had fallen on their
      knees others remained standing a few averted their heads from the
      levelled barrels of muskets Gaspar Ruiz upright the burliest of them
      all hung his big shock head The low sun dazzled him a little and he
      counted himself a dead man already
    p
    p
      He fell at the first discharge He fell because he thought he was a dead
      man He struck the ground heavily The jar of the fall surprised him ldquoI
      am not dead apparentlyrdquo he thought to himself when he heard the
      execution platoon reloading its arms at the word of command It was then
      that the hope of escape dawned upon him for the first time He remained
      lying stretched out with rigid limbs under the weight of two bodies
      collapsed crosswise upon his back
    p
    p
      By the time the soldiers had fired a third volley into the slightly
      stirring heaps of the slain the sun had gone out of sight and almost
      immediately with the darkening of the ocean dusk fell upon the coasts of
      the young Republic Above the gloom of the lowlands the snowy peaks of the
      Cordilleras remained luminous and crimson for a long time The soldiers
      before marching back to the fort sat down to smoke
    p
    p
      The sergeant with a naked sword in his hand strolled away by himself along
      the heap of the dead He was a humane man and watched for any stir or
      twitch of limb in the merciful idea of plunging the point of his blade
      into any body giving the slightest sign of life But none of the bodies
      afforded him an opportunity for the display of this charitable intention
      Not a muscle twitched amongst them not even the powerful muscles of
      Gaspar Ruiz who deluged with the blood of his neighbours and shamming
      death strove to appear more lifeless than the others
    p
    p
      He was lying face down The sergeant recognized him by his stature and
      being himself a very small man looked with envy and contempt at the
      prostration of so much strength He had always disliked that particular
      soldier Moved by an obscure animosity he inflicted a long gash across
      the neck of Gaspar Ruiz with some vague notion of making sure of that
      strong manrsquos death as if a powerful physique were more able to resist the
      bullets For the sergeant had no doubt that Gaspar Ruiz had been shot
      through in many places Then he passed on and shortly afterwards marched
      off with his men leaving the bodies to the care of crows and vultures
    p
    p
      Gaspar Ruiz had restrained a cry though it had seemed to him that his
      head was cut off at a blow and when darkness came shaking off the dead
      whose weight had oppressed him he crawled away over the plain on his
      hands and knees After drinking deeply like a wounded beast at a shallow
      stream he assumed an upright posture and staggered on lightheaded and
      aimless as if lost amongst the stars of the clear night A small house
      seemed to rise out of the ground before him He stumbled into the porch
      and struck at the door with his fist There was not a gleam of light
      Gaspar Ruiz might have thought that the inhabitants had fled from it as
      from many others in the neighbourhood had it not been for the shouts of
      abuse that answered his thumping In his feverish and enfeebled state the
      angry screaming seemed to him part of a hallucination belonging to the
      weird dreamlike feeling of his unexpected condemnation to death of the
      thirst suffered of the volleys fired at him within fifteen paces of his
      head being cut off at a blow ldquoOpen the doorrdquo he cried ldquoOpen in the name
      of Godrdquo
     p
    p
      An infuriated voice from within jeered at him ldquoCome in come in This
      house belongs to you All this land belongs to you Come and take itrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoFor the love of Godrdquo Gaspar Ruiz murmured
    p
    p
      ldquoDoes not all the land belong to you patriotsrdquo the voice on the other
      side of the door screamed on ldquoAre you not a patriotrdquo
     p
    p
      Gaspar Ruiz did not know ldquoI am a wounded manrdquo he said apathetically
    p
    p
      All became still inside Gaspar Ruiz lost the hope of being admitted and
      lay down under the porch just outside the door He was utterly careless of
      what was going to happen to him All his consciousness seemed to be
      concentrated in his neck where he felt a severe pain His indifference as
      to his fate was genuine The day was breaking when he awoke from a
      feverish doze the door at which he had knocked in the dark stood wide
      open now and a girl steadying herself with her outspread arms leaned
      over the threshold Lying on his back he stared up at her Her face was
      pale and her eyes were very dark her hair hung down black as ebony
      against her white cheeks her lips were full and red Beyond her he saw
      another head with long grey hair and a thin old face with a pair of
      anxiously clasped hands under the chin

      ldquoI knew those people by sightrdquo General Santierra would tell his guests at
      the diningtable ldquoI mean the people with whom Gaspar Ruiz found shelter
      The father was an old Spaniard a man of property ruined by the
      revolution His estates his house in town his money everything he had
      in the world had been confiscated by proclamation for he was a bitter foe
      of our independence From a position of great dignity and influence on the
      Viceroyrsquos Council he became of less importance than his own negro slaves
      made free by our glorious revolution He had not even the means to flee
      the country as other Spaniards had managed to do It may be that
      wandering ruined and houseless and burdened with nothing but his life
      which was left to him by the clemency of the Provisional Government he
      had simply walked under that broken roof of old tiles It was a lonely
      spot There did not seem to be even a dog belonging to the place But
      though the roof had holes as if a cannonball or two had dropped through
      it the wooden shutters were thick and tightclosed all the time
    p
    p
      ldquoMy way took me frequently along the path in front of that miserable
      rancho I rode from the fort to the town almost every evening to sigh at
      the window of a lady I was in love with then When one is young you
      understand    She was a good patriot you may believe Caballeros
      credit me or not political feeling ran so high in those days that I do
      not believe I could have been fascinated by the charms of a woman of
      Royalist opinions   rdquo
     p
    p
      Murmurs of amused incredulity all round the table interrupted the General
      and while they lasted he stroked his white beard gravely
    p
    p
      ldquoSenoresrdquo he protested ldquoa Royalist was a monster to our overwrought
      feelings I am telling you this in order not to be suspected of the
      slightest tenderness towards that old Royalistrsquos daughter Moreover as
      you know my affections were engaged elsewhere But I could not help
      noticing her on rare occasions when with the front door open she stood in
      the porch
    p
    p
      ldquoYou must know that this old Royalist was as crazy as a man can be His
      political misfortunes his total downfall and ruin had disordered his
      mind To show his contempt for what we patriots could do he affected to
      laugh at his imprisonment at the confiscation of his lands the burning
      of his houses and at the misery to which he and his womenfolk were
      reduced This habit of laughing had grown upon him so that he would begin
      to laugh and shout directly he caught sight of any stranger That was the
      form of his madness
    p
    p
      ldquoI of course disregarded the noise of that madman with that feeling of
      superiority the success of our cause inspired in us Americans I suppose I
      really despised him because he was an old Castilian a Spaniard born and
      a Royalist Those were certainly no reasons to scorn a man but for
      centuries Spaniards born had shown their contempt of us Americans men as
      well descended as themselves simply because we were what they called
      colonists We had been kept in abasement and made to feel our inferiority
      in social intercourse And now it was our turn It was safe for us
      patriots to display the same sentiments and I being a young patriot son
      of a patriot despised that old Spaniard and despising him I naturally
      disregarded his abuse though it was annoying to my feelings Others
      perhaps would not have been so forbearing
    p
    p
      ldquoHe would begin with a great yellmdashlsquoI see a patriot Another of
      themrsquo long before I came abreast of the house The tone of his senseless
      revilings mingled with bursts of laughter was sometimes piercingly
      shrill and sometimes grave It was all very mad but I felt it incumbent
      upon my dignity to check my horse to a walk without even glancing towards
      the house as if that manrsquos abusive clamour in the porch were less than
      the barking of a cur Always I rode by preserving an expression of haughty
      indifference on my face
    p
    p
      ldquoIt was no doubt very dignified but I should have done better if I had
      kept my eyes open A military man in war time should never consider
      himself off duty and especially so if the war is a revolutionary war
      when the enemy is not at the door but within your very house At such
      times the heat of passionate convictions passing into hatred removes the
      restraints of honour and humanity from many men and of delicacy and fear
      from some women These last when once they throw off the timidity and
      reserve of their sex become by the vivacity of their intelligence and the
      violence of their merciless resentment more dangerous than so many armed
      giantsrdquo
     p
    p
      The Generalrsquos voice rose but his big hand stroked his white beard twice
      with an effect of venerable calmness ldquoSi Senores Women are ready to
      rise to the heights of devotion unattainable by us men or to sink into
      the depths of abasement which amazes our masculine prejudices I am
      speaking now of exceptional women you understand   rdquo

    p
      Here one of the guests observed that he had never met a woman yet who was
      not capable of turning out quite exceptional under circumstances that
      would engage her feelings strongly ldquoThat sort of superiority in
      recklessness they have over usrdquo he concluded ldquomakes of them the more
      interesting half of mankindrdquo
     p
    p
      The General who bore the interruption with gravity nodded courteous
      assent ldquoSi Si Under circumstances    Precisely They can do an
      infinite deal of mischief sometimes in quite unexpected ways For who
      could have imagined that a young girl daughter of a ruined Royalist whose
      life was held only by the contempt of his enemies would have had the
      power to bring death and devastation upon two flourishing provinces and
      cause serious anxiety to the leaders of the revolution in the very hour of
      its successrdquo He paused to let the wonder of it penetrate our minds
    p
    p
      ldquoDeath and devastationrdquo somebody murmured in surprise ldquohow shockingrdquo
     p
    p
      The old General gave a glance in the direction of the murmur and went on
      ldquoYes That is warmdashcalamity But the means by which she obtained the
      power to work this havoc on our southern frontier seem to me who have
      seen her and spoken to her still more shocking That particular thing
      left on my mind a dreadful amazement which the further experience of life
      of more than fifty years has done nothing to diminishrdquo He looked round
      as if to make sure of our attention and in a changed voice ldquoI am as
      you know a republican son of a Liberatorrdquo he declared ldquoMy incomparable
      mother God rest her soul was a Frenchwoman the daughter of an ardent
      republican As a boy I fought for liberty Irsquove always believed in the
      equality of men and as to their brotherhood that to my mind is even
      more certain Look at the fierce animosity they display in their
      differences And what in the world do you know that is more bitterly
      fierce than brothersrsquo quarrelsrdquo
     p
    p
      All absence of cynicism checked an inclination to smile at this view of
      human brotherhood On the contrary there was in the tone the melancholy
      natural to a man profoundly humane at heart who from duty from
      conviction and from necessity had played his part in scenes of ruthless
      violence
    p
    p
      The General had seen much of fratricidal strife ldquoCertainly There is no
      doubt of their brotherhoodrdquo he insisted ldquoAll men are brothers and as
      such know almost too much of each other Butrdquomdashand here in the old
      patriarchal head white as silver the black eyes humorously twinkledmdashldquoif
      we are all brothers all the women are not our sistersrdquo
     p
    p
      One of the younger guests was heard murmuring his satisfaction at the
      fact But the General continued with deliberate earnestness ldquoThey are so
      different The tale of a king who took a beggarmaid for a partner of his
      throne may be pretty enough as we men look upon ourselves and upon love
      But that a young girl famous for her haughty beauty and only a short
      time before the admired of all at the balls in the Viceroyrsquos palace
      should take by the hand a guasso a common peasant is intolerable to our
      sentiment of women and their love It is madness Nevertheless it
      happened But it must be said that in her case it was the madness of hatemdashnot
      of loverdquo
     p
    p
      After presenting this excuse in a spirit of chivalrous justice the
      General remained silent for a time ldquoI rode past the house every day
      almostrdquo he began again ldquoand this was what was going on within But how
      it was going on no mind of man can conceive Her desperation must have
      been extreme and Gaspar Ruiz was a docile fellow He had been an obedient
      soldier His strength was like an enormous stone lying on the ground
      ready to be hurled this way or that by the hand that picks it up
    p
    p
      ldquoIt is clear that he would tell his story to the people who gave him the
      shelter he needed And he needed assistance badly His wound was not
      dangerous but his life was forfeited The old Royalist being wrapped up
      in his laughing madness the two women arranged a hidingplace for the
      wounded man in one of the huts amongst the fruit trees at the back of the
      house That hovel an abundance of clear water while the fever was on him
      and some words of pity were all they could give I suppose he had a share
      of what food there was And it would be but little a handful of roasted
      corn perhaps a dish of beans or a piece of bread with a few figs To
      such misery were those proud and once wealthy people reducedrdquo
     p
    p
      VII
    p
    p
      General Santierra was right in his surmise Such was the exact nature of
      the assistance which Gaspar Ruiz peasant son of peasants received from
      the Royalist family whose daughter had opened the door of their miserable
      refuge to his extreme distress Her sombre resolution ruled the madness of
      her father and the trembling bewilderment of her mother
    p
    p
      She had asked the strange man on the doorstep ldquoWho wounded yourdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoThe soldiers senorardquo Gaspar Ruiz had answered in a faint voice
    p
    p
      ldquoPatriotsrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoSirdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoWhat forrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoDeserterrdquo he gasped leaning against the wall under the scrutiny of her
      black eyes ldquoI was left for dead over thererdquo
     p
    p
      She led him through the house out to a small hut of clay and reeds lost
      in the long grass of the overgrown orchard He sank on a heap of maize
      straw in a corner and sighed profoundly
    p
    p
      ldquoNo one will look for you hererdquo she said looking down at him ldquoNobody
      comes near us We too have been left for deadmdashhererdquo
     p
    p
      He stirred uneasily on his heap of dirty straw and the pain in his neck
      made him groan deliriously
    p
    p
      ldquoI shall show Estaban some day that I am alive yetrdquo he mumbled
    p
    p
      He accepted her assistance in silence and the many days of pain went by
      Her appearances in the hut brought him relief and became connected with
      the feverish dreams of angels which visited his couch for Gaspar Ruiz was
      instructed in the mysteries of his religion and had even been taught to
      read and write a little by the priest of his village He waited for her
      with impatience and saw her pass out of the dark hut and disappear in the
      brilliant sunshine with poignant regret He discovered that while he lay
      there feeling so very weak he could by closing his eyes evoke her face
      with considerable distinctness And this discovered faculty charmed the
      long solitary hours of his convalescence Later on when he began to
      regain his strength he would creep at dusk from his hut to the house and
      sit on the step of the garden door
    p
    p
      In one of the rooms the mad father paced to and fro muttering to himself
      with short abrupt laughs In the passage sitting on a stool the mother
      sighed and moaned The daughter in rough threadbare clothing and her
      white haggard face half hidden by a coarse manta stood leaning against
      the side of the door Gaspar Ruiz with his elbows propped on his knees
      and his head resting in his hands talked to the two women in an
      undertone
    p
    p
      The common misery of destitution would have made a bitter mockery of a
      marked insistence on social differences Gaspar Ruiz understood this in
      his simplicity From his captivity amongst the Royalists he could give
      them news of people they knew He described their appearance and when he
      related the story of the battle in which he was recaptured the two women
      lamented the blow to their cause and the ruin of their secret hopes
    p
    p
      He had no feeling either way But he felt a great devotion for that young
      girl In his desire to appear worthy of her condescension he boasted a
      little of his bodily strength He had nothing else to boast of Because of
      that quality his comrades treated him with as great a deference he
      explained as though he had been a sergeant both in camp and in battle
    p
    p
      ldquoI could always get as many as I wanted to follow me anywhere senorita I
      ought to have been made an officer because I can read and writerdquo
     p
    p
      Behind him the silent old lady fetched a moaning sigh from time to time
      the distracted father muttered to himself pacing the sala and Gaspar
      Ruiz would raise his eyes now and then to look at the daughter of these
      people
    p
    p
      He would look at her with curiosity because she was alive and also with
      that feeling of familiarity and awe with which he had contemplated in
      churches the inanimate and powerful statues of the saints whose
      protection is invoked in dangers and difficulties His difficulty was very
      great
    p
    p
      He could not remain hiding in an orchard for ever and ever He knew also
      very well that before he had gone half a dayrsquos journey in any direction
      he would be picked up by one of the cavalry patrols scouring the country
      and brought into one or another of the camps where the patriot army
      destined for the liberation of Peru was collected There he would in the
      end be recognized as Gaspar Ruizmdashthe deserter to the Royalistsmdashand
      no doubt shot very effectually this time There did not seem any place in
      the world for the innocent Gaspar Ruiz anywhere And at this thought his
      simple soul surrendered itself to gloom and resentment as black as night
    p
    p
      They had made him a soldier forcibly He did not mind being a soldier And
      he had been a good soldier as he had been a good son because of his
      docility and his strength But now there was no use for either They had
      taken him from his parents and he could no longer be a soldiermdashnot
      a good soldier at any rate Nobody would listen to his explanations What
      injustice it was What injustice
    p
    p
      And in a mournful murmur he would go over the story of his capture and
      recapture for the twentieth time Then raising his eyes to the silent
      girl in the doorway ldquoSi senoritardquo he would say with a deep sigh
      ldquoinjustice has made this poor breath in my body quite worthless to me and
      to anybody else And I do not care who robs me of itrdquo
     p
    p
      One evening as he exhaled thus the plaint of his wounded soul she
      condescended to say that if she were a man she would consider no life
      worthless which held the possibility of revenge
    p
    p
      She seemed to be speaking to herself Her voice was low He drank in the
      gentle as if dreamy sound with a consciousness of peculiar delight of
      something warming his breast like a draught of generous wine
    p
    p
      ldquoTrue Senoritardquo he said raising his face up to hers slowly ldquothere is
      Estaban who must be shown that I am not dead after allrdquo
     p
    p
      The mutterings of the mad father had ceased long before the sighing
      mother had withdrawn somewhere into one of the empty rooms All was still
      within as well as without in the moonlight bright as day on the wild
      orchard full of inky shadows Gaspar Ruiz saw the dark eyes of Dona
      Erminia look down at him
    p
    p
      ldquoAh The sergeantrdquo she muttered disdainfully
    p
    p
      ldquoWhy He has wounded me with his swordrdquo he protested bewildered by the
      contempt that seemed to shine livid on her pale face
    p
    p
      She crushed him with her glance The power of her will to be understood
      was so strong that it kindled in him the intelligence of unexpressed
      things
    p
    p
      ldquoWhat else did you expect me to dordquo he cried as if suddenly driven to
      despair ldquoHave I the power to do more Am I a general with an army at my
      backmdashmiserable sinner that I am to be despised by you at lastrdquo
     p
    p
      VIII
    p
    p
      ldquoSenoresrdquo related the General to his guests ldquothough my thoughts were of
      love then and therefore enchanting the sight of that house always
      affected me disagreeably especially in the moonlight when its close
      shutters and its air of lonely neglect appeared sinister Still I went on
      using the bridlepath by the ravine because it was a short cut The mad
      Royalist howled and laughed at me every evening to his complete
      satisfaction but after a time as if wearied with my indifference he
      ceased to appear in the porch How they persuaded him to leave off I do
      not know However with Gaspar Ruiz in the house there would have been no
      difficulty in restraining him by force It was now part of their policy in
      there to avoid anything which could provoke me At least so I suppose
    p
    p
      ldquoNotwithstanding my infatuation with the brightest pair of eyes in Chile
      I noticed the absence of the old man after a week or so A few more days
      passed I began to think that perhaps these Royalists had gone away
      somewhere else But one evening as I was hastening towards the city I
      saw again somebody in the porch It was not the madman it was the girl
      She stood holding on to one of the wooden columns tall and whitefaced
      her big eyes sunk deep with privation and sorrow I looked hard at her
      and she met my stare with a strange inquisitive look Then as I turned
      my head after riding past she seemed to gather courage for the act and
      absolutely beckoned me back
    p
    p
      ldquoI obeyed senores almost without thinking so great was my astonishment
      It was greater still when I heard what she had to say She began by
      thanking me for my forbearance of her fatherrsquos infirmity so that I felt
      ashamed of myself I had meant to show disdain not forbearance Every
      word must have burnt her lips but she never departed from a gentle and
      melancholy dignity which filled me with respect against my will Senores
      we are no match for women But I could hardly believe my ears when she
      began her tale Providence she concluded seemed to have preserved the
      life of that wronged soldier who now trusted to my honour as a caballero
      and to my compassion for his sufferings
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoWronged manrsquo I observed coldly lsquoWell I think so too and you have
      been harbouring an enemy of your causersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoHe was a poor Christian crying for help at our door in the name of God
      senorrsquo she answered simply
    p
    p
      ldquoI began to admire her lsquoWhere is he nowrsquo I asked stiffly
    p
    p
      ldquoBut she would not answer that question With extreme cunning and an
      almost fiendish delicacy she managed to remind me of my failure in saving
      the lives of the prisoners in the guardroom without wounding my pride
      She knew of course the whole story Gaspar Ruiz she said entreated me
      to procure for him a safeconduct from General San Martin himself He had
      an important communication to make to the commanderinchief
    p
    p
      ldquoPor Dios senores she made me swallow all that pretending to be only
      the mouthpiece of that poor man Overcome by injustice he expected to
      find she said as much generosity in me as had been shown to him by the
      Royalist family which had given him a refuge
    p
    p
      ldquoHa It was well and nobly said to a youngster like me I thought her
      great Alas she was only implacable
    p
    p
      ldquoIn the end I rode away very enthusiastic about the business without
      demanding even to see Gaspar Ruiz who I was confident was in the house
    p
    p
      ldquoBut on calm reflection I began to see some difficulties which I had not
      confidence enough in myself to encounter It was not easy to approach a
      commanderinchief with such a story I feared failure At last I thought
      it better to lay the matter before my generalofdivision Robles a
      friend of my family who had appointed me his aidedecamp lately
    p
    p
      ldquoHe took it out of my hands at once without any ceremony
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoIn the house of course he is in the housersquo he said contemptuously
      lsquoYou ought to have gone sword in hand inside and demanded his surrender
      instead of chatting with a Royalist girl in the porch Those people should
      have been hunted out of that long ago Who knows how many spies they have
      harboured right in the very midst of our camps A safeconduct from the
      CommanderinChief The audacity of the fellow Ha ha Now we shall catch
      him tonight and then we shall find out without any safeconduct what
      he has got to say that is so very important Ha ha harsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoGeneral Robles peace to his soul was a short thick man with round
      staring eyes fierce and jovial Seeing my distress he added
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoCome come chico I promise you his life if he does not resist And
      that is not likely We are not going to break up a good soldier if it can
      be helped I tell you what I am curious to see your strong man Nothing
      but a general will do for the picaromdashwell he shall have a general
      to talk to Ha ha I shall go myself to the catching and you are coming
      with me of coursersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoAnd it was done that same night Early in the evening the house and the
      orchard were surrounded quietly Later on the General and I left a ball we
      were attending in town and rode out at an easy gallop At some little
      distance from the house we pulled up A mounted orderly held our horses A
      low whistle warned the men watching all along the ravine and we walked up
      to the porch softly The barricaded house in the moonlight seemed empty
    p
    p
      ldquoThe General knocked at the door After a time a womanrsquos voice within
      asked who was there My chief nudged me hard I gasped
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoIt is I Lieutenant Santierrarsquo I stammered out as if choked lsquoOpen the
      doorrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoIt came open slowly The girl holding a thin taper in her hand seeing
      another man with me began to back away before us slowly shading the
      light with her hand Her impassive white face looked ghostly I followed
      behind General Robles Her eyes were fixed on mine I made a gesture of
      helplessness behind my chiefrsquos back trying at the same time to give a
      reassuring expression to my face None of us three uttered a sound
    p
    p
      ldquoWe found ourselves in a room with bare floor and walls There was a rough
      table and a couple of stools in it nothing else whatever An old woman
      with her grey hair hanging loose wrung her hands when we appeared A peal
      of loud laughter resounded through the empty house very amazing and
      weird At this the old woman tried to get past us
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoNobody to leave the roomrsquo said General Robles to me
    p
    p
      ldquoI swung the door to heard the latch click and the laughter became faint
      in our ears
    p
    p
      ldquoBefore another word could be spoken in that room I was amazed by hearing
      the sound of distant thunder
    p
    p
      ldquoI had carried in with me into the house a vivid impression of a beautiful
      clear moonlight night without a speck of cloud in the sky I could not
      believe my ears Sent early abroad for my education I was not familiar
      with the most dreaded natural phenomenon of my native land I saw with
      inexpressible astonishment a look of terror in my chiefrsquos eyes Suddenly
      I felt giddy The General staggered against me heavily the girl seemed to
      reel in the middle of the room the taper fell out of her hand and the
      light went out a shrill cry of lsquoMisericordiarsquo from the old woman pierced
      my ears In the pitchy darkness I heard the plaster off the walls falling
      on the floor It is a mercy there was no ceiling Holding on to the latch
      of the door I heard the grinding of the rooftiles cease above my head
      The shock was over
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoOut of the house The door Fly Santierra flyrsquo howled the General
      You know senores in our country the bravest are not ashamed of the fear
      an earthquake strikes into all the senses of man One never gets used to
      it Repeated experience only augments the mastery of that nameless terror
    p
    p
      ldquoIt was my first earthquake and I was the calmest of them all I
      understood that the crash outside was caused by the porch with its wooden
      pillars and tiled roof projection falling down The next shock would
      destroy the house maybe That rumble as of thunder was approaching again
      The General was rushing round the room to find the door perhaps He made
      a noise as though he were trying to climb the walls and I heard him
      distinctly invoke the names of several saints lsquoOut out Santierrarsquo he
      yelled
    p
    p
      ldquoThe girlrsquos voice was the only one I did not hear
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoGeneralrsquo I cried I cannot move the door We must be locked inrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoI did not recognize his voice in the shout of malediction and despair he
      let out Senores I know many men in my country especially in the
      provinces most subject to earthquakes who will neither eat sleep pray
      nor even sit down to cards with closed doors The danger is not in the
      loss of time but in thismdashthat the movement of the walls may prevent
      a door being opened at all This was what had happened to us We were
      trapped and we had no help to expect from anybody There is no man in my
      country who will go into a house when the earth trembles There never wasmdashexcept
      one Gaspar Ruiz
    p
    p
      ldquoHe had come out of whatever hole he had been hiding in outside and had
      clambered over the timbers of the destroyed porch Above the awful
      subterranean groan of coming destruction I heard a mighty voice shouting
      the word lsquoErminiarsquo with the lungs of a giant An earthquake is a great
      leveller of distinctions I collected all my resolution against the terror
      of the scene lsquoShe is herersquo I shouted back A roar as of a furious wild
      beast answered memdashwhile my head swam my heart sank and the sweat
      of anguish streamed like rain off my brow
    p
    p
      ldquoHe had the strength to pick up one of the heavy posts of the porch
      Holding it under his armpit like a lance but with both hands he charged
      madly the rocking house with the force of a batteringram bursting open
      the door and rushing in headlong over our prostrate bodies I and the
      General picking ourselves up bolted out together without looking round
      once till we got across the road Then clinging to each other we beheld
      the house change suddenly into a heap of formless rubbish behind the back
      of a man who staggered towards us bearing the form of a woman clasped in
      his arms Her long black hair hung nearly to his feet He laid her down
      reverently on the heaving earth and the moonlight shone on her closed
      eyes
    p
    p
      ldquoSenores we mounted with difficulty Our horses getting up plunged madly
      held by the soldiers who had come running from all sides Nobody thought
      of catching Gaspar Ruiz then The eyes of men and animals shone with wild
      fear My general approached Gaspar Ruiz who stood motionless as a statue
      above the girl He let himself be shaken by the shoulder without detaching
      his eyes from her face
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoQue guapersquo shouted the General in his ear lsquoYou are the bravest man
      living You have saved my life I am General Robles Come to my quarters
      tomorrow if God gives us the grace to see another dayrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoHe never stirredmdashas if deaf without feeling insensible
    p
    p
      ldquoWe rode away for the town full of our relations of our friends of
      whose fate we hardly dared to think The soldiers ran by the side of our
      horses Everything was forgotten in the immensity of the catastrophe
      overtaking a whole countryrdquo
     p
    p
            
    p
    p
      Gaspar Ruiz saw the girl open her eyes The raising of her eyelids seemed
      to recall him from a trance They were alone the cries of terror and
      distress from homeless people filled the plains of the coast remote and
      immense coming like a whisper into their loneliness
    p
    p
      She rose swiftly to her feet darting fearful glances on all sides ldquoWhat
      is itrdquo she cried out low and peering into his face ldquoWhere am Irdquo
     p
    p
      He bowed his head sadly without a word
    p
    p
      ldquo   Who are yourdquo
     p
    p
      He knelt down slowly before her and touched the hem of her coarse black
      baize skirt ldquoYour slaverdquo he said
    p
    p
      She caught sight then of the heap of rubbish that had been the house all
      misty in the cloud of dust ldquoAhrdquo she cried pressing her hand to her
      forehead
    p
    p
      ldquoI carried you out from thererdquo he whispered at her feet
    p

      ldquoAnd theyrdquo she asked in a great sob

      He rose and taking her by the arms led her gently towards the shapeless
      ruin half overwhelmed by a landslide ldquoCome and listenrdquo he said
    p
    p
      The serene moon saw them clambering over that heap of stones joists and
      tiles which was a grave They pressed their ears to the interstices
      listening for the sound of a groan for a sigh of pain
    p
    p
      At last he said ldquoThey died swiftly You are alonerdquo
     p
    p
      She sat down on a piece of broken timber and put one arm across her face
      He waitedmdashthen approaching his lips to her ear ldquoLet us gordquo he
      whispered
    p
    p
      ldquoNevermdashnever from hererdquo she cried out flinging her arms above her
      head
    p
    p
      He stooped over her and her raised arms fell upon his shoulders He
      lifted her up steadied himself and began to walk looking straight before
      him
    p
    p
      ldquoWhat are you doingrdquo she asked feebly
    p
    p
      ldquoI am escaping from my enemiesrdquo he said never once glancing at his light
      burden
    p
    p
      ldquoWith merdquo she sighed helplessly
    p
    p
      ldquoNever without yourdquo he said ldquoYou are my strengthrdquo
     p
    p
      He pressed her close to him His face was grave and his footsteps steady
      The conflagrations bursting out in the ruins of destroyed villages dotted
      the plain with red fires and the sounds of distant lamentations the
      cries of Misericordia Misericordia made a desolate murmur in his ears
      He walked on solemn and collected as if carrying something holy
      fragile and precious

    p
      The earth rocked at times under his feet

      With movements of mechanical care and an air of abstraction old General
      Santierra lighted a long and thick cigar
    p
    p
      ldquoIt was a good many hours before we could send a party back to the
      ravinerdquo he said to his guests ldquoWe had found onethird of the town laid
      low the rest shaken up and the inhabitants rich and poor reduced to
      the same state of distraction by the universal disaster The affected
      cheerfulness of some contrasted with the despair of others In the general
      confusion a number of reckless thieves without fear of God or man became
      a danger to those who from the downfall of their homes had managed to save
      some valuables Crying lsquoMisericordiarsquo louder than any at every tremor and
      beating their breast with one hand these scoundrels robbed the poor
      victims with the other not even stopping short of murder
    p
    p
      ldquoGeneral Roblesrsquo division was occupied entirely in guarding the destroyed
      quarters of the town from the depredations of these inhuman monsters
      Taken up with my duties of orderly officer it was only in the morning
      that I could assure myself of the safety of my own family My mother and
      my sisters had escaped with their lives from that ballroom where I had
      left them early in the evening I remember those two beautiful young womenmdashGod
      rest their soulsmdashas if I saw them this moment in the garden of our
      destroyed house pale but active assisting some of our poor neighbours
      in their soiled balldresses and with the dust of fallen walls on their
      hair As to my mother she had a stoical soul in her frail body
      Halfcovered by a costly shawl she was lying on a rustic seat by the side
      of an ornamental basin whose fountain had ceased to play for ever on that
      night
    p
    p
      ldquoI had hardly had time to embrace them all with transports of joy when my
      chief coming along dispatched me to the ravine with a few soldiers to
      bring in my strong man as he called him and that pale girl
    p
    p
      ldquoBut there was no one for us to bring in A landslide had covered the
      ruins of the house and it was like a large mound of earth with only the
      ends of some timbers visible here and theremdashnothing more
    p
    p
      ldquoThus were the tribulations of the old Royalist couple ended An enormous
      and unconsecrated grave had swallowed them up alive in their unhappy
      obstinacy against the will of a people to be free And their daughter was
      gone
    p
    p
      ldquoThat Gaspar Ruiz had carried her off I understood very well But as the
      case was not foreseen I had no instructions to pursue them And certainly
      I had no desire to do so I had grown mistrustful of my interference It
      had never been successful and had not even appeared creditable He was
      gone Well let him go And he had carried off the Royalist girl Nothing
      better Vaya con Dios This was not the time to bother about a deserter
      who justly or unjustly ought to have been dead and a girl for whom it
      would have been better to have never been born
    p
    p
      ldquoSo I marched my men back to the town
    p
    p
      ldquoAfter a few days order having been reestablished all the principal
      families including my own left for Santiago We had a fine house there
      At the same time the division of Robles was moved to new cantonments near
      the capital This change suited very well the state of my domestic and
      amorous feelings
    p
    p
      ldquoOne night rather late I was called to my chief I found General Robles
      in his quarters at ease with his uniform off drinking neat brandy out
      of a tumblermdashas a precaution he used to say against the
      sleeplessness induced by the bites of mosquitoes He was a good soldier
      and he taught me the art and practice of war No doubt God has been
      merciful to his soul for his motives were never other than patriotic if
      his character was irascible As to the use of mosquito nets he considered
      it effeminate shamefulmdashunworthy of a soldier I noticed at the
      first glance that his face already very red wore an expression of high
      goodhumour
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoAha Senor tenientersquo he cried loudly as I saluted at the door
      lsquoBehold Your strong man has turned up againrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoHe extended to me a folded letter which I saw was superscribed lsquoTo the
      CommanderinChief of the Republican Armiesrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoThisrsquo General Robles went on in his loud voice lsquowas thrust by a boy
      into the hand of a sentry at the Quartel General while the fellow stood
      there thinking of his girl no doubtmdashfor before he could gather his
      wits together the boy had disappeared amongst the market people and he
      protests he could not recognize him to save his lifersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoMy chief told me further that the soldier had given the letter to the
      sergeant of the guard and that ultimately it had reached the hands of our
      generalissimo His Excellency had deigned to take cognizance of it with
      his own eyes After that he had referred the matter in confidence to
      General Robles
    p
    p
      ldquoThe letter senores I cannot now recollect textually I saw the
      signature of Gaspar Ruiz He was an audacious fellow He had snatched a
      soul for himself out of a cataclysm remember And now it was that soul
      which had dictated the terms of his letter Its tone was very independent
      I remember it struck me at the time as noblemdashdignified It was no
      doubt her letter Now I shudder at the depth of its duplicity Gaspar
      Ruiz was made to complain of the injustice of which he had been a victim
      He invoked his previous record of fidelity and courage Having been saved
      from death by the miraculous interposition of Providence he could think
      of nothing but of retrieving his character This he wrote he could not
      hope to do in the ranks as a discredited soldier still under suspicion He
      had the means to give a striking proof of his fidelity He had ended by
      proposing to the GeneralinChief a meeting at midnight in the middle of
      the Plaza before the Moneta The signal would be to strike fire with flint
      and steel three times which was not too conspicuous and yet distinctive
      enough for recognition
    p
    p
      ldquoSan Martin the great Liberator loved men of audacity and courage
      Besides he was just and compassionate I told him as much of the manrsquos
      story as I knew and was ordered to accompany him on the appointed night
      The signals were duly exchanged It was midnight and the whole town was
      dark and silent Their two cloaked figures came together in the centre of
      the vast Plaza and keeping discreetly at a distance I listened for an
      hour or more to the murmur of their voices Then the General motioned me
      to approach and as I did so I heard San Martin who was courteous to
      gentle and simple alike offer Gaspar Ruiz the hospitality of the
      headquarters for the night But the soldier refused saying that he would
      be not worthy of that honour till he had done something
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoYou cannot have a common deserter for your guest Excellencyrsquo he
      protested with a low laugh and stepping backwards merged slowly into the
      night
    p
    p
      ldquoThe CommanderinChief observed to me as we turned away lsquoHe had
      somebody with him our friend Ruiz I saw two figures for a moment It was
      an unobtrusive companionrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoI too had observed another figure join the vanishing form of Gaspar
      Ruiz It had the appearance of a short fellow in a poncho and a big hat
      And I wondered stupidly who it could be he had dared take into his
      confidence I might have guessed it could be no one but that fatal girlmdashalas
    p
    p
      ldquoWhere he kept her concealed I do not know He hadmdashit was known
      afterwardsmdashan uncle his motherrsquos brother a small shopkeeper in
      Santiago Perhaps it was there that she found a roof and food Whatever
      she found it was poor enough to exasperate her pride and keep up her
      anger and hate It is certain she did not accompany him on the feat he
      undertook to accomplish first of all It was nothing less than the
      destruction of a store of war material collected secretly by the Spanish
      authorities in the south in a town called Linares Gaspar Ruiz was
      entrusted with a small party only but they proved themselves worthy of
      San Martinrsquos confidence The season was not propitious They had to swim
      swollen rivers They seemed however to have galloped night and day
      outriding the news of their foray and holding straight for the town a
      hundred miles into the enemyrsquos country till at break of day they rode
      into it sword in hand surprising the little garrison It fled without
      making a stand leaving most of its officers in Gaspar Ruizrsquo hands
    p
    p
      ldquoA great explosion of gunpowder ended the conflagration of the magazines
      the raiders had set on fire without loss of time In less than six hours
      they were riding away at the same mad speed without the loss of a single
      man Good as they were such an exploit is not performed without a still
      better leadership
    p
    p
      ldquoI was dining at the headquarters when Gaspar Ruiz himself brought the
      news of his success And it was a great blow to the Royalist troops For a
      proof he displayed to us the garrisonrsquos flag He took it from under his
      poncho and flung it on the table The man was transfigured there was
      something exulting and menacing in the expression of his face He stood
      behind General San Martinrsquos chair and looked proudly at us all He had a
      round blue cap edged with silver braid on his head and we all could see a
      large white scar on the nape of his sunburnt neck
    p
    p
      ldquoSomebody asked him what he had done with the captured Spanish officers
    p
    p
      ldquoHe shrugged his shoulders scornfully lsquoWhat a question to ask In a
      partisan war you do not burden yourself with prisoners I let them gomdashand
      here are their swordknotsrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoHe flung a bunch of them on the table upon the flag Then General Robles
      whom I was attending there spoke up in his loud thick voice lsquoYou did
      Then my brave friend you do not know yet how a war like ours ought to be
      conducted You should have donemdashthisrsquo And he passed the edge of his
      hand across his own throat
    p
    p
      ldquoAlas senores It was only too true that on both sides this contest in
      its nature so heroic was stained by ferocity The murmurs that arose at
      General Roblesrsquo words were by no means unanimous in tone But the generous
      and brave San Martin praised the humane action and pointed out to Ruiz a
      place on his right hand Then rising with a full glass he proposed a
      toast lsquoCaballeros and comradesinarms let us drink the health of
      Captain Gaspar Ruizrsquo And when we had emptied our glasses lsquoI intendrsquo the
      CommanderinChief continued lsquoto entrust him with the guardianship of our
      southern frontier while we go afar to liberate our brethren in Peru He
      whom the enemy could not stop from striking a blow at his very heart will
      know how to protect the peaceful populations we leave behind us to pursue
      our sacred taskrsquo And he embraced the silent Gaspar Ruiz by his side
    p
    p
      ldquoLater on when we all rose from table I approached the latest officer of
      the army with my congratulations lsquoAnd Captain Ruizrsquo I added lsquoperhaps
      you do not mind telling a man who has always believed in the uprightness
      of your character what became of Dona Erminia on that nightrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoAt this friendly question his aspect changed He looked at me from under
      his eyebrows with the heavy dull glance of a guassomdashof a peasant
      lsquoSenor tenientersquo he said thickly and as if very much cast down lsquodo not
      ask me about the senorita for I prefer not to think about her at all when
      I am amongst yourdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoHe looked with a frown all about the room full of smoking and talking
      officers Of course I did not insist
    p
    p
      ldquoThese senores were the last words I was to hear him utter for a long
      long time The very next day we embarked for our arduous expedition to
      Peru and we only heard of Gaspar Ruizrsquo doings in the midst of battles of
      our own He had been appointed military guardian of our southern province
      He raised a partida But his leniency to the conquered foe displeased the
      Civil Governor who was a formal uneasy man full of suspicions He
      forwarded reports against Gaspar Ruiz to the Supreme Government one of
      them being that he had married publicly with great pomp a woman of
      Royalist tendencies Quarrels were sure to arise between these two men of
      very different character At last the Civil Governor began to complain of
      his inactivity and to hint at treachery which he wrote would be not
      surprising in a man of such antecedents Gaspar Ruiz heard of it His rage
      flamed up and the woman ever by his side knew how to feed it with
      perfidious words I do not know whether really the Supreme Government ever
      didmdashas he complained afterwardsmdashsend orders for his arrest It
      seems certain that the Civil Governor began to tamper with his officers
      and that Gaspar Ruiz discovered the fact
    p
    p
      ldquoOne evening when the Governor was giving a tertullia Gaspar Ruiz
      followed by six men he could trust appeared riding through the town to
      the door of the Government House and entered the sala armed his hat on
      his head As the Governor displeased advanced to meet him he seized the
      wretched man round the body carried him off from the midst of the
      appalled guests as though he were a child and flung him down the outer
      steps into the street An angry hug from Gaspar Ruiz was enough to crush
      the life out of a giant but in addition Gaspar Ruizrsquo horsemen fired their
      pistols at the body of the Governor as it lay motionless at the bottom of
      the stairsrdquo
     p
    p
      X
    p
    p
      ldquoAfter thismdashas he called itmdashact of justice Ruiz crossed the
      Rio Blanco followed by the greater part of his band and entrenched
      himself upon a hill A company of regular troops sent out foolishly
      against him was surrounded and destroyed almost to a man Other
      expeditions though better organized were equally unsuccessful
    p
    p
      ldquoIt was during these sanguinary skirmishes that his wife first began to
      appear on horseback at his right hand Rendered proud and selfconfident
      by his successes Ruiz no longer charged at the head of his partida but
      presumptuously like a general directing the movements of an army he
      remained in the rear well mounted and motionless on an eminence sending
      out his orders She was seen repeatedly at his side and for a long time
      was mistaken for a man There was much talk then of a mysterious
      whitefaced chief to whom the defeats of our troops were ascribed She
      rode like an Indian woman astride wearing a broadrimmed manrsquos hat and a
      dark poncho Afterwards in the day of their greatest prosperity this
      poncho was embroidered in gold and she wore then also the sword of poor
      Don Antonio de Leyva This veteran Chilian officer having the misfortune
      to be surrounded with his small force and running short of ammunition
      found his death at the hands of the Arauco Indians the allies and
      auxiliaries of Gaspar Ruiz This was the fatal affair long remembered
      afterwards as the lsquoMassacre of the Islandrsquo The sword of the unhappy
      officer was presented to her by Peneleo the Araucanian chief for these
      Indians struck by her aspect the deathly pallor of her face which no
      exposure to the weather seemed to affect and her calm indifference under
      fire looked upon her as a supernatural being or at least as a witch By
      this superstition the prestige and authority of Gaspar Ruiz amongst these
      ignorant people were greatly augmented She must have savoured her
      vengeance to the full on that day when she buckled on the sword of Don
      Antonio de Leyva It never left her side unless she put on her womanrsquos
      clothesmdashnot that she would or could ever use it but she loved to
      feel it beating upon her thigh as a perpetual reminder and symbol of the
      dishonour to the arms of the Republic She was insatiable Moreover on
      the path she had led Gaspar Ruiz upon there is no stopping Escaped
      prisonersmdashand they were not manymdashused to relate how with a few
      whispered words she could change the expression of his face and revive his
      flagging animosity They told how after every skirmish after every raid
      after every successful action he would ride up to her and look into her
      face Its haughty calm was never relaxed Her embrace senores must have
      been as cold as the embrace of a statue He tried to melt her icy heart in
      a stream of warm blood Some English naval officers who visited him at
      that time noticed the strange character of his infatuationrdquo
     p
    p
      At the movement of surprise and curiosity in his audience General
      Santierra paused for a moment
    p
    p
      ldquoYesmdashEnglish naval officersrdquo he repeated ldquoRuiz had consented to
      receive them to arrange for the liberation of some prisoners of your
      nationality In the territory upon which he ranged from sea coast to the
      Cordillera there was a bay where the ships of that time after rounding
      Cape Horn used to resort for wood and water There decoying the crew on
      shore he captured first the whaling brig Hersalia and afterwards made
      himself master by surprise of two more ships one English and one
      American
    p
    p
      ldquoIt was rumoured at the time that he dreamed of setting up a navy of his
      own But that of course was impossible Still manning the brig with
      part of her own crew and putting an officer and a good many men of his
      own on board he sent her off to the Spanish Governor of the island of
      Chiloe with a report of his exploits and a demand for assistance in the
      war against the rebels The Governor could not do much for him but he
      sent in return two light fieldpieces a letter of compliments with a
      colonelrsquos commission in the royal forces and a great Spanish flag This
      standard with much ceremony was hoisted over his house in the heart of the
      Arauco country Surely on that day she may have smiled on her guasso
      husband with a less haughty reserve
    p
    p
      ldquoThe senior officer of the English squadron on our coast made
      representations to our Government as to these captures But Gaspar Ruiz
      refused to treat with us Then an English frigate proceeded to the bay
      and her captain doctor and two lieutenants travelled inland under a
      safeconduct They were well received and spent three days as guests of
      the partisan chief A sort of military barbaric state was kept up at the
      residence It was furnished with the loot of frontier towns When first
      admitted to the principal sala they saw his wife lying down she was not
      in good health then with Gaspar Ruiz sitting at the foot of the couch
      His hat was lying on the floor and his hands reposed on the hilt of his
      sword
    p
    p
      ldquoDuring that first conversation he never removed his big hands from the
      swordhilt except once to arrange the coverings about her with gentle
      careful touches They noticed that whenever she spoke he would fix his
      eyes upon her in a kind of expectant breathless attention and seemingly
      forget the existence of the world and his own existence too In the
      course of the farewell banquet at which she was present reclining on her
      couch he burst forth into complaints of the treatment he had received
      After General San Martinrsquos departure he had been beset by spies slandered
      by civil officials his services ignored his liberty and even his life
      threatened by the Chilian Government He got up from the table thundered
      execrations pacing the room wildly then sat down on the couch at his
      wifersquos feet his breast heaving his eyes fixed on the floor She reclined
      on her back her head on the cushions her eyes nearly closed
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoAnd now I am an honoured Spanish officerrsquo he added in a calm voice
    p
    p
      ldquoThe captain of the English frigate then took the opportunity to inform
      him gently that Lima had fallen and that by the terms of a convention the
      Spaniards were withdrawing from the whole continent
    p
    p
      ldquoGaspar Ruiz raised his head and without hesitation speaking with
      suppressed vehemence declared that if not a single Spanish soldier were
      left in the whole of South America he would persist in carrying on the
      contest against Chile to the last drop of blood When he finished that mad
      tirade his wifersquos long white hand was raised and she just caressed his
      knee with the tips of her fingers for a fraction of a second
    p
    p
      ldquoFor the rest of the officersrsquo stay which did not extend for more than
      half an hour after the banquet that ferocious chieftain of a desperate
      partida overflowed with amiability and kindness He had been hospitable
      before but now it seemed as though he could not do enough for the comfort
      and safety of his visitorsrsquo journey back to their ship
    p
    p
      ldquoNothing I have been told could have presented a greater contrast to his
      late violence or the habitual taciturn reserve of his manner Like a man
      elated beyond measure by an unexpected happiness he overflowed with
      goodwill amiability and attentions He embraced the officers like
      brothers almost with tears in his eyes The released prisoners were
      presented each with a piece of gold At the last moment suddenly he
      declared he could do no less than restore to the masters of the merchant
      vessels all their private property This unexpected generosity caused some
      delay in the departure of the party and their first march was very short
    p
    p
      ldquoLate in the evening Gaspar Ruiz rode up with an escort to their camp
      fires bringing along with him a mule loaded with cases of wine He had
      come he said to drink a stirrup cup with his English friends whom he
      would never see again He was mellow and joyous in his temper He told
      stories of his own exploits laughed like a boy borrowed a guitar from
      the Englishmenrsquos chief muleteer and sitting crosslegged on his superfine
      poncho spread before the glow of the embers sang a guasso lovesong in a
      tender voice Then his head dropped on his breast his hands fell to the
      ground the guitar rolled off his kneesmdashand a great hush fell over
      the camp after the lovesong of the implacable partisan who had made so
      many of our people weep for destroyed homes and for loves cut short
    p
    p
      ldquoBefore anybody could make a sound he sprang up from the ground and called
      for his horse
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoAdios my friendsrsquo he cried lsquoGo with God I love you And tell them
      well in Santiago that between Gaspar Ruiz colonel of the King of Spain
      and the republican carrioncrows of Chile there is war to the last breathmdashwar
      war warrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoWith a great yell of lsquoWar war warrsquo which his escort took up they rode
      away and the sound of hoofs and of voices died out in the distance
      between the slopes of the hills
    p
    p
      ldquoThe two young English officers were convinced that Ruiz was mad How do
      you say thatmdashtile loosemdasheh But the doctor an observant
      Scotsman with much shrewdness and philosophy in his character told me
      that it was a very curious case of possession I met him many years
      afterwards but he remembered the experience very well He told me too
      that in his opinion that woman did not lead Gaspar Ruiz into the practice
      of sanguinary treachery by direct persuasion but by the subtle way of
      awakening and keeping alive in his simple mind a burning sense of an
      irreparable wrong Maybe maybe But I would say that she poured half of
      her vengeful soul into the strong clay of that man as you may pour
      intoxication madness poison into an empty cup
    p

      ldquoIf he wanted war he got it in earnest when our victorious army began to
      return from Peru Systematic operations were planned against this blot on
      the honour and prosperity of our hardly won independence General Robles
      commanded with his wellknown ruthless severity Savage reprisals were
      exercised on both sides and no quarter was given in the field Having won
      my promotion in the Peru campaign I was a captain on the staff Gaspar
      Ruiz found himself hard pressed at the same time we heard by means of a
      fugitive priest who had been carried off from his village presbytery and
      galloped eighty miles into the hills to perform the christening ceremony
      that a daughter was born to them To celebrate the event I suppose Ruiz
      executed one or two brilliant forays clear away at the rear of our forces
      and defeated the detachments sent out to cut off his retreat General
      Robles nearly had a stroke of apoplexy from rage He found another cause
      of insomnia than the bites of mosquitoes but against this one senores
      tumblers of raw brandy had no more effect than so much water He took to
      railing and storming at me about my strong man And from our impatience to
      end this inglorious campaign I am afraid that all we young officers became
      reckless and apt to take undue risks on service
    p
    p
      ldquoNevertheless slowly inch by inch as it were our columns were closing
      upon Gaspar Ruiz though he had managed to raise all the Araucanian nation
      of wild Indians against us Then a year or more later our Government
      became aware through its agents and spies that he had actually entered
      into alliance with Carreras the socalled dictator of the socalled
      republic of Mendoza on the other side of the mountains Whether Gaspar
      Ruiz had a deep political intention or whether he wished only to secure a
      safe retreat for his wife and child while he pursued remorselessly against
      us his war of surprises and massacres I cannot tell The alliance
      however was a fact Defeated in his attempt to check our advance from the
      sea he retreated with his usual swiftness and preparing for another hard
      and hazardous tussle began by sending his wife with the little girl
      across the Pequena range of mountains on the frontier of Mendozardquo
     p

      XI
    p
    p
      ldquoNow Carreras under the guise of politics and liberalism was a scoundrel
      of the deepest dye and the unhappy state of Mendoza was the prey of
      thieves robbers traitors and murderers who formed his party He was
      under a noble exterior a man without heart pity honour or conscience
      He aspired to nothing but tyranny and though he would have made use of
      Gaspar Ruiz for his nefarious designs yet he soon became aware that to
      propitiate the Chilian Government would answer his purpose better I blush
      to say that he made proposals to our Government to deliver up on certain
      conditions the wife and child of the man who had trusted to his honour
      and that this offer was accepted
    p
    p
      ldquoWhile on her way to Mendoza over the Pequena Pass she was betrayed by her
      escort of Carrerasrsquo men and given up to the officer in command of a
      Chilian fort on the upland at the foot of the main Cordillera range This
      atrocious transaction might have cost me dear for as a matter of fact I
      was a prisoner in Gaspar Ruizrsquo camp when he received the news I had been
      captured during a reconnaissance my escort of a few troopers being
      speared by the Indians of his bodyguard I was saved from the same fate
      because he recognized my features just in time No doubt my friends
      thought I was dead and I would not have given much for my life at any
      time But the strong man treated me very well because he said I had
      always believed in his innocence and had tried to serve him when he was a
      victim of injustice
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoAnd nowrsquo was his speech to me lsquoyou shall see that I always speak the
      truth You are safersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoI did not think I was very safe when I was called up to go to him one
      night He paced up and down like a wild beast exclaiming lsquoBetrayed
      Betrayedrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoHe walked up to me clenching his fists lsquoI could cut your throatrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoWill that give your wife back to yoursquo I said as quietly as I could
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoAnd the childrsquo he yelled out as if mad He fell into a chair and
      laughed in a frightful boisterous manner lsquoOh no you are safersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoI assured him that his wifersquos life was safe too but I did not say what
      I was convinced ofmdashthat he would never see her again He wanted war
      to the death and the war could only end with his death
    p
    p
      ldquoHe gave me a strange inexplicable look and sat muttering blankly lsquoIn
      their hands In their handsrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoI kept as still as a mouse before a cat
    p
    p
      ldquoSuddenly he jumped up lsquoWhat am I doing herersquo he cried and opening the
      door he yelled out orders to saddle and mount lsquoWhat is itrsquo he
      stammered coming up to me lsquoThe Pequena fort a fort of palisades
      Nothing I would get her back if she were hidden in the very heart of the
      mountainrsquo He amazed me by adding with an effort lsquoI carried her off in
      my two arms while the earth trembled And the child at least is mine She
      at least is minersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoThose were bizarre words but I had no time for wonder
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoYou shall go with mersquo he said violently lsquoI may want to parley and
      any other messenger from Ruiz the outlaw would have his throat cutrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoThis was true enough Between him and the rest of incensed mankind there
      could be no communication according to the customs of honourable warfare
    p
    p
      ldquoIn less than half an hour we were in the saddle flying wildly through
      the night He had only an escort of twenty men at his quarters but would
      not wait for more He sent however messengers to Peneleo the Indian
      chief then ranging in the foothills directing him to bring his warriors
      to the uplands and meet him at the lake called the Eye of Water near
      whose shores the frontier fort of Pequena was built
    p
    p
      ldquoWe crossed the lowlands with that untired rapidity of movement which had
      made Gaspar Ruizrsquo raids so famous We followed the lower valleys up to
      their precipitous heads The ride was not without its dangers A cornice
      road on a perpendicular wall of basalt wound itself around a buttressing
      rock and at last we emerged from the gloom of a deep gorge upon the
      upland of Pequena
    p
    p
      ldquoIt was a plain of green wiry grass and thin flowering bushes but high
      above our heads patches of snow hung in the folds and crevices of the
      great walls of rock The little lake was as round as a staring eye The
      garrison of the fort were just driving in their small herd of cattle when
      we appeared Then the great wooden gates swung to and that foursquare
      enclosure of broad blackened stakes pointed at the top and barely hiding
      the grass roofs of the huts inside seemed deserted empty without a
      single soul
    p
    p
      ldquoBut when summoned to surrender by a man who at Gaspar Ruizrsquo order rode
      fearlessly forward those inside answered by a volley which rolled him and
      his horse over I heard Ruiz by my side grind his teeth lsquoIt does not
      matterrsquo he said lsquoNow you gorsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoTorn and faded as its rags were the vestiges of my uniform were
      recognized and I was allowed to approach within speaking distance and
      then I had to wait because a voice clamouring through a loophole with joy
      and astonishment would not allow me to place a word It was the voice of
      Major Pajol an old friend He like my other comrades had thought me
      killed a long time ago
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoPut spurs to your horse manrsquo he yelled in the greatest excitement
      lsquowe will swing the gate open for yoursquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoI let the reins fall out of my hand and shook my head lsquoI am on my
      honourrsquo I cried
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoTo himrsquo he shouted with infinite disgust
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoHe promises you your lifersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoOur life is our own And do you Santierra advise us to surrender to
      that rastrerorsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoNorsquo I shouted lsquoBut he wants his wife and child and he can cut you off
      from waterrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoThen she would be the first to suffer You may tell him that Look heremdashthis
      is all nonsense we shall dash out and capture yoursquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoYou shall not catch me aliversquo I said firmly
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoImbecilersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoFor Godrsquos sakersquo I continued hastily lsquodo not open the gatersquo And I
      pointed at the multitude of Peneleorsquos Indians who covered the shores of
      the lake
    p
    p
      ldquoI had never seen so many of these savages together Their lances seemed
      as numerous as stalks of grass Their hoarse voices made a vast
      inarticulate sound like the murmur of the sea
    p
    p
      ldquoMy friend Pajol was swearing to himself lsquoWell thenmdashgo to the
      devilrsquo he shouted exasperated But as I swung round he repented for I
      heard him say hurriedly lsquoShoot the foolrsquos horse before he gets awayrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoHe had good marksmen Two shots rang out and in the very act of turning
      my horse staggered fell and lay still as if struck by lightning I had my
      feet out of the stirrups and rolled clear of him but I did not attempt to
      rise Neither dared they rush out to drag me in
    p
    p
      ldquoThe masses of Indians had begun to move upon the fort They rode up in
      squadrons trailing their long chusos then dismounted out of musketshot
      and throwing off their fur mantles advanced naked to the attack
      stamping their feet and shouting in cadence A sheet of flame ran three
      times along the face of the fort without checking their steady march They
      crowded right up to the very stakes flourishing their broad knives But
      this palisade was not fastened together with hide lashings in the usual
      way but with long iron nails which they could not cut Dismayed at the
      failure of their usual method of forcing an entrance the heathen who had
      marched so steadily against the musketry fire broke and fled under the
      volleys of the besieged
    p
    p
      ldquoDirectly they had passed me on their advance I got up and rejoined Gaspar
      Ruiz on a low ridge which jutted out upon the plain The musketry of his
      own men had covered the attack but now at a sign from him a trumpet
      sounded the lsquoCease firersquo Together we looked in silence at the hopeless
      rout of the savages
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoIt must be a siege thenrsquo he muttered And I detected him wringing his
      hands stealthily
    p
    p
      ldquoBut what sort of siege could it be Without any need for me to repeat my
      friend Pajolrsquos message he dared not cut the water off from the besieged
      They had plenty of meat And indeed if they had been short he would have
      been too anxious to send food into the stockade had he been able But as
      a matter of fact it was we on the plain who were beginning to feel the
      pinch of hunger
    p
    p
      ldquoPeneleo the Indian chief sat by our fire folded in his ample mantle of
      guanaco skins He was an athletic savage with an enormous square shock
      head of hair resembling a straw beehive in shape and size and with grave
      surly muchlined features In his broken Spanish he repeated growling
      like a badtempered wild beast that if an opening ever so small were made
      in the stockade his men would march in and get the senoramdashnot
      otherwise
    p
    p
      ldquoGaspar Ruiz sitting opposite him kept his eyes fixed on the fort night
      and day as it were in awful silence and immobility Meantime by runners
      from the lowlands that arrived nearly every day we heard of the defeat of
      one of his lieutenants in the Maipu valley Scouts sent afar brought news
      of a column of infantry advancing through distant passes to the relief of
      the fort They were slow but we could trace their toilful progress up the
      lower valleys I wondered why Ruiz did not march to attack and destroy
      this threatening force in some wild gorge fit for an ambuscade in
      accordance with his genius for guerilla warfare But his genius seemed to
      have abandoned him to his despair
    p
    p
      ldquoIt was obvious to me that he could not tear himself away from the sight
      of the fort I protest to you senores that I was moved almost to pity by
      the sight of this powerless strong man sitting on the ridge indifferent
      to sun to rain to cold to wind with his hands clasped round his legs
      and his chin resting on his knees gazingmdashgazingmdashgazing
    p
    p
      ldquoAnd the fort he kept his eyes fastened on was as still and silent as
      himself The garrison gave no sign of life They did not even answer the
      desultory fire directed at the loopholes
    p
    p
      ldquoOne night as I strolled past him he without changing his attitude
      spoke to me unexpectedly lsquoI have sent for a gunrsquo he said lsquoI shall have
      time to get her back and retreat before your Robles manages to crawl up
      herersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoHe had sent for a gun to the plains
    p
    p
      ldquoIt was long in coming but at last it came It was a sevenpounder field
      gun Dismounted and lashed crosswise to two long poles it had been
      carried up the narrow paths between two mules with ease His wild cry of
      exultation at daybreak when he saw the gun escort emerge from the valley
      rings in my ears now
    p
    p
      ldquoBut senores I have no words to depict his amazement his fury his
      despair and distraction when he heard that the animal loaded with the
      guncarriage had during the last night march somehow or other tumbled
      down a precipice He broke into menaces of death and torture against the
      escort I kept out of his way all that day lying behind some bushes and
      wondering what he would do now Retreat was left for him but he could not
      retreat
    p
    p
      ldquoI saw below me his artillerist Jorge an old Spanish soldier building
      up a sort of structure with heapedup saddles The gun ready loaded was
      lifted on to that but in the act of firing the whole thing collapsed and
      the shot flew high above the stockade
    p
    p
      ldquoNothing more was attempted One of the ammunition mules had been lost
      too and they had no more than six shots to fire ample enough to batter
      down the gate providing the gun was well laid This was impossible without
      it being properly mounted There was no time nor means to construct a
      carriage Already every moment I expected to hear Roblesrsquo buglecalls echo
      amongst the crags
    p
    p
      ldquoPeneleo wandering about uneasily draped in his skins sat down for a
      moment near me growling his usual tale
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoMake an entradamdasha hole If make a hole bueno If not make a hole
      then vamosmdashwe must go awayrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoAfter sunset I observed with surprise the Indians making preparations as
      if for another assault Their lines stood ranged in the shadows of the
      mountains On the plain in front of the fort gate I saw a group of men
      swaying about in the same place
    p
    p
      ldquoI walked down the ridge disregarded The moonlight in the clear air of
      the uplands was bright as day but the intense shadows confused my sight
      and I could not make out what they were doing I heard the voice of Jorge
      the artillerist say in a queer doubtful tone lsquoIt is loaded senorrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoThen another voice in that group pronounced firmly the words lsquoBring the
      riata herersquo It was the voice of Gaspar Ruiz
    p
    p
      ldquoA silence fell in which the popping shots of the besieged garrison rang
      out sharply They too had observed the group But the distance was too
      great and in the spatter of spent musketballs cutting up the ground the
      group opened closed swayed giving me a glimpse of busy stooping figures
      in its midst I drew nearer doubting whether this was a weird vision a
      suggestive and insensate dream
    p
    p
      ldquoA strangely stifled voice commanded lsquoHaul the hitches tighterrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoSi senorrsquo several other voices answered in tones of awed alacrity
    p
    p
      ldquoThen the stifled voice said lsquoLike this I must be free to breathersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoThen there was a concerned noise of many men together lsquoHelp him up
      hombres Steady Under the other armrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoThat deadened voice ordered lsquoBueno Stand away from me menrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoI pushed my way through the recoiling circle and heard once more that
      same oppressed voice saying earnestly lsquoForget that I am a living man
      Jorge Forget me altogether and think of what you have to dorsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoBe without fear senor You are nothing to me but a guncarriage and I
      shall not waste a shotrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoI heard the spluttering of a portfire and smelt the saltpetre of the
      match I saw suddenly before me a nondescript shape on all fours like a
      beast but with a manrsquos head drooping below a tubular projection over the
      nape of the neck and the gleam of a rounded mass of bronze on its back
    p
    p
      ldquoIn front of a silent semicircle of men it squatted alone with Jorge
      behind it and a trumpeter motionless his trumpet in his hand by its
      side
    p
    p
      ldquoJorge bent double muttered portfire in hand lsquoAn inch to the left
      senor Too much So Now if you let yourself down a little by letting
      your elbows bend I will   rsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoHe leaped aside lowering his portfire and a burst of flame darted out
      of the muzzle of the gun lashed on the manrsquos back
    p
    p
      ldquoThen Gaspar Ruiz lowered himself slowly lsquoGood shotrsquo he asked
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoFull on senorrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoThen load againrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoHe lay there before me on his breast under the darkly glittering bronze
      of his monstrous burden such as no love or strength of man had ever had
      to bear in the lamentable history of the world His arms were spread out
      and he resembled a prostrate penitent on the moonlit ground
    p
    p
      ldquoAgain I saw him raised to his hands and knees and the men stand away from
      him and old Jorge stoop glancing along the gun
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoLeft a little Right an inch Por Dios senor stop this trembling
      Where is your strengthrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoThe old gunnerrsquos voice was cracked with emotion He stepped aside and
      quick as lightning brought the spark to the touchhole
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoExcellentrsquo he cried tearfully but Gaspar Ruiz lay for a long time
      silent flattened on the ground
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoI am tiredrsquo he murmured at last lsquoWill another shot do itrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoWithout doubtrsquo said Jorge bending down to his ear
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoThenmdashloadrsquo I heard him utter distinctly lsquoTrumpeterrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoI am here senor ready for your wordrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoBlow a blast at this word that shall be heard from one end of Chile to
      the otherrsquo he said in an extraordinarily strong voice lsquoAnd you others
      stand ready to cut this accursed riata for then will be the time for me
      to lead you in your rush Now raise me up and you Jorgemdashbe quick
      with your aimrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoThe rattle of musketry from the fort nearly drowned his voice The
      palisade was wreathed in smoke and flame
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoExert your force forward against the recoil mi amorsquo said the old
      gunner shakily lsquoDig your fingers into the ground So Nowrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoA cry of exultation escaped him after the shot The trumpeter raised his
      trumpet nearly to his lips and waited But no word came from the prostrate
      man I fell on one knee and heard all he had to say then
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoSomething brokenrsquo he whispered lifting his head a little and turning
      his eyes towards me in his hopelessly crushed attitude
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoThe gate hangs only by the splintersrsquo yelled Jorge
    p
    p
      ldquoGaspar Ruiz tried to speak but his voice died out in his throat and I
      helped to roll the gun off his broken back He was insensible
    p
    p
      ldquoI kept my lips shut of course The signal for the Indians to attack was
      never given Instead the buglecalls of the relieving force for which my
      ears had thirsted so long burst out terrifying like the call of the Last
      Day to our surprised enemies
    p
    p
      ldquoA tornado senores a real hurricane of stampeded men wild horses
      mounted Indians swept over me as I cowered on the ground by the side of
      Gaspar Ruiz still stretched out on his face in the shape of a cross
      Peneleo galloping for life jabbed at me with his long chuso in passingmdashfor
      the sake of old acquaintance I suppose How I escaped the flying lead is
      more difficult to explain Venturing to rise on my knees too soon some
      soldiers of the th Taltal regiment in their hurry to get at something
      alive nearly bayoneted me on the spot They looked very disappointed
      too when some officers galloping up drove them away with the flat of
      their swords
    p
    p
      ldquoIt was General Robles with his staff He wanted badly to make some
      prisoners He too seemed disappointed for a moment lsquoWhat Is it yoursquo 
      he cried But he dismounted at once to embrace me for he was an old
      friend of my family I pointed to the body at our feet and said only
      these two words

      ldquolsquoGaspar Ruizrsquo

    p
      XII
    p
    p
      ldquoBut Gaspar Ruiz breathed yet I had him carried in his poncho under the
      shelter of some bushes on the very ridge from which he had been gazing so
      fixedly at the fort while unseen death was hovering already over his head
    p
    p
      ldquoOur troops had bivouacked round the fort Towards daybreak I was not
      surprised to hear that I was designated to command the escort of a
      prisoner who was to be sent down at once to Santiago Of course the
      prisoner was Gaspar Ruizrsquo wife
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoI have named you out of regard for your feelingsrsquo General Robles
      remarked lsquoThough the woman really ought to be shot for all the harm she
      has done to the Republicrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoAnd as I made a movement of shocked protest he continued
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoNow he is as well as dead she is of no importance Nobody will know
      what to do with her However the Government wants herrsquo He shrugged his
      shoulders lsquoI suppose he must have buried large quantities of his loot in
      places that she alone knows ofrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoAt dawn I saw her coming up the ridge guarded by two soldiers and
      carrying her child on her arm
    p
    p
      ldquoI walked to meet her
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoIs he living yetrsquo she asked confronting me with that white impassive
      face he used to look at in an adoring way
    p
    p
      ldquoI bent my head and led her round a clump of bushes without a word His
      eyes were open He breathed with difficulty and uttered her name with a
      great effort
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoErminiarsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoShe knelt at his head The little girl unconscious of him and with her
      big eyes looking about began to chatter suddenly in a joyous thin
      voice She pointed a tiny finger at the rosy glow of sunrise behind the
      black shapes of the peaks And while that childtalk incomprehensible and
      sweet to the ear lasted those two the dying man and the kneeling woman
      remained silent looking into each otherrsquos eyes listening to the frail
      sound Then the prattle stopped The child laid its head against its
      motherrsquos breast and was still
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoIt was for yoursquo he began lsquoForgiversquo His voice failed him Presently I
      heard a mutter and caught the pitiful words lsquoNot strong enoughrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoShe looked at him with an extraordinary intensity He tried to smile and
      in a humble tone lsquoForgive mersquo he repeated lsquoLeaving you   rsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoShe bent down dryeyed and in a steady voice lsquoOn all the earth I have
      loved nothing but you Gasparrsquo she said
    p
    p
      ldquoHis head made a movement His eyes revived lsquoAt lastrsquo he sighed out
      Then anxiously lsquoBut is this true    is this truersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoAs true as that there is no mercy and justice in this worldrsquo she
      answered him passionately She stooped over his face He tried to raise
      his head but it fell back and when she kissed his lips he was already
      dead His glazed eyes stared at the sky on which pink clouds floated very
      high But I noticed the eyelids of the child pressed to its motherrsquos
      breast droop and close slowly She had gone to sleep
    p
    p
      ldquoThe widow of Gaspar Ruiz the strong man allowed me to lead her away
      without shedding a tear
    p
    p
      ldquoFor travelling we had arranged for her a sidesaddle very much like a
      chair with a board swung beneath to rest her feet on And the first day
      she rode without uttering a word and hardly for one moment turning her
      eyes away from the little girl whom she held on her knees At our first
      camp I saw her during the night walking about rocking the child in her
      arms and gazing down at it by the light of the moon After we had started
      on our second dayrsquos march she asked me how soon we should come to the
      first village of the inhabited country
    p
    p
      ldquoI said we should be there about noon
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoAnd will there be women therersquo she inquired
    p
    p
      ldquoI told her that it was a large village lsquoThere will be men and women
      there senorarsquo I said lsquowhose hearts shall be made glad by the news that
      all the unrest and war is over nowrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoYes it is all over nowrsquo she repeated Then after a time lsquoSenor
      officer what will your Government do with mersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoI do not know senorarsquo I said lsquoThey will treat you well no doubt We
      republicans are not savages and take no vengeance on womenrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoShe gave me a look at the word lsquorepublicansrsquo which I imagined full of
      undying hate But an hour or so afterwards as we drew up to let the
      baggage mules go first along a narrow path skirting a precipice she
      looked at me with such a white troubled face that I felt a great pity for
      her
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoSenor officerrsquo she said lsquoI am weak I tremble It is an insensate
      fearrsquo And indeed her lips did tremble while she tried to smile glancing
      at the beginning of the narrow path which was not so dangerous after all
      lsquoI am afraid I shall drop the child Gaspar saved your life you remember
         Take her from mersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoI took the child out of her extended arms lsquoShut your eyes senora and
      trust to your mulersquo I recommended
    p
    p
      ldquoShe did so and with her pallor and her wasted thin face she looked
      deathlike At a turn of the path where a great crag of purple porphyry
      closes the view of the lowlands I saw her open her eyes I rode just
      behind her holding the little girl with my right arm lsquoThe child is all
      rightrsquo I cried encouragingly
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoYesrsquo she answered faintly and then to my intense terror I saw her
      stand up on the footrest staring horribly and throw herself forward
      into the chasm on our right
    p
    p
      ldquoI cannot describe to you the sudden and abject fear that came over me at
      that dreadful sight It was a dread of the abyss the dread of the crags
      which seemed to nod upon me My head swam I pressed the child to my side
      and sat my horse as still as a statue I was speechless and cold all over
      Her mule staggered sidling close to the rock and then went on My horse
      only pricked up his ears with a slight snort My heart stood still and
      from the depths of the precipice the stones rattling in the bed of the
      furious stream made me almost insane with their sound
    p
    p
      ldquoNext moment we were round the turn and on a broad and grassy slope And
      then I yelled My men came running back to me in great alarm It seems
      that at first I did nothing but shout lsquoShe has given the child into my
      hands She has given the child into my handsrsquo The escort thought I had
      gone madrdquo
     p
    p
      General Santierra ceased and got up from the table ldquoAnd that is all
      senoresrdquo he concluded with a courteous glance at his rising guests
    p
    p
      ldquoBut what became of the child Generalrdquo we asked
    p
    p
      ldquoAh the child the childrdquo
     p
    p
      He walked to one of the windows opening on his beautiful garden the
      refuge of his old days Its fame was great in the land Keeping us back
      with a raised arm he called out ldquoErminia Erminiardquo and waited Then his
      cautioning arm dropped and we crowded to the windows
    p
    p
      From a clump of trees a woman had come upon the broad walk bordered with
      flowers We could hear the rustle of her starched petticoats and observed
      the ample spread of her oldfashioned black silk skirt She looked up and
      seeing all these eyes staring at her stopped frowned smiled shook her
      finger at the General who was laughing boisterously and drawing the
      black lace on her head so as to partly conceal her haughty profile passed
      out of our sight walking with stiff dignity
    p
    p
      ldquoYou have beheld the guardian angel of the old manmdashand her to whom
      you owe all that is seemly and comfortable in my hospitality Somehow
      senores though the flame of love has been kindled early in my breast I
      have never married And because of that perhaps the sparks of the sacred
      fire are not yet extinct hererdquo He struck his broad chest ldquoStill alive
      still aliverdquo he said with seriocomic emphasis ldquoBut I shall not marry
      now She is General Santierrarsquos adopted daughter and heiressrdquo
     p
    p
      One of our fellowguests a young naval officer described her afterwards
      as a ldquoshort stout old girl of forty or thereaboutsrdquo We had all noticed
      that her hair was turning grey and that she had very fine black eyes
    p
    p
      ldquoAndrdquo General Santierra continued ldquoneither would she ever hear of
      marrying any one A real calamity Good patient devoted to the old man
      A simple soul But I would not advise any of you to ask for her hand for
      if she took yours into hers it would be only to crush your bones Ah she
      does not jest on that subject And she is the own daughter of her father
      the strong man who perished through his own strength the strength of his
      body of his simplicitymdashof his loverdquo

      THE INFORMER

      AN IRONIC TALE
    h
    p
      Mr X came to me preceded by a letter of introduction from a good friend
      of mine in Paris specifically to see my collection of Chinese bronzes and
      porcelain
    p
    p
      ldquoMy friend in Paris is a collector too He collects neither porcelain
      nor bronzes nor pictures nor medals nor stamps nor anything that could
      be profitably dispersed under an auctioneerrsquos hammer He would reject
      with genuine surprise the name of a collector Nevertheless thatrsquos what
      he is by temperament He collects acquaintances It is delicate work He
      brings to it the patience the passion the determination of a true
      collector of curiosities His collection does not contain any royal
      personages I donrsquot think he considers them sufficiently rare and
      interesting but with that exception he has met with and talked to
      everyone worth knowing on any conceivable ground He observes them
      listens to them penetrates them measures them and puts the memory away
      in the galleries of his mind He has schemed plotted and travelled all
      over Europe in order to add to his collection of distinguished personal
      acquaintances
    p
    p
      ldquoAs he is wealthy well connected and unprejudiced his collection is
      pretty complete including objects or should I say subjects whose value
      is unappreciated by the vulgar and often unknown to popular fame Of
      trevolte of modern times The world knows him as a revolutionary writer
      whose savage irony has laid bare the rottenness of the most respectable
      institutions He has scalped every venerated head and has mangled at the
      stake of his wit every received opinion and every recognized principle of
      conduct and policy Who does not remember his flaming red revolutionary
      pamphlets Their sudden swarmings used to overwhelm the powers of every
      Continental police like a plague of crimson gadflies But this extreme
      writer has been also the active inspirer of secret societies the
      mysterious unknown Number One of desperate conspiracies suspected and
      unsuspected matured or baffled And the world at large has never had an
      inkling of that fact This accounts for him going about amongst us to this
      day a veteran of many subterranean campaigns standing aside now safe
      within his reputation of merely the greatest destructive publicist that
      ever livedrdquo
     p
    p
      Thus wrote my friend adding that Mr X was an enlightened connoisseur of
      bronzes and china and asking me to show him my collection
    p
    p
      X turned up in due course My treasures are disposed in three large rooms
      without carpets and curtains There is no other furniture than the etagres
      and the glass cases whose contents shall be worth a fortune to my heirs I
      allow no fires to be lighted for fear of accidents and a fireproof door
      separates them from the rest of the house
    p
    p
      It was a bitter cold day We kept on our overcoats and hats Middlesized
      and spare his eyes alert in a long Romannosed countenance X walked on
      his neat little feet with short steps and looked at my collection
      intelligently I hope I looked at him intelligently too A snowwhite
      moustache and imperial made his nutbrown complexion appear darker than it
      really was In his fur coat and shiny tall hat that terrible man looked
      fashionable I believe he belonged to a noble family and could have
      called himself Vicomte X de la Z if he chose We talked nothing but
      bronzes and porcelain He was remarkably appreciative We parted on
      cordial terms
    p
    p
      Where he was staying I donrsquot know I imagine he must have been a lonely
      man Anarchists I suppose have no familiesmdashnot at any rate as we
      understand that social relation Organization into families may answer to
      a need of human nature but in the last instance it is based on law and
      therefore must be something odious and impossible to an anarchist But
      indeed I donrsquot understand anarchists Does a man of thatmdashof thatmdashpersuasion
      still remain an anarchist when alone quite alone and going to bed for
      instance Does he lay his head on the pillow pull his bedclothes over
      him and go to sleep with the necessity of the chambardement general as
      the French slang has it of the general blowup always present to his
      mind And if so how can he I am sure that if such a faith or such a
      fanaticism once mastered my thoughts I would never be able to compose
      myself sufficiently to sleep or eat or perform any of the routine acts of
      daily life I would want no wife no children I could have no friends it
      seems to me and as to collecting bronzes or china that I should say
      would be quite out of the question But I donrsquot know All I know is that
      Mr X took his meals in a very good restaurant which I frequented also
    p
    p
      With his head uncovered the silver topknot of his brushedup hair
      completed the character of his physiognomy all bony ridges and sunken
      hollows clothed in a perfect impassiveness of expression His meagre
      brown hands emerging from large white cuffs came and went breaking bread
      pouring wine and so on with quiet mechanical precision His head and
      body above the tablecloth had a rigid immobility This firebrand this
      great agitator exhibited the least possible amount of warmth and
      animation His voice was rasping cold and monotonous in a low key He
      could not be called a talkative personality but with his detached calm
      manner he appeared as ready to keep the conversation going as to drop it
      at any moment
    p
    p
      And his conversation was by no means commonplace To me I own there was
      some excitement in talking quietly across a dinnertable with a man whose
      venomous penstabs had sapped the vitality of at least one monarchy That
      much was a matter of public knowledge But I knew more I knew of himmdashfrom
      my friendmdashas a certainty what the guardians of social order in
      Europe had at most only suspected or dimly guessed at
    p
    p
      He had had what I may call his underground life And as I sat evening
      after evening facing him at dinner a curiosity in that direction would
      naturally arise in my mind I am a quiet and peaceable product of
      civilization and know no passion other than the passion for collecting
      things which are rare and must remain exquisite even if approaching to
      the monstrous Some Chinese bronzes are monstrously precious And here
      out of my friendrsquos collection here I had before me a kind of rare
      monster It is true that this monster was polished and in a sense even
      exquisite His beautiful unruffled manner was that But then he was not of
      bronze He was not even Chinese which would have enabled one to
      contemplate him calmly across the gulf of racial difference He was alive
      and European he had the manner of good society wore a coat and hat like
      mine and had pretty near the same taste in cooking It was too frightful
      to think of
    p
    p
      One evening he remarked casually in the course of conversation ldquoTherersquos
      no amendment to be got out of mankind except by terror and violencerdquo
     p
    p
      You can imagine the effect of such a phrase out of such a manrsquos mouth upon
      a person like myself whose whole scheme of life had been based upon a
      suave and delicate discrimination of social and artistic values Just
      imagine Upon me to whom all sorts and forms of violence appeared as
      unreal as the giants ogres and sevenheaded hydras whose activities
      affect fantastically the course of legends and fairytales
    p
    p
      I seemed suddenly to hear above the festive bustle and clatter of the
      brilliant restaurant the mutter of a hungry and seditious multitude
    p
    p
      I suppose I am impressionable and imaginative I had a disturbing vision
      of darkness full of lean jaws and wild eyes amongst the hundred electric
      lights of the place But somehow this vision made me angry too The sight
      of that man so calm breaking bits of white bread exasperated me And I
      had the audacity to ask him how it was that the starving proletariat of
      Europe to whom he had been preaching revolt and violence had not been made
      indignant by his openly luxurious life ldquoAt all thisrdquo I said pointedly
      with a glance round the room and at the bottle of champagne we generally
      shared between us at dinner
    p
    p
      He remained unmoved
    p
    p
      ldquoDo I feed on their toil and their heartrsquos blood Am I a speculator or a
      capitalist Did I steal my fortune from a starving people No They know
      this very well And they envy me nothing The miserable mass of the people
      is generous to its leaders What I have acquired has come to me through my
      writings not from the millions of pamphlets distributed gratis to the
      hungry and the oppressed but from the hundreds of thousands of copies
      sold to the wellfed bourgeoisie You know that my writings were at one
      time the rage the fashionmdashthe thing to read with wonder and horror
      to turn your eyes up at my pathos    or else to laugh in ecstasies at
      my witrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoYesrdquo I admitted ldquoI remember of course and I confess frankly that I
      could never understand that infatuationrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoDonrsquot you know yetrdquo he said ldquothat an idle and selfish class loves to
      see mischief being made even if it is made at its own expense Its own
      life being all a matter of pose and gesture it is unable to realize the
      power and the danger of a real movement and of words that have no sham
      meaning It is all fun and sentiment It is sufficient for instance to
      point out the attitude of the old French aristocracy towards the
      philosophers whose words were preparing the Great Revolution Even in
      England where you have some commonsense a demagogue has only to shout
      loud enough and long enough to find some backing in the very class he is
      shouting at You too like to see mischief being made The demagogue
      carries the amateurs of emotion with him Amateurism in this that and
      the other thing is a delightfully easy way of killing time and feeding
      onersquos own vanitymdashthe silly vanity of being abreast with the ideas of
      the day after tomorrow Just as good and otherwise harmless people will
      join you in ecstasies over your collection without having the slightest
      notion in what its marvellousness really consistsrdquo
     p
    p
      I hung my head It was a crushing illustration of the sad truth he
      advanced The world is full of such people And that instance of the
      French aristocracy before the Revolution was extremely telling too I
      could not traverse his statement though its cynicismmdashalways a
      distasteful traitmdashtook off much of its value to my mind However I
      admit I was impressed I felt the need to say something which would not be
      in the nature of assent and yet would not invite discussion
    p
    p
      ldquoYou donrsquot mean to sayrdquo I observed airily ldquothat extreme revolutionists
      have ever been actively assisted by the infatuation of such peoplerdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoI did not mean exactly that by what I said just now I generalized But
      since you ask me I may tell you that such help has been given to
      revolutionary activities more or less consciously in various countries
      And even in this countryrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoImpossiblerdquo I protested with firmness ldquoWe donrsquot play with fire to that
      extentrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoAnd yet you can better afford it than others perhaps But let me observe
      that most women if not always ready to play with fire are generally
      eager to play with a loose spark or sordquo
     p
    p
      ldquoIs this a jokerdquo I asked smiling
    p
    p
      ldquoIf it is I am not aware of itrdquo he said woodenly ldquoI was thinking of an
      instance Oh mild enough in a way   rdquo
     p
    p
      I became all expectation at this I had tried many times to approach him
      on his underground side so to speak The very word had been pronounced
      between us But he had always met me with his impenetrable calm
    p
    p
      ldquoAnd at the same timerdquo Mr X continued ldquoit will give you a notion of the
      difficulties that may arise in what you are pleased to call underground
      work It is sometimes difficult to deal with them Of course there is no
      hierarchy amongst the affiliated No rigid systemrdquo
     p
    p
      My surprise was great but shortlived Clearly amongst extreme
      anarchists there could be no hierarchy nothing in the nature of a law of
      precedence The idea of anarchy ruling among anarchists was comforting
      too It could not possibly make for efficiency
    p
    p
      Mr X startled me by asking abruptly ldquoYou know Hermione Streetrdquo
     p
    p
      I nodded doubtful assent Hermione Street has been within the last three
      years improved out of any manrsquos knowledge The name exists still but not
      one brick or stone of the old Hermione Street is left now It was the old
      street he meant for he said
    p
    p
      ldquoThere was a row of twostoried brick houses on the left with their backs
      against the wing of a great public buildingmdashyou remember Would it
      surprise you very much to hear that one of these houses was for a time the
      centre of anarchist propaganda and of what you would call underground
      actionrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoNot at allrdquo I declared Hermione Street had never been particularly
      respectable as I remembered it
    p
    p
      ldquoThe house was the property of a distinguished government officialrdquo he
      added sipping his champagne
    p
    p
      ldquoOh indeedrdquo I said this time not believing a word of it
    p
    p
      ldquoOf course he was not living thererdquo Mr X continued ldquoBut from ten till
      four he sat next door to it the dear man in his wellappointed private
      room in the wing of the public building Irsquove mentioned To be strictly
      accurate I must explain that the house in Hermione Street did not really
      belong to him It belonged to his grownup childrenmdasha daughter and a
      son The girl a fine figure was by no means vulgarly pretty To more
      personal charm than mere youth could account for she added the seductive
      appearance of enthusiasm of independence of courageous thought I
      suppose she put on these appearances as she put on her picturesque dresses
      and for the same reason to assert her individuality at any cost You
      know women would go to any length almost for such a purpose She went to
      a great length She had acquired all the appropriate gestures of
      revolutionary convictionsmdashthe gestures of pity of anger of
      indignation against the antihumanitarian vices of the social class to
      which she belonged herself All this sat on her striking personality as
      well as her slightly original costumes Very slightly original just
      enough to mark a protest against the philistinism of the overfed
      taskmasters of the poor Just enough and no more It would not have done
      to go too far in that directionmdashyou understand But she was of age
      and nothing stood in the way of her offering her house to the
      revolutionary workersrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoYou donrsquot mean itrdquo I cried
    p
    p
      ldquoI assure yourdquo he affirmed ldquothat she made that very practical gesture
      How else could they have got hold of it The cause is not rich And
      moreover there would have been difficulties with any ordinary
      houseagent who would have wanted references and so on The group she
      came in contact with while exploring the poor quarters of the town you
      know the gesture of charity and personal service which was so fashionable
      some years ago accepted with gratitude The first advantage was that
      Hermione Street is as you know well away from the suspect part of the
      town specially watched by the police
    p
    p
      ldquoThe ground floor consisted of a little Italian restaurant of the
      flyblown sort There was no difficulty in buying the proprietor out A
      woman and a man belonging to the group took it on The man had been a
      cook The comrades could get their meals there unnoticed amongst the
      other customers This was another advantage The first floor was occupied
      by a shabby Variety Artistsrsquo Agencymdashan agency for performers in
      inferior musichalls you know A fellow called Bomm I remember He was
      not disturbed It was rather favourable than otherwise to have a lot of
      foreignlooking people jugglers acrobats singers of both sexes and so
      on going in and out all day long The police paid no attention to new
      faces you see The top floor happened most conveniently to stand empty
      thenrdquo
     p
    p
      X interrupted himself to attack impassively with measured movements a
      bombe glacee which the waiter had just set down on the table He swallowed
      carefully a few spoonfuls of the iced sweet and asked me ldquoDid you ever
      hear of Stonersquos Dried Souprdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoHear of whatrdquo

      ldquoIt wasrdquo X pursued evenly ldquoa comestible article once rather prominently
      advertised in the dailies but which never somehow gained the favour of
      the public The enterprise fizzled out as you say here Parcels of their
      stock could be picked up at auctions at considerably less than a penny a
      pound The group bought some of it and an agency for Stonersquos Dried Soup
      was started on the top floor A perfectly respectable business The stuff
      a yellow powder of extremely unappetizing aspect was put up in large
      square tins of which six went to a case If anybody ever came to give an
      order it was of course executed But the advantage of the powder was
      this that things could be concealed in it very conveniently Now and then
      a special case got put on a van and sent off to be exported abroad under
      the very nose of the policeman on duty at the corner You understandrdquo

      ldquoI think I dordquo I said with an expressive nod at the remnants of the
      bombe melting slowly in the dish
    p
    p
      ldquoExactly But the cases were useful in another way too In the basement
      or in the cellar at the back rather two printingpresses were
      established A lot of revolutionary literature of the most inflammatory
      kind was got away from the house in Stonersquos Dried Soup cases The brother
      of our anarchist young lady found some occupation there He wrote
      articles helped to set up type and pull off the sheets and generally
      assisted the man in charge a very able young fellow called Sevrin
    p
    p
      ldquoThe guiding spirit of that group was a fanatic of social revolution He
      is dead now He was an engraver and etcher of genius You must have seen
      his work It is much sought after by certain amateurs now He began by
      being revolutionary in his art and ended by becoming a revolutionist
      after his wife and child had died in want and misery He used to say that
      the bourgeoisie the smug overfed lot had killed them That was his real
      belief He still worked at his art and led a double life He was tall
      gaunt and swarthy with a long brown beard and deepset eyes You must
      have seen him His name was Hornerdquo
     p
    p
      At this I was really startled Of course years ago I used to meet Horne
      about He looked like a powerful rough gipsy in an old top hat with a
      red muffler round his throat and buttoned up in a long shabby overcoat
      He talked of his art with exaltation and gave one the impression of being
      strung up to the verge of insanity A small group of connoisseurs
      appreciated his work Who would have thought that this man    Amazing
      And yet it was not after all so difficult to believe
    p
    p
      ldquoAs you seerdquo X went on ldquothis group was in a position to pursue its work
      of propaganda and the other kind of work too under very advantageous
      conditions They were all resolute experienced men of a superior stamp
      And yet we became struck at length by the fact that plans prepared in
      Hermione Street almost invariably failedrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoWho were lsquowersquordquo I asked pointedly
    p
    p
      ldquoSome of us in Brusselsmdashat the centrerdquo he said hastily ldquoWhatever
      vigorous action originated in Hermione Street seemed doomed to failure
      Something always happened to baffle the best planned manifestations in
      every part of Europe It was a time of general activity You must not
      imagine that all our failures are of a loud sort with arrests and trials
      That is not so Often the police work quietly almost secretly defeating
      our combinations by clever counterplotting No arrests no noise no
      alarming of the public mind and inflaming the passions It is a wise
      procedure But at that time the police were too uniformly successful from
      the Mediterranean to the Baltic It was annoying and began to look
      dangerous At last we came to the conclusion that there must be some
      untrustworthy elements amongst the London groups And I came over to see
      what could be done quietly
    p
    p
      ldquoMy first step was to call upon our young Lady Amateur of anarchism at her
      private house She received me in a flattering way I judged that she knew
      nothing of the chemical and other operations going on at the top of the
      house in Hermione Street The printing of anarchist literature was the
      only lsquoactivityrsquo she seemed to be aware of there She was displaying very
      strikingly the usual signs of severe enthusiasm and had already written
      many sentimental articles with ferocious conclusions I could see she was
      enjoying herself hugely with all the gestures and grimaces of deadly
      earnestness They suited her bigeyed broadbrowed face and the good
      carriage of her shapely head crowned by a magnificent lot of brown hair
      done in an unusual and becoming style Her brother was in the room too a
      serious youth with arched eyebrows and wearing a red necktie who struck
      me as being absolutely in the dark about everything in the world
      including himself By and by a tall young man came in He was cleanshaved
      with a strong bluish jaw and something of the air of a taciturn actor or
      of a fanatical priest the type with thick black eyebrowsmdashyou know
      But he was very presentable indeed He shook hands at once vigorously with
      each of us The young lady came up to me and murmured sweetly lsquoComrade
      Sevrinrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoI had never seen him before He had little to say to us but sat down by
      the side of the girl and they fell at once into earnest conversation She
      leaned forward in her deep armchair and took her nicely rounded chin in
      her beautiful white hand He looked attentively into her eyes It was the
      attitude of lovemaking serious intense as if on the brink of the
      grave I suppose she felt it necessary to round and complete her
      assumption of advanced ideas of revolutionary lawlessness by making
      believe to be in love with an anarchist And this one I repeat was
      extremely presentable notwithstanding his fanatical blackbrowed aspect
      After a few stolen glances in their direction I had no doubt that he was
      in earnest As to the lady her gestures were unapproachable better than
      the very thing itself in the blended suggestion of dignity sweetness
      condescension fascination surrender and reserve She interpreted her
      conception of what that precise sort of lovemaking should be with
      consummate art And so far she too no doubt was in earnest Gesturesmdashbut
      so perfect
    p
    p
      ldquoAfter I had been left alone with our Lady Amateur I informed her
      guardedly of the object of my visit I hinted at our suspicions I wanted
      to hear what she would have to say and half expected some perhaps
      unconscious revelation All she said was lsquoThatrsquos seriousrsquo looking
      delightfully concerned and grave But there was a sparkle in her eyes
      which meant plainly lsquoHow excitingrsquo After all she knew little of
      anything except of words Still she undertook to put me in communication
      with Horne who was not easy to find unless in Hermione Street where I
      did not wish to show myself just then
    p
    p
      ldquoI met Horne This was another kind of a fanatic altogether I exposed to
      him the conclusion we in Brussels had arrived at and pointed out the
      significant series of failures To this he answered with irrelevant
      exaltation
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoI have something in hand that shall strike terror into the heart of
      these gorged brutesrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoAnd then I learned that by excavating in one of the cellars of the
      house he and some companions had made their way into the vaults under the
      great public building I have mentioned before The blowing up of a whole
      wing was a certainty as soon as the materials were ready
    p
    p
      ldquoI was not so appalled at the stupidity of that move as I might have been
      had not the usefulness of our centre in Hermione Street become already
      very problematical In fact in my opinion it was much more of a police
      trap by this time than anything else
    p
    p
      ldquoWhat was necessary now was to discover what or rather who was wrong
      and I managed at last to get that idea into Hornersquos head He glared
      perplexed his nostrils working as if he were sniffing treachery in the
      air
    p
    p
      ldquoAnd here comes a piece of work which will no doubt strike you as a sort
      of theatrical expedient And yet what else could have been done The
      problem was to find out the untrustworthy member of the group But no
      suspicion could be fastened on one more than another To set a watch upon
      them all was not very practicable Besides that proceeding often fails
      In any case it takes time and the danger was pressing I felt certain
      that the premises in Hermione Street would be ultimately raided though
      the police had evidently such confidence in the informer that the house
      for the time being was not even watched Horne was positive on that
      point Under the circumstances it was an unfavourable symptom Something
      had to be done quickly
    p
    p
      ldquoI decided to organize a raid myself upon the group Do you understand A
      raid of other trusty comrades personating the police A conspiracy within
      a conspiracy You see the object of it of course When apparently about
      to be arrested I hoped the informer would betray himself in some way or
      other either by some unguarded act or simply by his unconcerned
      demeanour for instance Of coarse there was the risk of complete failure
      and the no lesser risk of some fatal accident in the course of resistance
      perhaps or in the efforts at escape For as you will easily see the
      Hermione Street group had to be actually and completely taken unawares as
      I was sure they would be by the real police before very long The informer
      was amongst them and Horne alone could be let into the secret of my plan
    p
    p
      ldquoI will not enter into the detail of my preparations It was not very easy
      to arrange but it was done very well with a really convincing effect
      The sham police invaded the restaurant whose shutters were immediately
      put up The surprise was perfect Most of the Hermione Street party were
      found in the second cellar enlarging the hole communicating with the
      vaults of the great public building At the first alarm several comrades
      bolted through impulsively into the aforesaid vault where of course had
      this been a genuine raid they would have been hopelessly trapped We did
      not bother about them for the moment They were harmless enough The top
      floor caused considerable anxiety to Horne and myself There surrounded
      by tins of Stonersquos Dried Soup a comrade nicknamed the Professor he was
      an exscience student was engaged in perfecting some new detonators He
      was an abstracted selfconfident sallow little man armed with large
      round spectacles and we were afraid that under a mistaken impression he
      would blow himself up and wreck the house about our ears I rushed
      upstairs and found him already at the door on the alert listening as he
      said to lsquosuspicious noises down belowrsquo Before I had quite finished
      explaining to him what was going on he shrugged his shoulders disdainfully
      and turned away to his balances and testtubes His was the true spirit of
      an extreme revolutionist Explosives were his faith his hope his weapon
      and his shield He perished a couple of years afterwards in a secret
      laboratory through the premature explosion of one of his improved
      detonators
    p
    p
      ldquoHurrying down again I found an impressive scene in the gloom of the big
      cellar The man who personated the inspector he was no stranger to the
      part was speaking harshly and giving bogus orders to his bogus
      subordinates for the removal of his prisoners Evidently nothing
      enlightening had happened so far Horne saturnine and swarthy waited
      with folded arms and his patient moody expectation had an air of
      stoicism well in keeping with the situation I detected in the shadows one
      of the Hermione Street group surreptitiously chewing up and swallowing a
      small piece of paper Some compromising scrap I suppose perhaps just a
      note of a few names and addresses He was a true and faithful lsquocompanionrsquo 
      But the fund of secret malice which lurks at the bottom of our sympathies
      caused me to feel amused at that perfectly uncalledfor performance
    p
    p
      ldquoIn every other respect the risky experiment the theatrical coup if you
      like to call it so seemed to have failed The deception could not be kept
      up much longer the explanation would bring about a very embarrassing and
      even grave situation The man who had eaten the paper would be furious
      The fellows who had bolted away would be angry too
    p
    p
      ldquoTo add to my vexation the door communicating with the other cellar
      where the printingpresses were flew open and our young lady
      revolutionist appeared a black silhouette in a closefitting dress and a
      large hat with the blaze of gas flaring in there at her back Over her
      shoulder I perceived the arched eyebrows and the red necktie of her
      brother
    p
    p
      ldquoThe last people in the world I wanted to see then They had gone that
      evening to some amateur concert for the delectation of the poor people
      you know but she had insisted on leaving early on purpose to call in
      Hermione Street on the way home under the pretext of having some work to
      do Her usual task was to correct the proofs of the Italian and French
      editions of the Alarm Bell and the Firebrandrdquo   
    p
    p
      ldquoHeavensrdquo I murmured I had been shown once a few copies of these
      publications Nothing in my opinion could have been less fit for the
      eyes of a young lady They were the most advanced things of the sort
      advanced I mean beyond all bounds of reason and decency One of them
      preached the dissolution of all social and domestic ties the other
      advocated systematic murder To think of a young girl calmly tracking
      printersrsquo errors all along the sort of abominable sentences I remembered
      was intolerable to my sentiment of womanhood Mr X after giving me a
      glance pursued steadily
    p
    p
      ldquoI think however that she came mostly to exercise her fascinations upon
      Sevrin and to receive his homage in her queenly and condescending way
      She was aware of bothmdashher power and his homagemdashand enjoyed
      them with I dare say complete innocence We have no ground in expediency
      or morals to quarrel with her on that account Charm in woman and
      exceptional intelligence in man are a law unto themselves Is it not sordquo
     p
    p
      I refrained from expressing my abhorrence of that licentious doctrine
      because of my curiosity
    p
    p
      ldquoBut what happened thenrdquo I hastened to ask
    p
    p
      X went on crumbling slowly a small piece of bread with a careless left
      hand
    p
    p
      ldquoWhat happened in effectrdquo he confessed ldquois that she saved the
      situationrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoShe gave you an opportunity to end your rather sinister farcerdquo I
      suggested
    p
    p
      ldquoYesrdquo he said preserving his impassive bearing ldquoThe farce was bound to
      end soon And it ended in a very few minutes And it ended well Had she
      not come in it might have ended badly Her brother of course did not
      count They had slipped into the house quietly some time before The
      printingcellar had an entrance of its own Not finding any one there she
      sat down to her proofs expecting Sevrin to return to his work at any
      moment He did not do so She grew impatient heard through the door the
      sounds of a disturbance in the other cellar and naturally came in to see
      what was the matter
    p
    p
      ldquoSevrin had been with us At first he had seemed to me the most amazed of
      the whole raided lot He appeared for an instant as if paralyzed with
      astonishment He stood rooted to the spot He never moved a limb A
      solitary gasjet flared near his head all the other lights had been put
      out at the first alarm And presently from my dark corner I observed on
      his shaven actorrsquos face an expression of puzzled vexed watchfulness He
      knitted his heavy eyebrows The corners of his mouth dropped scornfully
      He was angry Most likely he had seen through the game and I regretted I
      had not taken him from the first into my complete confidence
    p
    p
      ldquoBut with the appearance of the girl he became obviously alarmed It was
      plain I could see it grow The change of his expression was swift and
      startling And I did not know why The reason never occurred to me I was
      merely astonished at the extreme alteration of the manrsquos face Of course
      he had not been aware of her presence in the other cellar but that did
      not explain the shock her advent had given him For a moment he seemed to
      have been reduced to imbecility He opened his mouth as if to shout or
      perhaps only to gasp At any rate it was somebody else who shouted This
      somebody else was the heroic comrade whom I had detected swallowing a
      piece of paper With laudable presence of mind he let out a warning yell

    p
      ldquolsquoItrsquos the police Back Back Run back and bolt the door behind yoursquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoIt was an excellent hint but instead of retreating the girl continued to
      advance followed by her longfaced brother in his knickerbocker suit in
      which he had been singing comic songs for the entertainment of a joyless
      proletariat She advanced not as if she had failed to understandmdashthe
      word lsquopolicersquo has an unmistakable soundmdashbut rather as if she could
      not help herself She did not advance with the free gait and expanding
      presence of a distinguished amateur anarchist amongst poor struggling
      professionals but with slightly raised shoulders and her elbows pressed
      close to her body as if trying to shrink within herself Her eyes were
      fixed immovably upon Sevrin Sevrin the man I fancy not Sevrin the
      anarchist But she advanced And that was natural For all their
      assumption of independence girls of that class are used to the feeling of
      being specially protected as in fact they are This feeling accounts
      for nine tenths of their audacious gestures Her face had gone completely
      colourless Ghastly Fancy having it brought home to her so brutally that
      she was the sort of person who must run away from the police I believe
      she was pale with indignation mostly though there was of course also
      the concern for her intact personality a vague dread of some sort of
      rudeness And naturally she turned to a man to the man on whom she had
      a claim of fascination and homagemdashthe man who could not conceivably
      fail her at any juncturerdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoButrdquo I cried amazed at this analysis ldquoif it had been serious real I

      herrdquo
     p
    p
      X never moved a muscle of his face
    p
    p
      ldquoGoodness knows I imagine that this charming generous and independent
      creature had never known in her life a single genuine thought I mean a
      single thought detached from small human vanities or whose source was not
      in some conventional perception All I know is that after advancing a few
      steps she extended her hand towards the motionless Sevrin And that at
      least was no gesture It was a natural movement As to what she expected
      him to do who can tell The impossible But whatever she expected it
      could not have come up I am safe to say to what he had made up his mind
      to do even before that entreating hand had appealed to him so directly
      It had not been necessary From the moment he had seen her enter that
      cellar he had made up his mind to sacrifice his future usefulness to
      throw off the impenetrable solidly fastened mask it had been his pride to

     p
    p
      ldquoWhat do you meanrdquo I interrupted puzzled ldquoWas it Sevrin then who wasmdashrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoHe was The most persistent the most dangerous the craftiest the most
      systematic of informers A genius amongst betrayers Fortunately for us
      he was unique The man was a fanatic I have told you Fortunately again
      for us he had fallen in love with the accomplished and innocent gestures
      of that girl An actor in desperate earnest himself he must have believed
      in the absolute value of conventional signs As to the grossness of the
      trap into which he fell the explanation must be that two sentiments of
      such absorbing magnitude cannot exist simultaneously in one heart The
      danger of that other and unconscious comedian robbed him of his vision of
      his perspicacity of his judgment Indeed it did at first rob him of his
      selfpossession But he regained that through the necessitymdashas it
      appeared to him imperiouslymdashto do something at once To do what
      Why to get her out of the house as quickly as possible He was
      desperately anxious to do that I have told you he was terrified It could
      not be about himself He had been surprised and annoyed at a move quite
      unforeseen and premature I may even say he had been furious He was
      accustomed to arrange the last scene of his betrayals with a deep subtle
      art which left his revolutionist reputation untouched But it seems clear
      to me that at the same time he had resolved to make the best of it to
      keep his mask resolutely on It was only with the discovery of her being
      in the house that everythingmdashthe forced calm the restraint of his
      fanaticism the maskmdashall came off together in a kind of panic Why
      panic do you ask The answer is very simple He rememberedmdashor I
      dare say he had never forgottenmdashthe Professor alone at the top of
      the house pursuing his researches surrounded by tins upon tins of
      Stonersquos Dried Soup There was enough in some few of them to bury us all
      where we stood under a heap of bricks Sevrin of course was aware of
      that And we must believe also that he knew the exact character of the
      man He had gauged so many such characters Or perhaps he only gave the
      Professor credit for what he himself was capable of But in any case the
      effect was produced And suddenly he raised his voice in authority

      ldquolsquoGet the lady away at oncersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoIt turned out that he was as hoarse as a crow result no doubt of the
      intense emotion It passed off in a moment But these fateful words issued
      forth from his contracted throat in a discordant ridiculous croak They
      required no answer The thing was done However the man personating the
      inspector judged it expedient to say roughly

      ldquoHe dropped the lapels of the coat and plunging his hand into his breast
      jerked feverishly at something under his shirt At last he produced a
      small square pocket of soft leather which must have been hanging like a
      scapulary from his neck by the tape whose broken ends dangled from his
      fist
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoLook insidersquo he spluttered flinging it in the otherrsquos face And
      instantly he turned round towards the girl She stood just behind him

    p
    p
      ldquoHe spoke rapidly with nervous assurance I heard him distinctly promise
      her to make everything as clear as daylight presently But that was all I
      caught He stood close to her never attempting to touch her even with the
      tip of his little fingermdashand she stared at him stupidly For a
      moment however her eyelids descended slowly pathetically and then
      with the long black eyelashes lying on her white cheeks she looked ready
      to fall down in a swoon But she never even swayed where she stood He
      urged her loudly to follow him at once and walked towards the door at the
      bottom of the cellar stairs without looking behind him And as a matter
      of fact she did move after him a pace or two But of course he was not
      allowed to reach the door There were angry exclamations a short fierce
      scuffle Flung away violently he came flying backwards upon her and
      fell She threw out her arms in a gesture of dismay and stepped aside
      just clear of his head which struck the ground heavily near her shoe
    p
    p
      ldquoHe grunted with the shock By the time he had picked himself up slowly
      dazedly he was awake to the reality of things The man into whose hands
      he had thrust the leather case had extracted therefrom a narrow strip of

      expectant uneasy stillness reigned once more he threw it down
      disdainfully with the words lsquoI think comrades that this proof was

    p
      ldquoHe hung his head biting his lower lip A change had come over him a
      sort of thoughtful absorbed calmness Nevertheless he panted His sides
      worked visibly and his nostrils expanded and collapsed in weird contrast
      with his sombre aspect of a fanatical monk in a meditative attitude but
      with something too in his face of an actor intent upon the terrible
      exigencies of his part Before him Horne declaimed haggard and bearded
      like an inspired denunciatory prophet from a wilderness Two fanatics
      They were made to understand each other Does this surprise you I suppose
      you think that such people would be foaming at the mouth and snarling at
      each otherrdquo
     p
    p
      I protested hastily that I was not surprised in the least that I thought
      nothing of the kind that anarchists in general were simply inconceivable
      to me mentally morally logically sentimentally and even physically X
      received this declaration with his usual woodenness and went on
    p
    p
      ldquoHorne had burst out into eloquence While pouring out scornful invective
      he let tears escape from his eyes and roll down his black beard unheeded
      Sevrin panted quicker and quicker When he opened his mouth to speak
      everyone hung on his words
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoDonrsquot be a fool Hornersquo he began lsquoYou know very well that I have done
      this for none of the reasons you are throwing at mersquo And in a moment he
      became outwardly as steady as a rock under the otherrsquos lurid stare lsquoI
      have been thwarting deceiving and betraying youmdashfrom convictionrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoHe turned his back on Horne and addressing the girl repeated the words
      lsquoFrom convictionrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoItrsquos extraordinary how cold she looked I suppose she could not think of
      any appropriate gesture There can have been few precedents indeed for
      such a situation
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoClear as daylightrsquo he added lsquoDo you understand what that means From
      convictionrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoAnd still she did not stir She did not know what to do But the luckless
      wretch was about to give her the opportunity for a beautiful and correct
      gesture
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoI have felt in me the power to make you share this convictionrsquo he
      protested ardently He had forgotten himself he made a step towards hermdashperhaps
      he stumbled To me he seemed to be stooping low as if to touch the hem of
      her garment And then the appropriate gesture came She snatched her skirt
      away from his polluting contact and averted her head with an upward tilt
      It was magnificently done this gesture of conventionally unstained
      honour of an unblemished highminded amateur
    p
    p
      ldquoNothing could have been better And he seemed to think so too for once
      more he turned away But this time he faced no one He was again panting
      frightfully while he fumbled hurriedly in his waistcoat pocket and then
      raised his hand to his lips There was something furtive in this movement
      but directly afterwards his bearing changed His laboured breathing gave
      him a resemblance to a man who had just run a desperate race but a
      curious air of detachment of sudden and profound indifference replaced
      the strain of the striving effort The race was over I did not want to
      see what would happen next I was only too well aware I tucked the young
      ladyrsquos arm under mine without a word and made my way with her to the
      stairs
    p
    p
      ldquoHer brother walked behind us Halfway up the short flight she seemed
      unable to lift her feet high enough for the steps and we had to pull and
      push to get her to the top In the passage she dragged herself along
      hanging on my arm helplessly bent like an old woman We issued into an
      empty street through a halfopen door staggering like besotted revellers
      At the corner we stopped a fourwheeler and the ancient driver looked
      round from his box with morose scorn at our efforts to get her in Twice
      during the drive I felt her collapse on my shoulder in a half faint
      Facing us the youth in knickerbockers remained as mute as a fish and
      till he jumped out with the latchkey sat more still than I would have
      believed it possible
    p
    p
      ldquoAt the door of their drawingroom she left my arm and walked in first
      catching at the chairs and tables She unpinned her hat then exhausted
      with the effort her cloak still hanging from her shoulders flung herself
      into a deep armchair sideways her face half buried in a cushion The
      good brother appeared silently before her with a glass of water She
      motioned it away He drank it himself and walked off to a distant cornermdashbehind
      the grand piano somewhere All was still in this room where I had seen
      for the first time Sevrin the antianarchist captivated and spellbound
      by the consummate and hereditary grimaces that in a certain sphere of life
      take the place of feelings with an excellent effect I suppose her
      thoughts were busy with the same memory Her shoulders shook violently A
      pure attack of nerves When it quieted down she affected firmness lsquoWhat
      is done to a man of that sort What will they do to himrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoNothing They can do nothing to himrsquo I assured her with perfect truth
      I was pretty certain he had died in less than twenty minutes from the
      moment his hand had gone to his lips For if his fanatical antianarchism
      went even as far as carrying poison in his pocket only to rob his
      adversaries of legitimate vengeance I knew he would take care to provide
      something that would not fail him when required
    p
    p
      ldquoShe drew an angry breath There were red spots on her cheeks and a
      feverish brilliance in her eyes
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoHas ever any one been exposed to such a terrible experience To think
      that he had held my hand That manrsquo Her face twitched she gulped down a
      pathetic sob lsquoIf I ever felt sure of anything it was of Sevrinrsquos
      highminded motivesrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoThen she began to weep quietly which was good for her Then through her
      flood of tears half resentful lsquoWhat was it he said to memdashldquoFrom
      convictionrdquo It seemed a vile mockery What could he mean by itrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoThat my dear young ladyrsquo I said gently lsquois more than I or anybody
      else can ever explain to yoursquordquo
     p
    p
      Mr X flicked a crumb off the front of his coat
    p
    p
      ldquoAnd that was strictly true as to her Though Horne for instance
      understood very well and so did I especially after we had been to
      Sevrinrsquos lodging in a dismal back street of an intensely respectable
      quarter Horne was known there as a friend and we had no difficulty in
      being admitted the slatternly maid merely remarking as she let us in
      that lsquoMr Sevrin had not been home that nightrsquo We forced open a couple of
      drawers in the way of duty and found a little useful information The
      most interesting part was his diary for this man engaged in such deadly
      work had the weakness to keep a record of the most damnatory kind There
      were his acts and also his thoughts laid bare to us But the dead donrsquot
      mind that They donrsquot mind anything
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoFrom convictionrsquo Yes A vague but ardent humanitarianism had urged him
      in his first youth into the bitterest extremity of negation and revolt
      Afterwards his optimism flinched He doubted and became lost You have
      heard of converted atheists These turn often into dangerous fanatics but
      the soul remains the same After he had got acquainted with the girl
      there are to be met in that diary of his very queer politicoamorous
      rhapsodies He took her sovereign grimaces with deadly seriousness He
      longed to convert her But all this cannot interest you For the rest I
      donrsquot know if you remembermdashit is a good many years ago nowmdashthe
      journalistic sensation of the lsquoHermione Street Mysteryrsquo the finding of a
      manrsquos body in the cellar of an empty house the inquest some arrests
      many surmisesmdashthen silencemdashthe usual end for many obscure
      martyrs and confessors The fact is he was not enough of an optimist You
      must be a savage tyrannical pitiless thickandthin optimist like
      Horne for instance to make a good social rebel of the extreme type
    p
    p
      ldquoHe rose from the table A waiter hurried up with his overcoat another
      held his hat in readiness
    p
    p
      ldquoBut what became of the young ladyrdquo I asked
    p
    p
      ldquoDo you really want to knowrdquo he said buttoning himself in his fur coat
      carefully ldquoI confess to the small malice of sending her Sevrinrsquos diary
      She went into retirement then she went to Florence then she went into
      retreat in a convent I canrsquot tell where she will go next What does it

     p
    p
      ldquoHe fitted on his glossy high hat with extreme precision and casting a
      rapid glance round the room full of welldressed people innocently
      dining muttered between his teeth
    p
    p
      ldquoAnd nothing else That is why their kind is fated to perishrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoI never met Mr X again after that evening I took to dining at my club

      AN INDIGNANT TALE

    p
      Dodging in from the rainswept street I exchanged a smile and a glance
      with Miss Blank in the bar of the Three Crows This exchange was effected
      with extreme propriety It is a shock to think that if still alive Miss
      Blank must be something over sixty now How time passes
    p
    p
      Noticing my gaze directed inquiringly at the partition of glass and
      varnished wood Miss Blank was good enough to say encouragingly
    p
    p
      ldquoOnly Mr Jermyn and Mr Stonor in the parlour with another gentleman Irsquove
      never seen beforerdquo
     p
    p
      I moved towards the parlour door A voice discoursing on the other side
      it was but a matchboard partition rose so loudly that the concluding
      words became quite plain in all their atrocity
    p
    p
      ldquoThat fellow Wilmot fairly dashed her brains out and a good job toordquo
     p
    p
      This inhuman sentiment since there was nothing profane or improper in it
      failed to do as much as to check the slight yawn Miss Blank was achieving
      behind her hand And she remained gazing fixedly at the windowpanes
      which streamed with rain
    p
    p
      As I opened the parlour door the same voice went on in the same cruel
      strain
    p
    p
      ldquoI was glad when I heard she got the knock from somebody at last Sorry
      enough for poor Wilmot though That man and I used to be chums at one
      time Of course that was the end of him A clear case if there ever was
      one No way out of it None at allrdquo
     p
    p
      The voice belonged to the gentleman Miss Blank had never seen before He
      straddled his long legs on the hearthrug Jermyn leaning forward held
      his pockethandkerchief spread out before the grate He looked back
      dismally over his shoulder and as I slipped behind one of the little
      wooden tables I nodded to him On the other side of the fire imposingly
      calm and large sat Mr Stonor jammed tight into a capacious Windsor
      armchair There was nothing small about him but his short white
      sidewhiskers Yards and yards of extra superfine blue cloth made up into
      an overcoat reposed on a chair by his side And he must just have brought
      some liner from sea because another chair was smothered under his black
      waterproof ample as a pall and made of threefold oiled silk
      doublestitched throughout A manrsquos handbag of the usual size looked like
      a childrsquos toy on the floor near his feet
    p
    p
      I did not nod to him He was too big to be nodded to in that parlour He
      was a senior Trinity pilot and condescended to take his turn in the cutter
      only during the summer months He had been many times in charge of royal
      yachts in and out of Port Victoria Besides itrsquos no use nodding to a
      monument And he was like one He didnrsquot speak he didnrsquot budge He just
      sat there holding his handsome old head up immovable and almost bigger
      than life It was extremely fine Mr Stonorrsquos presence reduced poor old
      Jermyn to a mere shabby wisp of a man and made the talkative stranger in
      tweeds on the hearthrug look absurdly boyish The latter must have been a
      few years over thirty and was certainly not the sort of individual that
      gets abashed at the sound of his own voice because gathering me in as it
      were by a friendly glance he kept it going without a check
    p
    p
      ldquoI was glad of itrdquo he repeated emphatically ldquoYou may be surprised at
      it but then you havenrsquot gone through the experience Irsquove had of her I
      can tell you it was something to remember Of course I got off scot free
      myselfmdashas you can see She did her best to break up my pluck for me
      thorsquo She jolly near drove as fine a fellow as ever lived into a madhouse
      What do you say to thatmdashehrdquo
     p
    p
      Not an eyelid twitched in Mr Stonorrsquos enormous face Monumental The
      speaker looked straight into my eyes
    p
    p
      ldquoIt used to make me sick to think of her going about the world murdering
      peoplerdquo
     p
    p
      Jermyn approached the handkerchief a little nearer to the grate and
      groaned It was simply a habit he had
    p
    p
      ldquoIrsquove seen her oncerdquo he declared with mournful indifference ldquoShe had a
      housemdashrdquo
     p
    p
      The stranger in tweeds turned to stare down at him surprised
    p
    p
      ldquoShe had three housesrdquo he corrected authoritatively But Jermyn was not
      to be contradicted
    p
    p
      ldquoShe had a house I sayrdquo he repeated with dismal obstinacy ldquoA great
      big ugly white thing You could see it from miles awaymdashsticking
      uprdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoSo you couldrdquo assented the other readily ldquoIt was old Colchesterrsquos
      notion though he was always threatening to give her up He couldnrsquot stand
      her racket any more he declared it was too much of a good thing for him
      he would wash his hands of her if he never got hold of anothermdashand
      so on I daresay he would have chucked her onlymdashit may surprise youmdashhis
      missus wouldnrsquot hear of it Funny eh But with women you never know how
      they will take a thing and Mrs Colchester with her moustaches and big
      eyebrows set up for being as strongminded as they make them She used to
      walk about in a brown silk dress with a great gold cable flopping about
      her bosom You should have heard her snapping out lsquoRubbishrsquo or lsquoStuff
      and nonsensersquo I daresay she knew when she was well off They had no
      children and had never set up a home anywhere When in England she just
      made shift to hang out anyhow in some cheap hotel or boardinghouse I
      daresay she liked to get back to the comforts she was used to She knew
      very well she couldnrsquot gain by any change And moreover Colchester
      though a firstrate man was not what you may call in his first youth
      and perhaps she may have thought that he wouldnrsquot be able to get hold of
      another as he used to say so easily Anyhow for one reason or another
      it was lsquoRubbishrsquo and lsquoStuff and nonsensersquo for the good lady I overheard
      once young Mr Apse himself say to her confidentially lsquoI assure you Mrs
      Colchester I am beginning to feel quite unhappy about the name shersquos
      getting for herselfrsquo lsquoOhrsquo says she with her deep little hoarse laugh
      lsquoif one took notice of all the silly talkrsquo and she showed Apse all her
      ugly false teeth at once lsquoIt would take more than that to make me lose my
      confidence in her I assure yoursquo says sherdquo
     p
    p
      At this point without any change of facial expression Mr Stonor emitted
      a short sardonic laugh It was very impressive but I didnrsquot see the fun
      I looked from one to another The stranger on the hearthrug had an ugly
      smile
    p
    p
      ldquoAnd Mr Apse shook both Mrs Colchesterrsquos hands he was so pleased to
      hear a good word said for their favourite All these Apses young and old
      you know were perfectly infatuated with that abominable dangerousmdashrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoI beg your pardonrdquo I interrupted for he seemed to be addressing himself
      exclusively to me ldquobut who on earth are you talking aboutrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoI am talking of the Apse familyrdquo he answered courteously
    p
    p
      I nearly let out a damn at this But just then the respected Miss Blank
      put her head in and said that the cab was at the door if Mr Stonor
      wanted to catch the eleven three up
    p
    p
      At once the senior pilot arose in his mighty bulk and began to struggle
      into his coat with aweinspiring upheavals The stranger and I hurried
      impulsively to his assistance and directly we laid our hands on him he
      became perfectly quiescent We had to raise our arms very high and to
      make efforts It was like caparisoning a docile elephant With a ldquoThanks
      gentlemenrdquo he dived under and squeezed himself through the door in a
      great hurry
    p
    p
      We smiled at each other in a friendly way
    p
    p
      ldquoI wonder how he manages to hoist himself up a shiprsquos sideladderrdquo said
      the man in tweeds and poor Jermyn who was a mere North Sea pilot
      without official status or recognition of any sort pilot only by
      courtesy groaned
    p
    p
      ldquoHe makes eight hundred a yearrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoAre you a sailorrdquo I asked the stranger who had gone back to his
      position on the rug
    p
    p
      ldquoI used to be till a couple of years ago when I got marriedrdquo answered
      this communicative individual ldquoI even went to sea first in that very ship
      we were speaking of when you came inrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoWhat shiprdquo I asked puzzled ldquoI never heard you mention a shiprdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoIrsquove just told you her name my dear sirrdquo he replied ldquoThe Apse Family
      Surely yoursquove heard of the great firm of Apse amp Sons shipowners They
      had a pretty big fleet There was the Lucy Apse and the Harold Apse and
      Anne John Malcolm Clara Juliet and so onmdashno end of Apses Every
      brother sister aunt cousin wifemdashand grandmother too for all I
      knowmdashof the firm had a ship named after them Good solid
      oldfashioned craft they were too built to carry and to last None of
      your newfangled laboursaving appliances in them but plenty of men and
      plenty of good salt beef and hard tack put aboardmdashand off you go to
      fight your way out and home againrdquo
     p
    p
      The miserable Jermyn made a sound of approval which sounded like a groan
      of pain Those were the ships for him He pointed out in doleful tones
      that you couldnrsquot say to laboursaving appliances ldquoJump lively now my
      heartiesrdquo No laboursaving appliance would go aloft on a dirty night with
      the sands under your lee
    p
    p
      ldquoNordquo assented the stranger with a wink at me ldquoThe Apses didnrsquot believe
      in them either apparently They treated their people wellmdashas people
      donrsquot get treated nowadays and they were awfully proud of their ships
      Nothing ever happened to them This last one the Apse Family was to be
      like the others only she was to be still stronger still safer still
      more roomy and comfortable I believe they meant her to last for ever
      They had her built compositemdashiron teakwood and greenheart and
      her scantling was something fabulous If ever an order was given for a
      ship in a spirit of pride this one was Everything of the best The
      commodore captain of the employ was to command her and they planned the
      accommodation for him like a house on shore under a big tall poop that
      went nearly to the mainmast No wonder Mrs Colchester wouldnrsquot let the
      old man give her up Why it was the best home she ever had in all her
      married days She had a nerve that woman
    p
    p
      ldquoThe fuss that was made while that ship was building Letrsquos have this a
      little stronger and that a little heavier and hadnrsquot that other thing
      better be changed for something a little thicker The builders entered
      into the spirit of the game and there she was growing into the
      clumsiest heaviest ship of her size right before all their eyes without
      anybody becoming aware of it somehow She was to be  tons register
      or a little over no less on any account But see what happens When they
      came to measure her she turned out  tons and a fraction General
      consternation And they say old Mr Apse was so annoyed when they told him
      that he took to his bed and died The old gentleman had retired from the
      firm twentyfive years before and was ninetysix years old if a day so
      his death wasnrsquot perhaps so surprising Still Mr Lucian Apse was
      convinced that his father would have lived to a hundred So we may put him
      at the head of the list Next comes the poor devil of a shipwright that
      brute caught and squashed as she went off the ways They called it the
      launch of a ship but Irsquove heard people say that from the wailing and
      yelling and scrambling out of the way it was more like letting a devil
      loose upon the river She snapped all her checks like packthread and
      went for the tugs in attendance like a fury Before anybody could see what
      she was up to she sent one of them to the bottom and laid up another for
      three monthsrsquo repairs One of her cables parted and then suddenlymdashyou
      couldnrsquot tell whymdashshe let herself be brought up with the other as
      quiet as a lamb
    p
    p
      ldquoThatrsquos how she was You could never be sure what she would be up to next
      There are ships difficult to handle but generally you can depend on them
      behaving rationally With that ship whatever you did with her you never
      knew how it would end She was a wicked beast Or perhaps she was only
      just insanerdquo
     p
    p
      He uttered this supposition in so earnest a tone that I could not refrain
      from smiling He left off biting his lower lip to apostrophize me
    p
    p
      ldquoEh Why not Why couldnrsquot there be something in her build in her lines
      corresponding tomdashWhatrsquos madness Only something just a tiny bit
      wrong in the make of your brain Why shouldnrsquot there be a mad shipmdashI
      mean mad in a shiplike way so that under no circumstances could you be
      sure she would do what any other sensible ship would naturally do for you
      There are ships that steer wildly and ships that canrsquot be quite trusted
      always to stay others want careful watching when running in a gale and
      again there may be a ship that will make heavy weather of it in every
      little blow But then you expect her to be always so You take it as part
      of her character as a ship just as you take account of a manrsquos
      peculiarities of temper when you deal with him But with her you couldnrsquot
      She was unaccountable If she wasnrsquot mad then she was the most
      evilminded underhand savage brute that ever went afloat Irsquove seen her
      run in a heavy gale beautifully for two days and on the third broach to
      twice in the same afternoon The first time she flung the helmsman clean
      over the wheel but as she didnrsquot quite manage to kill him she had another
      try about three hours afterwards She swamped herself fore and aft burst
      all the canvas we had set scared all hands into a panic and even
      frightened Mrs Colchester down there in these beautiful stern cabins that
      she was so proud of When we mustered the crew there was one man missing
      Swept overboard of course without being either seen or heard poor
      devil and I only wonder more of us didnrsquot go
    p
    p
      ldquoAlways something like that Always I heard an old mate tell Captain
      Colchester once that it had come to this with him that he was afraid to
      open his mouth to give any sort of order She was as much of a terror in
      harbour as at sea You could never be certain what would hold her On the
      slightest provocation she would start snapping ropes cables wire
      hawsers like carrots She was heavy clumsy unhandymdashbut that does
      not quite explain that power for mischief she had You know somehow when
      I think of her I canrsquot help remembering what we hear of incurable lunatics
      breaking loose now and thenrdquo
     p
    p
      He looked at me inquisitively But of course I couldnrsquot admit that a
      ship could be mad
    p
    p
      ldquoIn the ports where she was knownrdquo he went onrsquo ldquothey dreaded the sight
      of her She thought nothing of knocking away twenty feet or so of solid
      stone facing off a quay or wiping off the end of a wooden wharf She must
      have lost miles of chain and hundreds of tons of anchors in her time When
      she fell aboard some poor unoffending ship it was the very devil of a job
      to haul her off again And she never got hurt herselfmdashjust a few
      scratches or so perhaps They had wanted to have her strong And so she
      was Strong enough to ram Polar ice with And as she began so she went on
      From the day she was launched she never let a year pass without murdering
      somebody I think the owners got very worried about it But they were a
      stiffnecked generation all these Apses they wouldnrsquot admit there could
      be anything wrong with the Apse Family They wouldnrsquot even change her
      name lsquoStuff and nonsensersquo as Mrs Colchester used to say They ought at
      least to have shut her up for life in some dry dock or other away up the
      river and never let her smell salt water again I assure you my dear
      sir that she invariably did kill someone every voyage she made It was
      perfectly wellknown She got a name for it far and widerdquo
     p
    p
      I expressed my surprise that a ship with such a deadly reputation could
      ever get a crew
    p
    p
      ldquoThen you donrsquot know what sailors are my dear sir Let me just show you
      by an instance One day in dock at home while loafing on the forecastle
      head I noticed two respectable salts come along one a middleaged
      competent steady man evidently the other a smart youngish chap They
      read the name on the bows and stopped to look at her Says the elder man
      lsquoApse Family Thatrsquos the sanguinary female dogrsquo Irsquom putting it in that
      way lsquoof a ship Jack that kills a man every voyage I wouldnrsquot sign in
      hermdashnot for Joe I wouldnrsquotrsquo And the other says lsquoIf she were mine
      Irsquod have her towed on the mud and set on fire blame if I wouldnrsquotrsquo Then
      the first man chimes in lsquoMuch do they care Men are cheap God knowsrsquo 
      The younger one spat in the water alongside lsquoThey wonrsquot have memdashnot
      for double wagesrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoThey hung about for some time and then walked up the dock Half an hour
      later I saw them both on our deck looking about for the mate and
      apparently very anxious to be taken on And they wererdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoHow do you account for thisrdquo I asked
    p
    p
      ldquoWhat would you sayrdquo he retorted ldquoRecklessness The vanity of boasting
      in the evening to all their chums lsquoWersquove just shipped in that there Apse
      Family Blow her She ainrsquot going to scare usrsquo Sheer sailorlike
      perversity A sort of curiosity Wellmdasha little of all that no
      doubt I put the question to them in the course of the voyage The answer
      of the elderly chap was
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoA man can die but oncersquo The younger assured me in a mocking tone that
      he wanted to see lsquohow she would do it this timersquo But I tell you what
      there was a sort of fascination about the bruterdquo
     p
    p
      Jermyn who seemed to have seen every ship in the world broke in sulkily
    p
    p
      ldquoI saw her once out of this very window towing up the river a great black
      ugly thing going along like a big hearserdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoSomething sinister about her looks wasnrsquot thererdquo said the man in
      tweeds looking down at old Jermyn with a friendly eye ldquoI always had a
      sort of horror of her She gave me a beastly shock when I was no more than
      fourteen the very first daymdashnay hourmdashI joined her Father
      came up to see me off and was to go down to Gravesend with us I was his
      second boy to go to sea My big brother was already an officer then We
      got on board about eleven in the morning and found the ship ready to drop
      out of the basin stern first She had not moved three times her own
      length when at a little pluck the tug gave her to enter the dock gates
      she made one of her rampaging starts and put such a weight on the check
      ropemdasha new sixinch hawsermdashthat forward there they had no
      chance to ease it round in time and it parted I saw the broken end fly
      up high in the air and the next moment that brute brought her quarter
      against the pierhead with a jar that staggered everybody about her decks
      She didnrsquot hurt herself Not she But one of the boys the mate had sent
      aloft on the mizzen to do something came down on the poopdeckmdashthumpmdashright
      in front of me He was not much older than myself We had been grinning at
      each other only a few minutes before He must have been handling himself
      carelessly not expecting to get such a jerk I heard his startled crymdashOhmdashin
      a high treble as he felt himself going and looked up in time to see him
      go limp all over as he fell Ough Poor father was remarkably white about
      the gills when we shook hands in Gravesend lsquoAre you all rightrsquo he says
      looking hard at me lsquoYes fatherrsquo lsquoQuite surersquo lsquoYes fatherrsquo lsquoWell
      then goodbye my boyrsquo He told me afterwards that for half a word he
      would have carried me off home with him there and then I am the baby of
      the familymdashyou knowrdquo added the man in tweeds stroking his
      moustache with an ingenuous smile
    p
    p
      I acknowledged this interesting communication by a sympathetic murmur He
      waved his hand carelessly
    p
    p
      ldquoThis might have utterly spoiled a chaprsquos nerve for going aloft you knowmdashutterly
      He fell within two feet of me cracking his head on a mooringbitt Never
      moved Stone dead Nice looking little fellow he was I had just been
      thinking we would be great chums However that wasnrsquot yet the worst that
      brute of a ship could do I served in her three years of my time and then
      I got transferred to the Lucy Apse for a year The sailmaker we had in
      the Apse Family turned up there too and I remember him saying to me one
      evening after we had been a week at sea Isnrsquot she a meek little shiprsquo 
      No wonder we thought the Lucy Apse a dear meek little ship after getting
      clear of that big rampaging savage brute It was like heaven Her
      officers seemed to me the restfullest lot of men on earth To me who had
      known no ship but the Apse Family the Lucy was like a sort of magic craft
      that did what you wanted her to do of her own accord One evening we got
      caught aback pretty sharply from right ahead In about ten minutes we had
      her full again sheets aft tacks down decks cleared and the officer of
      the watch leaning against the weather rail peacefully It seemed simply
      marvellous to me The other would have stuck for halfanhour in irons
      rolling her decks full of water knocking the men aboutmdashspars
      cracking braces snapping yards taking charge and a confounded scare
      going on aft because of her beastly rudder which she had a way of
      flapping about fit to raise your hair on end I couldnrsquot get over my
      wonder for days
    p
    p
      ldquoWell I finished my last year of apprenticeship in that jolly little shipmdashshe
      wasnrsquot so little either but after that other heavy devil she seemed but a
      plaything to handle I finished my time and passed and then just as I was
      thinking of having three weeks of real good time on shore I got at
      breakfast a letter asking me the earliest day I could be ready to join the
      Apse Family as third mate I gave my plate a shove that shot it into the
      middle of the table dad looked up over his paper mother raised her hands
      in astonishment and I went out bareheaded into our bit of garden where
      I walked round and round for an hour
    p
    p
      ldquoWhen I came in again mother was out of the diningroom and dad had
      shifted berth into his big armchair The letter was lying on the
      mantelpiece
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoItrsquos very creditable to you to get the offer and very kind of them to
      make itrsquo he said lsquoAnd I see also that Charles has been appointed chief
      mate of that ship for one voyagersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoThere was over leaf a PS to that effect in Mr Apsersquos own
      handwriting which I had overlooked Charley was my big brother
    p
    p
      ldquoI donrsquot like very much to have two of my boys together in one shiprsquo 
      father goes on in his deliberate solemn way lsquoAnd I may tell you that I
      would not mind writing Mr Apse a letter to that effectrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoDear old dad He was a wonderful father What would you have done The
      mere notion of going back and as an officer too to be worried and
      bothered and kept on the jump night and day by that brute made me feel
      sick But she wasnrsquot a ship you could afford to fight shy of Besides the
      most genuine excuse could not be given without mortally offending Apse
      amp Sons The firm and I believe the whole family down to the old
      unmarried aunts in Lancashire had grown desperately touchy about that
      accursed shiprsquos character This was the case for answering lsquoReady nowrsquo 
      from your very deathbed if you wished to die in their good graces And
      thatrsquos precisely what I did answermdashby wire to have it over and done
      with at once
    p
    p
      ldquoThe prospect of being shipmates with my big brother cheered me up
      considerably though it made me a bit anxious too Ever since I remember
      myself as a little chap he had been very good to me and I looked upon him
      as the finest fellow in the world And so he was No better officer ever
      walked the deck of a merchant ship And thatrsquos a fact He was a fine
      strong upstanding suntanned young fellow with his brown hair curling
      a little and an eye like a hawk He was just splendid We hadnrsquot seen
      each other for many years and even this time though he had been in
      England three weeks already he hadnrsquot showed up at home yet but had
      spent his spare time in Surrey somewhere making up to Maggie Colchester
      old Captain Colchesterrsquos niece Her father a great friend of dadrsquos was
      in the sugarbroking business and Charley made a sort of second home of
      their house I wondered what my big brother would think of me There was a
      sort of sternness about Charleyrsquos face which never left it not even when
      he was larking in his rather wild fashion
    p
    p
      ldquoHe received me with a great shout of laughter He seemed to think my
      joining as an officer the greatest joke in the world There was a
      difference of ten years between us and I suppose he remembered me best in
      pinafores I was a kid of four when he first went to sea It surprised me
      to find how boisterous he could be
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoNow we shall see what you are made ofrsquo he cried And he held me off by
      the shoulders and punched my ribs and hustled me into his berth lsquoSit
      down Ned I am glad of the chance of having you with me Irsquoll put the
      finishing touch to you my young officer providing yoursquore worth the
      trouble And first of all get it well into your head that we are not
      going to let this brute kill anybody this voyage Wersquoll stop her racketrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoI perceived he was in dead earnest about it He talked grimly of the
      ship and how we must be careful and never allow this ugly beast to catch
      us napping with any of her damned tricks
    p
    p
      ldquoHe gave me a regular lecture on special seamanship for the use of the
      Apse Family then changing his tone he began to talk at large rattling
      off the wildest funniest nonsense till my sides ached with laughing I
      could see very well he was a bit above himself with high spirits It
      couldnrsquot be because of my coming Not to that extent But of course I
      wouldnrsquot have dreamt of asking what was the matter I had a proper respect
      for my big brother I can tell you But it was all made plain enough a day
      or two afterwards when I heard that Miss Maggie Colchester was coming for
      the voyage Uncle was giving her a seatrip for the benefit of her health
    p
    p
      ldquoI donrsquot know what could have been wrong with her health She had a
      beautiful colour and a deuce of a lot of fair hair She didnrsquot care a rap
      for wind or rain or spray or sun or green seas or anything She was a
      blueeyed jolly girl of the very best sort but the way she cheeked my
      big brother used to frighten me I always expected it to end in an awful
      row However nothing decisive happened till after we had been in Sydney
      for a week One day in the menrsquos dinner hour Charley sticks his head
      into my cabin I was stretched out on my back on the settee smoking in
      peace
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoCome ashore with me Nedrsquo he says in his curt way
    p
    p
      ldquoI jumped up of course and away after him down the gangway and up George
      Street He strode along like a giant and I at his elbow panting It was
      confoundedly hot lsquoWhere on earth are you rushing me to Charleyrsquo I made
      bold to ask
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoHerersquo he says
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoHerersquo was a jewellerrsquos shop I couldnrsquot imagine what he could want
      there It seemed a sort of mad freak He thrusts under my nose three
      rings which looked very tiny on his big brown palm growling outmdash
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoFor Maggie Whichrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoI got a kind of scare at this I couldnrsquot make a sound but I pointed at
      the one that sparkled white and blue He put it in his waistcoat pocket
      paid for it with a lot of sovereigns and bolted out When we got on board
      I was quite out of breath lsquoShake hands old chaprsquo I gasped out He gave
      me a thump on the back lsquoGive what orders you like to the boatswain when
      the hands turntorsquo says he lsquoI am off duty this afternoonrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoThen he vanished from the deck for a while but presently he came out of
      the cabin with Maggie and these two went over the gangway publicly
      before all hands going for a walk together on that awful blazing hot
      day with clouds of dust flying about They came back after a few hours
      looking very staid but didnrsquot seem to have the slightest idea where they
      had been Anyway thatrsquos the answer they both made to Mrs Colchesterrsquos
      question at teatime
    p
    p
      ldquoAnd didnrsquot she turn on Charley with her voice like an old night
      cabmanrsquos lsquoRubbish Donrsquot know where yoursquove been Stuff and nonsense
      Yoursquove walked the girl off her legs Donrsquot do it againrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoItrsquos surprising how meek Charley could be with that old woman Only on
      one occasion he whispered to me lsquoIrsquom jolly glad she isnrsquot Maggiersquos aunt
      except by marriage Thatrsquos no sort of relationshiprsquo But I think he let
      Maggie have too much of her own way She was hopping all over that ship in
      her yachting skirt and a red tam orsquo shanter like a bright bird on a dead
      black tree The old salts used to grin to themselves when they saw her
      coming along and offered to teach her knots or splices I believe she
      liked the men for Charleyrsquos sake I suppose
    p
    p
      ldquoAs you may imagine the fiendish propensities of that cursed ship were
      never spoken of on board Not in the cabin at any rate Only once on the
      homeward passage Charley said incautiously something about bringing all
      her crew home this time Captain Colchester began to look uncomfortable at
      once and that silly hardbitten old woman flew out at Charley as though
      he had said something indecent I was quite confounded myself as to
      Maggie she sat completely mystified opening her blue eyes very wide Of
      course before she was a day older she wormed it all out of me She was a
      very difficult person to lie to
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoHow awfulrsquo she said quite solemn lsquoSo many poor fellows I am glad the
      voyage is nearly over I wonrsquot have a momentrsquos peace about Charley nowrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoI assured her Charley was all right It took more than that ship knew to
      get over a seaman like Charley And she agreed with me
    p
    p
      ldquoNext day we got the tug off Dungeness and when the towrope was fast
      Charley rubbed his hands and said to me in an undertonemdash
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoWersquove baffled her Nedrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoLooks like itrsquo I said with a grin at him It was beautiful weather
      and the sea as smooth as a millpond We went up the river without a shadow
      of trouble except once when off Hole Haven the brute took a sudden sheer
      and nearly had a barge anchored just clear of the fairway But I was aft
      looking after the steering and she did not catch me napping that time
      Charley came up on the poop looking very concerned lsquoClose shaversquo says
      he
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoNever mind Charleyrsquo I answered cheerily lsquoYoursquove tamed herrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoWe were to tow right up to the dock The river pilot boarded us below
      Gravesend and the first words I heard him say were lsquoYou may just as well
      take your port anchor inboard at once Mr Matersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoThis had been done when I went forward I saw Maggie on the forecastle
      head enjoying the bustle and I begged her to go aft but she took no
      notice of me of course Then Charley who was very busy with the head
      gear caught sight of her and shouted in his biggest voice lsquoGet off the
      forecastle head Maggie Yoursquore in the way herersquo For all answer she made
      a funny face at him and I saw poor Charley turn away hiding a smile She
      was flushed with the excitement of getting home again and her blue eyes
      seemed to snap electric sparks as she looked at the river A collier brig
      had gone round just ahead of us and our tug had to stop her engines in a
      hurry to avoid running into her
    p
    p
      ldquoIn a moment as is usually the case all the shipping in the reach seemed
      to get into a hopeless tangle A schooner and a ketch got up a small
      collision all to themselves right in the middle of the river It was
      exciting to watch and meantime our tug remained stopped Any other ship
      than that brute could have been coaxed to keep straight for a couple of
      minutesmdashbut not she Her head fell off at once and she began to
      drift down taking her tug along with her I noticed a cluster of coasters
      at anchor within a quarter of a mile of us and I thought I had better
      speak to the pilot lsquoIf you let her get amongst that lotrsquo I said
      quietly lsquoshe will grind some of them to bits before we get her out
      againrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoDonrsquot I know herrsquo cries he stamping his foot in a perfect fury And he
      out with his whistle to make that bothered tug get the shiprsquos head up
      again as quick as possible He blew like mad waving his arm to port and
      presently we could see that the tugrsquos engines had been set going ahead
      Her paddles churned the water but it was as if she had been trying to tow
      a rockmdashshe couldnrsquot get an inch out of that ship Again the pilot
      blew his whistle and waved his arm to port We could see the tugrsquos
      paddles turning faster and faster away broad on our bow
    p
    p
      ldquoFor a moment tug and ship hung motionless in a crowd of moving shipping
      and then the terrific strain that evil stonyhearted brute would always
      put on everything tore the towingchock clean out The towrope surged
      over snapping the iron stanchions of the headrail one after another as
      if they had been sticks of sealingwax It was only then I noticed that in
      order to have a better view over our heads Maggie had stepped upon the
      port anchor as it lay flat on the forecastle deck
    p
    p
      ldquoIt had been lowered properly into its hardwood beds but there had been
      no time to take a turn with it Anyway it was quite secure as it was for
      going into dock but I could see directly that the towrope would sweep
      under the fluke in another second My heart flew up right into my throat
      but not before I had time to yell out lsquoJump clear of that anchorrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoBut I hadnrsquot time to shriek out her name I donrsquot suppose she heard me at
      all The first touch of the hawser against the fluke threw her down she
      was up on her feet again quick as lightning but she was up on the wrong
      side I heard a horrid scraping sound and then that anchor tipping
      over rose up like something alive its great rough iron arm caught
      Maggie round the waist seemed to clasp her close with a dreadful hug and
      flung itself with her over and down in a terrific clang of iron followed
      by heavy ringing blows that shook the ship from stem to sternmdashbecause
      the ring stopper heldrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoHow horriblerdquo I exclaimed
    p
    p
      ldquoI used to dream for years afterwards of anchors catching hold of girlsrdquo
       said the man in tweeds a little wildly He shuddered ldquoWith a most
      pitiful howl Charley was over after her almost on the instant But Lord
      he didnrsquot see as much as a gleam of her red tam orsquo shanter in the water
      Nothing nothing whatever In a moment there were halfadozen boats
      around us and he got pulled into one I with the boatswain and the
      carpenter let go the other anchor in a hurry and brought the ship up
      somehow The pilot had gone silly He walked up and down the forecastle
      head wringing his hands and muttering to himself lsquoKilling women now
      Killing women nowrsquo Not another word could you get out of him
    p
    p
      ldquoDusk fell then a night black as pitch and peering upon the river I
      heard a low mournful hail lsquoShip ahoyrsquo Two Gravesend watermen came
      alongside They had a lantern in their wherry and looked up the shiprsquos
      side holding on to the ladder without a word I saw in the patch of light
      a lot of loose fair hair down thererdquo
     p
    p
      He shuddered again
    p
    p
      ldquoAfter the tide turned poor Maggiersquos body had floated clear of one of them
      big mooring buoysrdquo he explained ldquoI crept aft feeling halfdead and
      managed to send a rocket upmdashto let the other searchers know on the
      river And then I slunk away forward like a cur and spent the night
      sitting on the heel of the bowsprit so as to be as far as possible out of
      Charleyrsquos wayrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoPoor fellowrdquo I murmured
    p
    p
      ldquoYes Poor fellowrdquo he repeated musingly ldquoThat brute wouldnrsquot let himmdashnot
      even himmdashcheat her of her prey But he made her fast in dock next
      morning He did We hadnrsquot exchanged a wordmdashnot a single look for
      that matter I didnrsquot want to look at him When the last rope was fast he
      put his hands to his head and stood gazing down at his feet as if trying
      to remember something The men waited on the main deck for the words that
      end the voyage Perhaps that is what he was trying to remember I spoke
      for him lsquoThatrsquoll do menrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoI never saw a crew leave a ship so quietly They sneaked over the rail
      one after another taking care not to bang their sea chests too heavily
      They looked our way but not one had the stomach to come up and offer to
      shake hands with the mate as is usual
    p
    p
      ldquoI followed him all over the empty ship to and fro here and there with
      no living soul about but the two of us because the old shipkeeper had
      locked himself up in the galleymdashboth doors Suddenly poor Charley
      mutters in a crazy voice lsquoIrsquom done herersquo and strides down the gangway
      with me at his heels up the dock out at the gate on towards Tower Hill
      He used to take rooms with a decent old landlady in America Square to be
      near his work
    p
    p
      ldquoAll at once he stops short turns round and comes back straight at me
      lsquoNedrsquo says he I am going homersquo I had the good luck to sight a
      fourwheeler and got him in just in time His legs were beginning to give
      way In our hall he fell down on a chair and Irsquoll never forget fatherrsquos
      and motherrsquos amazed perfectly still faces as they stood over him They
      couldnrsquot understand what had happened to him till I blubbered out lsquoMaggie

    p
    p
      ldquoMother let out a little cry Father looks from him to me and from me to
      him as if comparing our facesmdashfor upon my soul Charley did not
      resemble himself at all Nobody moved and the poor fellow raises his big
      brown hands slowly to his throat and with one single tug rips everything
      openmdashcollar shirt waistcoatmdasha perfect wreck and ruin of a
      man Father and I got him upstairs somehow and mother pretty nearly
      killed herself nursing him through a brain feverrdquo
     p
    p
      The man in tweeds nodded at me significantly
    p
    p
      ldquoAh there was nothing that could be done with that brute She had a devil
      in herrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoWherersquos your brotherrdquo I asked expecting to hear he was dead But he was
      commanding a smart steamer on the China coast and never came home now
    p
    p
      Jermyn fetched a heavy sigh and the handkerchief being now sufficiently
      dry put it up tenderly to his red and lamentable nose
    p
    p
      ldquoShe was a ravening beastrdquo the man in tweeds started again ldquoOld
      Colchester put his foot down and resigned And would you believe it Apse
      amp Sons wrote to ask whether he wouldnrsquot reconsider his decision
      Anything to save the good name of the Apse Familyrsquo Old Colchester went to
      the office then and said that he would take charge again but only to sail
      her out into the North Sea and scuttle her there He was nearly off his
      chump He used to be darkish irongrey but his hair went snowwhite in a
      fortnight And Mr Lucian Apse they had known each other as young men
      pretended not to notice it Eh Herersquos infatuation if you like Herersquos
      pride for you
    p
    p
      ldquoThey jumped at the first man they could get to take her for fear of the
      scandal of the Apse Family not being able to find a skipper He was a
      festive soul I believe but he stuck to her grim and hard Wilmot was his
      second mate A harumscarum fellow and pretending to a great scorn for
      all the girls The fact is he was really timid But let only one of them
      do as much as lift her little finger in encouragement and there was
      nothing that could hold the beggar As apprentice once he deserted
      abroad after a petticoat and would have gone to the dogs then if his
      skipper hadnrsquot taken the trouble to find him and lug him by the ears out
      of some house of perdition or other
    p
    p
      ldquoIt was said that one of the firm had been heard once to express a hope
      that this brute of a ship would get lost soon I can hardly credit the
      tale unless it might have been Mr Alfred Apse whom the family didnrsquot
      think much of They had him in the office but he was considered a bad egg
      altogether always flying off to race meetings and coming home drunk You
      would have thought that a ship so full of deadly tricks would run herself
      ashore some day out of sheer cussedness But not she She was going to
      last for ever She had a nose to keep off the bottomrdquo
     p
    p
      Jermyn made a grunt of approval
    p
    p
      ldquoA ship after a pilotrsquos own heart ehrdquo jeered the man in tweeds ldquoWell
      Wilmot managed it He was the man for it but even he perhaps couldnrsquot
      have done the trick without the greeneyed governess or nurse or
      whatever she was to the children of Mr and Mrs Pamphilius
    p
    p
      ldquoThose people were passengers in her from Port Adelaide to the Cape Well
      the ship went out and anchored outside for the day The skippermdashhospitable
      soulmdashhad a lot of guests from town to a farewell lunchmdashas
      usual with him It was five in the evening before the last shore boat left
      the side and the weather looked ugly and dark in the gulf There was no
      reason for him to get under way However as he had told everybody he was
      going that day he imagined it was proper to do so anyhow But as he had
      no mind after all these festivities to tackle the straits in the dark
      with a scant wind he gave orders to keep the ship under lower topsails
      and foresail as close as she would lie dodging along the land till the
      morning Then he sought his virtuous couch The mate was on deck having
      his face washed very clean with hard rain squalls Wilmot relieved him at
      midnight
    p
    p
      ldquoThe Apse Family had as you observed a house on her poop   rdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoA big ugly white thing sticking uprdquo Jermyn murmured sadly at the
      fire
    p
    p
      ldquoThatrsquos it a companion for the cabin stairs and a sort of chartroom
      combined The rain drove in gusts on the sleepy Wilmot The ship was then
      surging slowly to the southward close hauled with the coast within three
      miles or so to windward There was nothing to look out for in that part of
      the gulf and Wilmot went round to dodge the squalls under the lee of that
      chartroom whose door on that side was open The night was black like a
      barrel of coaltar And then he heard a womanrsquos voice whispering to him
    p
    p
      ldquoThat confounded greeneyed girl of the Pamphilius people had put the kids
      to bed a long time ago of course but it seems couldnrsquot get to sleep
      herself She heard eight bells struck and the chief mate come below to
      turn in She waited a bit then got into her dressinggown and stole
      across the empty saloon and up the stairs into the chartroom She sat
      down on the settee near the open door to cool herself I daresay
    p
    p
      ldquoI suppose when she whispered to Wilmot it was as if somebody had struck a
      match in the fellowrsquos brain I donrsquot know how it was they had got so very
      thick I fancy he had met her ashore a few times before I couldnrsquot make
      it out because when telling the story Wilmot would break off to swear
      something awful at every second word We had met on the quay in Sydney
      and he had an apron of sacking up to his chin a big whip in his hand A
      wagondriver Glad to do anything not to starve Thatrsquos what he had come
      down to
    p
    p
      ldquoHowever there he was with his head inside the door on the girlrsquos
      shoulder as likely as notmdashofficer of the watch The helmsman on
      giving his evidence afterwards said that he shouted several times that
      the binnacle lamp had gone out It didnrsquot matter to him because his
      orders were to lsquosail her closersquo lsquoI thought it funnyrsquo he said lsquothat the
      ship should keep on falling off in squalls but I luffed her up every time
      as close as I was able It was so dark I couldnrsquot see my hand before my
      face and the rain came in bucketfuls on my headrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoThe truth was that at every squall the wind hauled aft a little till
      gradually the ship came to be heading straight for the coast without a
      single soul in her being aware of it Wilmot himself confessed that he had
      not been near the standard compass for an hour He might well have
      confessed The first thing he knew was the man on the lookout shouting
      blue murder forward there
    p
    p
      ldquoHe tore his neck free he says and yelled back at him lsquoWhat do you
      sayrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoI think I hear breakers ahead sirrsquo howled the man and came rushing
      aft with the rest of the watch in the lsquoawfullest blinding deluge that
      ever fell from the skyrsquo Wilmot says For a second or so he was so scared
      and bewildered that he could not remember on which side of the gulf the
      ship was He wasnrsquot a good officer but he was a seaman all the same He
      pulled himself together in a second and the right orders sprang to his
      lips without thinking They were to hard up with the helm and shiver the
      main and mizzentopsails
    p
    p
      ldquoIt seems that the sails actually fluttered He couldnrsquot see them but he
      heard them rattling and banging above his head lsquoNo use She was too slow
      in going offrsquo he went on his dirty face twitching and the damnrsquod
      carterrsquos whip shaking in his hand lsquoShe seemed to stick fastrsquo And then
      the flutter of the canvas above his head ceased At this critical moment
      the wind hauled aft again with a gust filling the sails and sending the
      ship with a great way upon the rocks on her lee bow She had overreached
      herself in her last little game Her time had comemdashthe hour the
      man the black night the treacherous gust of windmdashthe right woman
      to put an end to her The brute deserved nothing better Strange are the
      instruments of Providence Therersquos a sort of poetical justicemdashrdquo
     p
    p
      The man in tweeds looked hard at me
    p
    p
      ldquoThe first ledge she went over stripped the false keel off her Rip The
      skipper rushing out of his berth found a crazy woman in a red flannel
      dressinggown flying round and round the cuddy screeching like a
      cockatoo
    p
    p
      ldquoThe next bump knocked her clean under the cabin table It also started
      the sternpost and carried away the rudder and then that brute ran up a
      shelving rocky shore tearing her bottom out till she stopped short and

     p
    p
      ldquoAnybody lostrdquo I asked
    p
    p
      ldquoNo one unless that fellow Wilmotrdquo answered the gentleman unknown to
      Miss Blank looking round for his cap ldquoAnd his case was worse than
      drowning for a man Everybody got ashore all right Gale didnrsquot come on
      till next day dead from the West and broke up that brute in a
      surprisingly short time It was as though she had been rotten at heartrdquo 
        He changed his tone ldquoRain left off I must get my bike and rush home
      to dinner I live in Herne Baymdashcame out for a spin this morningrdquo
     p
    p
      He nodded at me in a friendly way and went out with a swagger
    p
    p
      ldquoDo you know who he is Jermynrdquo I asked
    p
    p
      The North Sea pilot shook his head dismally ldquoFancy losing a ship in that
      silly fashion Oh dear oh dearrdquo he groaned in lugubrious tones
      spreading his damp handkerchief again like a curtain before the glowing
      grate
    p
    p
      On going out I exchanged a glance and a smile strictly proper with the
      respectable Miss Blank barmaid of the Three Crows

      A DESPERATE TALE
    h
    p
      That year I spent the best two months of the dry season on one of the
      estatesmdashin fact on the principal cattle estatemdashof a famous
      meatextract manufacturing company
    p
    p
      BOS Bos You have seen the three magic letters on the advertisement
      pages of magazines and newspapers in the windows of provision merchants
      and on calendars for next year you receive by post in the month of
      November They scatter pamphlets also written in a sickly enthusiastic
      style and in several languages giving statistics of slaughter and
      bloodshed enough to make a Turk turn faint The ldquoartrdquo illustrating that
      ldquoliteraturerdquo represents in vivid and shining colours a large and enraged
      black bull stamping upon a yellow snake writhing in emeraldgreen grass
      with a cobaltblue sky for a background It is atrocious and it is an
      allegory The snake symbolizes disease weaknessmdashperhaps mere
      hunger which last is the chronic disease of the majority of mankind Of
      course everybody knows the B O S Ltd with its unrivalled products
      Vinobos Jellybos and the latest unequalled perfection Tribos whose
      nourishment is offered to you not only highly concentrated but already
      half digested Such apparently is the love that Limited Company bears to
      its fellowmenmdasheven as the love of the father and mother penguin for
      their hungry fledglings
    p
    p
      Of course the capital of a country must be productively employed I have
      nothing to say against the company But being myself animated by feelings
      of affection towards my fellowmen I am saddened by the modern system of
      advertising Whatever evidence it offers of enterprise ingenuity
      impudence and resource in certain individuals it proves to my mind the
      wide prevalence of that form of mental degradation which is called
      gullibility
    p
    p
      In various parts of the civilized and uncivilized world I have had to
      swallow B O S with more or less benefit to myself though without great
      pleasure Prepared with hot water and abundantly peppered to bring out the
      taste this extract is not really unpalatable But I have never swallowed
      its advertisements Perhaps they have not gone far enough As far as I can
      remember they make no promise of everlasting youth to the users of B O
      S nor yet have they claimed the power of raising the dead for their
      estimable products Why this austere reserve I wonder But I donrsquot think
      they would have had me even on these terms Whatever form of mental
      degradation I may being but human be suffering from it is not the
      popular form I am not gullible
    p
    p
      I have been at some pains to bring out distinctly this statement about
      myself in view of the story which follows I have checked the facts as far
      as possible I have turned up the files of French newspapers and I have
      also talked with the officer who commands the military guard on the Ile
      Royale when in the course of my travels I reached Cayenne I believe the
      story to be in the main true It is the sort of story that no man I
      think would ever invent about himself for it is neither grandiose nor
      flattering nor yet funny enough to gratify a perverted vanity
    p
    p
      It concerns the engineer of the steamlaunch belonging to the Maranon
      cattle estate of the B O S Co Ltd This estate is also an islandmdashan
      island as big as a small province lying in the estuary of a great South
      American river It is wild and not beautiful but the grass growing on its
      low plains seems to possess exceptionally nourishing and flavouring
      qualities It resounds with the lowing of innumerable herdsmdasha deep
      and distressing sound under the open sky rising like a monstrous protest
      of prisoners condemned to death On the mainland across twenty miles of
      discoloured muddy water there stands a city whose name let us say is
      Horta
    p
    p
      But the most interesting characteristic of this island which seems like a
      sort of penal settlement for condemned cattle consists in its being the
      only known habitat of an extremely rare and gorgeous butterfly The
      species is even more rare than it is beautiful which is not saying
      little I have already alluded to my travels I travelled at that time
      but strictly for myself and with a moderation unknown in our days of
      roundtheworld tickets I even travelled with a purpose As a matter of
      fact I ammdashldquoHa ha hamdasha desperate butterflyslayer Ha ha
      hardquo
     p
    p
      This was the tone in which Mr Harry Gee the manager of the cattle
      station alluded to my pursuits He seemed to consider me the greatest
      absurdity in the world On the other hand the B O S Co Ltd
      represented to him the acme of the nineteenth centuryrsquos achievement I
      believe that he slept in his leggings and spurs His days he spent in the
      saddle flying over the plains followed by a train of halfwild horsemen
      who called him Don Enrique and who had no definite idea of the B O S
      Co Ltd which paid their wages He was an excellent manager but I
      donrsquot see why when we met at meals he should have thumped me on the
      back with loud derisive inquiries ldquoHowrsquos the deadly sport today
      Butterflies going strong Ha ha hardquomdashespecially as he charged me
      two dollars per diem for the hospitality of the B O S Co Ltd
      capital L fully paid up in whose balancesheet for that year
      those monies are no doubt included ldquoI donrsquot think I can make it anything
      less in justice to my companyrdquo he had remarked with extreme gravity
      when I was arranging with him the terms of my stay on the island
    p
    p
      His chaff would have been harmless enough if intimacy of intercourse in
      the absence of all friendly feeling were not a thing detestable in itself
      Moreover his facetiousness was not very amusing It consisted in the
      wearisome repetition of descriptive phrases applied to people with a burst
      of laughter ldquoDesperate butterflyslayer Ha ha hardquo was one sample of
      his peculiar wit which he himself enjoyed so much And in the same vein of
      exquisite humour he called my attention to the engineer of the
      steamlaunch one day as we strolled on the path by the side of the
      creek
    p
    p
      The manrsquos head and shoulders emerged above the deck over which were
      scattered various tools of his trade and a few pieces of machinery He was
      doing some repairs to the engines At the sound of our footsteps he raised
      anxiously a grimy face with a pointed chin and a tiny fair moustache What
      could be seen of his delicate features under the black smudges appeared to
      me wasted and livid in the greenish shade of the enormous tree spreading
      its foliage over the launch moored close to the bank
    p
    p
      To my great surprise Harry Gee addressed him as ldquoCrocodilerdquo in that
      halfjeering halfbullying tone which is characteristic of
      selfsatisfaction in his delectable kind
    p
    p
      ldquoHow does the work get on Crocodilerdquo
     p
    p
      I should have said before that the amiable Harry had picked up French of a
      sort somewheremdashin some colony or othermdashand that he pronounced
      it with a disagreeable forced precision as though he meant to guy the
      language The man in the launch answered him quickly in a pleasant voice
      His eyes had a liquid softness and his teeth flashed dazzlingly white
      between his thin drooping lips The manager turned to me very cheerful
      and loud explaining
    p
    p
      ldquoI call him Crocodile because he lives half in half out of the creek
      Amphibiousmdashsee Therersquos nothing else amphibious living on the island
      except crocodiles so he must belong to the speciesmdasheh But in
      reality hersquos nothing less than un citoyen anarchiste de Barcelonerdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoA citizen anarchist from Barcelonardquo I repeated stupidly looking down
      at the man He had turned to his work in the enginewell of the launch and
      presented his bowed back to us In that attitude I heard him protest very
      audibly
    p
    p
      ldquoI do not even know Spanishrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoHey What You dare to deny you come from over thererdquo the accomplished
      manager was down on him truculently
    p
    p
      At this the man straightened himself up dropping a spanner he had been
      using and faced us but he trembled in all his limbs
    p
    p
      ldquoI deny nothing nothing nothingrdquo he said excitedly
    p
    p
      He picked up the spanner and went to work again without paying any further
      attention to us After looking at him for a minute or so we went away
    p
    p
      ldquoIs he really an anarchistrdquo I asked when out of earshot
    p
    p
      ldquoI donrsquot care a hang what he isrdquo answered the humorous official of the B
      O S Co ldquoI gave him the name because it suited me to label him in that
      way Itrsquos good for the companyrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoFor the companyrdquo I exclaimed stopping short
    p
    p
      ldquoAhardquo he triumphed tilting up his hairless pug face and straddling his
      thin long legs ldquoThat surprises you I am bound to do my best for my
      company They have enormous expenses Whymdashour agent in Horta tells
      me they spend fifty thousand pounds every year in advertising all over the
      world One canrsquot be too economical in working the show Well just you
      listen When I took charge here the estate had no steamlaunch I asked
      for one and kept on asking by every mail till I got it but the man they
      sent out with it chucked his job at the end of two months leaving the
      launch moored at the pontoon in Horta Got a better screw at a sawmill up
      the rivermdashblast him And ever since it has been the same thing Any
      Scotch or Yankee vagabond that likes to call himself a mechanic out here
      gets eighteen pounds a month and the next you know hersquos cleared out
      after smashing something as likely as not I give you my word that some of
      the objects Irsquove had for enginedrivers couldnrsquot tell the boiler from the
      funnel But this fellow understands his trade and I donrsquot mean him to
      clear out Seerdquo
     p
    p
      And he struck me lightly on the chest for emphasis Disregarding his
      peculiarities of manner I wanted to know what all this had to do with the
      man being an anarchist
    p
    p
      ldquoComerdquo jeered the manager ldquoIf you saw suddenly a barefooted unkempt
      chap slinking amongst the bushes on the sea face of the island and at the
      same time observed less than a mile from the beach a small schooner full
      of niggers hauling off in a hurry you wouldnrsquot think the man fell there
      from the sky would you And it could be nothing else but either that or
      Cayenne Irsquove got my wits about me Directly I sighted this queer game I
      said to myselfmdashlsquoEscaped Convictrsquo I was as certain of it as I am of
      seeing you standing here this minute So I spurred on straight at him He
      stood his ground for a bit on a sand hillock crying out lsquoMonsieur
      Monsieur Arretezrsquo then at the last moment broke and ran for life Says I
      to myself lsquoIrsquoll tame you before Irsquom done with yoursquo So without a single
      word I kept on heading him off here and there I rounded him up towards
      the shore and at last I had him corralled on a spit his heels in the
      water and nothing but sea and sky at his back with my horse pawing the
      sand and shaking his head within a yard of him
    p
    p
      ldquoHe folded his arms on his breast then and stuck his chin up in a sort of
      desperate way but I wasnrsquot to be impressed by the beggarrsquos posturing
    p
    p
      ldquoSays I lsquoYoursquore a runaway convictrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoWhen he heard French his chin went down and his face changed
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoI deny nothingrsquo says he panting yet for I had kept him skipping about
      in front of my horse pretty smartly I asked him what he was doing there
      He had got his breath by then and explained that he had meant to make his
      way to a farm which he understood from the schoonerrsquos people I suppose
      was to be found in the neighbourhood At that I laughed aloud and he got
      uneasy Had he been deceived Was there no farm within walking distance
    p
    p
      ldquoI laughed more and more He was on foot and of course the first bunch of
      cattle he came across would have stamped him to rags under their hoofs A
      dismounted man caught on the feedinggrounds hasnrsquot got the ghost of a
      chance
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoMy coming upon you like this has certainly saved your lifersquo I said He
      remarked that perhaps it was so but that for his part he had imagined I
      had wanted to kill him under the hoofs of my horse I assured him that
      nothing would have been easier had I meant it And then we came to a sort
      of dead stop For the life of me I didnrsquot know what to do with this
      convict unless I chucked him into the sea It occurred to me to ask him
      what he had been transported for He hung his head
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoWhat is itrsquo says I lsquoTheft murder rape or whatrsquo I wanted to hear
      what he would have to say for himself though of course I expected it

      ldquolsquoMake it what you like I deny nothing It is no good denying anythingrsquo

      themrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoI deny nothing whatever monsieurrsquo he repeats
    p
    p
      ldquoThis answer made me think that perhaps he was not an anarchist I believe
      those damned lunatics are rather proud of themselves If he had been one
      he would have probably confessed straight out

    p

    p
    p
      ldquoAt that I began to think he must be an anarchist after all Thatrsquos the
      class they come mostly from isnrsquot it I hate the cowardly bombthrowing
      brutes I almost made up my mind to turn my horse short round and leave
      him to starve or drown where he was whichever he liked best As to
      crossing the island to bother me again the cattle would see to that I
      donrsquot know what induced me to askmdash
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoWhat sort of workmanrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoI didnrsquot care a hang whether he answered me or not But when he said at
      once lsquoMecanicien monsieurrsquo I nearly jumped out of the saddle with
      excitement The launch had been lying disabled and idle in the creek for
      three weeks My duty to the company was clear He noticed my start too
      and there we were for a minute or so staring at each other as if
      bewitched
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoGet up on my horse behind mersquo I told him lsquoYou shall put my
      steamlaunch to rightsrsquordquo
     p
    p
      These are the words in which the worthy manager of the Maranon estate
      related to me the coming of the supposed anarchist He meant to keep himmdashout
      of a sense of duty to the companymdashand the name he had given him
      would prevent the fellow from obtaining employment anywhere in Horta The
      vaqueros of the estate when they went on leave spread it all over the
      town They did not know what an anarchist was nor yet what Barcelona
      meant They called him Anarchisto de Barcelona as if it were his
      Christian name and surname But the people in town had been reading in
      their papers about the anarchists in Europe and were very much impressed
      Over the jocular addition of ldquode Barcelonardquo Mr Harry Gee chuckled with
      immense satisfaction ldquoThat breed is particularly murderous isnrsquot it It
      makes the sawmills crowd still more afraid of having anything to do with
      himmdashseerdquo he exulted candidly ldquoI hold him by that name better than
      if I had him chained up by the leg to the deck of the steamlaunch
    p
    p
      ldquoAnd markrdquo he added after a pause ldquohe does not deny it I am not
      wronging him in any way He is a convict of some sort anyhowrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoBut I suppose you pay him some wages donrsquot yourdquo I asked
    p
    p
      ldquoWages What does he want with money here He gets his food from my
      kitchen and his clothing from the store Of course Irsquoll give him something
      at the end of the year but you donrsquot think Irsquod employ a convict and give
      him the same money I would give an honest man I am looking after the
      interests of my company first and lastrdquo
     p
    p
      I admitted that for a company spending fifty thousand pounds every year
      in advertising the strictest economy was obviously necessary The manager
      of the Maranon Estancia grunted approvingly
    p
    p
      ldquoAnd Irsquoll tell you whatrdquo he continued ldquoif I were certain hersquos an
      anarchist and he had the cheek to ask me for money I would give him the
      toe of my boot However let him have the benefit of the doubt I am
      perfectly willing to take it that he has done nothing worse than to stick
      a knife into somebodymdashwith extenuating circumstancesmdashFrench
      fashion donrsquot you know But that subversive sanguinary rot of doing away
      with all law and order in the world makes my blood boil Itrsquos simply
      cutting the ground from under the feet of every decent respectable
      hardworking person I tell you that the consciences of people who have
      them like you or I must be protected in some way or else the first low
      scoundrel that came along would in every respect be just as good as
      myself Wouldnrsquot he now And thatrsquos absurdrdquo
     p
    p
      He glared at me I nodded slightly and murmured that doubtless there was
      much subtle truth in his view
    p
    p
      The principal truth discoverable in the views of Paul the engineer was
      that a little thing may bring about the undoing of a man
    p
    p
      ldquoiIl ne faut pas beaucoup pour perdre un hommeirdquo he said to me
      thoughtfully one evening
    p
    p
      I report this reflection in French since the man was of Paris not of
      Barcelona at all At the Maranon he lived apart from the station in a
      small shed with a metal roof and straw walls which he called mon atelier
      He had a workbench there They had given him several horseblankets and a
      saddlemdashnot that he ever had occasion to ride but because no other
      bedding was used by the workinghands who were all vaquerosmdashcattlemen
      And on this horsemanrsquos gear like a son of the plains he used to sleep
      amongst the tools of his trade in a litter of rusty scrapiron with a
      portable forge at his head under the workbench sustaining his grimy
      mosquitonet
    p
    p
      Now and then I would bring him a few candle ends saved from the scant
      supply of the managerrsquos house He was very thankful for these He did not
      like to lie awake in the dark he confessed He complained that sleep fled
      from him ldquoLe sommeil me fuitrdquo he declared with his habitual air of
      subdued stoicism which made him sympathetic and touching I made it clear
      to him that I did not attach undue importance to the fact of his having
      been a convict
    p
    p
      Thus it came about that one evening he was led to talk about himself As
      one of the bits of candle on the edge of the bench burned down to the end
      he hastened to light another
    p
    p
      He had done his military service in a provincial garrison and returned to
      Paris to follow his trade It was a wellpaid one He told me with some
      pride that in a short time he was earning no less than ten francs a day
      He was thinking of setting up for himself by and by and of getting
      married
    p
    p
      Here he sighed deeply and paused Then with a return to his stoical note
    p
    p
      ldquoIt seems I did not know enough about myselfrdquo
     p
    p
      On his twentyfifth birthday two of his friends in the repairing shop
      where he worked proposed to stand him a dinner He was immensely touched
      by this attention
    p
    p
      ldquoI was a steady manrdquo he remarked ldquobut I am not less sociable than any
      other bodyrdquo
     p
    p
      The entertainment came off in a little cafe on the Boulevard de la
      Chapelle At dinner they drank some special wine It was excellent
      Everything was excellent and the worldmdashin his own wordsmdashseemed
      a very good place to live in He had good prospects some little money
      laid by and the affection of two excellent friends He offered to pay for
      all the drinks after dinner which was only proper on his part
    p
    p
      They drank more wine they drank liqueurs cognac beer then more
      liqueurs and more cognac Two strangers sitting at the next table looked
      at him he said with so much friendliness that he invited them to join
      the party
    p
    p
      He had never drunk so much in his life His elation was extreme and so
      pleasurable that whenever it flagged he hastened to order more drinks
    p
    p
      ldquoIt seemed to merdquo he said in his quiet tone and looking on the ground in
      the gloomy shed full of shadows ldquothat I was on the point of just
      attaining a great and wonderful felicity Another drink I felt would do
      it The others were holding out well with me glass for glassrdquo
     p
    p
      But an extraordinary thing happened At something the strangers said his
      elation fell Gloomy ideasmdashdes idees noiresmdashrushed into his
      head All the world outside the cafe appeared to him as a dismal evil
      place where a multitude of poor wretches had to work and slave to the sole
      end that a few individuals should ride in carriages and live riotously in
      palaces He became ashamed of his happiness The pity of mankindrsquos cruel
      lot wrung his heart In a voice choked with sorrow he tried to express
      these sentiments He thinks he wept and swore in turns
    p
    p
      The two new acquaintances hastened to applaud his humane indignation Yes
      The amount of injustice in the world was indeed scandalous There was only
      one way of dealing with the rotten state of society Demolish the whole
      sacree boutique Blow up the whole iniquitous show
    p
    p
      Their heads hovered over the table They whispered to him eloquently I
      donrsquot think they quite expected the result He was extremely drunkmdashmad
      drunk With a howl of rage he leaped suddenly upon the table Kicking over
      the bottles and glasses he yelled ldquoVive lrsquoanarchie Death to the
      capitalistsrdquo He yelled this again and again All round him broken glass
      was falling chairs were being swung in the air people were taking each
      other by the throat The police dashed in He hit bit scratched and
      struggled till something crashed down upon his head   
    p
    p
      He came to himself in a police cell locked up on a charge of assault
      seditious cries and anarchist propaganda
    p
    p
      He looked at me fixedly with his liquid shining eyes that seemed very
      big in the dim light
    p
    p
      ldquoThat was bad But even then I might have got off somehow perhapsrdquo he
      said slowly
    p
    p
      I doubt it But whatever chance he had was done away with by a young
      socialist lawyer who volunteered to undertake his defence In vain he
      assured him that he was no anarchist that he was a quiet respectable
      mechanic only too anxious to work ten hours per day at his trade He was
      represented at the trial as the victim of society and his drunken
      shoutings as the expression of infinite suffering The young lawyer had
      his way to make and this case was just what he wanted for a start The
      speech for the defence was pronounced magnificent
    p
    p
      The poor fellow paused swallowed and brought out the statement
    p
    p
      ldquoI got the maximum penalty applicable to a first offencerdquo
     p
    p
      I made an appropriate murmur He hung his head and folded his arms
    p
    p
      ldquoWhen they let me out of prisonrdquo he began gently ldquoI made tracks of
      course for my old workshop My patron had a particular liking for me
      before but when he saw me he turned green with fright and showed me the
      door with a shaking handrdquo
     p
    p
      While he stood in the street uneasy and disconcerted he was accosted by
      a middleaged man who introduced himself as an engineerrsquos fitter too ldquoI
      know who you arerdquo he said ldquoI have attended your trial You are a good
      comrade and your ideas are sound But the devil of it is that you wonrsquot be
      able to get work anywhere now These bourgeoisrsquoll conspire to starve you
      Thatrsquos their way Expect no mercy from the richrdquo
     p
    p
      To be spoken to so kindly in the street had comforted him very much His
      seemed to be the sort of nature needing support and sympathy The idea of
      not being able to find work had knocked him over completely If his
      patron who knew him so well for a quiet orderly competent workman
      would have nothing to do with him nowmdashthen surely nobody else would
      That was clear The police keeping their eye on him would hasten to warn
      every employer inclined to give him a chance He felt suddenly very
      helpless alarmed and idle and he followed the middleaged man to the
      estaminet round the corner where he met some other good companions They
      assured him that he would not be allowed to starve work or no work They
      had drinks all round to the discomfiture of all employers of labour and to
      the destruction of society
    p
    p
      He sat biting his lower lip
    p
    p
      ldquoThat is monsieur how I became a compagnonrdquo he said The hand he passed
      over his forehead was trembling ldquoAll the same therersquos something wrong in
      a world where a man can get lost for a glass more or lessrdquo
     p
    p
      He never looked up though I could see he was getting excited under his
      dejection He slapped the bench with his open palm
    p
    p
      ldquoNordquo he cried ldquoIt was an impossible existence Watched by the police
      watched by the comrades I did not belong to myself any more Why I could
      not even go to draw a few francs from my savingsbank without a comrade
      hanging about the door to see that I didnrsquot bolt And most of them were
      neither more nor less than housebreakers The intelligent I mean They
      robbed the rich they were only getting back their own they said When I
      had had some drink I believed them There were also the fools and the mad
      Des exaltesmdashquoi When I was drunk I loved them When I got more
      drink I was angry with the world That was the best time I found refuge
      from misery in rage But one canrsquot be always drunkmdashnrsquoestce pas
      monsieur And when I was sober I was afraid to break away They would have
      stuck me like a pigrdquo
     p
    p
      He folded his arms again and raised his sharp chin with a bitter smile
    p
    p
      ldquoBy and by they told me it was time to go to work The work was to rob a
      bank Afterwards a bomb would be thrown to wreck the place My beginnerrsquos
      part would be to keep watch in a street at the back and to take care of a
      black bag with the bomb inside till it was wanted After the meeting at
      which the affair was arranged a trusty comrade did not leave me an inch I
      had not dared to protest I was afraid of being done away with quietly in
      that room only as we were walking together I wondered whether it would
      not be better for me to throw myself suddenly into the Seine But while I
      was turning it over in my mind we had crossed the bridge and afterwards I
      had not the opportunityrdquo
     p
    p
      In the light of the candle end with his sharp features fluffy little
      moustache and oval face he looked at times delicately and gaily young
      and then appeared quite old decrepit full of sorrow pressing his folded
      arms to his breast
    p
    p
      As he remained silent I felt bound to ask
    p
    p
      ldquoWell And how did it endrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoDeportation to Cayennerdquo he answered
    p
    p
      He seemed to think that somebody had given the plot away As he was
      keeping watch in the back street bag in hand he was set upon by the
      police ldquoThese imbecilesrdquo had knocked him down without noticing what he
      had in his hand He wondered how the bomb failed to explode as he fell
      But it didnrsquot explode
    p
    p
      ldquoI tried to tell my story in courtrdquo he continued ldquoThe president was
      amused There were in the audience some idiots who laughedrdquo
     p
    p
      I expressed the hope that some of his companions had been caught too He
      shuddered slightly before he told me that there were twomdashSimon
      called also Biscuit the middleaged fitter who spoke to him in the
      street and a fellow of the name of Mafile one of the sympathetic
      strangers who had applauded his sentiments and consoled his humanitarian
      sorrows when he got drunk in the cafe
    p
    p
      ldquoYesrdquo he went on with an effort ldquoI had the advantage of their company
      over there on St Josephrsquos Island amongst some eighty or ninety other
      convicts We were all classed as dangerousrdquo
     p
    p
      St Josephrsquos Island is the prettiest of the Iles de Salut It is rocky and
      green with shallow ravines bushes thickets groves of mangotrees and
      many feathery palms Six warders armed with revolvers and carbines are in
      charge of the convicts kept there
    p
    p
      An eightoared galley keeps up the communication in the daytime across a
      channel a quarter of a mile wide with the Ile Royale where there is a
      military post She makes the first trip at six in the morning At four in
      the afternoon her service is over and she is then hauled up into a little
      dock on the Ile Royale and a sentry put over her and a few smaller boats
      From that time till next morning the island of St Joseph remains cut off
      from the rest of the world with the warders patrolling in turn the path
      from the wardersrsquo house to the convict huts and a multitude of sharks
      patrolling the waters all round
    p
    p
      Under these circumstances the convicts planned a mutiny Such a thing had
      never been known in the penitentiaryrsquos history before But their plan was
      not without some possibility of success The warders were to be taken by
      surprise and murdered during the night Their arms would enable the
      convicts to shoot down the people in the galley as she came alongside in
      the morning The galley once in their possession other boats were to be
      captured and the whole company was to row away up the coast
    p
    p
      At dusk the two warders on duty mustered the convicts as usual Then they
      proceeded to inspect the huts to ascertain that everything was in order
      In the second they entered they were set upon and absolutely smothered
      under the numbers of their assailants The twilight faded rapidly It was
      a new moon and a heavy black squall gathering over the coast increased
      the profound darkness of the night The convicts assembled in the open
      space deliberating upon the next step to be taken argued amongst
      themselves in low voices
    p
    p
      ldquoYou took part in all thisrdquo I asked
    p
    p
      ldquoNo I knew what was going to be done of course But why should I kill
      these warders I had nothing against them But I was afraid of the others
      Whatever happened I could not escape from them I sat alone on the stump
      of a tree with my head in my hands sick at heart at the thought of a
      freedom that could be nothing but a mockery to me Suddenly I was startled
      to perceive the shape of a man on the path near by He stood perfectly
      still then his form became effaced in the night It must have been the
      chief warder coming to see what had become of his two men No one noticed
      him The convicts kept on quarrelling over their plans The leaders could
      not get themselves obeyed The fierce whispering of that dark mass of men
      was very horrible
    p
    p
      ldquoAt last they divided into two parties and moved off When they had passed
      me I rose weary and hopeless The path to the wardersrsquo house was dark and
      silent but on each side the bushes rustled slightly Presently I saw a
      faint thread of light before me The chief warder followed by his three
      men was approaching cautiously But he had failed to close his dark
      lantern properly The convicts had seen that faint gleam too There was
      an awful savage yell a turmoil on the dark path shots fired blows
      groans and with the sound of smashed bushes the shouts of the pursuers
      and the screams of the pursued the manhunt the warderhunt passed by
      me into the interior of the island I was alone And I assure you
      monsieur I was indifferent to everything After standing still for a
      while I walked on along the path till I kicked something hard I stooped
      and picked up a warderrsquos revolver I felt with my fingers that it was
      loaded in five chambers In the gusts of wind I heard the convicts calling
      to each other far away and then a roll of thunder would cover the
      soughing and rustling of the trees Suddenly a big light ran across my
      path very low along the ground And it showed a womanrsquos skirt with the
      edge of an apron
    p
    p
      ldquoI knew that the person who carried it must be the wife of the head
      warder They had forgotten all about her it seems A shot rang out in the
      interior of the island and she cried out to herself as she ran She
      passed on I followed and presently I saw her again She was pulling at
      the cord of the big bell which hangs at the end of the landingpier with
      one hand and with the other she was swinging the heavy lantern to and
      fro This is the agreed signal for the Ile Royale should assistance be
      required at night The wind carried the sound away from our island and the
      light she swung was hidden on the shore side by the few trees that grow
      near the wardersrsquo house
    p
    p
      ldquoI came up quite close to her from behind She went on without stopping
      without looking aside as though she had been all alone on the island A
      brave woman monsieur I put the revolver inside the breast of my blue
      blouse and waited A flash of lightning and a clap of thunder destroyed
      both the sound and the light of the signal for an instant but she never
      faltered pulling at the cord and swinging the lantern as regularly as a
      machine She was a comely woman of thirtymdashno more I thought to
      myself lsquoAll thatrsquos no good on a night like thisrsquo And I made up my mind
      that if a body of my fellowconvicts came down to the piermdashwhich was
      sure to happen soonmdashI would shoot her through the head before I shot
      myself I knew the lsquocomradesrsquo well This idea of mine gave me quite an
      interest in life monsieur and at once instead of remaining stupidly
      exposed on the pier I retreated a little way and crouched behind a bush
      I did not intend to let myself be pounced upon unawares and be prevented
      perhaps from rendering a supreme service to at least one human creature
      before I died myself
    p
    p
      ldquoBut we must believe the signal was seen for the galley from Ile Royale
      came over in an astonishingly short time The woman kept right on till the
      light of her lantern flashed upon the officer in command and the bayonets
      of the soldiers in the boat Then she sat down and began to cry
    p
    p
      ldquoShe didnrsquot need me any more I did not budge Some soldiers were only in
      their shirtsleeves others without boots just as the call to arms had
      found them They passed by my bush at the double The galley had been sent
      away for more and the woman sat all alone crying at the end of the pier
      with the lantern standing on the ground near her
    p
    p
      ldquoThen suddenly I saw in the light at the end of the pier the red
      pantaloons of two more men I was overcome with astonishment They too
      started off at a run Their tunics flapped unbuttoned and they were
      bareheaded One of them panted out to the other lsquoStraight on straight
      onrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoWhere on earth did they spring from I wondered Slowly I walked down the
      short pier I saw the womanrsquos form shaken by sobs and heard her moaning
      more and more distinctly lsquoOh my man my poor man my poor manrsquo I stole
      on quietly She could neither hear nor see anything She had thrown her
      apron over her head and was rocking herself to and fro in her grief But I
      remarked a small boat fastened to the end of the pier
    p
    p
      ldquoThose two menmdashthey looked like sousofficiersmdashmust have come
      in it after being too late I suppose for the galley It is incredible
      that they should have thus broken the regulations from a sense of duty
      And it was a stupid thing to do I could not believe my eyes in the very
      moment I was stepping into that boat
    p
    p
      ldquoI pulled along the shore slowly A black cloud hung over the Iles de
      Salut I heard firing shouts Another hunt had begunmdashthe
      convicthunt The oars were too long to pull comfortably I managed them
      with difficulty though the boat herself was light But when I got round
      to the other side of the island the squall broke in rain and wind I was
      unable to make head against it I let the boat drift ashore and secured
      her
    p
    p
      ldquoI knew the spot There was a tumbledown old hovel standing near the
      water Cowering in there I heard through the noises of the wind and the
      falling downpour some people tearing through the bushes They came out on
      the strand Soldiers perhaps A flash of lightning threw everything near
      me into violent relief Two convicts
    p
    p
      ldquoAnd directly an amazed voice exclaimed lsquoItrsquos a miraclersquo It was the
      voice of Simon otherwise Biscuit
    p
    p
      ldquoAnd another voice growled lsquoWhatrsquos a miraclersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoWhy therersquos a boat lying herersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoYou must be mad Simon But there is after all    A boatrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoThey seemed awed into complete silence The other man was Mafile He
      spoke again cautiously
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoIt is fastened up There must be somebody herersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoI spoke to them from within the hovel lsquoI am herersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoThey came in then and soon gave me to understand that the boat was
      theirs not mine lsquoThere are two of usrsquo said Mafile lsquoagainst you alonersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoI got out into the open to keep clear of them for fear of getting a
      treacherous blow on the head I could have shot them both where they
      stood But I said nothing I kept down the laughter rising in my throat I
      made myself very humble and begged to be allowed to go They consulted in
      low tones about my fate while with my hand on the revolver in the bosom
      of my blouse I had their lives in my power I let them live I meant them
      to pull that boat I represented to them with abject humility that I
      understood the management of a boat and that being three to pull we
      could get a rest in turns That decided them at last It was time A
      little more and I would have gone into screaming fits at the drollness of
      itrdquo
     p
    p
      At this point his excitement broke out He jumped off the bench and
      gesticulated The great shadows of his arms darting over roof and walls
      made the shed appear too small to contain his agitation
    p
    p
      ldquoI deny nothingrdquo he burst out ldquoI was elated monsieur I tasted a sort
      of felicity But I kept very quiet I took my turns at pulling all through
      the night We made for the open sea putting our trust in a passing ship
      It was a foolhardy action I persuaded them to it When the sun rose the
      immensity of water was calm and the Iles de Salut appeared only like dark
      specks from the top of each swell I was steering then Mafile who was
      pulling bow let out an oath and said lsquoWe must restrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoThe time to laugh had come at last And I took my fill of it I can tell
      you I held my sides and rolled in my seat they had such startled faces
      lsquoWhatrsquos got into him the animalrsquo cries Mafile
    p
    p
      ldquoAnd Simon who was nearest to me says over his shoulder to him lsquoDevil
      take me if I donrsquot think hersquos gone madrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoThen I produced the revolver Aha In a moment they both got the stoniest
      eyes you can imagine Ha ha They were frightened But they pulled Oh
      yes they pulled all day sometimes looking wild and sometimes looking
      faint I lost nothing of it because I had to keep my eyes on them all the
      time or elsemdashcrackmdashthey would have been on top of me in a
      second I rested my revolver hand on my knee all ready and steered with
      the other Their faces began to blister Sky and sea seemed on fire round
      us and the sea steamed in the sun The boat made a sizzling sound as she
      went through the water Sometimes Mafile foamed at the mouth and sometimes
      he groaned But he pulled He dared not stop His eyes became bloodshot
      all over and he had bitten his lower lip to pieces Simon was as hoarse
      as a crow
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoComrademdashrsquo he begins
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoThere are no comrades here I am your patronrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoPatron thenrsquo he says lsquoin the name of humanity let us restrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoI let them There was a little rainwater washing about the bottom of the
      boat I permitted them to snatch some of it in the hollow of their palms
      But as I gave the command lsquoEn routersquo I caught them exchanging
      significant glances They thought I would have to go to sleep sometime
      Aha But I did not want to go to sleep I was more awake than ever It is
      they who went to sleep as they pulled tumbling off the thwarts head over
      heels suddenly one after another I let them lie All the stars were out
      It was a quiet world The sun rose Another day Allez En route
    p
    p
      ldquoThey pulled badly Their eyes rolled about and their tongues hung out In
      the middle of the forenoon Mafile croaks out lsquoLet us make a rush at him
      Simon I would just as soon be shot at once as to die of thirst hunger
      and fatigue at the oarrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoBut while he spoke he pulled and Simon kept on pulling too It made me
      smile Ah They loved their life these two in this evil world of theirs
      just as I used to love my life too before they spoiled it for me with
      their phrases I let them go on to the point of exhaustion and only then
      I pointed at the sails of a ship on the horizon
    p
    p
      ldquoAha You should have seen them revive and buckle to their work For I
      kept them at it to pull right across that shiprsquos path They were changed
      The sort of pity I had felt for them left me They looked more like
      themselves every minute They looked at me with the glances I remembered
      so well They were happy They smiled
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoWellrsquo says Simon lsquothe energy of that youngster has saved our lives If
      he hadnrsquot made us we could never have pulled so far out into the track of
      ships Comrade I forgive you I admire yoursquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoAnd Mafile growls from forward lsquoWe owe you a famous debt of gratitude
      comrade You are cut out for a chiefrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoComrade Monsieur Ah what a good word And they such men as these two
      had made it accursed I looked at them I remembered their lies their
      promises their menaces and all my days of misery Why could they not
      have left me alone after I came out of prison I looked at them and
      thought that while they lived I could never be free Never Neither I nor
      others like me with warm hearts and weak heads For I know I have not a
      strong head monsieur A black rage came upon memdashthe rage of extreme
      intoxicationmdashbut not against the injustice of society Oh no
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoI must be freersquo I cried furiously
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoVive la liberterdquo yells that ruffian Mafile lsquoMort aux bourgeois who
      send us to Cayenne They shall soon know that we are freersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoThe sky the sea the whole horizon seemed to turn red blood red all
      round the boat My temples were beating so loud that I wondered they did
      not hear How is it that they did not How is it they did not understand
    p
    p
      ldquoI heard Simon ask lsquoHave we not pulled far enough out nowrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoYes Far enoughrsquo I said I was sorry for him it was the other I hated
      He hauled in his oar with a loud sigh and as he was raising his hand to
      wipe his forehead with the air of a man who has done his work I pulled
      the trigger of my revolver and shot him like this off the knee right
      through the heart
    p
    p
      ldquoHe tumbled down with his head hanging over the side of the boat I did
      not give him a second glance The other cried out piercingly Only one
      shriek of horror Then all was still
    p
    p
      ldquoHe slipped off the thwart on to his knees and raised his clasped hands
      before his face in an attitude of supplication lsquoMercyrsquo he whispered
      faintly lsquoMercy for memdashcomradersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoAh comradersquo I said in a low tone lsquoYes comrade of course Well
      then shout Vive lrsquoanarchiersquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoHe flung up his arms his face up to the sky and his mouth wide open in a
      great yell of despair lsquoVive lrsquoanarchie Vivemdashrsquo 
    p
    p
      ldquoHe collapsed all in a heap with a bullet through his head
    p
    p
      ldquoI flung them both overboard I threw away the revolver too Then I sat
      down quietly I was free at last At last I did not even look towards the
      ship I did not care indeed I think I must have gone to sleep because
      all of a sudden there were shouts and I found the ship almost on top of
      me They hauled me on board and secured the boat astern They were all
      blacks except the captain who was a mulatto He alone knew a few words
      of French I could not find out where they were going nor who they were
      They gave me something to eat every day but I did not like the way they
      used to discuss me in their language Perhaps they were deliberating about
      throwing me overboard in order to keep possession of the boat How do I
      know As we were passing this island I asked whether it was inhabited I
      understood from the mulatto that there was a house on it A farm I
      fancied they meant So I asked them to put me ashore on the beach and
      keep the boat for their trouble This I imagine was just what they
      wanted The rest you knowrdquo
     p
    p
      After pronouncing these words he lost suddenly all control over himself
      He paced to and fro rapidly till at last he broke into a run his arms
      went like a windmill and his ejaculations became very much like raving
      The burden of them was that he ldquodenied nothing nothingrdquo I could only let
      him go on and sat out of his way repeating ldquoCalmez vous calmez vousrdquo
       at intervals till his agitation exhausted itself
    p
    p
      I must confess too that I remained there long after he had crawled under
      his mosquitonet He had entreated me not to leave him so as one sits up
      with a nervous child I sat up with himmdashin the name of humanitymdashtill
      he fell asleep
    p
    p
      On the whole my idea is that he was much more of an anarchist than he
      confessed to me or to himself and that the special features of his case
      apart he was very much like many other anarchists Warm heart and weak
      headmdashthat is the word of the riddle and it is a fact that the
      bitterest contradictions and the deadliest conflicts of the world are
      carried on in every individual breast capable of feeling and passion
    p
    p
      From personal inquiry I can vouch that the story of the convict mutiny was
      in every particular as stated by him
    p
    p
      When I got back to Horta from Cayenne and saw the ldquoAnarchistrdquo again he
      did not look well He was more worn still more frail and very livid
      indeed under the grimy smudges of his calling Evidently the meat of the
      companyrsquos main herd in its unconcentrated form did not agree with him at
      all
    p
    p
      It was on the pontoon in Horta that we met and I tried to induce him to
      leave the launch moored where she was and follow me to Europe there and
      then It would have been delightful to think of the excellent managerrsquos
      surprise and disgust at the poor fellowrsquos escape But he refused with
      unconquerable obstinacy
    p
    p
      ldquoSurely you donrsquot mean to live always hererdquo I cried He shook his head
    p
    p
      ldquoI shall die hererdquo he said Then added moodily ldquoAway from themrdquo
     p
    p
      Sometimes I think of him lying openeyed on his horsemanrsquos gear in the low
      shed full of tools and scraps of ironmdashthe anarchist slave of the
      Maranon estate waiting with resignation for that sleep which ldquofledrdquo from
      him as he used to say in such an unaccountable manner

      THE DUEL
    h
    h
      A MILITARY TALE
    h
    p
      I
    p
    p
      Napoleon I whose career had the quality of a duel against the whole of
      Europe disliked duelling between the officers of his army The great
      military emperor was not a swashbuckler and had little respect for
      tradition
    p
    p
      Nevertheless a story of duelling which became a legend in the army runs
      through the epic of imperial wars To the surprise and admiration of their
      fellows two officers like insane artists trying to gild refined gold or
      paint the lily pursued a private contest through the years of universal
      carnage They were officers of cavalry and their connection with the
      highspirited but fanciful animal which carries men into battle seems
      particularly appropriate It would be difficult to imagine for heroes of
      this legend two officers of infantry of the line for example whose
      fantasy is tamed by much walking exercise and whose valour necessarily
      must be of a more plodding kind As to gunners or engineers whose heads
      are kept cool on a diet of mathematics it is simply unthinkable
    p
    p
      The names of the two officers were Feraud and DrsquoHubert and they were both
      lieutenants in a regiment of hussars but not in the same regiment
    p
    p
      Feraud was doing regimental work but Lieut DrsquoHubert had the good fortune
      to be attached to the person of the general commanding the division as
      officier drsquoordonnance It was in Strasbourg and in this agreeable and
      important garrison they were enjoying greatly a short interval of peace
      They were enjoying it though both intensely warlike because it was a
      swordsharpening firelockcleaning peace dear to a military heart and
      undamaging to military prestige inasmuch that no one believed in its
      sincerity or duration
    p
    p
      Under those historical circumstances so favourable to the proper
      appreciation of military leisure Lieut DrsquoHubert one fine afternoon
      made his way along a quiet street of a cheerful suburb towards Lieut
      Feraudrsquos quarters which were in a private house with a garden at the
      back belonging to an old maiden lady
    p
    p
      His knock at the door was answered instantly by a young maid in Alsatian
      costume Her fresh complexion and her long eyelashes lowered demurely at
      the sight of the tall officer caused Lieut DrsquoHubert who was accessible
      to esthetic impressions to relax the cold severe gravity of his face At
      the same time he observed that the girl had over her arm a pair of
      hussarrsquos breeches blue with a red stripe
    p
    p
      ldquoLieut Feraud inrdquo he inquired benevolently
    p
    p
      ldquoOh no sir He went out at six this morningrdquo
     p
    p
      The pretty maid tried to close the door Lieut DrsquoHubert opposing this
      move with gentle firmness stepped into the anteroom jingling his spurs
    p
    p
      ldquoCome my dear You donrsquot mean to say he has not been home since six
      orsquoclock this morningrdquo
     p
    p
      Saying these words Lieut DrsquoHubert opened without ceremony the door of a
      room so comfortably and neatly ordered that only from internal evidence in
      the shape of boots uniforms and military accoutrements did he acquire
      the conviction that it was Lieut Feraudrsquos room And he saw also that
      Lieut Feraud was not at home The truthful maid had followed him and
      raised her candid eyes to his face
    p
    p
      ldquoHrsquomrdquo said Lieut DrsquoHubert greatly disappointed for he had already
      visited all the haunts where a lieutenant of hussars could be found of a
      fine afternoon ldquoSo hersquos out And do you happen to know my dear why he
      went out at six this morningrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoNordquo she answered readily ldquoHe came home late last night and snored I
      heard him when I got up at five Then he dressed himself in his oldest
      uniform and went out Service I supposerdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoService Not a bit of itrdquo cried Lieut DrsquoHubert ldquoLearn my angel that
      he went out thus early to fight a duel with a civilianrdquo
     p
    p
      She heard this news without a quiver of her dark eyelashes It was very
      obvious that the actions of Lieut Feraud were generally above criticism
      She only looked up for a moment in mute surprise and Lieut DrsquoHubert
      concluded from this absence of emotion that she must have seen Lieut
      Feraud since the morning He looked around the room
    p
    p
      ldquoComerdquo he insisted with confidential familiarity ldquoHersquos perhaps
      somewhere in the house nowrdquo
     p
    p
      She shook her head
    p
    p
      ldquoSo much the worse for himrdquo continued Lieut DrsquoHubert in a tone of
      anxious conviction ldquoBut he has been home this morningrdquo
     p
    p
      This time the pretty maid nodded slightly
    p
    p
      ldquoHe hasrdquo cried Lieut DrsquoHubert ldquoAnd went out again What for Couldnrsquot
      he keep quietly indoors What a lunatic My dear girlmdashrdquo
     p
    p
      Lieut DrsquoHubertrsquos natural kindness of disposition and strong sense of
      comradeship helped his powers of observation He changed his tone to a
      most insinuating softness and gazing at the hussarrsquos breeches hanging
      over the arm of the girl he appealed to the interest she took in Lieut
      Feraudrsquos comfort and happiness He was pressing and persuasive He used
      his eyes which were kind and fine with excellent effect His anxiety to
      get hold at once of Lieut Feraud for Lieut Feraudrsquos own good seemed so
      genuine that at last it overcame the girlrsquos unwillingness to speak
      Unluckily she had not much to tell Lieut Feraud had returned home
      shortly before ten had walked straight into his room and had thrown
      himself on his bed to resume his slumbers She had heard him snore rather
      louder than before far into the afternoon Then he got up put on his best
      uniform and went out That was all she knew
    p
    p
      She raised her eyes and Lieut DrsquoHubert stared into them incredulously
    p
    p
      ldquoItrsquos incredible Gone parading the town in his best uniform My dear
      child donrsquot you know he ran that civilian through this morning Clean
      through as you spit a harerdquo
     p
    p
      The pretty maid heard the gruesome intelligence without any signs of
      distress But she pressed her lips together thoughtfully
    p
    p
      ldquoHe isnrsquot parading the townrdquo she remarked in a low tone ldquoFar from itrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoThe civilianrsquos family is making an awful rowrdquo continued Lieut DrsquoHubert
      pursuing his train of thought ldquoAnd the general is very angry Itrsquos one of
      the best families in the town Feraud ought to have kept close at leastmdashrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoWhat will the general do to himrdquo inquired the girl anxiously
    p
    p
      ldquoHe wonrsquot have his head cut off to be surerdquo grumbled Lieut DrsquoHubert
      ldquoHis conduct is positively indecent Hersquos making no end of trouble for
      himself by this sort of bravadordquo
     p
    p
      ldquoBut he isnrsquot parading the townrdquo the maid insisted in a shy murmur
    p
    p
      ldquoWhy yes Now I think of it I havenrsquot seen him anywhere about What on
      earth has he done with himselfrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoHersquos gone to pay a callrdquo suggested the maid after a moment of silence
    p
    p
      Lieut DrsquoHubert started
    p
    p
      ldquoA call Do you mean a call on a lady The cheek of the man And how do
      you know this my dearrdquo
     p
    p
      Without concealing her womanrsquos scorn for the denseness of the masculine
      mind the pretty maid reminded him that Lieut Feraud had arrayed himself
      in his best uniform before going out He had also put on his newest
      dolman she added in a tone as if this conversation were getting on her
      nerves and turned away brusquely
    p
    p
      Lieut DrsquoHubert without questioning the accuracy of the deduction did
      not see that it advanced him much on his official quest For his quest
      after Lieut Feraud had an official character He did not know any of the
      women this fellow who had run a man through in the morning was likely to
      visit in the afternoon The two young men knew each other but slightly He
      bit his gloved finger in perplexity
    p
    p
      ldquoCallrdquo he exclaimed ldquoCall on the devilrdquo
     p
    p
      The girl with her back to him and folding the hussars breeches on a
      chair protested with a vexed little laugh
    p
    p
      ldquoOh dear no On Madame de Lionnerdquo
     p
    p
      Lieut DrsquoHubert whistled softly Madame de Lionne was the wife of a high
      official who had a wellknown salon and some pretensions to sensibility
      and elegance The husband was a civilian and old but the society of the
      salon was young and military Lieut DrsquoHubert had whistled not because
      the idea of pursuing Lieut Feraud into that very salon was disagreeable
      to him but because having arrived in Strasbourg only lately he had not
      had the time as yet to get an introduction to Madame de Lionne And what
      was that swashbuckler Feraud doing there he wondered He did not seem the
      sort of man whomdash
    p
    p
      ldquoAre you certain of what you sayrdquo asked Lieut DrsquoHubert
    p
    p
      The girl was perfectly certain Without turning round to look at him she
      explained that the coachman of their next door neighbours knew the
      maitredrsquohotel of Madame de Lionne In this way she had her information
      And she was perfectly certain In giving this assurance she sighed Lieut
      Feraud called there nearly every afternoon she added
    p
    p
      ldquoAh bahrdquo exclaimed DrsquoHubert ironically His opinion of Madame de Lionne
      went down several degrees Lieut Feraud did not seem to him specially
      worthy of attention on the part of a woman with a reputation for
      sensibility and elegance But there was no saying At bottom they were all
      alikemdashvery practical rather than idealistic Lieut DrsquoHubert
      however did not allow his mind to dwell on these considerations
    p
    p
      ldquoBy thunderrdquo he reflected aloud ldquoThe general goes there sometimes If he
      happens to find the fellow making eyes at the lady there will be the devil
      to pay Our general is not a very accommodating person I can tell yourdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoGo quickly then Donrsquot stand here now Irsquove told you where he isrdquo cried
      the girl colouring to the eyes
    p
    p
      ldquoThanks my dear I donrsquot know what I would have done without yourdquo
     p
    p
      After manifesting his gratitude in an aggressive way which at first was
      repulsed violently and then submitted to with a sudden and still more
      repellent indifference Lieut DrsquoHubert took his departure
    p
    p
      He clanked and jingled along the streets with a martial swagger To run a
      comrade to earth in a drawingroom where he was not known did not trouble
      him in the least A uniform is a passport His position as officier
      drsquoordonnance of the general added to his assurance Moreover now that he
      knew where to find Lieut Feraud he had no option It was a service
      matter
    p
    p
      Madame de Lionnersquos house had an excellent appearance A man in livery
      opening the door of a large drawingroom with a waxed floor shouted his
      name and stood aside to let him pass It was a reception day The ladies
      wore big hats surcharged with a profusion of feathers their bodies
      sheathed in clinging white gowns from the armpits to the tips of the low
      satin shoes looked sylphlike and cool in a great display of bare necks
      and arms The men who talked with them on the contrary were arrayed
      heavily in multicoloured garments with collars up to their ears and thick
      sashes round their waists Lieut DrsquoHubert made his unabashed way across
      the room and bowing low before a sylphlike form reclining on a couch
      offered his apologies for this intrusion which nothing could excuse but
      the extreme urgency of the service order he had to communicate to his
      comrade Feraud He proposed to himself to return presently in a more
      regular manner and beg forgiveness for interrupting the interesting
      conversation   
    p
    p
      A bare arm was extended towards him with gracious nonchalance even before
      he had finished speaking He pressed the hand respectfully to his lips
      and made the mental remark that it was bony Madame de Lionne was a
      blonde with too fine a skin and a long face
    p
    p
      ldquoCrsquoest cardquo she said with an ethereal smile disclosing a set of large
      teeth ldquoCome this evening to plead for your forgivenessrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoI will not fail madamerdquo
     p
    p
      Meantime Lieut Feraud splendid in his new dolman and the extremely
      polished boots of his calling sat on a chair within a foot of the couch
      one hand resting on his thigh the other twirling his moustache to a
      point At a significant glance from DrsquoHubert he rose without alacrity and
      followed him into the recess of a window
    p
    p
      ldquoWhat is it you want with merdquo he asked with astonishing indifference
      Lieut DrsquoHubert could not imagine that in the innocence of his heart and
      simplicity of his conscience Lieut Feraud took a view of his duel in
      which neither remorse nor yet a rational apprehension of consequences had
      any place Though he had no clear recollection how the quarrel had
      originated it was begun in an establishment where beer and wine are drunk
      late at night he had not the slightest doubt of being himself the
      outraged party He had had two experienced friends for his seconds
      Everything had been done according to the rules governing that sort of
      adventures And a duel is obviously fought for the purpose of someone
      being at least hurt if not killed outright The civilian got hurt That
      also was in order Lieut Feraud was perfectly tranquil but Lieut
      DrsquoHubert took it for affectation and spoke with a certain vivacity
    p
    p
      ldquoI am directed by the general to give you the order to go at once to your
      quarters and remain there under close arrestrdquo
     p
    p
      It was now the turn of Lieut Feraud to be astonished ldquoWhat the devil are
      you telling me thererdquo he murmured faintly and fell into such profound
      wonder that he could only follow mechanically the motions of Lieut
      DrsquoHubert The two officers one tall with an interesting face and a
      moustache the colour of ripe corn the other short and sturdy with a
      hooked nose and a thick crop of black curly hair approached the mistress
      of the house to take their leave Madame de Lionne a woman of eclectic
      taste smiled upon these armed young men with impartial sensibility and an
      equal share of interest Madame de Lionne took her delight in the infinite
      variety of the human species All the other eyes in the drawingroom
      followed the departing officers and when they had gone out one or two
      men who had already heard of the duel imparted the information to the
      sylphlike ladies who received it with faint shrieks of humane concern
    p
    p
      Meantime the two hussars walked side by side Lieut Feraud trying to
      master the hidden reason of things which in this instance eluded the grasp
      of his intellect Lieut DrsquoHubert feeling annoyed at the part he had to
      play because the generalrsquos instructions were that he should see
      personally that Lieut Feraud carried out his orders to the letter and at
      once
    p
    p
      ldquoThe chief seems to know this animalrdquo he thought eyeing his companion
      whose round face the round eyes and even the twistedup jet black little
      moustache seemed animated by a mental exasperation against the
      incomprehensible And aloud he observed rather reproachfully ldquoThe general
      is in a devilish fury with yourdquo
     p
    p
      Lieut Feraud stopped short on the edge of the pavement and cried in
      accents of unmistakable sincerity ldquoWhat on earth forrdquo The innocence of
      the fiery Gascon soul was depicted in the manner in which he seized his
      head in both hands as if to prevent it bursting with perplexity
    p
    p
      ldquoFor the duelrdquo said Lieut DrsquoHubert curtly He was annoyed greatly by
      this sort of perverse fooling
    p
    p
      ldquoThe duel The   rdquo
     p
    p
      Lieut Feraud passed from one paroxysm of astonishment into another He
      dropped his hands and walked on slowly trying to reconcile this
      information with the state of his own feelings It was impossible He
      burst out indignantly ldquoWas I to let that sauerkrauteating civilian wipe
      his boots on the uniform of the th Hussarsrdquo
     p
    p
      Lieut DrsquoHubert could not remain altogether unmoved by that simple
      sentiment This little fellow was a lunatic he thought to himself but
      there was something in what he said
    p
    p
      ldquoOf course I donrsquot know how far you were justifiedrdquo he began
      soothingly ldquoAnd the general himself may not be exactly informed Those
      people have been deafening him with their lamentationsrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoAh the general is not exactly informedrdquo mumbled Lieut Feraud walking
      faster and faster as his choler at the injustice of his fate began to
      rise ldquoHe is not exactly    And he orders me under close arrest with
      God knows what afterwardsrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoDonrsquot excite yourself like thisrdquo remonstrated the other ldquoYour
      adversaryrsquos people are very influential you know and it looks bad enough
      on the face of it The general had to take notice of their complaint at
      once I donrsquot think he means to be oversevere with you Itrsquos the best
      thing for you to be kept out of sight for a whilerdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoI am very much obliged to the generalrdquo muttered Lieut Feraud through
      his teeth ldquoAnd perhaps you would say I ought to be grateful to you too
      for the trouble you have taken to hunt me up in the drawingroom of a lady
      whomdashrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoFranklyrdquo interrupted Lieut DrsquoHubert with an innocent laugh ldquoI think
      you ought to be I had no end of trouble to find out where you were It
      wasnrsquot exactly the place for you to disport yourself in under the
      circumstances If the general had caught you there making eyes at the
      goddess of the temple    oh my word    He hates to be bothered
      with complaints against his officers you know And it looked uncommonly
      like sheer bravadordquo
     p
    p
      The two officers had arrived now at the street door of Lieut Feraudrsquos
      lodgings The latter turned towards his companion ldquoLieut DrsquoHubertrdquo he
      said ldquoI have something to say to you which canrsquot be said very well in
      the street You canrsquot refuse to come uprdquo
     p
    p
      The pretty maid had opened the door Lieut Feraud brushed past her
      brusquely and she raised her scared and questioning eyes to Lieut
      DrsquoHubert who could do nothing but shrug his shoulders slightly as he
      followed with marked reluctance
    p
    p
      In his room Lieut Feraud unhooked the clasp flung his new dolman on the
      bed and folding his arms across his chest turned to the other hussar
    p
    p
      ldquoDo you imagine I am a man to submit tamely to injusticerdquo he inquired in
      a boisterous voice
    p
    p
      ldquoOh do be reasonablerdquo remonstrated Lieut DrsquoHubert
    p
    p
      ldquoI am reasonable I am perfectly reasonablerdquo retorted the other with
      ominous restraint ldquoI canrsquot call the general to account for his behaviour
      but you are going to answer me for yoursrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoI canrsquot listen to this nonsenserdquo murmured Lieut DrsquoHubert making a
      slightly contemptuous grimace
    p
    p
      ldquoYou call this nonsense It seems to me a perfectly plain statement
      Unless you donrsquot understand Frenchrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoWhat on earth do you meanrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoI meanrdquo screamed suddenly Lieut Feraud ldquoto cut off your ears to teach
      you to disturb me with the generalrsquos orders when I am talking to a ladyrdquo
     p
    p
      A profound silence followed this mad declaration and through the open
      window Lieut DrsquoHubert heard the little birds singing sanely in the
      garden He said preserving his calm ldquoWhy If you take that tone of
      course I shall hold myself at your disposition whenever you are at liberty
      to attend to this affair but I donrsquot think you will cut my ears offrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoI am going to attend to it at oncerdquo declared Lieut Feraud with extreme
      truculence ldquoIf you are thinking of displaying your airs and graces
      tonight in Madame de Lionnersquos salon you are very much mistakenrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoReallyrdquo said Lieut DrsquoHubert who was beginning to feel irritated ldquoyou
      are an impracticable sort of fellow The generalrsquos orders to me were to
      put you under arrest not to carve you into small pieces Goodmorningrdquo
       And turning his back on the little Gascon who always sober in his
      potations was as though born intoxicated with the sunshine of his
      vineripening country the Northman who could drink hard on occasion but
      was born sober under the watery skies of Picardy made for the door
      Hearing however the unmistakable sound behind his back of a sword drawn
      from the scabbard he had no option but to stop
    p
    p
      ldquoDevil take this mad Southernerrdquo he thought spinning round and surveying
      with composure the warlike posture of Lieut Feraud with a bare sword in
      his hand
    p
    p
      ldquoAt oncemdashat oncerdquo stuttered Feraud beside himself
    p
    p
      ldquoYou had my answerrdquo said the other keeping his temper very well
    p
    p
      At first he had been only vexed and somewhat amused but now his face got
      clouded He was asking himself seriously how he could manage to get away
      It was impossible to run from a man with a sword and as to fighting him
      it seemed completely out of the question He waited awhile then said
      exactly what was in his heart
    p
    p
      ldquoDrop this I wonrsquot fight with you I wonrsquot be made ridiculousrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoAh you wonrsquotrdquo hissed the Gascon ldquoI suppose you prefer to be made
      infamous Do you hear what I say    Infamous Infamous Infamousrdquo he
      shrieked rising and falling on his toes and getting very red in the face
    p
    p
      Lieut DrsquoHubert on the contrary became very pale at the sound of the
      unsavoury word for a moment then flushed pink to the roots of his fair
      hair ldquoBut you canrsquot go out to fight you are under arrest you lunaticrdquo
       he objected with angry scorn
    p
    p
      ldquoTherersquos the garden itrsquos big enough to lay out your long carcass inrdquo
       spluttered the other with such ardour that somehow the anger of the cooler
      man subsided
    p
    p
      ldquoThis is perfectly absurdrdquo he said glad enough to think he had found a
      way out of it for the moment ldquoWe shall never get any of our comrades to
      serve as seconds Itrsquos preposterousrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoSeconds Damn the seconds We donrsquot want any seconds Donrsquot you worry
      about any seconds I shall send word to your friends to come and bury you
      when I am done And if you want any witnesses Irsquoll send word to the old
      girl to put her head out of a window at the back Stay Therersquos the
      gardener Hersquoll do Hersquos as deaf as a post but he has two eyes in his
      head Come along I will teach you my staff officer that the carrying
      about of a generalrsquos orders is not always childrsquos playrdquo
     p
    p
      While thus discoursing he had unbuckled his empty scabbard He sent it
      flying under the bed and lowering the point of the sword brushed past
      the perplexed Lieut DrsquoHubert exclaiming ldquoFollow merdquo Directly he had
      flung open the door a faint shriek was heard and the pretty maid who had
      been listening at the keyhole staggered away putting the backs of her
      hands over her eyes Feraud did not seem to see her but she ran after him
      and seized his left arm He shook her off and then she rushed towards
      Lieut DrsquoHubert and clawed at the sleeve of his uniform
    p
    p
      ldquoWretched manrdquo she sobbed ldquoIs this what you wanted to find him forrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoLet me gordquo entreated Lieut DrsquoHubert trying to disengage himself
      gently ldquoItrsquos like being in a madhouserdquo he protested with exasperation
      ldquoDo let me go I wonrsquot do him any harmrdquo
     p
    p
      A fiendish laugh from Lieut Feraud commented that assurance ldquoCome
      alongrdquo he shouted with a stamp of his foot
    p
    p
      And Lieut DrsquoHubert did follow He could do nothing else Yet in
      vindication of his sanity it must be recorded that as he passed through
      the anteroom the notion of opening the street door and bolting out
      presented itself to this brave youth only of course to be instantly
      dismissed for he felt sure that the other would pursue him without shame
      or compunction And the prospect of an officer of hussars being chased
      along the street by another officer of hussars with a naked sword could
      not be for a moment entertained Therefore he followed into the garden
      Behind them the girl tottered out too With ashy lips and wild scared
      eyes she surrendered herself to a dreadful curiosity She had also the
      notion of rushing if need be between Lieut Feraud and death
    p
    p
      The deaf gardener utterly unconscious of approaching footsteps went on
      watering his flowers till Lieut Feraud thumped him on the back Beholding
      suddenly an enraged man flourishing a big sabre the old chap trembling in
      all his limbs dropped the wateringpot At once Lieut Feraud kicked it
      away with great animosity and seizing the gardener by the throat backed
      him against a tree He held him there shouting in his ear ldquoStay here
      and look on You understand Yoursquove got to look on Donrsquot dare budge from
      the spotrdquo
     p
    p
      Lieut DrsquoHubert came slowly down the walk unclasping his dolman with
      unconcealed disgust Even then with his hand already on the hilt of his
      sword he hesitated to draw till a roar ldquoEn garde fichtre What do you
      think you came here forrdquo and the rush of his adversary forced him to put
      himself as quickly as possible in a posture of defence
    p
    p
      The clash of arms filled that prim garden which hitherto had known no
      more warlike sound than the click of clipping shears and presently the
      upper part of an old ladyrsquos body was projected out of a window upstairs
      She tossed her arms above her white cap scolding in a cracked voice The
      gardener remained glued to the tree his toothless mouth open in idiotic
      astonishment and a little farther up the path the pretty girl as if
      spellbound to a small grass plot ran a few steps this way and that
      wringing her hands and muttering crazily She did not rush between the
      combatants the onslaughts of Lieut Feraud were so fierce that her heart
      failed her Lieut DrsquoHubert his faculties concentrated upon defence
      needed all his skill and science of the sword to stop the rushes of his
      adversary Twice already he had to break ground It bothered him to feel
      his foothold made insecure by the round dry gravel of the path rolling
      under the hard soles of his boots This was most unsuitable ground he
      thought keeping a watchful narrowed gaze shaded by long eyelashes upon
      the fiery stare of his thickset adversary This absurd affair would ruin
      his reputation of a sensible wellbehaved promising young officer It
      would damage at any rate his immediate prospects and lose him the
      goodwill of his general These worldly preoccupations were no doubt
      misplaced in view of the solemnity of the moment A duel whether regarded
      as a ceremony in the cult of honour or even when reduced in its moral
      essence to a form of manly sport demands a perfect singleness of
      intention a homicidal austerity of mood On the other hand this vivid
      concern for his future had not a bad effect inasmuch as it began to rouse
      the anger of Lieut DrsquoHubert Some seventy seconds had elapsed since they
      had crossed blades and Lieut DrsquoHubert had to break ground again in order
      to avoid impaling his reckless adversary like a beetle for a cabinet of
      specimens The result was that misapprehending the motive Lieut Feraud
      with a triumphant sort of snarl pressed his attack
    p
    p
      ldquoThis enraged animal will have me against the wall directlyrdquo thought
      Lieut DrsquoHubert He imagined himself much closer to the house than he was
      and he dared not turn his head it seemed to him that he was keeping his
      adversary off with his eyes rather more than with his point Lieut Feraud
      crouched and bounded with a fierce tigerish agility fit to trouble the
      stoutest heart But what was more appalling than the fury of a wild beast
      accomplishing in all innocence of heart a natural function was the fixity
      of savage purpose man alone is capable of displaying Lieut D lsquoHubert in
      the midst of his worldly preoccupations perceived it at last It was an
      absurd and damaging affair to be drawn into but whatever silly intention
      the fellow had started with it was clear enough that by this time he
      meant to killmdashnothing less He meant it with an intensity of will
      utterly beyond the inferior faculties of a tiger
    p
    p
      As is the case with constitutionally brave men the full view of the
      danger interested Lieut DrsquoHubert And directly he got properly
      interested the length of his arm and the coolness of his head told in his
      favour It was the turn of Lieut Feraud to recoil with a bloodcurdling
      grunt of baffled rage He made a swift feint and then rushed straight
      forward
    p
    p
      ldquoAh you would would yourdquo Lieut DrsquoHubert exclaimed mentally The
      combat had lasted nearly two minutes time enough for any man to get
      embittered apart from the merits of the quarrel And all at once it was
      over Trying to close breast to breast under his adversaryrsquos guard Lieut
      Feraud received a slash on his shortened arm He did not feel it in the
      least but it checked his rush and his feet slipping on the gravel he
      fell backwards with great violence The shock jarred his boiling brain
      into the perfect quietude of insensibility Simultaneously with his fall
      the pretty servantgirl shrieked but the old maiden lady at the window
      ceased her scolding and began to cross herself piously
    p
    p
      Beholding his adversary stretched out perfectly still his face to the
      sky Lieut DrsquoHubert thought he had killed him outright The impression of
      having slashed hard enough to cut his man clean in two abode with him for
      a while in an exaggerated memory of the right goodwill he had put into
      the blow He dropped on his knees hastily by the side of the prostrate
      body Discovering that not even the arm was severed a slight sense of
      disappointment mingled with the feeling of relief The fellow deserved the
      worst But truly he did not want the death of that sinner The affair was
      ugly enough as it stood and Lieut DrsquoHubert addressed himself at once to
      the task of stopping the bleeding In this task it was his fate to be
      ridiculously impeded by the pretty maid Rending the air with screams of
      horror she attacked him from behind and twining her fingers in his hair
      tugged back at his head Why she should choose to hinder him at this
      precise moment he could not in the least understand He did not try It
      was all like a very wicked and harassing dream Twice to save himself from
      being pulled over he had to rise and fling her off He did this stoically
      without a word kneeling down again at once to go on with his work But
      the third time his work being done he seized her and held her arms
      pinned to her body Her cap was half off her face was red her eyes
      blazed with crazy boldness He looked mildly into them while she called
      him a wretch a traitor and a murderer many times in succession This did
      not annoy him so much as the conviction that she had managed to scratch
      his face abundantly Ridicule would be added to the scandal of the story
      He imagined the adorned tale making its way through the garrison of the
      town through the whole army on the frontier with every possible
      distortion of motive and sentiment and circumstance spreading a doubt
      upon the sanity of his conduct and the distinction of his taste even to
      the very ears of his honourable family It was all very well for that
      fellow Feraud who had no connections no family to speak of and no
      quality but courage which anyhow was a matter of course and possessed
      by every single trooper in the whole mass of French cavalry Still holding
      down the arms of the girl in a strong grip Lieut DrsquoHubert glanced over
      his shoulder Lieut Feraud had opened his eyes He did not move Like a
      man just waking from a deep sleep he stared without any expression at the
      evening sky
    p
    p
      Lieut DrsquoHubertrsquos urgent shouts to the old gardener produced no effectmdashnot
      so much as to make him shut his toothless mouth Then he remembered that
      the man was stone deaf All that time the girl struggled not with
      maidenly coyness but like a pretty dumb fury kicking his shins now and
      then He continued to hold her as if in a vice his instinct telling him
      that were he to let her go she would fly at his eyes But he was greatly
      humiliated by his position At last she gave up She was more exhausted
      than appeased he feared Nevertheless he attempted to get out of this
      wicked dream by way of negotiation
    p
    p
      ldquoListen to merdquo he said as calmly as he could ldquoWill you promise to run
      for a surgeon if I let you gordquo
     p
    p
      With real affliction he heard her declare that she would do nothing of the
      kind On the contrary her sobbed out intention was to remain in the
      garden and fight tooth and nail for the protection of the vanquished man
      This was shocking
    p
    p
      ldquoMy dear childrdquo he cried in despair ldquois it possible that you think me
      capable of murdering a wounded adversary Is it    Be quiet you
      little wild cat yourdquo
     p
    p
      They struggled A thick drowsy voice said behind him ldquoWhat are you after
      with that girlrdquo
     p
    p
      Lieut Feraud had raised himself on his good arm He was looking sleepily
      at his other arm at the mess of blood on his uniform at a small red pool
      on the ground at his sabre lying a foot away on the path Then he laid
      himself down gently again to think it all out as far as a thundering
      headache would permit of mental operations
    p
    p
      Lieut DrsquoHubert released the girl who crouched at once by the side of the
      other lieutenant The shades of night were falling on the little trim
      garden with this touching group whence proceeded low murmurs of sorrow
      and compassion with other feeble sounds of a different character as if
      an imperfectly awake invalid were trying to swear Lieut DrsquoHubert went
      away
    p
    p
      He passed through the silent house and congratulated himself upon the
      dusk concealing his gory hands and scratched face from the passersby But
      this story could by no means be concealed He dreaded the discredit and
      ridicule above everything and was painfully aware of sneaking through the
      back streets in the manner of a murderer Presently the sounds of a flute
      coming out of the open window of a lighted upstairs room in a modest house
      interrupted his dismal reflections It was being played with a persevering
      virtuosity and through the fioritures of the tune one could hear the
      regular thumping of the foot beating time on the floor
    p
    p
      Lieut DrsquoHubert shouted a name which was that of an army surgeon whom he
      knew fairly well The sounds of the flute ceased and the musician
      appeared at the window his instrument still in his hand peering into the
      street
    p
    p
      ldquoWho calls You DrsquoHubert What brings you this wayrdquo
     p
    p
      He did not like to be disturbed at the hour when he was playing the flute
      He was a man whose hair had turned grey already in the thankless task of
      tying up wounds on battlefields where others reaped advancement and glory
    p
    p
      ldquoI want you to go at once and see Feraud You know Lieut Feraud He lives
      down the second street Itrsquos but a step from hererdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoWhatrsquos the matter with himrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoWoundedrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoAre you surerdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoSurerdquo cried DrsquoHubert ldquoI come from thererdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoThatrsquos amusingrdquo said the elderly surgeon Amusing was his favourite
      word but the expression of his face when he pronounced it never
      corresponded He was a stolid man ldquoCome inrdquo he added ldquoIrsquoll get ready in
      a momentrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoThanks I will I want to wash my hands in your roomrdquo
     p
    p
      Lieut DrsquoHubert found the surgeon occupied in unscrewing his flute and
      packing the pieces methodically in a case He turned his head
    p
    p
      ldquoWater theremdashin the corner Your hands do want washingrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoIrsquove stopped the bleedingrdquo said Lieut DrsquoHubert ldquoBut you had better
      make haste Itrsquos rather more than ten minutes ago you knowrdquo
     p
    p
      The surgeon did not hurry his movements
    p
    p
      ldquoWhatrsquos the matter Dressing came off Thatrsquos amusing Irsquove been at work
      in the hospital all day but Irsquove been told this morning by somebody that
      he had come off without a scratchrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoNot the same duel probablyrdquo growled moodily Lieut DrsquoHubert wiping his
      hands on a coarse towel
    p
    p
      ldquoNot the same    What Another It would take the very devil to make
      me go out twice in one dayrdquo The surgeon looked narrowly at Lieut
      DrsquoHubert ldquoHow did you come by that scratched face Both sides toomdashand
      symmetrical Itrsquos amusingrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoVeryrdquo snarled Lieut DrsquoHubert ldquoAnd you will find his slashed arm
      amusing too It will keep both of you amused for quite a long timerdquo
     p
    p
      The doctor was mystified and impressed by the brusque bitterness of Lieut
      DrsquoHubertrsquos tone They left the house together and in the street he was
      still more mystified by his conduct
    p
    p
      ldquoArenrsquot you coming with merdquo he asked
    p
    p
      ldquoNordquo said Lieut DrsquoHubert ldquoYou can find the house by yourself The front
      door will be standing open very likelyrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoAll right Wherersquos his roomrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoGround floor But you had better go right through and look in the garden
      firstrdquo
     p
    p
      This astonishing piece of information made the surgeon go off without
      further parley Lieut DrsquoHubert regained his quarters nursing a hot and
      uneasy indignation He dreaded the chaff of his comrades almost as much as
      the anger of his superiors The truth was confoundedly grotesque and
      embarrassing even putting aside the irregularity of the combat itself
      which made it come abominably near a criminal offence Like all men
      without much imagination a faculty which helps the process of reflective
      thought Lieut DrsquoHubert became frightfully harassed by the obvious
      aspects of his predicament He was certainly glad that he had not killed
      Lieut Feraud outside all rules and without the regular witnesses proper
      to such a transaction Uncommonly glad At the same time he felt as though
      he would have liked to wring his neck for him without ceremony
    p
    p
      He was still under the sway of these contradictory sentiments when the
      surgeon amateur of the flute came to see him More than three days had
      elapsed Lieut DrsquoHubert was no longer officier drsquoordonnance to the
      general commanding the division He had been sent back to his regiment
      And he was resuming his connection with the soldiersrsquo military family by
      being shut up in close confinement not at his own quarters in town but
      in a room in the barracks Owing to the gravity of the incident he was
      forbidden to see any one He did not know what had happened what was
      being said or what was being thought The arrival of the surgeon was a
      most unexpected thing to the worried captive The amateur of the flute
      began by explaining that he was there only by a special favour of the
      colonel
    p
    p
      ldquoI represented to him that it would be only fair to let you have some
      authentic news of your adversaryrdquo he continued ldquoYoursquoll be glad to hear
      hersquos getting better fastrdquo
     p
    p
      Lieut DrsquoHubertrsquos face exhibited no conventional signs of gladness He
      continued to walk the floor of the dusty bare room
    p
    p
      ldquoTake this chair doctorrdquo he mumbled
    p
    p
      The doctor sat down
    p
    p
      ldquoThis affair is variously appreciatedmdashin town and in the army In
      fact the diversity of opinions is amusingrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoIs itrdquo mumbled Lieut DrsquoHubert tramping steadily from wall to wall But
      within himself he marvelled that there could be two opinions on the
      matter The surgeon continued
    p
    p
      ldquoOf course as the real facts are not knownmdashrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoI should have thoughtrdquo interrupted DrsquoHubert ldquothat the fellow would have
      put you in possession of factsrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoHe said somethingrdquo admitted the other ldquothe first time I saw him And
      by the by I did find him in the garden The thump on the back of his head
      had made him a little incoherent then Afterwards he was rather reticent
      than otherwiserdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoDidnrsquot think he would have the grace to be ashamedrdquo mumbled DrsquoHubert
      resuming his pacing while the doctor murmured ldquoItrsquos very amusing
      Ashamed Shame was not exactly his frame of mind However you may look at
      the matter otherwiserdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoWhat are you talking about What matterrdquo asked DrsquoHubert with a sidelong
      look at the heavyfaced greyhaired figure seated on a wooden chair
    p
    p
      ldquoWhatever it isrdquo said the surgeon a little impatiently ldquoI donrsquot want to
      pronounce any opinion on your conductmdashrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoBy heavens you had better notrdquo burst out DrsquoHubert
    p
    p
      ldquoTheremdashthere Donrsquot be so quick in flourishing the sword It
      doesnrsquot pay in the long run Understand once for all that I would not
      carve any of you youngsters except with the tools of my trade But my
      advice is good If you go on like this you will make for yourself an ugly
      reputationrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoGo on like whatrdquo demanded Lieut DrsquoHubert stopping short quite
      startled ldquoImdashImdashmake for myself a reputation    What do
      you imaginerdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoI told you I donrsquot wish to judge of the rights and wrongs of this
      incident Itrsquos not my business Neverthelessmdashrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoWhat on earth has he been telling yourdquo interrupted Lieut DrsquoHubert in a
      sort of awed scare
    p
    p
      ldquoI told you already that at first when I picked him up in the garden he
      was incoherent Afterwards he was naturally reticent But I gather at
      least that he could not help himselfrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoHe couldnrsquotrdquo shouted Lieut DrsquoHubert in a great voice Then lowering
      his tone impressively ldquoAnd what about me Could I help myselfrdquo
     p
    p
      The surgeon stood up His thoughts were running upon the flute his
      constant companion with a consoling voice In the vicinity of field
      ambulances after twentyfour hoursrsquo hard work he had been known to
      trouble with its sweet sounds the horrible stillness of battlefields
      given over to silence and the dead The solacing hour of his daily life
      was approaching and in peace time he held on to the minutes as a miser to
      his hoard
    p
    p
      ldquoOf coursemdashof courserdquo he said perfunctorily ldquoYou would think so
      Itrsquos amusing However being perfectly neutral and friendly to you both I
      have consented to deliver his message to you Say that I am humouring an
      invalid if you like He wants you to know that this affair is by no means
      at an end He intends to send you his seconds directly he has regained his
      strengthmdashproviding of course the army is not in the field at that
      timerdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoHe intends does he Why certainlyrdquo spluttered Lieut DrsquoHubert in a
      passion
    p
    p
      The secret of his exasperation was not apparent to the visitor but this
      passion confirmed the surgeon in the belief which was gaining ground
      outside that some very serious difference had arisen between these two
      young men something serious enough to wear an air of mystery some fact
      of the utmost gravity To settle their urgent difference about that fact
      those two young men had risked being broken and disgraced at the outset
      almost of their career The surgeon feared that the forthcoming inquiry
      would fail to satisfy the public curiosity They would not take the public
      into their confidence as to that something which had passed between them
      of a nature so outrageous as to make them face a charge of murdermdashneither
      more nor less But what could it be
    p
    p
      The surgeon was not very curious by temperament but that question
      haunting his mind caused him twice that evening to hold the instrument off
      his lips and sit silent for a whole minutemdashright in the middle of a
      tunemdashtrying to form a plausible conjecture
    p
    p

    p
    p
      He succeeded in this object no better than the rest of the garrison and
      the whole of society The two young officers of no especial consequence
      till then became distinguished by the universal curiosity as to the
      origin of their quarrel Madame de Lionnersquos salon was the centre of
      ingenious surmises that lady herself was for a time assailed by inquiries
      as being the last person known to have spoken to these unhappy and
      reckless young men before they went out together from her house to a
      savage encounter with swords at dusk in a private garden She protested
      she had not observed anything unusual in their demeanour Lieut Feraud
      had been visibly annoyed at being called away That was natural enough no
      man likes to be disturbed in a conversation with a lady famed for her
      elegance and sensibility But in truth the subject bored Madame de Lionne
      since her personality could by no stretch of reckless gossip be connected
      with this affair And it irritated her to hear it advanced that there
      might have been some woman in the case This irritation arose not from
      her elegance or sensibility but from a more instinctive side of her
      nature It became so great at last that she peremptorily forbade the
      subject to be mentioned under her roof Near her couch the prohibition was
      obeyed but farther off in the salon the pall of the imposed silence
      continued to be lifted more or less A personage with a long pale face
      resembling the countenance of a sheep opined shaking his head that it
      was a quarrel of long standing envenomed by time It was objected to him
      that the men themselves were too young for such a theory They belonged
      also to different and distant parts of France There were other physical
      impossibilities too A subcommissary of the Intendence an agreeable and
      cultivated bachelor in kerseymere breeches Hessian boots and a blue coat
      embroidered with silver lace who affected to believe in the
      transmigration of souls suggested that the two had met perhaps in some
      previous existence The feud was in the forgotten past It might have been
      something quite inconceivable in the present state of their being but
      their souls remembered the animosity and manifested an instinctive
      antagonism He developed this theme jocularly Yet the affair was so
      absurd from the worldly the military the honourable or the prudential
      point of view that this weird explanation seemed rather more reasonable
      than any other
    p
    p
      The two officers had confided nothing definite to any one Humiliation at
      having been worsted arms in hand and an uneasy feeling of having been
      involved in a scrape by the injustice of fate kept Lieut Feraud savagely
      dumb He mistrusted the sympathy of mankind That would of course go to
      that dandified staff officer Lying in bed he raved aloud to the pretty
      maid who administered to his needs with devotion and listened to his
      horrible imprecations with alarm That Lieut DrsquoHubert should be made to
      ldquopay for itrdquo seemed to her just and natural Her principal care was that
      Lieut Feraud should not excite himself He appeared so wholly admirable
      and fascinating to the humility of her heart that her only concern was to
      see him get well quickly even if it were only to resume his visits to
      Madame de Lionnersquos salon
    p
    p
      Lieut DrsquoHubert kept silent for the immediate reason that there was no
      one except a stupid young soldier servant to speak to Further he was
      aware that the episode so grave professionally had its comic side When
      reflecting upon it he still felt that he would like to wring Lieut
      Feraudrsquos neck for him But this formula was figurative rather than
      precise and expressed more a state of mind than an actual physical
      impulse At the same time there was in that young man a feeling of
      comradeship and kindness which made him unwilling to make the position of
      Lieut Feraud worse than it was He did not want to talk at large about
      this wretched affair At the inquiry he would have of course to speak
      the truth in selfdefence This prospect vexed him
    p
    p
      But no inquiry took place The army took the field instead Lieut
      DrsquoHubert liberated without remark took up his regimental duties and
      Lieut Feraud his arm just out of the sling rode unquestioned with his
      squadron to complete his convalescence in the smoke of battlefields and
      the fresh air of night bivouacs This bracing treatment suited him so
      well that at the first rumour of an armistice being signed he could turn
      without misgivings to the thoughts of his private warfare
    p
    p
      This time it was to be regular warfare He sent two friends to Lieut
      DrsquoHubert whose regiment was stationed only a few miles away Those
      friends had asked no questions of their principal ldquoI owe him one that
      pretty staff officerrdquo he had said grimly and they went away quite
      contentedly on their mission Lieut DrsquoHubert had no difficulty in finding
      two friends equally discreet and devoted to their principal ldquoTherersquos a
      crazy fellow to whom I must give a lessonrdquo he had declared curtly and
      they asked for no better reasons
    p
    p
      On these grounds an encounter with duellingswords was arranged one early
      morning in a convenient field At the third setto Lieut DrsquoHubert found
      himself lying on his back on the dewy grass with a hole in his side A
      serene sun rising over a landscape of meadows and woods hung on his left
      A surgeonmdashnot the flute player but anothermdashwas bending over
      him feeling around the wound
    p
    p
      ldquoNarrow squeak But it will be nothingrdquo he pronounced
    p
    p
      Lieut DrsquoHubert heard these words with pleasure One of his seconds
      sitting on the wet grass and sustaining his head on his lap said ldquoThe
      fortune of war mon pauvre vieux What will you have You had better make
      it up like two good fellows Dordquo
     p
    p
      ldquoYou donrsquot know what you askrdquo murmured Lieut DrsquoHubert in a feeble
      voice ldquoHowever if he   rdquo
     p
    p
      In another part of the meadow the seconds of Lieut Feraud were urging him
      to go over and shake hands with his adversary
    p
    p
      ldquoYou have paid him off nowmdashque diable Itrsquos the proper thing to do
      This DrsquoHubert is a decent fellowrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoI know the decency of these generalsrsquo petsrdquo muttered Lieut Feraud
      through his teeth and the sombre expression of his face discouraged
      further efforts at reconciliation The seconds bowing from a distance
      took their men off the field In the afternoon Lieut DrsquoHubert very
      popular as a good comrade uniting great bravery with a frank and equable
      temper had many visitors It was remarked that Lieut Feraud did not as
      is customary show himself much abroad to receive the felicitations of his
      friends They would not have failed him because he too was liked for
      the exuberance of his southern nature and the simplicity of his character
      In all the places where officers were in the habit of assembling at the
      end of the day the duel of the morning was talked over from every point of
      view Though Lieut DrsquoHubert had got worsted this time his sword play was
      commended No one could deny that it was very close very scientific It
      was even whispered that if he got touched it was because he wished to
      spare his adversary But by many the vigour and dash of Lieut Feraudrsquos
      attack were pronounced irresistible
    p
    p
      The merits of the two officers as combatants were frankly discussed but
      their attitude to each other after the duel was criticised lightly and
      with caution It was irreconcilable and that was to be regretted But
      after all they knew best what the care of their honour dictated It was
      not a matter for their comrades to pry into overmuch As to the origin of
      the quarrel the general impression was that it dated from the time they
      were holding garrison in Strasbourg The musical surgeon shook his head at
      that It went much farther back he thought
    p
    p
      ldquoWhy of course You must know the whole storyrdquo cried several voices
      eager with curiosity ldquoWhat was itrdquo
     p
    p
      He raised his eyes from his glass deliberately ldquoEven if I knew ever so
      well you canrsquot expect me to tell you since both the principals choose to
      say nothingrdquo
     p
    p
      He got up and went out leaving the sense of mystery behind him He could
      not stay any longer because the witching hour of fluteplaying was
      drawing near
    p
    p
      After he had gone a very young officer observed solemnly ldquoObviously his
      lips are sealedrdquo
     p
    p
      Nobody questioned the high correctness of that remark Somehow it added to
      the impressiveness of the affair Several older officers of both
      regiments prompted by nothing but sheer kindness and love of harmony
      proposed to form a Court of Honour to which the two young men would leave
      the task of their reconciliation Unfortunately they began by approaching
      Lieut Feraud on the assumption that having just scored heavily he
      would be found placable and disposed to moderation
    p
    p
      The reasoning was sound enough Nevertheless the move turned out
      unfortunate In that relaxation of moral fibre which is brought about by
      the ease of soothed vanity Lieut Feraud had condescended in the secret
      of his heart to review the case and even had come to doubt not the
      justice of his cause but the absolute sagacity of his conduct This being
      so he was disinclined to talk about it The suggestion of the regimental
      wise men put him in a difficult position He was disgusted at it and this
      disgust by a paradoxical logic reawakened his animosity against Lieut
      DrsquoHubert Was he to be pestered with this fellow for evermdashthe fellow
      who had an infernal knack of getting round people somehow And yet it was
      difficult to refuse point blank that mediation sanctioned by the code of
      honour
    p
    p
      He met the difficulty by an attitude of grim reserve He twisted his
      moustache and used vague words His case was perfectly clear He was not
      ashamed to state it before a proper Court of Honour neither was he afraid
      to defend it on the ground He did not see any reason to jump at the
      suggestion before ascertaining how his adversary was likely to take it
    p
    p
      Later in the day his exasperation growing upon him he was heard in a
      public place saying sardonically ldquothat it would be the very luckiest
      thing for Lieut DrsquoHubert because the next time of meeting he need not
      hope to get off with the mere trifle of three weeks in bedrdquo
     p
    p
      This boastful phrase might have been prompted by the most profound
      Machiavellism Southern natures often hide under the outward
      impulsiveness of action and speech a certain amount of astuteness
    p
    p
      Lieut Feraud mistrusting the justice of men by no means desired a Court
      of Honour and the above words according so well with his temperament
      had also the merit of serving his turn Whether meant so or not they
      found their way in less than fourandtwenty hours into Lieut DrsquoHubertrsquos
      bedroom In consequence Lieut DrsquoHubert sitting propped up with pillows
      received the overtures made to him next day by the statement that the
      affair was of a nature which could not bear discussion
    p
    p
      The pale face of the wounded officer his weak voice which he had yet to
      use cautiously and the courteous dignity of his tone had a great effect
      on his hearers Reported outside all this did more for deepening the
      mystery than the vapourings of Lieut Feraud This last was greatly
      relieved at the issue He began to enjoy the state of general wonder and
      was pleased to add to it by assuming an attitude of fierce discretion
    p
    p
      The colonel of Lieut DrsquoHubertrsquos regiment was a greyhaired
      weatherbeaten warrior who took a simple view of his responsibilities ldquoI
      canrsquotrdquo he said to himself ldquolet the best of my subalterns get damaged
      like this for nothing I must get to the bottom of this affair privately
      He must speak out if the devil were in it The colonel should be more than
      a father to these youngstersrdquo And indeed he loved all his men with as
      much affection as a father of a large family can feel for every individual
      member of it If human beings by an oversight of Providence came into the
      world as mere civilians they were born again into a regiment as infants
      are born into a family and it was that military birth alone which
      counted
    p
    p
      At the sight of Lieut DrsquoHubert standing before him very bleached and
      holloweyed the heart of the old warrior felt a pang of genuine
      compassion All his affection for the regimentmdashthat body of men
      which he held in his hand to launch forward and draw back who ministered
      to his pride and commanded all his thoughtsmdashseemed centred for a
      moment on the person of the most promising subaltern He cleared his
      throat in a threatening manner and frowned terribly ldquoYou must
      understandrdquo he began ldquothat I donrsquot care a rap for the life of a single
      man in the regiment I would send the eight hundred and fortythree of you
      men and horses galloping into the pit of perdition with no more
      compunction than I would kill a flyrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoYes Colonel You would be riding at our headrdquo said Lieut DrsquoHubert with
      a wan smile
    p
    p
      The colonel who felt the need of being very diplomatic fairly roared at
      this ldquoI want you to know Lieut DrsquoHubert that I could stand aside and
      see you all riding to Hades if need be I am a man to do even that if the
      good of the service and my duty to my country required it from me But
      thatrsquos unthinkable so donrsquot you even hint at such a thingrdquo He glared
      awfully but his tone softened ldquoTherersquos some milk yet about that
      moustache of yours my boy You donrsquot know what a man like me is capable
      of I would hide behind a haystack if    Donrsquot grin at me sir How
      dare you If this were not a private conversation I would    Look here
      I am responsible for the proper expenditure of lives under my command for
      the glory of our country and the honour of the regiment Do you understand
      that Well then what the devil do you mean by letting yourself be
      spitted like this by that fellow of the th Hussars Itrsquos simply
      disgracefulrdquo
     p
    p
      Lieut DrsquoHubert felt vexed beyond measure His shoulders moved slightly
      He made no other answer He could not ignore his responsibility
    p
    p
      The colonel veiled his glance and lowered his voice still more ldquoItrsquos
      deplorablerdquo he murmured And again he changed his tone ldquoComerdquo he went
      on persuasively but with that note of authority which dwells in the
      throat of a good leader of men ldquothis affair must be settled I desire to
      be told plainly what it is all about I demand as your best friend to
      knowrdquo
     p
    p
      The compelling power of authority the persuasive influence of kindness
      affected powerfully a man just risen from a bed of sickness Lieut
      DrsquoHubertrsquos hand which grasped the knob of a stick trembled slightly But
      his northern temperament sentimental yet cautious and clearsighted too
      in its idealistic way checked his impulse to make a clean breast of the
      whole deadly absurdity According to the precept of transcendental wisdom
      he turned his tongue seven times in his mouth before he spoke He made
      then only a speech of thanks
    p
    p
      The colonel listened interested at first then looked mystified At last
      he frowned ldquoYou hesitatemdashmille tonnerres Havenrsquot I told you that
      I will condescend to argue with youmdashas a friendrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoYes Colonelrdquo answered Lieut DrsquoHubert gently ldquoBut I am afraid that
      after you have heard me out as a friend you will take action as my
      superior officerrdquo
     p
    p
      The attentive colonel snapped his jaws ldquoWell what of thatrdquo he said
      frankly ldquoIs it so damnably disgracefulrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoIt is notrdquo negatived Lieut DrsquoHubert in a faint but firm voice
    p
    p
      ldquoOf course I shall act for the good of the service Nothing can prevent
      me doing that What do you think I want to be told forrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoI know it is not from idle curiosityrdquo protested Lieut DrsquoHubert ldquoI know
      you will act wisely But what about the good fame of the regimentrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoIt cannot be affected by any youthful folly of a lieutenantrdquo said the
      colonel severely
    p
    p
      ldquoNo It cannot be But it can be by evil tongues It will be said that a
      lieutenant of the th Hussars afraid of meeting his adversary is hiding
      behind his colonel And that would be worse than hiding behind a haystackmdashfor
      the good of the service I cannot afford to do that Colonelrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoNobody would dare to say anything of the kindrdquo began the colonel very
      fiercely but ended the phrase on an uncertain note The bravery of Lieut
      DrsquoHubert was well known But the colonel was well aware that the duelling
      courage the single combat courage is rightly or wrongly supposed to be
      courage of a special sort And it was eminently necessary that an officer
      of his regiment should possess every kind of couragemdashand prove it
      too The colonel stuck out his lower lip and looked far away with a
      peculiar glazed stare This was the expression of his perplexitymdashan
      expression practically unknown to his regiment for perplexity is a
      sentiment which is incompatible with the rank of colonel of cavalry The
      colonel himself was overcome by the unpleasant novelty of the sensation
      As he was not accustomed to think except on professional matters connected
      with the welfare of men and horses and the proper use thereof on the
      field of glory his intellectual efforts degenerated into mere mental
      repetitions of profane language ldquoMille tonnerres    Sacre nom de nom
        rdquo he thought
    p
    p
      Lieut DrsquoHubert coughed painfully and added in a weary voice ldquoThere will
      be plenty of evil tongues to say that Irsquove been cowed And I am sure you
      will not expect me to pass that over I may find myself suddenly with a
      dozen duels on my hands instead of this one affairrdquo
     p
    p
      The direct simplicity of this argument came home to the colonelrsquos
      understanding He looked at his subordinate fixedly ldquoSit down
      Lieutenantrdquo he said gruffly ldquoThis is the very devil of a    Sit
      downrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoMon Colonelrdquo DrsquoHubert began again ldquoI am not afraid of evil tongues
      Therersquos a way of silencing them But therersquos my peace of mind too I
      wouldnrsquot be able to shake off the notion that Irsquove ruined a brother
      officer Whatever action you take it is bound to go farther The inquiry
      has been droppedmdashlet it rest now It would have been absolutely
      fatal to Feraudrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoHey What Did he behave so badlyrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoYes It was pretty badrdquo muttered Lieut DrsquoHubert Being still very weak
      he felt a disposition to cry
    p
    p
      As the other man did not belong to his own regiment the colonel had no
      difficulty in believing this He began to pace up and down the room He
      was a good chief a man capable of discreet sympathy But he was human in
      other ways too and this became apparent because he was not capable of
      artifice
    p
    p
      ldquoThe very devil Lieutenantrdquo he blurted out in the innocence of his
      heart ldquois that I have declared my intention to get to the bottom of this
      affair And when a colonel says something    you see   rdquo
     p
    p
      Lieut DrsquoHubert broke in earnestly ldquoLet me entreat you Colonel to be
      satisfied with taking my word of honour that I was put into a damnable
      position where I had no option I had no choice whatever consistent with
      my dignity as a man and an officer    After all Colonel this fact is
      the very bottom of this affair Here yoursquove got it The rest is mere
      detail   rdquo
     p
    p
      The colonel stopped short The reputation of Lieut DrsquoHubert for good
      sense and good temper weighed in the balance A cool head a warm heart
      open as the day Always correct in his behaviour One had to trust him
      The colonel repressed manfully an immense curiosity ldquoHrsquom You affirm that
      as a man and an officer    No option Ehrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoAs an officermdashan officer of the th Hussars toordquo insisted Lieut
      DrsquoHubert ldquoI had not And that is the bottom of the affair Colonelrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoYes But still I donrsquot see why to onersquos colonel    A colonel is a
      fathermdashque diablerdquo
     p
    p
      Lieut DrsquoHubert ought not to have been allowed out as yet He was becoming
      aware of his physical insufficiency with humiliation and despair But the
      morbid obstinacy of an invalid possessed him and at the same time he felt
      with dismay his eyes filling with water This trouble seemed too big to
      handle A tear fell down the thin pale cheek of Lieut DrsquoHubert
    p
    p
      The colonel turned his back on him hastily You could have heard a pin
      drop ldquoThis is some silly woman storymdashis it notrdquo
     p
    p
      Saying these words the chief spun round to seize the truth which is not a
      beautiful shape living in a well but a shy bird best caught by stratagem
      This was the last move of the colonelrsquos diplomacy He saw the truth
      shining unmistakably in the gesture of Lieut DrsquoHubert raising his weak
      arms and his eyes to heaven in supreme protest
    p
    p
      ldquoNot a woman affairmdashehrdquo growled the colonel staring hard ldquoI donrsquot
      ask you who or where All I want to know is whether there is a woman in
      itrdquo
     p
    p
      Lieut DrsquoHubertrsquos arms dropped and his weak voice was pathetically
      broken
    p
    p
      ldquoNothing of the kind mon Colonelrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoOn your honourrdquo insisted the old warrior
    p
    p
      ldquoOn my honourrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoVery wellrdquo said the colonel thoughtfully and bit his lip The
      arguments of Lieut DrsquoHubert helped by his liking for the man had
      convinced him On the other hand it was highly improper that his
      intervention of which he had made no secret should produce no visible
      effect He kept Lieut DrsquoHubert a few minutes longer and dismissed him
      kindly
    p
    p
      ldquoTake a few days more in bed Lieutenant What the devil does the surgeon
      mean by reporting you fit for dutyrdquo
     p
    p
      On coming out of the colonelrsquos quarters Lieut DrsquoHubert said nothing to
      the friend who was waiting outside to take him home He said nothing to
      anybody Lieut DrsquoHubert made no confidences But on the evening of that
      day the colonel strolling under the elms growing near his quarters in
      the company of his second in command opened his lips
    p
    p
      ldquoIrsquove got to the bottom of this affairrdquo he remarked The lieutcolonel
      a dry brown chip of a man with short sidewhiskers pricked up his ears
      at that without letting a sign of curiosity escape him
    p
    p
      ldquoItrsquos no triflerdquo added the colonel oracularly The other waited for a
      long while before he murmured
    p
    p
      ldquoIndeed sirrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoNo triflerdquo repeated the colonel looking straight before him ldquoIrsquove
      however forbidden DrsquoHubert either to send to or receive a challenge from
      Feraud for the next twelve monthsrdquo
     p
    p
      He had imagined this prohibition to save the prestige a colonel should
      have The result of it was to give an official seal to the mystery
      surrounding this deadly quarrel Lieut DrsquoHubert repelled by an impassive
      silence all attempts to worm the truth out of him Lieut Feraud secretly
      uneasy at first regained his assurance as time went on He disguised his
      ignorance of the meaning of the imposed truce by slight sardonic laughs
      as though he were amused by what he intended to keep to himself ldquoBut what
      will you dordquo his chums used to ask him He contented himself by replying
      ldquoQui vivra verrardquo with a little truculent air And everybody admired his
      discretion
    p
    p
      Before the end of the truce Lieut DrsquoHubert got his troop The promotion
      was well earned but somehow no one seemed to expect the event When
      Lieut Feraud heard of it at a gathering of officers he muttered through
      his teeth ldquoIs that sordquo At once he unhooked his sabre from a peg near the
      door buckled it on carefully and left the company without another word
      He walked home with measured steps struck a light with his flint and
      steel and lit his tallow candle Then snatching an unlucky glass tumbler
      off the mantelpiece he dashed it violently on the floor
    p
    p
      Now that DrsquoHubert was an officer of superior rank there could be no
      question of a duel Neither of them could send or receive a challenge
      without rendering himself amenable to a courtmartial It was not to be
      thought of Lieut Feraud who for many days now had experienced no real
      desire to meet Lieut DrsquoHubert arms in hand chafed again at the
      systematic injustice of fate ldquoDoes he think he will escape me in that
      wayrdquo he thought indignantly He saw in this promotion an intrigue a
      conspiracy a cowardly manoeuvre That colonel knew what he was doing He
      had hastened to recommend his favourite for a step It was outrageous that
      a man should be able to avoid the consequences of his acts in such a dark
      and tortuous manner
    p
    p
      Of a happygolucky disposition of a temperament more pugnacious than
      military Lieut Feraud had been content to give and receive blows for
      sheer love of armed strife and without much thought of advancement but
      now an urgent desire to get on sprang up in his breast This fighter by
      vocation resolved in his mind to seize showy occasions and to court the
      favourable opinion of his chiefs like a mere worldling He knew he was as
      brave as any one and never doubted his personal charm Nevertheless
      neither the bravery nor the charm seemed to work very swiftly Lieut
      Feraudrsquos engaging careless truculence of a beau sabreur underwent a
      change He began to make bitter allusions to ldquoclever fellows who stick at
      nothing to get onrdquo The army was full of them he would say you had only
      to look round But all the time he had in view one person only his
      adversary DrsquoHubert Once he confided to an appreciative friend ldquoYou see
      I donrsquot know how to fawn on the right sort of people It isnrsquot in my
      characterrdquo
     p
    p
      He did not get his step till a week after Austerlitz The Light Cavalry of
      the Grand Army had its hands very full of interesting work for a little
      while Directly the pressure of professional occupation had been eased
      Captain Feraud took measures to arrange a meeting without loss of time ldquoI
      know my birdrdquo he observed grimly ldquoIf I donrsquot look sharp he will take
      care to get himself promoted over the heads of a dozen better men than
      himself Hersquos got the knack for that sort of thingrdquo
     p
    p
      This duel was fought in Silesia If not fought to a finish it was at any
      rate fought to a standstill The weapon was the cavalry sabre and the
      skill the science the vigour and the determination displayed by the
      adversaries compelled the admiration of the beholders It became the
      subject of talk on both shores of the Danube and as far as the garrisons
      of Gratz and Laybach They crossed blades seven times Both had many cuts
      which bled profusely Both refused to have the combat stopped time after
      time with what appeared the most deadly animosity This appearance was
      caused on the part of Captain DrsquoHubert by a rational desire to be done
      once for all with this worry on the part of Captain Feraud by a
      tremendous exaltation of his pugnacious instincts and the incitement of
      wounded vanity At last dishevelled their shirts in rags covered with
      gore and hardly able to stand they were led away forcibly by their
      marvelling and horrified seconds Later on besieged by comrades avid of
      details these gentlemen declared that they could not have allowed that
      sort of hacking to go on indefinitely Asked whether the quarrel was
      settled this time they gave it out as their conviction that it was a
      difference which could only be settled by one of the parties remaining
      lifeless on the ground The sensation spread from army corps to army
      corps and penetrated at last to the smallest detachments of the troops
      cantoned between the Rhine and the Save In the cafes in Vienna it was
      generally estimated from details to hand that the adversaries would be
      able to meet again in three weeksrsquo time on the outside Something really
      transcendent in the way of duelling was expected
    p
    p
      These expectations were brought to naught by the necessities of the
      service which separated the two officers No official notice had been
      taken of their quarrel It was now the property of the army and not to be
      meddled with lightly But the story of the duel or rather their duelling
      propensities must have stood somewhat in the way of their advancement
      because they were still captains when they came together again during the
      war with Prussia Detached north after Jena with the army commanded by
      Marshal Bernadotte Prince of Ponte Corvo they entered Lubeck together
    p
    p
      It was only after the occupation of that town that Captain Feraud found
      leisure to consider his future conduct in view of the fact that Captain
      DrsquoHubert had been given the position of third aidedecamp to the marshal
      He considered it a great part of a night and in the morning summoned two
      sympathetic friends
    p
    p
      ldquoIrsquove been thinking it over calmlyrdquo he said gazing at them with
      bloodshot tired eyes ldquoI see that I must get rid of that intriguing
      personage Here hersquos managed to sneak on to the personal staff of the
      marshal Itrsquos a direct provocation to me I canrsquot tolerate a situation in
      which I am exposed any day to receive an order through him And God knows
      what order too That sort of thing has happened once beforemdashand
      thatrsquos once too often He understands this perfectly never fear I canrsquot
      tell you any more Now you know what it is you have to dordquo
     p
    p
      This encounter took place outside the town of Lubeck on very open ground
      selected with special care in deference to the general sentiment of the
      cavalry division belonging to the army corps that this time the two
      officers should meet on horseback After all this duel was a cavalry
      affair and to persist in fighting on foot would look like a slight on
      onersquos own arm of the service The seconds startled by the unusual nature
      of the suggestion hastened to refer to their principals Captain Feraud
      jumped at it with alacrity For some obscure reason depending no doubt
      on his psychology he imagined himself invincible on horseback All alone
      within the four walls of his room he rubbed his hands and muttered
      triumphantly ldquoAha my pretty staff officer Irsquove got you nowrdquo
     p
    p
      Captain DrsquoHubert on his side after staring hard for a considerable time
      at his friends shrugged his shoulders slightly This affair had
      hopelessly and unreasonably complicated his existence for him One
      absurdity more or less in the development did not mattermdashall
      absurdity was distasteful to him but urbane as ever he produced a
      faintly ironical smile and said in his calm voice ldquoIt certainly will do
      away to some extent with the monotony of the thingrdquo
     p
    p
      When left alone he sat down at a table and took his head into his hands
      He had not spared himself of late and the marshal had been working all his
      aidesdecamp particularly hard The last three weeks of campaigning in
      horrible weather had affected his health When overtired he suffered from
      a stitch in his wounded side and that uncomfortable sensation always
      depressed him ldquoItrsquos that brutersquos doing toordquo he thought bitterly
    p
    p
      The day before he had received a letter from home announcing that his
      only sister was going to be married He reflected that from the time she
      was nineteen and he twentysix when he went away to garrison life in
      Strasbourg he had had but two short glimpses of her They had been great
      friends and confidants and now she was going to be given away to a man
      whom he did not knowmdasha very worthy fellow no doubt but not half
      good enough for her He would never see his old Leonie again She had a
      capable little head and plenty of tact she would know how to manage the
      fellow to be sure He was easy in his mind about her happiness but he
      felt ousted from the first place in her thoughts which had been his ever
      since the girl could speak A melancholy regret of the days of his
      childhood settled upon Captain DrsquoHubert third aidedecamp to the Prince
      of Ponte Corvo
    p
    p
      He threw aside the letter of congratulation he had begun to write as in
      duty bound but without enthusiasm He took a fresh piece of paper and
      traced on it the words ldquoThis is my last will and testamentrdquo Looking at
      these words he gave himself up to unpleasant reflection a presentiment
      that he would never see the scenes of his childhood weighed down the
      equable spirits of Captain DrsquoHubert He jumped up pushing his chair back
      yawned elaborately in sign that he didnrsquot care anything for presentiments
      and throwing himself on the bed went to sleep During the night he
      shivered from time to time without waking up In the morning he rode out
      of town between his two seconds talking of indifferent things and
      looking right and left with apparent detachment into the heavy morning
      mists shrouding the flat green fields bordered by hedges He leaped a
      ditch and saw the forms of many mounted men moving in the fog ldquoWe are to
      fight before a gallery it seemsrdquo he muttered to himself bitterly
    p
    p
      His seconds were rather concerned at the state of the atmosphere but
      presently a pale sickly sun struggled out of the low vapours and Captain
      DrsquoHubert made out in the distance three horsemen riding a little apart
      from the others It was Captain Feraud and his seconds He drew his sabre
      and assured himself that it was properly fastened to his wrist And now
      the seconds who had been standing in close group with the heads of their
      horses together separated at an easy canter leaving a large clear field
      between him and his adversary Captain DrsquoHubert looked at the pale sun at
      the dismal fields and the imbecility of the impending fight filled him
      with desolation From a distant part of the field a stentorian voice
      shouted commands at proper intervals Au pasmdashAu trotmdashCharrrgez
         Presentiments of death donrsquot come to a man for nothing he thought
      at the very moment he put spurs to his horse
    p
    p
      And therefore he was more than surprised when at the very first setto
      Captain Feraud laid himself open to a cut over the forehead which
      blinding him with blood ended the combat almost before it had fairly
      begun It was impossible to go on Captain DrsquoHubert leaving his enemy
      swearing horribly and reeling in the saddle between his two appalled
      friends leaped the ditch again into the road and trotted home with his
      two seconds who seemed rather awestruck at the speedy issue of that
      encounter In the evening Captain DrsquoHubert finished the congratulatory
      letter on his sisterrsquos marriage
    p
    p
      He finished it late It was a long letter Captain DrsquoHubert gave reins to
      his fancy He told his sister that he would feel rather lonely after this
      great change in her life but then the day would come for him too to get
      married In fact he was thinking already of the time when there would be
      no one left to fight with in Europe and the epoch of wars would be over
      ldquoI expect thenrdquo he wrote ldquoto be within measurable distance of a
      marshalrsquos baton and you will be an experienced married woman You shall
      look out a wife for me I will be probably bald by then and a little
      blase I shall require a young girl pretty of course and with a large
      fortune which should help me to close my glorious career in the splendour
      befitting my exalted rankrdquo He ended with the information that he had just
      given a lesson to a worrying quarrelsome fellow who imagined he had a
      grievance against him ldquoBut if you in the depths of your provincerdquo he
      continued ldquoever hear it said that your brother is of a quarrelsome
      disposition donrsquot you believe it on any account There is no saying what
      gossip from the army may reach your innocent ears Whatever you hear you
      may rest assured that your everloving brother is not a duellistrdquo Then
      Captain DrsquoHubert crumpled up the blank sheet of paper headed with the
      words ldquoThis is my last will and testamentrdquo and threw it in the fire with
      a great laugh at himself He didnrsquot care a snap for what that lunatic
      could do He had suddenly acquired the conviction that his adversary was
      utterly powerless to affect his life in any sort of way except perhaps
      in the way of putting a special excitement into the delightful gay
      intervals between the campaigns
    p
    p
      From this on there were however to be no peaceful intervals in the
      career of Captain DrsquoHubert He saw the fields of Eylau and Friedland
      marched and countermarched in the snow in the mud in the dust of Polish
      plains picking up distinction and advancement on all the roads of
      Northeastern Europe Meantime Captain Feraud despatched southwards with
      his regiment made unsatisfactory war in Spain It was only when the
      preparations for the Russian campaign began that he was ordered north
      again He left the country of mantillas and oranges without regret
    p
    p
      The first signs of a not unbecoming baldness added to the lofty aspect of
      Colonel DrsquoHubertrsquos forehead This feature was no longer white and smooth
      as in the days of his youth the kindly open glance of his blue eyes had
      grown a little hard as if from much peering through the smoke of battles
      The ebony crop on Colonel Feraudrsquos head coarse and crinkly like a cap of
      horsehair showed many silver threads about the temples A detestable
      warfare of ambushes and inglorious surprises had not improved his temper
      The beaklike curve of his nose was unpleasantly set off by a deep fold on
      each side of his mouth The round orbits of his eyes radiated wrinkles
      More than ever he recalled an irritable and staring birdmdashsomething
      like a cross between a parrot and an owl He was still extremely outspoken
      in his dislike of ldquointriguing fellowsrdquo He seized every opportunity to
      state that he did not pick up his rank in the anterooms of marshals The
      unlucky persons civil or military who with an intention of being
      pleasant begged Colonel Feraud to tell them how he came by that very
      apparent scar on the forehead were astonished to find themselves snubbed
      in various ways some of which were simply rude and others mysteriously
      sardonic Young officers were warned kindly by their more experienced
      comrades not to stare openly at the colonelrsquos scar But indeed an officer
      need have been very young in his profession not to have heard the
      legendary tale of that duel originating in a mysterious unforgivable
      offence
    p
    p
      III
    p
    p
      The retreat from Moscow submerged all private feelings in a sea of
      disaster and misery Colonels without regiments DrsquoHubert and Feraud
      carried the musket in the ranks of the socalled sacred battalionmdasha
      battalion recruited from officers of all arms who had no longer any troops
      to lead
    p
    p
      In that battalion promoted colonels did duty as sergeants the generals
      captained the companies a marshal of France Prince of the Empire
      commanded the whole All had provided themselves with muskets picked up on
      the road and with cartridges taken from the dead In the general
      destruction of the bonds of discipline and duty holding together the
      companies the battalions the regiments the brigades and divisions of
      an armed host this body of men put its pride in preserving some semblance
      of order and formation The only stragglers were those who fell out to
      give up to the frost their exhausted souls They plodded on and their
      passage did not disturb the mortal silence of the plains shining with the
      livid light of snows under a sky the colour of ashes Whirlwinds ran along
      the fields broke against the dark column enveloped it in a turmoil of
      flying icicles and subsided disclosing it creeping on its tragic way
      without the swing and rhythm of the military pace It struggled onwards
      the men exchanging neither words nor looks whole ranks marched touching
      elbow day after day and never raising their eyes from the ground as if
      lost in despairing reflections In the dumb black forests of pines the
      cracking of overloaded branches was the only sound they heard Often from
      daybreak to dusk no one spoke in the whole column It was like a macabre
      march of struggling corpses towards a distant grave Only an alarm of
      Cossacks could restore to their eyes a semblance of martial resolution
      The battalion faced about and deployed or formed square under the endless
      fluttering of snowflakes A cloud of horsemen with fur caps on their
      heads levelled long lances and yelled ldquoHurrah Hurrahrdquo around their
      menacing immobility whence with muffled detonations hundreds of dark red
      flames darted through the air thick with falling snow In a very few
      moments the horsemen would disappear as if carried off yelling in the
      gale and the sacred battalion standing still alone in the blizzard
      heard only the howling of the wind whose blasts searched their very
      hearts Then with a cry or two of ldquoVive lrsquoEmpereurrdquo it would resume its
      march leaving behind a few lifeless bodies lying huddled up tiny black
      specks on the white immensity of the snows
    p
    p
      Though often marching in the ranks or skirmishing in the woods side by
      side the two officers ignored each other this not so much from inimical
      intention as from a very real indifference All their store of moral
      energy was expended in resisting the terrific enmity of nature and the
      crushing sense of irretrievable disaster To the last they counted among
      the most active the least demoralized of the battalion their vigorous
      vitality invested them both with the appearance of an heroic pair in the
      eyes of their comrades And they never exchanged more than a casual word
      or two except one day when skirmishing in front of the battalion against
      a worrying attack of cavalry they found themselves cut off in the woods
      by a small party of Cossacks A score of furcapped hairy horsemen rode
      to and fro brandishing their lances in ominous silence but the two
      officers had no mind to lay down their arms and Colonel Feraud suddenly
      spoke up in a hoarse growling voice bringing his firelock to the
      shoulder ldquoYou take the nearest brute Colonel DrsquoHubert Irsquoll settle the
      next one I am a better shot than you arerdquo
     p
    p
      Colonel DrsquoHubert nodded over his levelled musket Their shoulders were
      pressed against the trunk of a large tree on their front enormous
      snowdrifts protected them from a direct charge Two carefully aimed shots
      rang out in the frosty air two Cossacks reeled in their saddles The
      rest not thinking the game good enough closed round their wounded
      comrades and galloped away out of range The two officers managed to
      rejoin their battalion halted for the night During that afternoon they
      had leaned upon each other more than once and towards the end Colonel
      DrsquoHubert whose long legs gave him an advantage in walking through soft
      snow peremptorily took the musket of Colonel Feraud from him and carried
      it on his shoulder using his own as a staff
    p
    p
      On the outskirts of a village half buried in the snow an old wooden barn
      burned with a clear and an immense flame The sacred battalion of
      skeletons muffled in rags crowded greedily the windward side stretching
      hundreds of numbed bony hands to the blaze Nobody had noted their
      approach Before entering the circle of light playing on the sunken
      glassyeyed starved faces Colonel DrsquoHubert spoke in his turn
    p
    p
      ldquoHerersquos your musket Colonel Feraud I can walk better than yourdquo
     p
    p
      Colonel Feraud nodded and pushed on towards the warmth of the fierce
      flames Colonel DrsquoHubert was more deliberate but not the less bent on
      getting a place in the front rank Those they shouldered aside tried to
      greet with a faint cheer the reappearance of the two indomitable
      companions in activity and endurance Those manly qualities had never
      perhaps received a higher tribute than this feeble acclamation
    p
    p
      This is the faithful record of speeches exchanged during the retreat from
      Moscow by Colonels Feraud and DrsquoHubert Colonel Feraudrsquos taciturnity was
      the outcome of concentrated rage Short hairy black faced with layers
      of grime and the thick sprouting of a wiry beard a frostbitten hand
      wrapped up in filthy rags carried in a sling he accused fate of
      unparalleled perfidy towards the sublime Man of Destiny Colonel DrsquoHubert
      his long moustaches pendent in icicles on each side of his cracked blue
      lips his eyelids inflamed with the glare of snows the principal part of
      his costume consisting of a sheepskin coat looted with difficulty from the
      frozen corpse of a camp follower found in an abandoned cart took a more
      thoughtful view of events His regularly handsome features now reduced to
      mere bony lines and fleshless hollows looked out of a womanrsquos black
      velvet hood over which was rammed forcibly a cocked hat picked up under
      the wheels of an empty army fourgon which must have contained at one time
      some general officerrsquos luggage The sheepskin coat being short for a man
      of his inches ended very high up and the skin of his legs blue with the
      cold showed through the tatters of his nether garments This under the
      circumstances provoked neither jeers nor pity No one cared how the next
      man felt or looked Colonel DrsquoHubert himself hardened to exposure
      suffered mainly in his selfrespect from the lamentable indecency of his
      costume A thoughtless person may think that with a whole host of
      inanimate bodies bestrewing the path of retreat there could not have been
      much difficulty in supplying the deficiency But to loot a pair of
      breeches from a frozen corpse is not so easy as it may appear to a mere
      theorist It requires time and labour You must remain behind while your
      companions march on Colonel DrsquoHubert had his scruples as to falling out
      Once he had stepped aside he could not be sure of ever rejoining his
      battalion and the ghastly intimacy of a wrestling match with the frozen
      dead opposing the unyielding rigidity of iron to your violence was
      repugnant to the delicacy of his feelings Luckily one day grubbing in a
      mound of snow between the huts of a village in the hope of finding there a
      frozen potato or some vegetable garbage he could put between his long and
      shaky teeth Colonel DrsquoHubert uncovered a couple of mats of the sort
      Russian peasants use to line the sides of their carts with These beaten
      free of frozen snow bent about his elegant person and fastened solidly
      round his waist made a bellshaped nether garment a sort of stiff
      petticoat which rendered Colonel DrsquoHubert a perfectly decent but a much
      more noticeable figure than before
    p
    p
      Thus accoutred he continued to retreat never doubting of his personal
      escape but full of other misgivings The early buoyancy of his belief in
      the future was destroyed If the road of glory led through such unforeseen
      passages he asked himselfmdashfor he was reflectivemdashwhether the
      guide was altogether trustworthy It was a patriotic sadness not
      unmingled with some personal concern and quite unlike the unreasoning
      indignation against men and things nursed by Colonel Feraud Recruiting
      his strength in a little German town for three weeks Colonel DrsquoHubert was
      surprised to discover within himself a love of repose His returning
      vigour was strangely pacific in its aspirations He meditated silently
      upon this bizarre change of mood No doubt many of his brother officers of
      field rank went through the same moral experience But these were not the
      times to talk of it In one of his letters home Colonel DrsquoHubert wrote
      ldquoAll your plans my dear Leonie for marrying me to the charming girl you
      have discovered in your neighbourhood seem farther off than ever Peace
      is not yet Europe wants another lesson It will be a hard task for us
      but it shall be done because the Emperor is invinciblerdquo
     p
    p
      Thus wrote Colonel D lsquoHubert from Pomerania to his married sister Leonie
      settled in the south of France And so far the sentiments expressed would
      not have been disowned by Colonel Feraud who wrote no letters to anybody
      whose father had been in life an illiterate blacksmith who had no sister
      or brother and whom no one desired ardently to pair off for a life of
      peace with a charming young girl But Colonel D lsquoHubertrsquos letter contained
      also some philosophical generalities upon the uncertainty of all personal
      hopes when bound up entirely with the prestigious fortune of one
      incomparably great it is true yet still remaining but a man in his
      greatness This view would have appeared rank heresy to Colonel Feraud
      Some melancholy forebodings of a military kind expressed cautiously
      would have been pronounced as nothing short of high treason by Colonel
      Feraud But Leonie the sister of Colonel DrsquoHubert read them with
      profound satisfaction and folding the letter thoughtfully remarked to
      herself that ldquoArmand was likely to prove eventually a sensible fellowrdquo
       Since her marriage into a Southern family she had become a convinced
      believer in the return of the legitimate king Hopeful and anxious she
      offered prayers night and morning and burnt candles in churches for the
      safety and prosperity of her brother
    p
    p
      She had every reason to suppose that her prayers were heard Colonel
      DrsquoHubert passed through Lutzen Bautzen and Leipsic losing no limb and
      acquiring additional reputation Adapting his conduct to the needs of that
      desperate time he had never voiced his misgivings He concealed them
      under a cheerful courtesy of such pleasant character that people were
      inclined to ask themselves with wonder whether Colonel DrsquoHubert was aware
      of any disasters Not only his manners but even his glances remained
      untroubled The steady amenity of his blue eyes disconcerted all
      grumblers and made despair itself pause
    p
    p
      This bearing was remarked favourably by the Emperor himself for Colonel
      DrsquoHubert attached now to the MajorGeneralrsquos staff came on several
      occasions under the imperial eye But it exasperated the higher strung
      nature of Colonel Feraud Passing through Magdeburg on service this last
      allowed himself while seated gloomily at dinner with the Commandant de
      Place to say of his lifelong adversary ldquoThis man does not love the
      Emperorrdquo and his words were received by the other guests in profound
      silence Colonel Feraud troubled in his conscience at the atrocity of the
      aspersion felt the need to back it up by a good argument ldquoI ought to
      know himrdquo he cried adding some oaths ldquoOne studies onersquos adversary I
      have met him on the ground half a dozen times as all the army knows What
      more do you want If that isnrsquot opportunity enough for any fool to size up
      his man may the devil take me if I can tell what isrdquo And he looked
      around the table obstinate and sombre
    p
    p
      Later on in Paris while extremely busy reorganizing his regiment Colonel
      Feraud learned that Colonel DrsquoHubert had been made a general He glared at
      his informant incredulously then folded his arms and turned away
      muttering ldquoNothing surprises me on the part of that manrdquo
     p
    p
      And aloud he added speaking over his shoulder ldquoYou would oblige me
      greatly by telling General DrsquoHubert at the first opportunity that his
      advancement saves him for a time from a pretty hot encounter I was only
      waiting for him to turn up hererdquo
     p
    p
      The other officer remonstrated
    p
    p
      ldquoCould you think of it Colonel Feraud at this time when every life
      should be consecrated to the glory and safety of Francerdquo
     p
    p
      But the strain of unhappiness caused by military reverses had spoiled
      Colonel Feraudrsquos character Like many other men he was rendered wicked by
      misfortune
    p
    p
      ldquoI cannot consider General DrsquoHubertrsquos existence of any account either for
      the glory or safety of Francerdquo he snapped viciously ldquoYou donrsquot pretend
      perhaps to know him better than I domdashI who have met him half a
      dozen times on the groundmdashdo yourdquo
     p
    p
      His interlocutor a young man was silenced Colonel Feraud walked up and
      down the room
    p
    p
      ldquoThis is not the time to mince mattersrdquo he said ldquoI canrsquot believe that
      that man ever loved the Emperor He picked up his generalrsquos stars under
      the boots of Marshal Berthier Very well Irsquoll get mine in another
      fashion and then we shall settle this business which has been dragging on
      too longrdquo
     p
    p
      General DrsquoHubert informed indirectly of Colonel Feraudrsquos attitude made a
      gesture as if to put aside an importunate person His thoughts were
      solicited by graver cares He had had no time to go and see his family
      His sister whose royalist hopes were rising higher every day though
      proud of her brother regretted his recent advancement in a measure
      because it put on him a prominent mark of the usurperrsquos favour which
      later on could have an adverse influence upon his career He wrote to her
      that no one but an inveterate enemy could say he had got his promotion by
      favour As to his career he assured her that he looked no farther forward
      into the future than the next battlefield
    p
    p
      Beginning the campaign of France in this dogged spirit General DrsquoHubert
      was wounded on the second day of the battle under Laon While being
      carried off the field he heard that Colonel Feraud promoted this moment
      to general had been sent to replace him at the head of his brigade He
      cursed his luck impulsively not being able at the first glance to discern
      all the advantages of a nasty wound And yet it was by this heroic method
      that Providence was shaping his future Travelling slowly south to his
      sisterrsquos country home under the care of a trusty old servant General
      DrsquoHubert was spared the humiliating contacts and the perplexities of
      conduct which assailed the men of Napoleonic empire at the moment of its
      downfall Lying in his bed with the windows of his room open wide to the
      sunshine of Provence he perceived the undisguised aspect of the blessing
      conveyed by that jagged fragment of a Prussian shell which killing his
      horse and ripping open his thigh saved him from an active conflict with
      his conscience After the last fourteen years spent sword in hand in the
      saddle and with the sense of his duty done to the very end General
      DrsquoHubert found resignation an easy virtue His sister was delighted with
      his reasonableness ldquoI leave myself altogether in your hands my dear
      Leonierdquo he had said to her
    p
    p
      He was still laid up when the credit of his brotherinlawrsquos family being
      exerted on his behalf he received from the royal government not only the
      confirmation of his rank but the assurance of being retained on the
      active list To this was added an unlimited convalescent leave The
      unfavourable opinion entertained of him in Bonapartist circles though it
      rested on nothing more solid than the unsupported pronouncement of General
      Feraud was directly responsible for General DrsquoHubertrsquos retention on the
      active list As to General Feraud his rank was confirmed too It was
      more than he dared to expect but Marshal Soult then Minister of War to
      the restored king was partial to officers who had served in Spain Only
      not even the marshalrsquos protection could secure for him active employment
      He remained irreconcilable idle and sinister He sought in obscure
      restaurants the company of other halfpay officers who cherished dingy but
      glorious old tricolour cockades in their breastpockets and buttoned with
      the forbidden eagle buttons their shabby uniforms declaring themselves
      too poor to afford the expense of the prescribed change
    p
    p
      The triumphant return from Elba an historical fact as marvellous and
      incredible as the exploits of some mythological demigod found General
      DrsquoHubert still quite unable to sit a horse Neither could he walk very
      well These disabilities which Madame Leonie accounted most lucky helped
      to keep her brother out of all possible mischief His frame of mind at
      that time she noted with dismay became very far from reasonable This
      general officer still menaced by the loss of a limb was discovered one
      night in the stables of the chateau by a groom who seeing a light
      raised an alarm of thieves His crutch was lying halfburied in the straw
      of the litter and the general was hopping on one leg in a loose box
      around a snorting horse he was trying to saddle Such were the effects of
      imperial magic upon a calm temperament and a pondered mind Beset in the
      light of stable lanterns by the tears entreaties indignation
      remonstrances and reproaches of his family he got out of the difficult
      situation by fainting away there and then in the arms of his nearest
      relatives and was carried off to bed Before he got out of it again the
      second reign of Napoleon the Hundred Days of feverish agitation and
      supreme effort passed away like a terrifying dream The tragic year 
      begun in the trouble and unrest of consciences was ending in vengeful
      proscriptions
    p
    p
      How General Feraud escaped the clutches of the Special Commission and the
      last offices of a firing squad he never knew himself It was partly due to
      the subordinate position he was assigned during the Hundred Days The
      Emperor had never given him active command but had kept him busy at the
      cavalry depot in Paris mounting and despatching hastily drilled troopers
      into the field Considering this task as unworthy of his abilities he had
      discharged it with no offensively noticeable zeal but for the greater
      part he was saved from the excesses of Royalist reaction by the
      interference of General DrsquoHubert
    p
    p
      This last still on convalescent leave but able now to travel had been
      despatched by his sister to Paris to present himself to his legitimate
      sovereign As no one in the capital could possibly know anything of the
      episode in the stable he was received there with distinction Military to
      the very bottom of his soul the prospect of rising in his profession
      consoled him from finding himself the butt of Bonapartist malevolence
      which pursued him with a persistence he could not account for All the
      rancour of that embittered and persecuted party pointed to him as the man
      who had never loved the Emperormdasha sort of monster essentially worse
      than a mere betrayer
    p
    p
      General DrsquoHubert shrugged his shoulders without anger at this ferocious
      prejudice Rejected by his old friends and mistrusting profoundly the
      advances of Royalist society the young and handsome general he was
      barely forty adopted a manner of cold punctilious courtesy which at the
      merest shadow of an intended slight passed easily into harsh haughtiness
      Thus prepared General DrsquoHubert went about his affairs in Paris feeling
      inwardly very happy with the peculiar uplifting happiness of a man very
      much in love The charming girl looked out by his sister had come upon the
      scene and had conquered him in the thorough manner in which a young girl
      by merely existing in his sight can make a man of forty her own They were
      going to be married as soon as General DrsquoHubert had obtained his official
      nomination to a promised command
    p
    p
      One afternoon sitting on the terrasse of the Cafe Tortoni General
      DrsquoHubert learned from the conversation of two strangers occupying a table
      near his own that General Feraud included in the batch of superior
      officers arrested after the second return of the king was in danger of
      passing before the Special Commission Living all his spare moments as is
      frequently the case with expectant lovers a day in advance of reality
      and in a state of bestarred hallucination it required nothing less than
      the name of his perpetual antagonist pronounced in a loud voice to call
      the youngest of Napoleonrsquos generals away from the mental contemplation of
      his betrothed He looked round The strangers wore civilian clothes Lean
      and weatherbeaten lolling back in their chairs they scowled at people
      with moody and defiant abstraction from under their hats pulled low over
      their eyes It was not difficult to recognize them for two of the
      compulsorily retired officers of the Old Guard As from bravado or
      carelessness they chose to speak in loud tones General DrsquoHubert who saw
      no reason why he should change his seat heard every word They did not
      seem to be the personal friends of General Feraud His name came up
      amongst others Hearing it repeated General DrsquoHubertrsquos tender
      anticipations of a domestic future adorned with a womanrsquos grace were
      traversed by the harsh regret of his warlike past of that one long
      intoxicating clash of arms unique in the magnitude of its glory and
      disastermdashthe marvellous work and the special possession of his own
      generation He felt an irrational tenderness towards his old adversary and
      appreciated emotionally the murderous absurdity their encounter had
      introduced into his life It was like an additional pinch of spice in a
      hot dish He remembered the flavour with sudden melancholy He would never
      taste it again It was all over ldquoI fancy it was being left lying in the
      garden that had exasperated him so against me from the firstrdquo he thought
      indulgently
    p
    p
      The two strangers at the next table had fallen silent after the third
      mention of General Feraudrsquos name Presently the elder of the two speaking
      again in a bitter tone affirmed that General Feraudrsquos account was
      settled And why Simply because he was not like some bigwigs who loved
      only themselves The Royalists knew they could never make anything of him
      He loved The Other too well
    p
    p
      The Other was the Man of St Helena The two officers nodded and touched
      glasses before they drank to an impossible return Then the same who had
      spoken before remarked with a sardonic laugh ldquoHis adversary showed more
      clevernessrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoWhat adversaryrdquo asked the younger as if puzzled
    p
    p
      ldquoDonrsquot you know They were two hussars At each promotion they fought a
      duel Havenrsquot you heard of the duel going on ever since rdquo
     p
    p
      The other had heard of the duel of course Now he understood the
      allusion General Baron DrsquoHubert would be able now to enjoy his fat kingrsquos
      favour in peace
    p
    p
      ldquoMuch good may it do to himrdquo mumbled the elder ldquoThey were both brave
      men I never saw this DrsquoHubertmdasha sort of intriguing dandy I am
      told But I can well believe what Irsquove heard Feraud say of himmdashthat
      he never loved the Emperorrdquo
     p
    p
      They rose and went away
    p
    p
      General DrsquoHubert experienced the horror of a somnambulist who wakes up
      from a complacent dream of activity to find himself walking on a quagmire
      A profound disgust of the ground on which he was making his way overcame
      him Even the image of the charming girl was swept from his view in the
      flood of moral distress Everything he had ever been or hoped to be would
      taste of bitter ignominy unless he could manage to save General Feraud
      from the fate which threatened so many braves Under the impulse of this
      almost morbid need to attend to the safety of his adversary General
      DrsquoHubert worked so well with hands and feet as the French saying is
      that in less than twentyfour hours he found means of obtaining an
      extraordinary private audience from the Minister of Police
    p
    p
      General Baron DrsquoHubert was shown in suddenly without preliminaries In the
      dusk of the Ministerrsquos cabinet behind the forms of writingdesk chairs
      and tables between two bunches of wax candles blazing in sconces he
      beheld a figure in a gorgeous coat posturing before a tall mirror The old
      conventionnel Fouche Senator of the Empire traitor to every man to
      every principle and motive of human conduct Duke of Otranto and the wily
      artizan of the second Restoration was trying the fit of a court suit in
      which his young and accomplished fiancee had declared her intention to
      have his portrait painted on porcelain It was a caprice a charming fancy
      which the first Minister of Police of the second Restoration was anxious
      to gratify For that man often compared in wiliness of conduct to a fox
      but whose ethical side could be worthily symbolized by nothing less
      emphatic than a skunk was as much possessed by his love as General
      DrsquoHubert himself
    p
    p
      Startled to be discovered thus by the blunder of a servant he met this
      little vexation with the characteristic impudence which had served his
      turn so well in the endless intrigues of his selfseeking career Without
      altering his attitude a hairrsquosbreadth one leg in a silk stocking
      advanced his head twisted over his left shoulder he called out calmly
      ldquoThis way General Pray approach Well I am all attentionrdquo
     p
    p
      While General DrsquoHubert ill at ease as if one of his own little weaknesses
      had been exposed presented his request as shortly as possible the Duke
      of Otranto went on feeling the fit of his collar settling the lapels
      before the glass and buckling his back in an effort to behold the set of
      the gold embroidered coatskirts behind His still face his attentive
      eyes could not have expressed a more complete interest in those matters
      if he had been alone
    p
    p
      ldquoExclude from the operations of the Special Court a certain Feraud
      Gabriel Florian General of brigade of the promotion of rdquo he
      repeated in a slightly wondering tone and then turned away from the
      glass ldquoWhy exclude him preciselyrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoI am surprised that your Excellency so competent in the evaluation of
      men of his time should have thought worth while to have that name put
      down on the listrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoA rabid Bonapartistrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoSo is every grenadier and every trooper of the army as your Excellency
      well knows And the individuality of General Feraud can have no more
      weight than that of any casual grenadier He is a man of no mental grasp
      of no capacity whatever It is inconceivable that he should ever have any
      influencerdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoHe has a wellhung tongue thoughrdquo interjected Fouche
    p
    p
      ldquoNoisy I admit but not dangerousrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoI will not dispute with you I know next to nothing of him Hardly his
      name in factrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoAnd yet your Excellency has the presidency of the Commission charged by
      the king to point out those who were to be triedrdquo said General DrsquoHubert
      with an emphasis which did not miss the ministerrsquos ear
    p
    p
      ldquoYes Generalrdquo he said walking away into the dark part of the vast room
      and throwing himself into a deep armchair that swallowed him up all but
      the soft gleam of gold embroideries and the pallid patch of the facemdashldquoyes
      General Take this chair thererdquo
     p
    p
      General DrsquoHubert sat down
    p
    p
      ldquoYes Generalrdquo continued the archmaster in the arts of intrigue and
      betrayals whose duplicity as if at times intolerable to his
      selfknowledge found relief in bursts of cynical openness ldquoI did hurry
      on the formation of the proscribing Commission and I took its presidency
      And do you know why Simply from fear that if I did not take it quickly
      into my hands my own name would head the list of the proscribed Such are
      the times in which we live But I am minister of the king yet and I ask
      you plainly why I should take the name of this obscure Feraud off the
      list You wonder how his name got there Is it possible that you should
      know men so little My dear General at the very first sitting of the
      Commission names poured on us like rain off the roof of the Tuileries
      Names We had our choice of thousands How do you know that the name of
      this Feraud whose life or death donrsquot matter to France does not keep out
      some other namerdquo
     p
    p
      The voice out of the armchair stopped Opposite General DrsquoHubert sat
      still shadowy and silent Only his sabre clinked slightly The voice in
      the armchair began again ldquoAnd we must try to satisfy the exigencies of
      the Allied Sovereigns too The Prince de Talleyrand told me only
      yesterday that Nesselrode had informed him officially of His Majesty the
      Emperor Alexanderrsquos dissatisfaction at the small number of examples the
      Government of the king intends to makemdashespecially amongst military
      men I tell you this confidentiallyrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoUpon my wordrdquo broke out General DrsquoHubert speaking through his teeth
      ldquoif your Excellency deigns to favour me with any more confidential
      information I donrsquot know what I will do Itrsquos enough to break onersquos sword
      over onersquos knee and fling the pieces   rdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoWhat government you imagined yourself to be servingrdquo interrupted the
      minister sharply
    p
    p
      After a short pause the crestfallen voice of General DrsquoHubert answered
      ldquoThe Government of Francerdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoThatrsquos paying your conscience off with mere words General The truth is
      that you are serving a government of returned exiles of men who have been
      without country for twenty years Of men also who have just got over a
      very bad and humiliating fright    Have no illusions on that scorerdquo
     p
    p
      The Duke of Otranto ceased He had relieved himself and had attained his
      object of stripping some selfrespect off that man who had inconveniently
      discovered him posturing in a goldembroidered court costume before a
      mirror But they were a hotheaded lot in the army it occurred to him
      that it would be inconvenient if a welldisposed general officer received
      in audience on the recommendation of one of the Princes were to do
      something rashly scandalous directly after a private interview with the
      minister In a changed tone he put a question to the point ldquoYour relationmdashthis
      Feraudrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoNo No relation at allrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoIntimate friendrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoIntimate    yes There is between us an intimate connection of a
      nature which makes it a point of honour with me to try   rdquo
     p
    p
      The minister rang a bell without waiting for the end of the phrase When
      the servant had gone out after bringing in a pair of heavy silver
      candelabra for the writingdesk the Duke of Otranto rose his breast
      glistening all over with gold in the strong light and taking a piece of
      paper out of a drawer held it in his hand ostentatiously while he said
      with persuasive gentleness ldquoYou must not speak of breaking your sword
      across your knee General Perhaps you would never get another The
      Emperor will not return this time    Diable drsquohomme There was just a
      moment here in Paris soon after Waterloo when he frightened me It
      looked as though he were ready to begin all over again Luckily one never
      does begin all over again really You must not think of breaking your
      sword Generalrdquo
     p
    p
      General DrsquoHubert looking on the ground moved slightly his hand in a
      hopeless gesture of renunciation The Minister of Police turned his eyes
      away from him and scanned deliberately the paper he had been holding up
      all the time
    p
    p
      ldquoThere are only twenty general officers selected to be made an example of
      Twenty A round number And letrsquos see Feraud    Ah hersquos there
      Gabriel Florian Parfaitement Thatrsquos your man Well there will be only
      nineteen examples made nowrdquo
     p
    p
      General DrsquoHubert stood up feeling as though he had gone through an
      infectious illness ldquoI must beg your Excellency to keep my interference a
      profound secret I attach the greatest importance to his never learning 
       rdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoWho is going to inform him I should like to knowrdquo said Fouche raising
      his eyes curiously to General DrsquoHubertrsquos tense set face ldquoTake one of
      these pens and run it through the name yourself This is the only list in
      existence If you are careful to take up enough ink no one will be able to
      tell what was the name struck out But par exemple I am not responsible
      for what Clarke will do with him afterwards If he persists in being rabid
      he will be ordered by the Minister of War to reside in some provincial
      town under the supervision of the policerdquo
     p
    p
      A few days later General DrsquoHubert was saying to his sister after the
      first greetings had been got over ldquoAh my dear Leonie it seemed to me I
      couldnrsquot get away from Paris quick enoughrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoEffect of loverdquo she suggested with a malicious smile
    p
    p
      ldquoAnd horrorrdquo added General DrsquoHubert with profound seriousness ldquoI have
      nearly died there of    of nauseardquo
     p
    p
      His face was contracted with disgust And as his sister looked at him
      attentively he continued ldquoI have had to see Fouche I have had an
      audience I have been in his cabinet There remains with one who had the
      misfortune to breathe the air of the same room with that man a sense of
      diminished dignity an uneasy feeling of being not so clean after all as
      one hoped one was    But you canrsquot understandrdquo
     p
    p
      She nodded quickly several times She understood very well on the
      contrary She knew her brother thoroughly and liked him as he was
      Moreover the scorn and loathing of mankind were the lot of the Jacobin
      Fouche who exploiting for his own advantage every weakness every
      virtue every generous illusion of mankind made dupes of his whole
      generation and died obscurely as Duke of Otranto
    p
    p
      ldquoMy dear Armandrdquo she said compassionately ldquowhat could you want from
      that manrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoNothing less than a liferdquo answered General DrsquoHubert ldquoAnd Irsquove got it
      It had to be done But I feel yet as if I could never forgive the
      necessity to the man I had to saverdquo
     p
    p
      General Feraud totally unable as is the case with most of us to
      comprehend what was happening to him received the Minister of Warrsquos order
      to proceed at once to a small town of Central France with feelings whose
      natural expression consisted in a fierce rolling of the eye and savage
      grinding of the teeth The passing away of the state of war the only
      condition of society he had ever known the horrible view of a world at
      peace frightened him He went away to his little town firmly convinced
      that this could not last There he was informed of his retirement from the
      army and that his pension calculated on the scale of a colonelrsquos rank
      was made dependent on the correctness of his conduct and on the good
      reports of the police No longer in the army He felt suddenly strange to
      the earth like a disembodied spirit It was impossible to exist But at
      first he reacted from sheer incredulity This could not be He waited for
      thunder earthquakes natural cataclysms but nothing happened The leaden
      weight of an irremediable idleness descended upon General Feraud who
      having no resources within himself sank into a state of aweinspiring
      hebetude He haunted the streets of the little town gazing before him
      with lacklustre eyes disregarding the hats raised on his passage and
      people nudging each other as he went by whispered ldquoThatrsquos poor General
      Feraud His heart is broken Behold how he loved the Emperorrdquo
     p
    p
      The other living wreckage of Napoleonic tempest clustered round General
      Feraud with infinite respect He himself imagined his soul to be crushed
      by grief He suffered from quickly succeeding impulses to weep to howl
      to bite his fists till blood came to spend days on his bed with his head
      thrust under the pillow but these arose from sheer ennui from the
      anguish of an immense indescribable inconceivable boredom His mental
      inability to grasp the hopeless nature of his case as a whole saved him
      from suicide He never even thought of it once He thought of nothing But
      his appetite abandoned him and the difficulty he experienced to express
      the overwhelming nature of his feelings the most furious swearing could
      do no justice to it induced gradually a habit of silencemdasha sort of
      death to a southern temperament
    p
    p
      Great therefore was the sensation amongst the anciens militaires
      frequenting a certain little cafe full of flies when one stuffy afternoon
      ldquothat poor General Feraudrdquo let out suddenly a volley of formidable curses
    p
    p
      He had been sitting quietly in his own privileged corner looking through
      the Paris gazettes with just as much interest as a condemned man on the
      eve of execution could be expected to show in the news of the day ldquoIrsquoll
      find out presently that I am alive yetrdquo he declared in a dogmatic tone
      ldquoHowever this is a private affair An old affair of honour Bah Our
      honour does not matter Here we are driven off with a split ear like a lot
      of cast troop horsesmdashgood only for a knackerrsquos yard But it would be
      like striking a blow for the Emperor    Messieurs I shall require the
      assistance of two of yourdquo
     p
    p
      Every man moved forward General Feraud deeply touched by this
      demonstration called with visible emotion upon the oneeyed veteran
      cuirassier and the officer of the Chasseurs a Cheval who had left the tip
      of his nose in Russia He excused his choice to the others
    p
    p
      ldquoA cavalry affair thismdashyou knowrdquo
     p
    p
      He was answered with a varied chorus of ldquoParfaitement mon General    
      Crsquoest juste    Parbleu crsquoest connu   rdquo Everybody was satisfied
      The three left the cafe together followed by cries of ldquoBonne chancerdquo
     p
    p
      Outside they linked arms the general in the middle The three rusty
      cocked hats worn en bataille with a sinister forward slant barred the
      narrow street nearly right across The overheated little town of grey
      stones and red tiles was drowsing away its provincial afternoon under a
      blue sky The loud blows of a cooper hooping a cask reverberated regularly
      between the houses The general dragged his left foot a little in the
      shade of the walls
    p
    p
      ldquoThis damned winter of  has got into my bones for good Never mind We
      must take pistols thatrsquos all A little lumbago We must have pistols
      Hersquos game for my bag My eyes are as keen as ever You should have seen me
      in Russia picking off the dodging Cossacks with a beastly old infantry
      musket I have a natural gift for firearmsrdquo
     p
    p
      In this strain General Feraud ran on holding up his head with owlish
      eyes and rapacious beak A mere fighter all his life a cavalry man a
      sabreur he conceived war with the utmost simplicity as in the main a
      massed lot of personal contests a sort of gregarious duelling And here
      he had in hand a war of his own He revived The shadow of peace passed
      away from him like the shadow of death It was the marvellous resurrection
      of the named Feraud Gabriel Florian engage volontaire of  General
      of  buried without ceremony by means of a service order signed by the
      War Minister of the Second Restoration

    p
    p
      No man succeeds in everything he undertakes In that sense we are all
      failures The great point is not to fail in ordering and sustaining the
      effort of our life In this matter vanity is what leads us astray It
      hurries us into situations from which we must come out damaged whereas
      pride is our safeguard by the reserve it imposes on the choice of our
      endeavour as much as by the virtue of its sustaining power
    p
    p
      General DrsquoHubert was proud and reserved He had not been damaged by his
      casual love affairs successful or otherwise In his warscarred body his
      heart at forty remained unscratched Entering with reserve into his
      sisterrsquos matrimonial plans he had felt himself falling irremediably in
      love as one falls off a roof He was too proud to be frightened Indeed
      the sensation was too delightful to be alarming
    p
    p
      The inexperience of a man of forty is a much more serious thing than the
      inexperience of a youth of twenty for it is not helped out by the
      rashness of hot blood The girl was mysterious as young girls are by the
      mere effect of their guarded ingenuity and to him the mysteriousness of
      that young girl appeared exceptional and fascinating But there was
      nothing mysterious about the arrangements of the match which Madame Leonie
      had promoted There was nothing peculiar either It was a very
      appropriate match commending itself extremely to the young ladyrsquos mother
      the father was dead and tolerable to the young ladyrsquos unclemdashan old
      emigre lately returned from Germany and pervading cane in hand a lean
      ghost of the ancien regime the garden walks of the young ladyrsquos ancestral
      home
    p
    p
      General DrsquoHubert was not the man to be satisfied merely with the woman and
      the fortunemdashwhen it came to the point His pride and pride aims
      always at true success would be satisfied with nothing short of love But
      as true pride excludes vanity he could not imagine any reason why this
      mysterious creature with deep and brilliant eyes of a violet colour should
      have any feeling for him warmer than indifference The young lady her
      name was Adele baffled every attempt at a clear understanding on that
      point It is true that the attempts were clumsy and made timidly because
      by then General DrsquoHubert had become acutely aware of the number of his
      years of his wounds of his many moral imperfections of his secret
      unworthinessmdashand had incidentally learned by experience the meaning
      of the word funk As far as he could make out she seemed to imply that
      with an unbounded confidence in her motherrsquos affection and sagacity she
      felt no unsurmountable dislike for the person of General DrsquoHubert and
      that this was quite sufficient for a wellbroughtup young lady to begin
      married life upon This view hurt and tormented the pride of General
      DrsquoHubert And yet he asked himself with a sort of sweet despair what
      more could he expect She had a quiet and luminous forehead Her violet
      eyes laughed while the lines of her lips and chin remained composed in
      admirable gravity All this was set off by such a glorious mass of fair
      hair by a complexion so marvellous by such a grace of expression that
      General DrsquoHubert really never found the opportunity to examine with
      sufficient detachment the lofty exigencies of his pride In fact he
      became shy of that line of inquiry since it had led once or twice to a
      crisis of solitary passion in which it was borne upon him that he loved
      her enough to kill her rather than lose her From such passages not
      unknown to men of forty he would come out broken exhausted remorseful
      a little dismayed He derived however considerable comfort from the
      quietist practice of sitting now and then half the night by an open window
      and meditating upon the wonder of her existence like a believer lost in
      the mystic contemplation of his faith
    p
    p
      It must not be supposed that all these variations of his inward state were
      made manifest to the world General D lsquoHubert found no difficulty in
      appearing wreathed in smiles Because in fact he was very happy He
      followed the established rules of his condition sending over flowers
      from his sisterrsquos garden and hothouses early every morning and a
      little later following himself to lunch with his intended her mother and
      her emigre uncle The middle of the day was spent in strolling or sitting
      in the shade A watchful deference trembling on the verge of tenderness
      was the note of their intercourse on his sidemdashwith a playful turn of
      the phrase concealing the profound trouble of his whole being caused by
      her inaccessible nearness Late in the afternoon General D lsquoHubert walked
      home between the fields of vines sometimes intensely miserable sometimes
      supremely happy sometimes pensively sad but always feeling a special
      intensity of existence that elation common to artists poets and loversmdashto
      men haunted by a great passion a noble thought or a new vision of
      plastic beauty
    p
    p
      The outward world at that time did not exist with any special distinctness
      for General DrsquoHubert One evening however crossing a ridge from which he
      could see both houses General DrsquoHubert became aware of two figures far
      down the road The day had been divine The festal decoration of the
      inflamed sky lent a gentle glow to the sober tints of the southern land
      The grey rocks the brown fields the purple undulating distances
      harmonized in luminous accord exhaled already the scents of the evening
      The two figures down the road presented themselves like two rigid and
      wooden silhouettes all black on the ribbon of white dust General DrsquoHubert
      made out the long straight military capotes buttoned closely right up to
      the black stocks the cocked hats the lean carven brown countenancesmdashold
      soldiersmdashvieilles moustaches The taller of the two had a black
      patch over one eye the otherrsquos hard dry countenance presented some
      bizarre disquieting peculiarity which on nearer approach proved to be
      the absence of the tip of the nose Lifting their hands with one movement
      to salute the slightly lame civilian walking with a thick stick they
      inquired for the house where the General Baron DrsquoHubert lived and what
      was the best way to get speech with him quietly
    p
    p
      ldquoIf you think this quiet enoughrdquo said General DrsquoHubert looking round at
      the vinefields framed in purple lines and dominated by the nest of grey
      and drab walls of a village clustering around the top of a conical hill
      so that the blunt church tower seemed but the shape of a crowning rockmdashldquoif
      you think this spot quiet enough you can speak to him at once And I beg
      you comrades to speak openly with perfect confidencerdquo
     p
    p
      They stepped back at this and raised again their hands to their hats with
      marked ceremoniousness Then the one with the chipped nose speaking for
      both remarked that the matter was confidential enough and to be arranged
      discreetly Their general quarters were established in that village over
      there where the infernal clodhoppersmdashdamn their false Royalist
      heartsmdashlooked remarkably crosseyed at three unassuming military
      men For the present he should only ask for the name of General DrsquoHubertrsquos
      friends
    p
    p
      ldquoWhat friendsrdquo said the astonished General DrsquoHubert completely off the
      track ldquoI am staying with my brotherinlaw over thererdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoWell he will do for onerdquo said the chipped veteran
    p
    p
      ldquoWersquore the friends of General Feraudrdquo interjected the other who had kept
      silent till then only glowering with his one eye at the man who had never
      loved the Emperor That was something to look at For even the goldlaced
      Judases who had sold him to the English the marshals and princes had
      loved him at some time or other But this man had never loved the Emperor
      General Feraud had said so distinctly
    p
    p
      General DrsquoHubert felt an inward blow in his chest For an infinitesimal
      fraction of a second it was as if the spinning of the earth had become
      perceptible with an awful slight rustle in the eternal stillness of
      space But this noise of blood in his ears passed off at once
      Involuntarily he murmured ldquoFeraud I had forgotten his existencerdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoHersquos existing at present very uncomfortably it is true in the infamous
      inn of that nest of savages up thererdquo said the oneeyed cuirassier
      drily ldquoWe arrived in your parts an hour ago on post horses Hersquos awaiting
      our return with impatience There is hurry you know The General has
      broken the ministerial order to obtain from you the satisfaction hersquos
      entitled to by the laws of honour and naturally hersquos anxious to have it
      all over before the gendarmerie gets on his scentrdquo
     p
    p
      The other elucidated the idea a little further ldquoGet back on the quietmdashyou
      understand Phitt No one the wiser We have broken out too Your friend
      the king would be glad to cut off our scurvy pittances at the first
      chance Itrsquos a risk But honour before everythingrdquo
     p
    p
      General DrsquoHubert had recovered his powers of speech ldquoSo you come here
      like this along the road to invite me to a throatcutting match with thatmdashthat
        rdquo A laughing sort of rage took possession of him ldquoHa ha ha hardquo
     p
    p
      His fists on his hips he roared without restraint while they stood
      before him lank and straight as though they had been shot up with a snap
      through a trap door in the ground Only fourandtwenty months ago the
      masters of Europe they had already the air of antique ghosts they seemed
      less substantial in their faded coats than their own narrow shadows
      falling so black across the white road the military and grotesque shadows
      of twenty years of war and conquests They had an outlandish appearance of
      two imperturbable bonzes of the religion of the sword And General
      DrsquoHubert also one of the exmasters of Europe laughed at these serious
      phantoms standing in his way
    p
    p
      Said one indicating the laughing General with a jerk of the head ldquoA
      merry companion thatrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoThere are some of us that havenrsquot smiled from the day The Other went
      awayrdquo remarked his comrade
    p
    p
      A violent impulse to set upon and beat those unsubstantial wraiths to the
      ground frightened General DrsquoHubert He ceased laughing suddenly His
      desire now was to get rid of them to get them away from his sight quickly
      before he lost control of himself He wondered at the fury he felt rising
      in his breast But he had no time to look into that peculiarity just then
    p
    p
      ldquoI understand your wish to be done with me as quickly as possible Donrsquot
      let us waste time in empty ceremonies Do you see that wood there at the
      foot of that slope Yes the wood of pines Let us meet there tomorrow at
      sunrise I will bring with me my sword or my pistols or both if you
      likerdquo
     p
    p
      The seconds of General Feraud looked at each other
    p
    p
      ldquoPistols Generalrdquo said the cuirassier
    p
    p
      ldquoSo be it Au revoirmdashtomorrow morning Till then let me advise you
      to keep close if you donrsquot want the gendarmerie making inquiries about you
      before it gets dark Strangers are rare in this part of the countryrdquo
     p
    p
      They saluted in silence General DrsquoHubert turning his back on their
      retreating forms stood still in the middle of the road for a long time
      biting his lower lip and looking on the ground Then he began to walk
      straight before him thus retracing his steps till he found himself before
      the park gate of his intendedrsquos house Dusk had fallen Motionless he
      stared through the bars at the front of the house gleaming clear beyond
      the thickets and trees Footsteps scrunched on the gravel and presently a
      tall stooping shape emerged from the lateral alley following the inner
      side of the park wall
    p
    p
      Le Chevalier de Valmassigue uncle of the adorable Adele exbrigadier in
      the army of the Princes bookbinder in Altona afterwards shoemaker with
      a great reputation for elegance in the fit of ladiesrsquo shoes in another
      small German town wore silk stockings on his lean shanks low shoes with
      silver buckles a brocaded waistcoat A longskirted coat a la francaise
      covered loosely his thin bowed back A small threecornered hat rested on
      a lot of powdered hair tied in a queue
    p
    p
      ldquoMonsieur le Chevalierrdquo called General DrsquoHubert softly
    p
    p
      ldquoWhat You here again mon ami Have you forgotten somethingrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoBy heavens thatrsquos just it I have forgotten something I am come to tell
      you of it Nomdashoutside Behind this wall Itrsquos too ghastly a thing to
      be let in at all where she livesrdquo
     p
    p
      The Chevalier came out at once with that benevolent resignation some old
      people display towards the fugue of youth Older by a quarter of a century
      than General DrsquoHubert he looked upon him in the secret of his heart as a
      rather troublesome youngster in love He had heard his enigmatical words
      very well but attached no undue importance to what a mere man of forty so
      hard hit was likely to do or say The turn of mind of the generation of
      Frenchmen grown up during the years of his exile was almost unintelligible
      to him Their sentiments appeared to him unduly violent lacking fineness
      and measure their language needlessly exaggerated He joined calmly the
      General on the road and they made a few steps in silence the General
      trying to master his agitation and get proper control of his voice
    p
    p
      ldquoIt is perfectly true I forgot something I forgot till half an hour ago
      that I had an urgent affair of honour on my hands Itrsquos incredible but it
      is sordquo
     p
    p
      All was still for a moment Then in the profound evening silence of the
      countryside the clear aged voice of the Chevalier was heard trembling
      slightly ldquoMonsieur Thatrsquos an indignityrdquo
     p
    p
      It was his first thought The girl born during his exile the posthumous
      daughter of his poor brother murdered by a band of Jacobins had grown
      since his return very dear to his old heart which had been starving on
      mere memories of affection for so many years ldquoIt is an inconceivable
      thing I say A man settles such affairs before he thinks of asking for a
      young girlrsquos hand Why If you had forgotten for ten days longer you
      would have been married before your memory returned to you In my time men
      did not forget such thingsmdashnor yet what is due to the feelings of an
      innocent young woman If I did not respect them myself I would qualify
      your conduct in a way which you would not likerdquo
     p
    p
      General DrsquoHubert relieved himself frankly by a groan ldquoDonrsquot let that
      consideration prevent you You run no risk of offending her mortallyrdquo
     p
    p
      But the old man paid no attention to this loverrsquos nonsense Itrsquos doubtful
      whether he even heard ldquoWhat is itrdquo he asked ldquoWhatrsquos the nature of   
      rdquo ldquoCall it a youthful folly Monsieur le Chevalier An inconceivable
      incredible result of   rdquo He stopped short ldquoHe will never believe the
      storyrdquo he thought ldquoHe will only think I am taking him for a fool and
      get offendedrdquo General DrsquoHubert spoke up again ldquoYes originating in
      youthful folly it has become   rdquo
     p
    p
      The Chevalier interrupted ldquoWell then it must be arrangedrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoArrangedrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoYes no matter at what cost to your amour propre You should have
      remembered you were engaged You forgot that too I suppose And then you
      go and forget your quarrel Itrsquos the most hopeless exhibition of levity I
      ever heard ofrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoGood heavens Monsieur You donrsquot imagine I have been picking up this
      quarrel last time I was in Paris or anything of the sort do yourdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoEh What matters the precise date of your insane conductrdquo exclaimed the
      Chevalier testily ldquoThe principal thing is to arrange itrdquo
     p
    p
      Noticing General DrsquoHubert getting restive and trying to place a word the
      old emigre raised his hand and added with dignity ldquoIrsquove been a soldier
      too I would never dare suggest a doubtful step to the man whose name my
      niece is to bear I tell you that entre galants hommes an affair can
      always be arrangedrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoBut saperiotte Monsieur le Chevalier itrsquos fifteen or sixteen years ago
      I was a lieutenant of hussars thenrdquo
     p
    p
      The old Chevalier seemed confounded by the vehemently despairing tone of
      this information ldquoYou were a lieutenant of hussars sixteen years agordquo he
      mumbled in a dazed manner
    p
    p
      ldquoWhy yes You did not suppose I was made a general in my cradle like a
      royal princerdquo
     p
    p
      In the deepening purple twilight of the fields spread with vine leaves
      backed by a low band of sombre crimson in the west the voice of the old
      exofficer in the army of the Princes sounded collected punctiliously
      civil
    p
    p
      ldquoDo I dream Is this a pleasantry Or am I to understand that you have
      been hatching an affair of honour for sixteen yearsrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoIt has clung to me for that length of time That is my precise meaning
      The quarrel itself is not to be explained easily We met on the ground
      several times during that time of courserdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoWhat manners What horrible perversion of manliness Nothing can account
      for such inhumanity but the sanguinary madness of the Revolution which has
      tainted a whole generationrdquo mused the returned emigre in a low tone
      ldquoWhorsquos your adversaryrdquo he asked a little louder
    p
    p
      ldquoMy adversary His name is Feraudrdquo
     p
    p
      Shadowy in his tricorne and oldfashioned clothes like a bowed thin
      ghost of the ancien regime the Chevalier voiced a ghostly memory ldquoI can
      remember the feud about little Sophie Derval between Monsieur de Brissac
      Captain in the Bodyguards and drsquoAnjorrant not the pockmarked one the
      othermdashthe Beau drsquoAnjorrant as they called him They met three
      times in eighteen months in a most gallant manner It was the fault of
      that little Sophie too who would keep on playing   rdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoThis is nothing of the kindrdquo interrupted General DrsquoHubert He laughed a
      little sardonically ldquoNot at all so simplerdquo he added ldquoNor yet half so
      reasonablerdquo he finished inaudibly between his teeth and ground them
      with rage
    p
    p
      After this sound nothing troubled the silence for a long time till the
      Chevalier asked without animation ldquoWhat is hemdashthis Feraudrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoLieutenant of hussars toomdashI mean hersquos a general A Gascon Son of
      a blacksmith I believerdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoThere I thought so That Bonaparte had a special predilection for the
      canaille I donrsquot mean this for you DrsquoHubert You are one of us though
      you have served this usurper who   rdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoLetrsquos leave him out of thisrdquo broke in General DrsquoHubert
    p
    p
      The Chevalier shrugged his peaked shoulders ldquoFeraud of sorts Offspring
      of a blacksmith and some village troll See what comes of mixing yourself
      up with that sort of peoplerdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoYou have made shoes yourself Chevalierrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoYes But I am not the son of a shoemaker Neither are you Monsieur
      DrsquoHubert You and I have something that your Bonapartersquos princes dukes
      and marshals have not because therersquos no power on earth that could give
      it to themrdquo retorted the emigre with the rising animation of a man who
      has got hold of a hopeful argument ldquoThose people donrsquot existmdashall
      these Ferauds Feraud What is Feraud A vanupieds disguised into a
      general by a Corsican adventurer masquerading as an emperor There is no
      earthly reason for a DrsquoHubert to srsquoencanailler by a duel with a person of
      that sort You can make your excuses to him perfectly well And if the
      manant takes into his head to decline them you may simply refuse to meet
      himrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoYou say I may do thatrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoI do With the clearest consciencerdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoMonsieur le Chevalier To what do you think you have returned from your
      emigrationrdquo
     p
    p
      This was said in such a startling tone that the old man raised sharply his
      bowed head glimmering silvery white under the points of the little
      tricorne For a time he made no sound
    p
    p
      ldquoGod knowsrdquo he said at last pointing with a slow and grave gesture at a
      tall roadside cross mounted on a block of stone and stretching its arms
      of forged iron all black against the darkening red band in the skymdashldquoGod
      knows If it were not for this emblem which I remember seeing on this
      spot as a child I would wonder to what we who remained faithful to God
      and our king have returned The very voices of the people have changedrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoYes it is a changed Francerdquo said General DrsquoHubert He seemed to have
      regained his calm His tone was slightly ironic ldquoTherefore I cannot take
      your advice Besides how is one to refuse to be bitten by a dog that
      means to bite Itrsquos impracticable Take my word for itmdashFeraud isnrsquot
      a man to be stayed by apologies or refusals But there are other ways I
      could for instance send a messenger with a word to the brigadier of the
      gendarmerie in Senlac He and his two friends are liable to arrest on my
      simple order It would make some talk in the army both the organized and
      the disbandedmdashespecially the disbanded All canaille All once upon
      a time the companions in arms of Armand DrsquoHubert But what need a DrsquoHubert
      care what people that donrsquot exist may think Or better still I might get
      my brotherinlaw to send for the mayor of the village and give him a
      hint No more would be needed to get the three lsquobrigandsrsquo set upon with
      flails and pitchforks and hunted into some nice deep wet ditchmdashand
      nobody the wiser It has been done only ten miles from here to three poor
      devils of the disbanded Red Lancers of the Guard going to their homes
      What says your conscience Chevalier Can a DrsquoHubert do that thing to
      three men who do not existrdquo
     p
    p
      A few stars had come out on the blue obscurity clear as crystal of the
      sky The dry thin voice of the Chevalier spoke harshly ldquoWhy are you
      telling me all thisrdquo
     p
    p
      The General seized the withered old hand with a strong grip ldquoBecause I
      owe you my fullest confidence Who could tell Adele but you You
      understand why I dare not trust my brotherinlaw nor yet my own sister
      Chevalier I have been so near doing these things that I tremble yet You
      donrsquot know how terrible this duel appears to me And therersquos no escape
      from itrdquo
     p
    p
      He murmured after a pause ldquoItrsquos a fatalityrdquo dropped the Chevalierrsquos
      passive hand and said in his ordinary conversational voice ldquoI shall have
      to go without seconds If it is my lot to remain on the ground you at
      least will know all that can be made known of this affairrdquo
     p
    p
      The shadowy ghost of the ancien regime seemed to have become more bowed
      during the conversation ldquoHow am I to keep an indifferent face this
      evening before these two womenrdquo he groaned ldquoGeneral I find it very
      difficult to forgive yourdquo
     p
    p
      General D lsquoHubert made no answer
    p
    p
      ldquoIs your cause good at leastrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoI am innocentrdquo
     p
    p
      This time he seized the Chevalierrsquos ghostly arm above the elbow and gave
      it a mighty squeeze ldquoI must kill himrdquo he hissed and opening his hand
      strode away down the road
    p
    p
      The delicate attentions of his adoring sister had secured for the General
      perfect liberty of movement in the house where he was a guest He had even
      his own entrance through a small door in one corner of the orangery Thus
      he was not exposed that evening to the necessity of dissembling his
      agitation before the calm ignorance of the other inmates He was glad of
      it It seemed to him that if he had to open his lips he would break out
      into horrible and aimless imprecations start breaking furniture smashing
      china and glass From the moment he opened the private door and while
      ascending the twentyeight steps of a winding staircase giving access to
      the corridor on which his room opened he went through a horrible and
      humiliating scene in which an infuriated madman with bloodshot eyes and a
      foaming mouth played inconceivable havoc with everything inanimate that
      may be found in a wellappointed diningroom When he opened the door of
      his apartment the fit was over and his bodily fatigue was so great that
      he had to catch at the backs of the chairs while crossing the room to
      reach a low and broad divan on which he let himself fall heavily His
      moral prostration was still greater That brutality of feeling which he
      had known only when charging the enemy sabre in hand amazed this man of
      forty who did not recognize in it the instinctive fury of his menaced
      passion But in his mental and bodily exhaustion this passion got cleared
      distilled refined into a sentiment of melancholy despair at having
      perhaps to die before he had taught this beautiful girl to love him
    p
    p
      That night General DrsquoHubert stretched out on his back with his hands over
      his eyes or lying on his breast with his face buried in a cushion made
      the full pilgrimage of emotions Nauseating disgust at the absurdity of
      the situation doubt of his own fitness to conduct his existence and
      mistrust of his best sentiments for what the devil did he want to go to
      Fouche formdashhe knew them all in turn ldquoI am an idiot neither more
      nor lessrdquo he thoughtmdashldquoA sensitive idiot Because I overheard two
      men talking in a cafe    I am an idiot afraid of liesmdashwhereas in
      life it is only truth that mattersrdquo
     p
    p
      Several times he got up and walking in his socks in order not to be heard
      by anybody downstairs drank all the water he could find in the dark And
      he tasted the torments of jealousy too She would marry somebody else
      His very soul writhed The tenacity of that Feraud the awful persistence
      of that imbecile brute came to him with the tremendous force of a
      relentless destiny General DrsquoHubert trembled as he put down the empty
      water ewer ldquoHe will have merdquo he thought General DrsquoHubert was tasting
      every emotion that life has to give He had in his dry mouth the faint
      sickly flavour of fear not the excusable fear before a young girlrsquos
      candid and amused glance but the fear of death and the honourable manrsquos
      fear of cowardice
    p
    p
      But if true courage consists in going out to meet an odious danger from
      which our body soul and heart recoil together General DrsquoHubert had the
      opportunity to practise it for the first time in his life He had charged
      exultingly at batteries and at infantry squares and ridden with messages
      through a hail of bullets without thinking anything about it His business
      now was to sneak out unheard at break of day to an obscure and revolting
      death General DrsquoHubert never hesitated He carried two pistols in a
      leather bag which he slung over his shoulder Before he had crossed the
      garden his mouth was dry again He picked two oranges It was only after
      shutting the gate after him that he felt a slight faintness
    p
    p
      He staggered on disregarding it and after going a few yards regained the
      command of his legs In the colourless and pellucid dawn the wood of pines
      detached its columns of trunks and its dark green canopy very clearly
      against the rocks of the grey hillside He kept his eyes fixed on it
      steadily and sucked at an orange as he walked That temperamental
      goodhumoured coolness in the face of danger which had made him an officer
      liked by his men and appreciated by his superiors was gradually asserting
      itself It was like going into battle Arriving at the edge of the wood he
      sat down on a boulder holding the other orange in his hand and
      reproached himself for coming so ridiculously early on the ground Before
      very long however he heard the swishing of bushes footsteps on the hard
      ground and the sounds of a disjointed loud conversation A voice
      somewhere behind him said boastfully ldquoHersquos game for my bagrdquo
     p
    p
      He thought to himself ldquoHere they are Whatrsquos this about game Are they
      talking of merdquo And becoming aware of the other orange in his hand he
      thought further ldquoThese are very good oranges Leoniersquos own tree I may
      just as well eat this orange now instead of flinging it awayrdquo
     p
    p
      Emerging from a wilderness of rocks and bushes General Feraud and his
      seconds discovered General DrsquoHubert engaged in peeling the orange They
      stood still waiting till he looked up Then the seconds raised their
      hats while General Feraud putting his hands behind his back walked
      aside a little way
    p
    p
      ldquoI am compelled to ask one of you messieurs to act for me I have
      brought no friends Will yourdquo
     p
    p
      The oneeyed cuirassier said judicially ldquoThat cannot be refusedrdquo
     p
    p
      The other veteran remarked ldquoItrsquos awkward all the samerdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoOwing to the state of the peoplersquos minds in this part of the country
      there was no one I could trust safely with the object of your presence
      hererdquo explained General DrsquoHubert urbanely
    p
    p
      They saluted looked round and remarked both together
    p
    p
      ldquoPoor groundrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoItrsquos unfitrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoWhy bother about ground measurements and so on Let us simplify
      matters Load the two pairs of pistols I will take those of General
      Feraud and let him take mine Or better still let us take a mixed pair
      One of each pair Then let us go into the wood and shoot at sight while
      you remain outside We did not come here for ceremonies but for warmdashwar
      to the death Any ground is good enough for that If I fall you must
      leave me where I lie and clear out It wouldnrsquot be healthy for you to be
      found hanging about here after thatrdquo
     p
    p
      It appeared after a short parley that General Feraud was willing to accept
      these conditions While the seconds were loading the pistols he could be
      heard whistling and was seen to rub his hands with perfect contentment
      He flung off his coat briskly and General D lsquoHubert took off his own and
      folded it carefully on a stone
    p
    p
      ldquoSuppose you take your principal to the other side of the wood and let him
      enter exactly in ten minutes from nowrdquo suggested General DrsquoHubert
      calmly but feeling as if he were giving directions for his own execution
      This however was his last moment of weakness ldquoWait Let us compare
      watches firstrdquo
     p
    p
      He pulled out his own The officer with the chipped nose went over to
      borrow the watch of General Feraud They bent their heads over them for a
      time
    p
    p
      ldquoThatrsquos it At four minutes to six by yours Seven to by minerdquo
     p
    p
      It was the cuirassier who remained by the side of General DrsquoHubert
      keeping his one eye fixed immovably on the white face of the watch he held
      in the palm of his hand He opened his mouth waiting for the beat of the
      last second long before he snapped out the word ldquoAvancezrdquo
     p
    p
      General DrsquoHubert moved on passing from the glaring sunshine of the
      Provencal morning into the cool and aromatic shade of the pines The
      ground was clear between the reddish trunks whose multitude leaning at
      slightly different angles confused his eye at first It was like going
      into battle The commanding quality of confidence in himself woke up in
      his breast He was all to his affair The problem was how to kill the
      adversary Nothing short of that would free him from this imbecile
      nightmare ldquoItrsquos no use wounding that bruterdquo thought General DrsquoHubert He
      was known as a resourceful officer His comrades years ago used also to
      call him The Strategist And it was a fact that he could think in the
      presence of the enemy Whereas Feraud had been always a mere fightermdashbut
      a dead shot unluckily
    p
    p
      ldquoI must draw his fire at the greatest possible rangerdquo said General
      DrsquoHubert to himself
    p
    p
      At that moment he saw something white moving far off between the treesmdashthe
      shirt of his adversary He stepped out at once between the trunks
      exposing himself freely then quick as lightning leaped back It had
      been a risky move but it succeeded in its object Almost simultaneously
      with the pop of a shot a small piece of bark chipped off by the bullet
      stung his ear painfully
    p
    p
      General Feraud with one shot expended was getting cautious Peeping
      round the tree General DrsquoHubert could not see him at all This ignorance
      of the foersquos whereabouts carried with it a sense of insecurity General
      DrsquoHubert felt himself abominably exposed on his flank and rear Again
      something white fluttered in his sight Ha The enemy was still on his
      front then He had feared a turning movement But apparently General
      Feraud was not thinking of it General DrsquoHubert saw him pass without
      special haste from one tree to another in the straight line of approach
      With great firmness of mind General DrsquoHubert stayed his hand Too far yet
      He knew he was no marksman His must be a waiting gamemdashto kill
    p
    p
      Wishing to take advantage of the greater thickness of the trunk he sank
      down to the ground Extended at full length head on to his enemy he had
      his person completely protected Exposing himself would not do now
      because the other was too near by this time A conviction that Feraud
      would presently do something rash was like balm to General DrsquoHubertrsquos
      soul But to keep his chin raised off the ground was irksome and not much
      use either He peeped round exposing a fraction of his head with dread
      but really with little risk His enemy as a matter of fact did not
      expect to see anything of him so far down as that General DrsquoHubert caught
      a fleeting view of General Feraud shifting trees again with deliberate
      caution ldquoHe despises my shootingrdquo he thought displaying that insight
      into the mind of his antagonist which is of such great help in winning
      battles He was confirmed in his tactics of immobility ldquoIf I could only
      watch my rear as well as my frontrdquo he thought anxiously longing for the
      impossible
    p
    p
      It required some force of character to lay his pistols down but on a
      sudden impulse General DrsquoHubert did this very gentlymdashone on each
      side of him In the army he had been looked upon as a bit of a dandy
      because he used to shave and put on a clean shirt on the days of battle
      As a matter of fact he had always been very careful of his personal
      appearance In a man of nearly forty in love with a young and charming
      girl this praiseworthy selfrespect may run to such little weaknesses as
      for instance being provided with an elegant little leather foldingcase
      containing a small ivory comb and fitted with a piece of lookingglass on
      the outside General DrsquoHubert his hands being free felt in his breechesrsquo 
      pockets for that implement of innocent vanity excusable in the possessor
      of long silky moustaches He drew it out and then with the utmost
      coolness and promptitude turned himself over on his back In this new
      attitude his head a little raised holding the little lookingglass just
      clear of his tree he squinted into it with his left eye while the right
      kept a direct watch on the rear of his position Thus was proved
      Napoleonrsquos saying that ldquofor a French soldier the word impossible does
      not existrdquo He had the right tree nearly filling the field of his little
      mirror
    p
    p
      ldquoIf he moves from behind itrdquo he reflected with satisfaction ldquoI am bound
      to see his legs But in any case he canrsquot come upon me unawaresrdquo
     p
    p
      And sure enough he saw the boots of General Feraud flash in and out
      eclipsing for an instant everything else reflected in the little mirror
      He shifted its position accordingly But having to form his judgment of
      the change from that indirect view he did not realize that now his feet
      and a portion of his legs were in plain sight of General Feraud
    p
    p
      General Feraud had been getting gradually impressed by the amazing
      cleverness with which his enemy was keeping cover He had spotted the
      right tree with bloodthirsty precision He was absolutely certain of it
      And yet he had not been able to glimpse as much as the tip of an ear As
      he had been looking for it at the height of about five feet ten inches
      from the ground it was no great wondermdashbut it seemed very wonderful
      to General Feraud
    p
    p
      The first view of these feet and legs determined a rush of blood to his
      head He literally staggered behind his tree and had to steady himself
      against it with his hand The other was lying on the ground then On the
      ground Perfectly still too Exposed What could it mean    The
      notion that he had knocked over his adversary at the first shot entered
      then General Feraudrsquos head Once there it grew with every second of
      attentive gazing overshadowing every other suppositionmdashirresistible
      triumphant ferocious
    p
    p
      ldquoWhat an ass I was to think I could have missed himrdquo he muttered to
      himself ldquoHe was exposed en pleinmdashthe foolmdashfor quite a couple
      of secondsrdquo
     p
    p
      General Feraud gazed at the motionless limbs the last vestiges of
      surprise fading before an unbounded admiration of his own deadly skill
      with the pistol
    p
    p
      ldquoTurned up his toes By the god of war that was a shotrdquo he exulted
      mentally ldquoGot it through the head no doubt just where I aimed
      staggered behind that tree rolled over on his back and diedrdquo
     p
    p
      And he stared He stared forgetting to move almost awed almost sorry
      But for nothing in the world would he have had it undone Such a shotmdashsuch
      a shot Rolled over on his back and died
    p
    p
      For it was this helpless position lying on the back that shouted its
      direct evidence at General Feraud It never occurred to him that it might
      have been deliberately assumed by a living man It was inconceivable It
      was beyond the range of sane supposition There was no possibility to
      guess the reason for it And it must be said too that General DrsquoHubertrsquos
      turnedup feet looked thoroughly dead General Feraud expanded his lungs
      for a stentorian shout to his seconds but from what he felt to be an
      excessive scrupulousness refrained for a while
    p
    p
      ldquoI will just go and see first whether he breathes yetrdquo he mumbled to
      himself leaving carelessly the shelter of his tree This move was
      immediately perceived by the resourceful General DrsquoHubert He concluded it
      to be another shift but when he lost the boots out of the field of the
      mirror he became uneasy General Feraud had only stepped a little out of
      the line but his adversary could not possibly have supposed him walking
      up with perfect unconcern General DrsquoHubert beginning to wonder at what
      had become of the other was taken unawares so completely that the first
      warning of danger consisted in the long earlymorning shadow of his enemy
      falling aslant on his outstretched legs He had not even heard a footfall
      on the soft ground between the trees
    p
    p
      It was too much even for his coolness He jumped up thoughtlessly leaving
      the pistols on the ground The irresistible instinct of an average man
      unless totally paralyzed by discomfiture would have been to stoop for
      his weapons exposing himself to the risk of being shot down in that
      position Instinct of course is irreflective It is its very definition
      But it may be an inquiry worth pursuing whether in reflective mankind the
      mechanical promptings of instinct are not affected by the customary mode
      of thought In his young days Armand DrsquoHubert the reflective promising
      officer had emitted the opinion that in warfare one should ldquonever cast
      back on the lines of a mistakerdquo This idea defended and developed in many
      discussions had settled into one of the stock notions of his brain had
      become a part of his mental individuality Whether it had gone so
      inconceivably deep as to affect the dictates of his instinct or simply
      because as he himself declared afterwards he was ldquotoo scared to remember
      the confounded pistolsrdquo the fact is that General DrsquoHubert never attempted
      to stoop for them Instead of going back on his mistake he seized the
      rough trunk with both hands and swung himself behind it with such
      impetuosity that going right round in the very flash and report of the
      pistolshot he reappeared on the other side of the tree face to face with
      General Feraud This last completely unstrung by such a show of agility
      on the part of a dead man was trembling yet A very faint mist of smoke
      hung before his face which had an extraordinary aspect as if the lower
      jaw had come unhinged
    p
    p
      ldquoNot missedrdquo he croaked hoarsely from the depths of a dry throat
    p
    p
      This sinister sound loosened the spell that had fallen on General
      DrsquoHubertrsquos senses ldquoYes missedmdasha bout portantrdquo he heard himself
      saying almost before he had recovered the full command of his faculties
      The revulsion of feeling was accompanied by a gust of homicidal fury
      resuming in its violence the accumulated resentment of a lifetime For
      years General D lsquoHubert had been exasperated and humiliated by an
      atrocious absurdity imposed upon him by this manrsquos savage caprice
      Besides General DrsquoHubert had been in this last instance too unwilling to
      confront death for the reaction of his anguish not to take the shape of a
      desire to kill ldquoAnd I have my two shots to fire yetrdquo he added
      pitilessly
    p
    p
      General Feraud snappedto his teeth and his face assumed an irate
      undaunted expression ldquoGo onrdquo he said grimly
    p
    p
      These would have been his last words if General DrsquoHubert had been holding
      the pistols in his hands But the pistols were lying on the ground at the
      foot of a pine General DrsquoHubert had the second of leisure necessary to
      remember that he had dreaded death not as a man but as a lover not as a
      danger but as a rival not as a foe to life but as an obstacle to
      marriage And behold there was the rival defeatedmdashutterly
      defeated crushed done for
    p
    p
      He picked up the weapons mechanically and instead of firing them into
      General Feraudrsquos breast he gave expression to the thoughts uppermost in
      his mind ldquoYou will fight no more duels nowrdquo
     p
    p
      His tone of leisurely ineffable satisfaction was too much for General
      Feraudrsquos stoicism ldquoDonrsquot dawdle then damn you for a coldblooded
      staffcoxcombrdquo he roared out suddenly out of an impassive face held
      erect on a rigidly still body
    p
    p
      General DrsquoHubert uncocked the pistols carefully This proceeding was
      observed with mixed feelings by the other general ldquoYou missed me twicerdquo
       the victor said coolly shifting both pistols to one hand ldquothe last time
      within a foot or so By every rule of single combat your life belongs to
      me That does not mean that I want to take it nowrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoI have no use for your forbearancerdquo muttered General Feraud gloomily
    p
    p
      ldquoAllow me to point out that this is no concern of minerdquo said General
      DrsquoHubert whose every word was dictated by a consummate delicacy of
      feeling In anger he could have killed that man but in cold blood he
      recoiled from humiliating by a show of generosity this unreasonable beingmdasha
      fellowsoldier of the Grande Armee a companion in the wonders and terrors
      of the great military epic ldquoYou donrsquot set up the pretension of dictating
      to me what I am to do with whatrsquos my ownrdquo
     p
    p
      General Feraud looked startled and the other continued ldquoYoursquove forced me
      on a point of honour to keep my life at your disposal as it were for
      fifteen years Very well Now that the matter is decided to my advantage
      I am going to do what I like with your life on the same principle You
      shall keep it at my disposal as long as I choose Neither more nor less
      You are on your honour till I say the wordrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoI am But sacrebleu This is an absurd position for a General of the
      Empire to be placed inrdquo cried General Feraud in accents of profound and
      dismayed conviction ldquoIt amounts to sitting all the rest of my life with a
      loaded pistol in a drawer waiting for your word Itrsquosmdashitrsquos idiotic
      I shall be an object ofmdashofmdashderisionrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoAbsurdmdashidiotic Do you think sordquo queried General DrsquoHubert with
      sly gravity ldquoPerhaps But I donrsquot see how that can be helped However I
      am not likely to talk at large of this adventure Nobody need ever know
      anything about it Just as no one to this day I believe knows the origin
      of our quarrel    Not a word morerdquo he added hastily ldquoI canrsquot really
      discuss this question with a man who as far as I am concerned does not
      existrdquo
     p
    p
      When the two duellists came out into the open General Feraud walking a
      little behind and rather with the air of walking in a trance the two
      seconds hurried towards them each from his station at the edge of the
      wood General DrsquoHubert addressed them speaking loud and distinctly
      ldquoMessieurs I make it a point of declaring to you solemnly in the
      presence of General Feraud that our difference is at last settled for
      good You may inform all the world of that factrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoA reconciliation after allrdquo they exclaimed together
    p
    p
      ldquoReconciliation Not that exactly It is something much more binding Is
      it not so Generalrdquo
     p
    p
      General Feraud only lowered his head in sign of assent The two veterans
      looked at each other Later in the day when they found themselves alone
      out of their moody friendrsquos earshot the cuirassier remarked suddenly
      ldquoGenerally speaking I can see with my one eye as far as most people but
      this beats me He wonrsquot say anythingrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoIn this affair of honour I understand there has been from first to last
      always something that no one in the army could quite make outrdquo declared
      the chasseur with the imperfect nose ldquoIn mystery it began in mystery it
      went on in mystery it is to end apparentlyrdquo
     p
    p
      General DrsquoHubert walked home with long hasty strides by no means
      uplifted by a sense of triumph He had conquered yet it did not seem to
      him that he had gained very much by his conquest The night before he had
      grudged the risk of his life which appeared to him magnificent worthy of
      preservation as an opportunity to win a girlrsquos love He had known moments
      when by a marvellous illusion this love seemed to be already his and
      his threatened life a still more magnificent opportunity of devotion Now
      that his life was safe it had suddenly lost its special magnificence It
      had acquired instead a specially alarming aspect as a snare for the
      exposure of unworthiness As to the marvellous illusion of conquered love
      that had visited him for a moment in the agitated watches of the night
      which might have been his last on earth he comprehended now its true
      nature It had been merely a paroxysm of delirious conceit Thus to this
      man sobered by the victorious issue of a duel life appeared robbed of
      its charm simply because it was no longer menaced
    p
    p
      Approaching the house from the back through the orchard and the kitchen
      garden he could not notice the agitation which reigned in front He never
      met a single soul Only while walking softly along the corridor he became
      aware that the house was awake and more noisy than usual Names of
      servants were being called out down below in a confused noise of coming
      and going With some concern he noticed that the door of his own room
      stood ajar though the shutters had not been opened yet He had hoped that
      his early excursion would have passed unperceived He expected to find
      some servant just gone in but the sunshine filtering through the usual
      cracks enabled him to see lying on the low divan something bulky which
      had the appearance of two women clasped in each otherrsquos arms Tearful and
      desolate murmurs issued mysteriously from that appearance General
      DrsquoHubert pulled open the nearest pair of shutters violently One of the
      women then jumped up It was his sister She stood for a moment with her
      hair hanging down and her arms raised straight up above her head and then
      flung herself with a stifled cry into his arms He returned her embrace
      trying at the same time to disengage himself from it The other woman had
      not risen She seemed on the contrary to cling closer to the divan
      hiding her face in the cushions Her hair was also loose it was admirably
      fair General DrsquoHubert recognized it with staggering emotion Mademoiselle
      de Valmassigue Adele In distress
    p
    p
      He became greatly alarmed and got rid of his sisterrsquos hug definitely
      Madame Leonie then extended her shapely bare arm out of her peignoir
      pointing dramatically at the divan ldquoThis poor terrified child has rushed
      here from home on foot two milesmdashrunning all the wayrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoWhat on earth has happenedrdquo asked General DrsquoHubert in a low agitated
      voice
    p
    p
      But Madame Leonie was speaking loudly ldquoShe rang the great bell at the
      gate and roused all the householdmdashwe were all asleep yet You may
      imagine what a terrible shock    Adele my dear child sit uprdquo
     p
    p
      General DrsquoHubertrsquos expression was not that of a man who ldquoimaginesrdquo with
      facility He did however fish out of the chaos of surmises the notion
      that his prospective motherinlaw had died suddenly but only to dismiss
      it at once He could not conceive the nature of the event or the
      catastrophe which would induce Mademoiselle de Valmassigue living in a
      house full of servants to bring the news over the fields herself two
      miles running all the way
    p
    p
      ldquoBut why are you in this roomrdquo he whispered full of awe
    p
    p
      ldquoOf course I ran up to see and this child    I did not notice it  
       she followed me Itrsquos that absurd Chevalierrdquo went on Madame Leonie
      looking towards the divan    ldquoHer hair is all come down You may
      imagine she did not stop to call her maid to dress it before she started
        Adele my dear sit up    He blurted it all out to her at
      halfpast five in the morning She woke up early and opened her shutters
      to breathe the fresh air and saw him sitting collapsed on a garden bench
      at the end of the great alley At that hourmdashyou may imagine And the
      evening before he had declared himself indisposed She hurried on some
      clothes and flew down to him One would be anxious for less He loves her
      but not very intelligently He had been up all night fully dressed the
      poor old man perfectly exhausted He wasnrsquot in a state to invent a
      plausible story    What a confidant you chose there My husband was
      furious He said lsquoWe canrsquot interfere nowrsquo So we sat down to wait It was
      awful And this poor child running with her hair loose over here publicly
      She has been seen by some people in the fields She has roused the whole
      household too Itrsquos awkward for her Luckily you are to be married next
      week    Adele sit up He has come home on his own legs    We
      expected to see you coming on a stretcher perhapsmdashwhat do I know
      Go and see if the carriage is ready I must take this child home at once
      It isnrsquot proper for her to stay here a minute longerrdquo
     p
    p
      General DrsquoHubert did not move It was as though he had heard nothing
      Madame Leonie changed her mind ldquoI will go and see myselfrdquo she cried ldquoI
      want also my cloakmdashAdelemdashrdquo she began but did not add ldquosit
      uprdquo She went out saying in a very loud and cheerful tone ldquoI leave the
      door openrdquo
     p
    p
      General DrsquoHubert made a movement towards the divan but then Adele sat up
      and that checked him dead He thought ldquoI havenrsquot washed this morning I
      must look like an old tramp Therersquos earth on the back of my coat and
      pineneedles in my hairrdquo It occurred to him that the situation required a
      good deal of circumspection on his part
    p
    p
      ldquoI am greatly concerned mademoisellerdquo he began vaguely and abandoned
      that line She was sitting up on the divan with her cheeks unusually pink
      and her hair brilliantly fair falling all over her shouldersmdashwhich
      was a very novel sight to the general He walked away up the room and
      looking out of the window for safety said ldquoI fear you must think I
      behaved like a madmanrdquo in accents of sincere despair Then he spun round
      and noticed that she had followed him with her eyes They were not cast
      down on meeting his glance And the expression of her face was novel to
      him also It was one might have said reversed Those eyes looked at him
      with grave thoughtfulness while the exquisite lines of her mouth seemed
      to suggest a restrained smile This change made her transcendental beauty
      much less mysterious much more accessible to a manrsquos comprehension An
      amazing ease of mind came to the generalmdashand even some ease of
      manner He walked down the room with as much pleasurable excitement as he
      would have found in walking up to a battery vomiting death fire and
      smoke then stood looking down with smiling eyes at the girl whose
      marriage with him next week had been so carefully arranged by the wise
      the good the admirable Leonie
    p
    p
      ldquoAh mademoisellerdquo he said in a tone of courtly regret ldquoif only I could
      be certain that you did not come here this morning two miles running all
      the way merely from affection for your motherrdquo
     p
    p
      He waited for an answer imperturbable but inwardly elated It came in a
      demure murmur eyelashes lowered with fascinating effect ldquoYou must not be
      mechant as well as madrdquo
     p
    p
      And then General DrsquoHubert made an aggressive movement towards the divan
      which nothing could check That piece of furniture was not exactly in the
      line of the open door But Madame Leonie coming back wrapped up in a
      light cloak and carrying a lace shawl on her arm for Adele to hide her
      incriminating hair under had a swift impression of her brother getting up
      from his knees
    p
    p
      ldquoCome along my dear childrdquo she cried from the doorway
    p
    p
      The general now himself again in the fullest sense showed the readiness
      of a resourceful cavalry officer and the peremptoriness of a leader of
      men ldquoYou donrsquot expect her to walk to the carriagerdquo he said indignantly
      ldquoShe isnrsquot fit I shall carry her downstairsrdquo
     p
    p
      This he did slowly followed by his awed and respectful sister but he
      rushed back like a whirlwind to wash off all the signs of the night of
      anguish and the morning of war and to put on the festive garments of a
      conqueror before hurrying over to the other house Had it not been for
      that General D lsquoHubert felt capable of mounting a horse and pursuing his
      late adversary in order simply to embrace him from excess of happiness ldquoI
      owe it all to this stupid bruterdquo he thought ldquoHe has made plain in a
      morning what might have taken me years to find outmdashfor I am a timid
      fool No selfconfidence whatever Perfect coward And the Chevalier
      Delightful old manrdquo General DrsquoHubert longed to embrace him also
    p
    p
      The Chevalier was in bed For several days he was very unwell The men of
      the Empire and the postrevolution young ladies were too much for him He
      got up the day before the wedding and being curious by nature took his
      niece aside for a quiet talk He advised her to find out from her husband
      the true story of the affair of honour whose claim so imperative and so
      persistent had led her to within an ace of tragedy ldquoIt is right that his
      wife should be told And next month or so will be your time to learn from
      him anything you want to know my dear childrdquo
     p
    p
      Later on when the married couple came on a visit to the mother of the
      bride Madame la Generale DrsquoHubert communicated to her beloved old uncle
      the true story she had obtained without any difficulty from her husband
    p
    p
      The Chevalier listened with deep attention to the end took a pinch of
      snuff flicked the grains of tobacco from the frilled front of his shirt
      and asked calmly ldquoAnd thatrsquos all it wasrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoYes unclerdquo replied Madame la Generale opening her pretty eyes very
      wide ldquoIsnrsquot it funny Crsquoest insensemdashto think what men are capable
      ofrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoHrsquomrdquo commented the old emigre ldquoIt depends what sort of men That
      Bonapartersquos soldiers were savages It is insense As a wife my dear you
      must believe implicitly what your husband saysrdquo
     p
    p
      But to Leoniersquos husband the Chevalier confided his true opinion ldquoIf
      thatrsquos the tale the fellow made up for his wife and during the honeymoon
      too you may depend on it that no one will ever know now the secret of
      this affairrdquo
     p
    p
      Considerably later still General DrsquoHubert judged the time come and the
      opportunity propitious to write a letter to General Feraud This letter
      began by disclaiming all animosity ldquoIrsquove neverrdquo wrote the General Baron
      DrsquoHubert ldquowished for your death during all the time of our deplorable
      quarrel Allow merdquo he continued ldquoto give you back in all form your
      forfeited life It is proper that we two who have been partners in so
      much military glory should be friendly to each other publiclyrdquo
     p
    p
      The same letter contained also an item of domestic information It was in
      reference to this last that General Feraud answered from a little village
      on the banks of the Garonne in the following words
    p
    p
      ldquoIf one of your boyrsquos names had been Napoleonmdashor Josephmdashor
      even Joachim I could congratulate you on the event with a better heart
      As you have thought proper to give him the names of Charles Henri Armand
      I am confirmed in my conviction that you never loved the Emperor The
      thought of that sublime hero chained to a rock in the middle of a savage
      ocean makes life of so little value that I would receive with positive joy
      your instructions to blow my brains out From suicide I consider myself in
      honour debarred But I keep a loaded pistol in my drawerrdquo
     p
    p
      Madame la Generale DrsquoHubert lifted up her hands in despair after perusing
      that answer
    p
    p
      ldquoYou see He wonrsquot be reconciledrdquo said her husband ldquoHe must never by
      any chance be allowed to guess where the money comes from It wouldnrsquot
      do He couldnrsquot bear itrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoYou are a brave homme Armandrdquo said Madame la Generale appreciatively
    p
    p
      ldquoMy dear I had the right to blow his brains out but as I didnrsquot we
      canrsquot let him starve He has lost his pension and he is utterly incapable
      of doing anything in the world for himself We must take care of him
      secretly to the end of his days Donrsquot I owe him the most ecstatic moment
      of my life    Ha ha ha Over the fields two miles running all the
      way I couldnrsquot believe my ears    But for his stupid ferocity it
      would have taken me years to find you out Itrsquos extraordinary how in one
      way or another this man has managed to fasten himself on my deeper
      feelingsrdquo

      The first time we got into conversation was in the National Museum in
      Naples in the rooms on the ground floor containing the famous collection
      of bronzes from Herculaneum and Pompeii that marvellous legacy of antique
      art whose delicate perfection has been preserved for us by the
      catastrophic fury of a volcano
    p
    p
      He addressed me first over the celebrated Resting Hermes which we had
      been looking at side by side He said the right things about that wholly
      admirable piece Nothing profound His taste was natural rather than
      cultivated He had obviously seen many fine things in his life and
      appreciated them but he had no jargon of a dilettante or the connoisseur
      A hateful tribe He spoke like a fairly intelligent man of the world a
      perfectly unaffected gentleman
    p
    p
      We had known each other by sight for some few days past Staying in the
      same hotelmdashgood but not extravagantly up to datemdashI had
      noticed him in the vestibule going in and out I judged he was an old and
      valued client The bow of the hotelkeeper was cordial in its deference
      and he acknowledged it with familiar courtesy For the servants he was Il
      Conde There was some squabble over a manrsquos parasolmdashyellow silk with
      white lining sort of thingmdashthe waiters had discovered abandoned
      outside the diningroom door Our goldlaced doorkeeper recognized it and
      I heard him directing one of the lift boys to run after Il Conde with it
      Perhaps he was the only Count staying in the hotel or perhaps he had the
      distinction of being the Count par excellence conferred upon him because
      of his tried fidelity to the house
    p
    p
      Having conversed at the Museomdashand by the by he had expressed his
      dislike of the busts and statues of Roman emperors in the gallery of
      marbles their faces were too vigorous too pronounced for himmdashhaving
      conversed already in the morning I did not think I was intruding when in
      the evening finding the diningroom very full I proposed to share his
      little table Judging by the quiet urbanity of his consent he did not
      think so either His smile was very attractive
    p
    p
      He dined in an evening waistcoat and a ldquosmokingrdquo he called it so with a
      black tie All this of very good cut not newmdashjust as these things
      should be He was morning or evening very correct in his dress I have
      no doubt that his whole existence had been correct well ordered and
      conventional undisturbed by startling events His white hair brushed
      upwards off a lofty forehead gave him the air of an idealist of an
      imaginative man His white moustache heavy but carefully trimmed and
      arranged was not unpleasantly tinted a golden yellow in the middle The
      faint scent of some very good perfume and of good cigars that last an
      odour quite remarkable to come upon in Italy reached me across the table
      It was in his eyes that his age showed most They were a little weary with
      creased eyelids He must have been sixty or a couple of years more And he
      was communicative I would not go so far as to call it garrulousmdashbut
      distinctly communicative
    p
    p
      He had tried various climates of Abbazia of the Riviera of other
      places too he told me but the only one which suited him was the climate
      of the Gulf of Naples The ancient Romans who he pointed out to me were
      men expert in the art of living knew very well what they were doing when
      they built their villas on these shores in Baiae in Vico in Capri They
      came down to this seaside in search of health bringing with them their
      trains of mimes and fluteplayers to amuse their leisure He thought it
      extremely probable that the Romans of the higher classes were specially
      predisposed to painful rheumatic affections
    p
    p
      This was the only personal opinion I heard him express It was based on no
      special erudition He knew no more of the Romans than an average informed
      man of the world is expected to know He argued from personal experience
      He had suffered himself from a painful and dangerous rheumatic affection
      till he found relief in this particular spot of Southern Europe
    p
    p
      This was three years ago and ever since he had taken up his quarters on
      the shores of the gulf either in one of the hotels in Sorrento or hiring
      a small villa in Capri He had a piano a few books picked up transient
      acquaintances of a day week or month in the stream of travellers from
      all Europe One can imagine him going out for his walks in the streets and
      lanes becoming known to beggars shopkeepers children country people
      talking amiably over the walls to the contadinimdashand coming back to
      his rooms or his villa to sit before the piano with his white hair
      brushed up and his thick orderly moustache ldquoto make a little music for
      myselfrdquo And of course for a change there was Naples near bymdashlife
      movement animation opera A little amusement as he said is necessary
      for health Mimes and fluteplayers in fact Only unlike the magnates of
      ancient Rome he had no affairs of the city to call him away from these
      moderate delights He had no affairs at all Probably he had never had any
      grave affairs to attend to in his life It was a kindly existence with
      its joys and sorrows regulated by the course of Naturemdashmarriages
      births deathsmdashruled by the prescribed usages of good society and
      protected by the State
    p
    p
      He was a widower but in the months of July and August he ventured to
      cross the Alps for six weeks on a visit to his married daughter He told
      me her name It was that of a very aristocratic family She had a castlemdashin
      Bohemia I think This is as near as I ever came to ascertaining his
      nationality His own name strangely enough he never mentioned Perhaps
      he thought I had seen it on the published list Truth to say I never
      looked At any rate he was a good Europeanmdashhe spoke four languages
      to my certain knowledgemdashand a man of fortune Not of great fortune
      evidently and appropriately I imagine that to be extremely rich would
      have appeared to him improper outremdashtoo blatant altogether And
      obviously too the fortune was not of his making The making of a fortune
      cannot be achieved without some roughness It is a matter of temperament
      His nature was too kindly for strife In the course of conversation he
      mentioned his estate quite by the way in reference to that painful and
      alarming rheumatic affection One year staying incautiously beyond the
      Alps as late as the middle of September he had been laid up for three
      months in that lonely country house with no one but his valet and the
      caretaking couple to attend to him Because as he expressed it he ldquokept
      no establishment thererdquo He had only gone for a couple of days to confer
      with his land agent He promised himself never to be so imprudent in the
      future The first weeks of September would find him on the shores of his
      beloved gulf
    p
    p
      Sometimes in travelling one comes upon such lonely men whose only
      business is to wait for the unavoidable Deaths and marriages have made a
      solitude round them and one really cannot blame their endeavours to make
      the waiting as easy as possible As he remarked to me ldquoAt my time of life
      freedom from physical pain is a very important matterrdquo
     p
    p
      It must not be imagined that he was a wearisome hypochondriac He was
      really much too wellbred to be a nuisance He had an eye for the small
      weaknesses of humanity But it was a goodnatured eye He made a restful
      easy pleasant companion for the hours between dinner and bedtime We
      spent three evenings together and then I had to leave Naples in a hurry
      to look after a friend who had fallen seriously ill in Taormina Having
      nothing to do Il Conde came to see me off at the station I was somewhat
      upset and his idleness was always ready to take a kindly form He was by
      no means an indolent man
    p
    p
      He went along the train peering into the carriages for a good seat for me
      and then remained talking cheerily from below He declared he would miss
      me that evening very much and announced his intention of going after
      dinner to listen to the band in the public garden the Villa Nazionale He
      would amuse himself by hearing excellent music and looking at the best
      society There would be a lot of people as usual
    p
    p
      I seem to see him yetmdashhis raised face with a friendly smile under
      the thick moustaches and his kind fatigued eyes As the train began to
      move he addressed me in two languages first in French saying ldquoBon
      voyagerdquo then in his very good somewhat emphatic English encouragingly
      because he could see my concern ldquoAll willmdashbemdashwellmdashyetrdquo
     p
    p
      My friendrsquos illness having taken a decidedly favourable turn I returned
      to Naples on the tenth day I cannot say I had given much thought to Il
      Conde during my absence but entering the diningroom I looked for him in
      his habitual place I had an idea he might have gone back to Sorrento to
      his piano and his books and his fishing He was great friends with all the
      boatmen and fished a good deal with lines from a boat But I made out his
      white head in the crowd of heads and even from a distance noticed
      something unusual in his attitude Instead of sitting erect gazing all
      round with alert urbanity he drooped over his plate I stood opposite him
      for some time before he looked up a little wildly if such a strong word
      can be used in connection with his correct appearance
    p
    p
      ldquoAh my dear sir Is it yourdquo he greeted me ldquoI hope all is wellrdquo
     p
    p
      He was very nice about my friend Indeed he was always nice with the
      niceness of people whose hearts are genuinely humane But this time it
      cost him an effort His attempts at general conversation broke down into
      dullness It occurred to me he might have been indisposed But before I
      could frame the inquiry he muttered
    p
    p
      ldquoYou find me here very sadrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoI am sorry for thatrdquo I said ldquoYou havenrsquot had bad news I hoperdquo
     p
    p
      It was very kind of me to take an interest No It was not that No bad
      news thank God And he became very still as if holding his breath Then
      leaning forward a little and in an odd tone of awed embarrassment he
      took me into his confidence
    p
    p
      ldquoThe truth is that I have had a verymdasha verymdashhow shall I saymdashabominable
      adventure happen to merdquo
     p
    p
      The energy of the epithet was sufficiently startling in that man of
      moderate feelings and toneddown vocabulary The word unpleasant I should
      have thought would have fitted amply the worst experience likely to befall
      a man of his stamp And an adventure too Incredible But it is in human
      nature to believe the worst and I confess I eyed him stealthily
      wondering what he had been up to In a moment however my unworthy
      suspicions vanished There was a fundamental refinement of nature about
      the man which made me dismiss all idea of some more or less disreputable
      scrape
    p
    p
      ldquoIt is very serious Very seriousrdquo He went on nervously ldquoI will tell
      you after dinner if you will allow merdquo
     p
    p
      I expressed my perfect acquiescence by a little bow nothing more I
      wished him to understand that I was not likely to hold him to that offer
      if he thought better of it later on We talked of indifferent things but
      with a sense of difficulty quite unlike our former easy gossipy
      intercourse The hand raising a piece of bread to his lips I noticed
      trembled slightly This symptom in regard to my reading of the man was
      no less than startling
    p
    p
      In the smokingroom he did not hang back at all Directly we had taken our
      usual seats he leaned sideways over the arm of his chair and looked
      straight into my eyes earnestly
    p
    p
      ldquoYou rememberrdquo he began ldquothat day you went away I told you then I would
      go to the Villa Nazionale to hear some music in the eveningrdquo
     p
    p
      I remembered His handsome old face so fresh for his age unmarked by any
      trying experience appeared haggard for an instant It was like the
      passing of a shadow Returning his steadfast gaze I took a sip of my
      black coffee He was systematically minute in his narrative simply in
      order I think not to let his excitement get the better of him
    p
    p
      After leaving the railway station he had an ice and read the paper in a
      cafe Then he went back to the hotel dressed for dinner and dined with a
      good appetite After dinner he lingered in the hall there were chairs and
      tables there smoking his cigar talked to the little girl of the Primo
      Tenore of the San Carlo theatre and exchanged a few words with that
      ldquoamiable ladyrdquo the wife of the Primo Tenore There was no performance
      that evening and these people were going to the Villa also They went out
      of the hotel Very well
    p
    p
      At the moment of following their examplemdashit was halfpast nine
      alreadymdashhe remembered he had a rather large sum of money in his
      pocketbook He entered therefore the office and deposited the greater
      part of it with the bookkeeper of the hotel This done he took a
      carozella and drove to the seashore He got out of the cab and entered the
      Villa on foot from the Largo di Vittoria end
    p
    p
      He stared at me very hard And I understood then how really impressionable
      he was Every small fact and event of that evening stood out in his memory
      as if endowed with mystic significance If he did not mention to me the
      colour of the pony which drew the carozella and the aspect of the man who
      drove it was a mere oversight arising from his agitation which he
      repressed manfully
    p
    p
      He had then entered the Villa Nazionale from the Largo di Vittoria end
      The Villa Nazionale is a public pleasureground laid out in grass plots
      bushes and flowerbeds between the houses of the Riviera di Chiaja and
      the waters of the bay Alleys of trees more or less parallel stretch its
      whole lengthmdashwhich is considerable On the Riviera di Chiaja side
      the electric tramcars run close to the railings Between the garden and
      the sea is the fashionable drive a broad road bordered by a low wall
      beyond which the Mediterranean splashes with gentle murmurs when the
      weather is fine
    p
    p
      As life goes on late at night in Naples the broad drive was all astir
      with a brilliant swarm of carriage lamps moving in pairs some creeping
      slowly others running rapidly under the thin motionless line of electric
      lamps defining the shore And a brilliant swarm of stars hung above the
      land humming with voices piled up with houses glittering with lightsmdashand
      over the silent flat shadows of the sea
    p
    p
      The gardens themselves are not very well lit Our friend went forward in
      the warm gloom his eyes fixed upon a distant luminous region extending
      nearly across the whole width of the Villa as if the air had glowed there
      with its own cold bluish and dazzling light This magic spot behind the
      black trunks of trees and masses of inky foliage breathed out sweet
      sounds mingled with bursts of brassy roar sudden clashes of metal and
      grave vibrating thuds
    p
    p
      As he walked on all these noises combined together into a piece of
      elaborate music whose harmonious phrases came persuasively through a great
      disorderly murmur of voices and shuffling of feet on the gravel of that
      open space An enormous crowd immersed in the electric light as if in a
      bath of some radiant and tenuous fluid shed upon their heads by luminous
      globes drifted in its hundreds round the band Hundreds more sat on
      chairs in more or less concentric circles receiving unflinchingly the
      great waves of sonority that ebbed out into the darkness The Count
      penetrated the throng drifted with it in tranquil enjoyment listening
      and looking at the faces All people of good society mothers with their
      daughters parents and children young men and young women all talking
      smiling nodding to each other Very many pretty faces and very many
      pretty toilettes There was of course a quantity of diverse types showy
      old fellows with white moustaches fat men thin men officers in uniform
      but what predominated he told me was the South Italian type of young
      man with a colourless clear complexion red lips jetblack little
      moustache and liquid black eyes so wonderfully effective in leering or
      scowling
    p
    p
      Withdrawing from the throng the Count shared a little table in front of
      the cafe with a young man of just such a type Our friend had some
      lemonade The young man was sitting moodily before an empty glass He
      looked up once and then looked down again He also tilted his hat
      forward Like thismdash
    p
    p
      The Count made the gesture of a man pulling his hat down over his brow
      and went on
    p
    p
      ldquoI think to myself he is sad something is wrong with him young men have
      their troubles I take no notice of him of course I pay for my lemonade
      and go awayrdquo
     p
    p
      Strolling about in the neighbourhood of the band the Count thinks he saw
      twice that young man wandering alone in the crowd Once their eyes met It
      must have been the same young man but there were so many there of that
      type that he could not be certain Moreover he was not very much
      concerned except in so far that he had been struck by the marked peevish
      discontent of that face
    p
    p
      Presently tired of the feeling of confinement one experiences in a crowd
      the Count edged away from the band An alley very sombre by contrast
      presented itself invitingly with its promise of solitude and coolness He
      entered it walking slowly on till the sound of the orchestra became
      distinctly deadened Then he walked back and turned about once more He
      did this several times before he noticed that there was somebody occupying
      one of the benches
    p
    p
      The spot being midway between two lampposts the light was faint
    p
    p
      The man lolled back in the corner of the seat his legs stretched out his
      arms folded and his head drooping on his breast He never stirred as
      though he had fallen asleep there but when the Count passed by next time
      he had changed his attitude He sat leaning forward His elbows were
      propped on his knees and his hands were rolling a cigarette He never
      looked up from that occupation
    p
    p
      The Count continued his stroll away from the band He returned slowly he
      said I can imagine him enjoying to the full but with his usual
      tranquillity the balminess of this southern night and the sounds of music
      softened delightfully by the distance
    p
    p
      Presently he approached for the third time the man on the garden seat
      still leaning forward with his elbows on his knees It was a dejected
      pose In the semiobscurity of the alley his high shirt collar and his
      cuffs made small patches of vivid whiteness The Count said that he had
      noticed him getting up brusquely as if to walk away but almost before he
      was aware of it the man stood before him asking in a low gentle tone
      whether the signore would have the kindness to oblige him with a light
    p
    p
      The Count answered this request by a polite ldquoCertainlyrdquo and dropped his
      hands with the intention of exploring both pockets of his trousers for the
      matches
    p
    p
      ldquoI dropped my handsrdquo he said ldquobut I never put them in my pockets I felt
      a pressure theremdashrdquo
     p
    p
      He put the tip of his finger on a spot close under his breastbone the
      very spot of the human body where a Japanese gentleman begins the
      operations of the Harakiri which is a form of suicide following upon
      dishonour upon an intolerable outrage to the delicacy of onersquos feelings
    p
    p
      ldquoI glance downrdquo the Count continued in an awestruck voice ldquoand what do I
      see A knife A long knifemdashrdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoYou donrsquot mean to sayrdquo I exclaimed amazed ldquothat you have been held up
      like this in the Villa at halfpast ten orsquoclock within a stonersquos throw of
      a thousand peoplerdquo
     p
    p
      He nodded several times staring at me with all his might
    p
    p
      ldquoThe clarionetrdquo he declared solemnly ldquowas finishing his solo and I
      assure you I could hear every note Then the band crashed fortissimo and
      that creature rolled its eyes and gnashed its teeth hissing at me with the
      greatest ferocity lsquoBe silent No noise ormdashlsquordquo
     p
    p
      I could not get over my astonishment
    p
    p
      ldquoWhat sort of knife was itrdquo I asked stupidly
    p
    p
      ldquoA long blade A stilettomdashperhaps a kitchen knife A long narrow
      blade It gleamed And his eyes gleamed His white teeth too I could see
      them He was very ferocious I thought to myself lsquoIf I hit him he will
      kill mersquo How could I fight with him He had the knife and I had nothing
      I am nearly seventy you know and that was a young man I seemed even to
      recognize him The moody young man of the cafe The young man I met in the
      crowd But I could not tell There are so many like him in this countryrdquo
     p
    p
      The distress of that moment was reflected in his face I should think that
      physically he must have been paralyzed by surprise His thoughts however
      remained extremely active They ranged over every alarming possibility
      The idea of setting up a vigorous shouting for help occurred to him too
      But he did nothing of the kind and the reason why he refrained gave me a
      good opinion of his mental selfpossession He saw in a flash that nothing
      prevented the other from shouting too
    p
    p
      ldquoThat young man might in an instant have thrown away his knife and
      pretended I was the aggressor Why not He might have said I attacked him
      Why not It was one incredible story against another He might have said
      anythingmdashbring some dishonouring charge against memdashwhat do I
      know By his dress he was no common robber He seemed to belong to the
      better classes What could I say He was an ItalianmdashI am a
      foreigner Of course I have my passport and there is our consulmdashbut
      to be arrested dragged at night to the police office like a criminalrdquo
     p
    p
      He shuddered It was in his character to shrink from scandal much more
      than from mere death And certainly for many people this would have always
      remainedmdashconsidering certain peculiarities of Neapolitan mannersmdasha
      deucedly queer story The Count was no fool His belief in the respectable
      placidity of life having received this rude shock he thought that now
      anything might happen But also a notion came into his head that this
      young man was perhaps merely an infuriated lunatic
    p
    p
      This was for me the first hint of his attitude towards this adventure In
      his exaggerated delicacy of sentiment he felt that nobodyrsquos selfesteem
      need be affected by what a madman may choose to do to one It became
      apparent however that the Count was to be denied that consolation He
      enlarged upon the abominably savage way in which that young man rolled his
      glistening eyes and gnashed his white teeth The band was going now
      through a slow movement of solemn braying by all the trombones with
      deliberately repeated bangs of the big drum
    p
    p
      ldquoBut what did you dordquo I asked greatly excited
    p
    p
      ldquoNothingrdquo answered the Count ldquoI let my hands hang down very still I
      told him quietly I did not intend making a noise He snarled like a dog
      then said in an ordinary voice
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoVostro portofoliorsquordquo
     p
    p
      ldquoSo I naturallyrdquo continued the Countmdashand from this point acted the
      whole thing in pantomime Holding me with his eyes he went through all
      the motions of reaching into his inside breast pocket taking out a
      pocketbook and handing it over But that young man still bearing
      steadily on the knife refused to touch it
    p
    p
      He directed the Count to take the money out himself received it into his
      left hand motioned the pocketbook to be returned to the pocket all this
      being done to the sweet thrilling of flutes and clarionets sustained by
      the emotional drone of the hautboys And the ldquoyoung manrdquo as the Count
      called him said ldquoThis seems very littlerdquo
     p
    p
      ldquoIt was indeed only  or  lirerdquo the Count pursued ldquoI had left my
      money in the hotel as you know I told him this was all I had on me He
      shook his head impatiently and said
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoVostro orologiorsquordquo
     p
    p
      The Count gave me the dumb show of pulling out his watch detaching it
      But as it happened the valuable gold halfchronometer he possessed had
      been left at a watchmakerrsquos for cleaning He wore that evening on a
      leather guard the Waterbury fiftyfranc thing he used to take with him on
      his fishing expeditions Perceiving the nature of this booty the
      welldressed robber made a contemptuous clicking sound with his tongue
      like this ldquoTseAhrdquo and waved it away hastily Then as the Count was
      returning the disdained object to his pocket he demanded with a
      threateningly increased pressure of the knife on the epigastrium by way
      of reminder
    p
    p
      ldquolsquoVostri anellirsquordquo
     p
    p
      ldquoOne of the ringsrdquo went on the Count ldquowas given me many years ago by my
      wife the other is the signet ring of my father I said lsquoNo That you
      shall not haversquordquo
     p
    p
      Here the Count reproduced the gesture corresponding to that declaration by
      clapping one hand upon the other and pressing both thus against his
      chest It was touching in its resignation ldquoThat you shall not haverdquo he
      repeated firmly and closed his eyes fully expectingmdashI donrsquot know
      whether I am right in recording that such an unpleasant word had passed
      his lipsmdashfully expecting to feel himself beingmdashI really
      hesitate to saymdashbeing disembowelled by the push of the long sharp
      blade resting murderously against the pit of his stomachmdashthe very
      seat in all human beings of anguishing sensations
    p
    p
      Great waves of harmony went on flowing from the band
    p
    p
      Suddenly the Count felt the nightmarish pressure removed from the
      sensitive spot He opened his eyes He was alone He had heard nothing It
      is probable that ldquothe young manrdquo had departed with light steps some time
      before but the sense of the horrid pressure had lingered even after the
      knife had gone A feeling of weakness came over him He had just time to
      stagger to the garden seat He felt as though he had held his breath for a
      long time He sat all in a heap panting with the shock of the reaction
    p
    p
      The band was executing with immense bravura the complicated finale It
      ended with a tremendous crash He heard it unreal and remote as if his
      ears had been stopped and then the hard clapping of a thousand more or
      less pairs of hands like a sudden hailshower passing away The profound
      silence which succeeded recalled him to himself
    p
    p
      A tramcar resembling a long glass box wherein people sat with their heads
      strongly lighted ran along swiftly within sixty yards of the spot where
      he had been robbed Then another rustled by and yet another going the
      other way The audience about the band had broken up and were entering
      the alley in small conversing groups The Count sat up straight and tried
      to think calmly of what had happened to him The vileness of it took his
      breath away again As far as I can make it out he was disgusted with
      himself I do not mean to say with his behaviour Indeed if his
      pantomimic rendering of it for my information was to be trusted it was
      simply perfect No it was not that He was not ashamed He was shocked at
      being the selected victim not of robbery so much as of contempt His
      tranquillity had been wantonly desecrated His lifelong kindly nicety of
      outlook had been defaced
    p
    p
      Nevertheless at that stage before the iron had time to sink deep he was
      able to argue himself into comparative equanimity As his agitation calmed
      down somewhat he became aware that he was frightfully hungry Yes
      hungry The sheer emotion had made him simply ravenous He left the seat
      and after walking for some time found himself outside the gardens and
      before an arrested tramcar without knowing very well how he came there
      He got in as if in a dream by a sort of instinct Fortunately he found in
      his trouser pocket a copper to satisfy the conductor Then the car
      stopped and as everybody was getting out he got out too He recognized
      the Piazza San Ferdinando but apparently it did not occur to him to take
      a cab and drive to the hotel He remained in distress on the Piazza like a
      lost dog thinking vaguely of the best way of getting something to eat at
      once
    p
    p
      Suddenly he remembered his twentyfranc piece He explained to me that he
      had that piece of French gold for something like three years He used to
      carry it about with him as a sort of reserve in case of accident Anybody
      is liable to have his pocket pickedmdasha quite different thing from a
      brazen and insulting robbery
    p
    p
      The monumental arch of the Galleria Umberto faced him at the top of a
      noble flight of stairs He climbed these without loss of time and
      directed his steps towards the Cafe Umberto All the tables outside were
      occupied by a lot of people who were drinking But as he wanted something
      to eat he went inside into the cafe which is divided into aisles by
      square pillars set all round with long lookingglasses The Count sat down
      on a red plush bench against one of these pillars waiting for his
      risotto And his mind reverted to his abominable adventure
    p
    p
      He thought of the moody welldressed young man with whom he had
      exchanged glances in the crowd around the bandstand and who he felt
      confident was the robber Would he recognize him again Doubtless But he
      did not want ever to see him again The best thing was to forget this
      humiliating episode
    p
    p
      The Count looked round anxiously for the coming of his risotto and
      behold to the left against the wallmdashthere sat the young man He was
      alone at a table with a bottle of some sort of wine or syrup and a carafe
      of iced water before him The smooth olive cheeks the red lips the
      little jetblack moustache turned up gallantly the fine black eyes a
      little heavy and shaded by long eyelashes that peculiar expression of
      cruel discontent to be seen only in the busts of some Roman emperorsmdashit
      was he no doubt at all But that was a type The Count looked away
      hastily The young officer over there reading a paper was like that too
      Same type Two young men farther away playing draughts also resembledmdash
    p
    p
      The Count lowered his head with the fear in his heart of being
      everlastingly haunted by the vision of that young man He began to eat his
      risotto Presently he heard the young man on his left call the waiter in a
      badtempered tone
    p
    p
      At the call not only his own waiter but two other idle waiters belonging
      to a quite different row of tables rushed towards him with obsequious
      alacrity which is not the general characteristic of the waiters in the
      Cafe Umberto The young man muttered something and one of the waiters
      walking rapidly to the nearest door called out into the Galleria
      ldquoPasquale O Pasqualerdquo
     p
    p
      Everybody knows Pasquale the shabby old fellow who shuffling between the
      tables offers for sale cigars cigarettes picture postcards and matches
      to the clients of the cafe He is in many respects an engaging scoundrel
      The Count saw the greyhaired unshaven ruffian enter the cafe the glass
      case hanging from his neck by a leather strap and at a word from the
      waiter make his shuffling way with a sudden spurt to the young manrsquos
      table The young man was in need of a cigar with which Pasquale served him
      fawningly The old pedlar was going out when the Count on a sudden
      impulse beckoned to him
    p
    p
      Pasquale approached the smile of deferential recognition combining oddly
      with the cynical searching expression of his eyes Leaning his case on the
      table he lifted the glass lid without a word The Count took a box of
      cigarettes and urged by a fearful curiosity asked as casually as he couldmdash
    p
    p
      ldquoTell me Pasquale who is that young signore sitting over thererdquo
     p
    p
      The other bent over his box confidentially
    p
    p
      ldquoThat Signor Conderdquo he said beginning to rearrange his wares busily and
      without looking up ldquothat is a young Cavaliere of a very good family from
      Bari He studies in the University here and is the chief capo of an
      association of young menmdashof very nice young menrdquo
     p
    p
      He paused and then with mingled discretion and pride of knowledge
      murmured the explanatory word ldquoCamorrardquo and shut down the lid ldquoA very
      powerful Camorrardquo he breathed out ldquoThe professors themselves respect it
      greatly    una lira e cinquanti centesimi Signor Conderdquo
     p
    p
      Our friend paid with the gold piece While Pasquale was making up the
      change he observed that the young man of whom he had heard so much in a
      few words was watching the transaction covertly After the old vagabond
      had withdrawn with a bow the Count settled with the waiter and sat still
      A numbness he told me had come over him
    p
    p
      The young man paid too got up and crossed over apparently for the
      purpose of looking at himself in the mirror set in the pillar nearest to
      the Countrsquos seat He was dressed all in black with a dark green bow tie
      The Count looked round and was startled by meeting a vicious glance out
      of the corners of the otherrsquos eyes The young Cavaliere from Bari
      according to Pasquale but Pasquale is of course an accomplished liar
      went on arranging his tie settling his hat before the glass and meantime
      he spoke just loud enough to be heard by the Count He spoke through his
      teeth with the most insulting venom of contempt and gazing straight into
      the mirror
    p
    p
      ldquoAh So you had some gold on youmdashyou old liarmdashyou old birbamdashyou
      furfante But you are not done with me yetrdquo
     p
    p
      The fiendishness of his expression vanished like lightning and he lounged
      out of the cafe with a moody impassive face
    p
    p
      The poor Count after telling me this last episode fell back trembling in
      his chair His forehead broke into perspiration There was a wanton
      insolence in the spirit of this outrage which appalled even me What it
      was to the Countrsquos delicacy I wonrsquot attempt to guess I am sure that if he
      had been not too refined to do such a blatantly vulgar thing as dying from
      apoplexy in a cafe he would have had a fatal stroke there and then All
      irony apart my difficulty was to keep him from seeing the full extent of
      my commiseration He shrank from every excessive sentiment and my
      commiseration was practically unbounded It did not surprise me to hear
      that he had been in bed a week He had got up to make his arrangements for
      leaving Southern Italy for good and all
    p
    p
      And the man was convinced that he could not live through a whole year in
      any other climate
    p
    p
      No argument of mine had any effect It was not timidity though he did say
      to me once ldquoYou do not know what a Camorra is my dear sir I am a marked
      manrdquo He was not afraid of what could be done to him His delicate
      conception of his dignity was defiled by a degrading experience He
      couldnrsquot stand that No Japanese gentleman outraged in his exaggerated
      sense of honour could have gone about his preparations for Harakiri with
      greater resolution To go home really amounted to suicide for the poor
      Count
    p
    p
      There is a saying of Neapolitan patriotism intended for the information
      of foreigners I presume ldquoSee Naples and then dierdquo Vedi Napoli e poi
      mori It is a saying of excessive vanity and everything excessive was
      abhorrent to the nice moderation of the poor Count Yet as I was seeing
      him off at the railway station I thought he was behaving with singular
      fidelity to its conceited spirit Vedi Napoli    He had seen it He
      had seen it with startling thoroughnessmdashand now he was going to his
      grave He was going to it by the train de luxe of the International
      Sleeping Car Company via Trieste and Vienna As the four long sombre
      coaches pulled out of the station I raised my hat with the solemn feeling
      of paying the last tribute of respect to a funeral cortege Il Condersquos
      profile much aged already glided away from me in stony immobility
      behind the lighted pane of glassmdashVedi Napoli e poi mori
