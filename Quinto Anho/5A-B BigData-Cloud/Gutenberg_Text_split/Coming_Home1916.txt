I

The young men of our American Relief Corps are beginning to come back
from the front with stories

There was no time to pick them up during the first monthsthe whole
business was too wild and grim The horror has not decreased but nerves
and sight are beginning to be disciplined to it In the earlier days
moreover such fragments of experience as one got were torn from their
setting like bits of flesh scattered by shrapnel Now things that seemed
disjointed are beginning to link themselves together and the broken
bones of history are rising from the battlefields

I cant say that in this respect all the members of the Relief Corps
have made the most of their opportunity Some are unobservant or
perhaps simply inarticulate others when going beyond the bald
statistics of their job tend to drop into sentiment and cinema scenes
and none but H Macy Greer has the gift of making the thing told seem as
true as if one had seen it So it is on H Macy Greer that I depend
and when his motor dashes him back to Paris for supplies I never fail to
hunt him down and coax him to my rooms for dinner and a long cigar

Greer is a small hardmuscled youth with pleasant manners a
sallow face straight hempcoloured hair and grey eyes of unexpected
inwardness He has a voice like thick soup and speaks with the slovenly
drawl of the new generation of Americans dragging his words along like
reluctant dogs on a string and depriving his narrative of every shade
of expression that intelligent intonation gives But his eyes see so
much that they make one see even what his foggy voice obscures

Some of his tales are dark and dreadful some are unutterably sad and
some end in a huge laugh of irony I am not sure how I ought to classify
the one I have written down here




II

ON my first dash to the Northern fighting lineGreer told me the other
nightI carried supplies to an ambulance where the surgeon asked me to
have a talk with an officer who was badly wounded and fretting for news
of his people in the east of France

He was a young Frenchman a cavalry lieutenant trim and slim with a
pleasant smile and obstinate blue eyes that I liked He looked as if
he could hold on tight when it was worth his while He had had a leg
smashed poor devil in the first fighting in Flanders and had been
dragging on for weeks in the squalid camphospital where I found him He
didnt waste any words on himself but began at once about his family
They were living when the war broke out at their countryplace in
the Vosges his father and mother his sister just eighteen and his
brother Alain two years younger His father the Comte de Rchamp
had married late in life and was over seventy his mother a good deal
younger was crippled with rheumatism and there was besidesto
round off the groupa helpless but intensely alive and domineering
old grandmother about whom all the others revolved You know how French
families hang together and throw out branches that make new roots but
keep hold of the central trunk like that treewhats it calledthat
they give pictures of in books about the East

Jean de Rchampthat was my lieutenants nametold me his family was
a typical case Were very province he said My people live
at Rchamp all the year We have a house at Nancyrather a fine old
htelbut my parents go there only once in two or three years for a
few weeks Thats our seasonImagine the point of view Or rather
dont because you couldnt He had been about the world a good
deal and known something of other angles of vision

Well of this helpless exposed little knot of people he had had no
wordsimply nothingsince the first of August He was at home staying
with them at Rchamp when war broke out He was mobilised the first
day and had only time to throw his traps into a cart and dash to the
station His depot was on the other side of France and communications
with the East by mail and telegraph were completely interrupted during
the first weeks His regiment was sent at once to the fighting line
and the first news he got came to him in October from a communiqu in
a Paris paper a month old saying The enemy yesterday retook Rchamp
 After that dead silence and the poor devil left in the trenches to
digest that retook

There are thousands and thousands of just such cases and men bearing
them and cracking jokes and hitting out as hard as they can Jean
de Rchamp knew this and tried to crack jokes toobut he got his leg
smashed just afterward and ever since hed been lying on a straw pallet
under a horseblanket saying to himself Rchamp retaken

Of course he explained with a weary smile as long as you can tot
up your daily bag in the trenches its a sort of satisfactionthough
I dont quite know why anyhow youre so deadbeat at night that no
dreams come But lying here staring at the ceiling one goes through the
whole business once an hour at the least the attack the slaughter
the ruinsand worse Havent I seen and heard things enough on
this side to know whats been happening on the other Dont try to
sugar the dose I like it bitter

I was three days in the neighbourhood and I went back every day to see
him He liked to talk to me because he had a faint hope of my getting
news of his family when I returned to Paris I hadnt much myself but
there was no use telling him so Besides things change from day to day
and when we parted I promised to get word to him as soon as I could
find out anything We both knew of course that that would not be till
Rchamp was taken a third timeby his own troops and perhaps soon
after that I should be able to get there or near there and make
enquiries myself To make sure that I should forget nothing he drew
the family photographs from under his pillow and handed them over
the little witchgrandmother with a face like a withered walnut the
father a fine brokenlooking old boy with a Roman nose and a weak chin
the mother in crape simple serious and provincial the little sister
ditto and Alain the young brotherjust the age the brutes have been
carrying off to German prisonsan overgrown threadpaper boy with too
much forehead and eyes and not a muscle in his body A charminglooking
family distinguished and amiable but all except the grandmother
rather usual The kind of people who come in sets

As I pocketed the photographs I noticed that another lay face down by
his pillow Is that for me too I asked

He coloured and shook his head and I felt I had blundered But after a
moment he turned the photograph over and held it out

Its the young girl I am engaged to She was at Rchamp visiting my
parents when war was declared but she was to leave the day after I
did He hesitated There may have been some difficulty about her
going I should like to be sure she got away Her name is Yvonne
Malo

He did not offer me the photograph and I did not need it That girl had
a face of her own Dark and keen and splendid a type so different
from the others that I found myself staring If he had not said ma
fiance I should have understood better After another pause he went
on I will give you her address in Paris She has no family she lives
aloneshe is a musician Perhaps you may find her there His colour
deepened again as he added But I know nothingI have had no news of
her either

To ease the silence that followed I suggested But if she has no
family wouldnt she have been likely to stay with your people and
wouldnt that be the reason of your not hearing from her

Oh noI dont think she stayed He seemed about to add If she
could help it but shut his lips and slid the picture out of sight

As soon as I got back to Paris I made enquiries but without result
The Germans had been pushed back from that particular spot after a
fortnights intermittent occupation but their lines were close by
across the valley and Rchamp was still in a net of trenches No one
could get to it and apparently no news could come from it For the
moment at any rate I found it impossible to get in touch with the
place

My enquiries about Mlle Malo were equally unfruitful I went to the
address Rchamp had given me somewhere off in Passy among gardens in
what they call a Square no doubt because its oblong a kind of long
narrow court with aestheticlooking studio buildings round it Mlle
Malo lived in one of them on the top floor the concierge said and
I looked up and saw a big studio window and a roofterrace with dead
gourds dangling from a pergola But she wasnt there she hadnt been
there and they had no news of her I wrote to Rchamp of my double
failure he sent me back a line of thanks and after that for a long
while I heard no more of him

By the beginning of November the enemys hold had begun to loosen in the
Argonne and along the Vosges and one day we were sent off to the
East with a couple of ambulances Of course we had to have military
chauffeurs and the one attached to my ambulance happened to be a fellow
I knew The day before we started in talking over our route with him
I said I suppose we can manage to get to Rchamp now He looked
puzzledit was such a little place that hed forgotten the name Why
do you want to get there he wondered I told him and he gave an
exclamation Good God Of coursebut how extraordinary Jean de
Rchamps here now in Paris too lame for the front and driving
a motor We stared at each other and he went on He must take my
placehe must go with you I dont know how it can be done but done it
shall be

Done it was and the next morning at daylight I found Jean de Rchamp at
the wheel of my car He looked another fellow from the wreck I had left
in the Flemish hospital all made over and burning with activity but
older and with lines about his eyes He had had news from his people in
the interval and had learned that they were still at Rchamp and well
What was more surprising was that Mlle Malo was with themhad never
left Alain had been got away to England where he remained but none of
the others had budged They had fitted up an ambulance in the chteau
and Mlle Malo and the little sister were nursing the wounded There
were not many details in the letters and they had been a long time on
the way but their tone was so reassuring that Jean could give himself
up to unclouded anticipation You may fancy if he was grateful for the
chance I was giving him for of course he couldnt have seen his people
in any other way

Our permits as you know dont as a rule let us into the firingline
we only take supplies to secondline ambulances and carry back the
badly wounded in need of delicate operations So I wasnt in the least
sure we should be allowed to go to Rchampthough I had made up my mind
to get there anyhow

We were about a fortnight on the way coming and going in Champagne and
the Argonne and that gave us time to get to know each other It was
bitter cold and after our long runs over the lonely frozen hills we
used to crawl into the caf of the innif there was oneand talk and
talk We put up in fairly rough places generally in a farm house or a
cottage packed with soldiers for the villages have all remained empty
since the autumn except when troops are quartered in them Usually to
keep warm we had to go up after supper to the room we shared and
get under the blankets with our clothes on Once some jolly Sisters
of Charity took us in at their Hospice and we slept two nights in
an icecold whitewashed cellbut what tales we heard around their
kitchenfire The Sisters had stayed alone to face the Germans had seen
the town burn and had made the Teutons turn the hose on the singed
roof of their Hospice and beat the fire back from it Its a pity those
Sisters of Charity cant marry

Rchamp told me a lot in those days I dont believe he was talkative
before the war but his long weeks in hospital starving for news had
unstrung him And then he was mad with excitement at getting back to his
own place In the interval hed heard how other people caught in their
countryhouses had faredyou know the stories we all refused to believe
at first and that we now prefer not to think about Well hed been
thinking about those stories pretty steadily for some months and he
kept repeating My people say theyre all rightbut they give no
details

You see he explained there never were such helpless beings Even if
there had been time to leave they couldnt have done it My mother
had been having one of her worst attacks of rheumatismshe was in bed
helpless when I left And my grandmother who is a demon of activity in
the house wont stir out of it We havent been able to coax her into
the garden for years She says its draughty and you know how we all
feel about draughts As for my father he hasnt had to decide anything
since the Comte de Chambord refused to adopt the tricolour My father
decided that he was right and since then there has been nothing
particular for him to take a stand about But I know how he behaved just
as well as if Id been therehe kept saying One must actone
must act and sitting in his chair and doing nothing Oh Im not
disrespectful they were like that in his generation Besidesits
better to laugh at things isnt it And suddenly his face would
darken

On the whole however his spirits were good till we began to traverse
the line of ruined towns between Sainte Menehould and BarleDuc This
is the way the devils came he kept saying to me and I saw he was hard
at work picturing the work they must have done in his own neighbourhood

But since your sister writes that your people are safe

They may have made her write that to reassure me Theyd heard I was
badly wounded And mind you theres never been a line from my mother

But you say your mothers hands are so lame that she cant hold a pen
And wouldnt Mlle Malo have written you the truth

At that his frown would lift Oh yes She would despise any attempt at
concealment

Well thenwhat the deuce is the matter

Its when I see these devils traces he could only mutter

One day when we had passed through a particularly devastated little
place and had got from the cur some more than usually abominable
details of things done there Rchamp broke out to me over the
kitchenfire of our nights lodging When I hear things like that I
dont believe anybody who tells me my people are all right

But you know well enough I insisted that the Germans are not all
alikethat it all depends on the particular officer

Yes yes I know he assented with a visible effort at impartiality
Only you seeas one gets nearer He went on to say that when he
had been sent from the ambulance at the front to a hospital at Moulins
he had been for a day or two in a ward next to some wounded German
soldiersbad cases they wereand had heard them talking They didnt
know he knew German and he had heard things There was one name
always coming back in their talk von Scharlach Oberst von Scharlach
One of them a young fellow said I wish now Id cut my hand off
rather than do what he told us to that night Every time the fever
comes I see it all again I wish Id been struck dead first They all
said Scharlach with a kind of terror in their voices as if he might
hear them even there and come down on them horribly Rchamp had asked
where their regiment came from and had been told From the Vosges
That had set his brain working and whenever he saw a ruined village or
heard a tale of savagery the Scharlach nerve began to quiver At such
times it was no use reminding him that the Germans had had at least
three hundred thousand men in the East in August He simply didnt
listen




III

The day before we started for Rchamp his spirits flew up again and
that night he became confidential Youve been such a friend to me that
there are certain thingsseeing whats ahead of usthat I should like
to explain and noticing my surprise he went on I mean about my
people The state of mind in my milieu must be so remote from anything
youre used to in your happy country But perhaps I can make you
understand

I saw that what he wanted was to talk to me of the girl he was engaged
to Mlle Malo left an orphan at ten had been the ward of a neighbour
of the Rchamps a chap with an old name and a starred chteau who
had lost almost everything else at baccarat before he was forty and had
repented had the gout and studied agriculture for the rest of his life
The girls father was a rather brilliant painter who died young and
her mother who followed him in a year or two was a Pole you may fancy
that with such antecedents the girl was just the mixture to shake down
quietly into French country life with a gouty and repentant guardian
The Marquis de Corvenairethat was his namebrought her down to his
place got an old maid sister to come and stay and really as far as
one knows brought his ward up rather decently

Now and then she used to be driven over to play with the young Rchamps
and Jean remembered her as an ugly little girl in a plaid frock who
used to invent wonderful games and get tired of playing them just as the
other children were beginning to learn how But her domineering ways
and searching questions did not meet with his mothers approval and her
visits were not encouraged When she was seventeen her guardian died
and left her a little money The maiden sister had gone dotty there was
nobody to look after Yvonne and she went to Paris to an aunt broke
loose from the aunt when she came of age set up her studio travelled
painted played the violin knew lots of people and never laid eyes on
Jean de Rchamp till about a year before the war when her guardians
place was sold and she had to go down there to see about her interest
in the property

The old Rchamps heard she was coming but didnt ask her to stay
Jean drove over to the shutup chateau however and found Mlle Malo
lunching on a corner of the kitchen table She exclaimed My little
Jean flew to him with a kiss for each cheek and made him sit down and
share her omelet The ugly little girl had shed her chrysalisand
you may fancy if he went back once or twice

Mlle Malo was staying at the chateau all alone with the farmers wife
to come in and cook her dinner not a soul in the house at night but
herself and her brindled sheep dog She had to be there a week and
Jean suggested to his people to ask her to Rchamp But at Rchamp they
hesitated coughed looked away said the sparerooms were all upside
down and the valetdechambre laid up with the mumps and the cook
shorthandedtill finally the irrepressible grandmother broke out A
young girl who chooses to live aloneprobably prefers to live alone

There was a deadly silence and Jean did not raise the question again
but I can imagine his blue eyes getting obstinate

Soon after Mlle Malos return to Paris he followed her and began to
frequent the Passy studio The life there was unlike anything he had
ever seenor conceived as possible short of the prairies He had
sampled the usual varieties of French womankind and explored most
of the social layers but he had missed the newest that of the
artisticemancipated I dont know much about that set myself but from
his descriptions I should say they were a good deal like intelligent
Americans except that they dont seem to keep art and life in such
watertight compartments But his great discovery was the new girl
Apparently he had never before known any but the traditional type which
predominates in the provinces and still persists he tells me in the
last fastnesses of the Faubourg St Germain The girl who comes and goes
as she pleases reads what she likes has opinions about what she reads
who talks looks behaves with the independence of a married womanand
yet has kept the Dianafreshnessthink how she must have shaken up
such a mans inherited view of things Mlle Malo did far more than make
Rchamp fall in love with her she turned his world topsyturvey
and prevented his ever again squeezing himself into his little old
pigeonhole of prejudices

Before long they confessed their lovejust like any young couple of
AngloSaxonsand Jean went down to Rchamp to ask permission to marry
her Neither you nor I can quite enter into the state of mind of a young
man of twentyseven who has knocked about all over the globe and
been in and out of the usual sentimental coilsand who has to ask his
parents leave to get married Dont let us try its no use We should
only end by picturing him as an incorrigible ninny But there isnt a
man in France who wouldnt feel it his duty to take that step as Jean
de Rchamp did All we can do is to accept the premise and pass on

WellJean went down and asked his father and his mother and his old
grandmother if they would permit him to marry Mlle Malo and they all
with one voice said they wouldnt There was an uproar in fact and the
old grandmother contributed the most piercing note to the concert Marry
Mlle Malo A young girl who lived alone Travelled Spent her time with
foreignerswith musicians and painters A young girl Of course if
she had been a married womanthat is a widowmuch as they would have
preferred a young girl for Jean or even if widow it had to be a widow
of another typestill it was conceivable that out of affection for
him they might have resigned themselves to his choice But a young
girlbring such a young girl to Rchamp Ask them to receive her under
the same roof with their little Simone their innocent Alain

He had a bad hour of it but he held his own keeping silent while
they screamed and stiffening as they began to wobble from exhaustion
Finally he took his mother apart and tried to reason with her His
arguments were not much use but his resolution impressed her and he
saw it As for his father nobody was afraid of Monsieur de Rchamp
When he said Nevernever while I live and there is a roof on
Rchamp they all knew he had collapsed inside But the grandmother
was terrible She was terrible because she was so old and so clever
at taking advantage of it She could bring on a valvular heart attack by
just sitting still and holding her breath as Jean and his mother had
long since found out and she always treated them to one when things
werent going as she liked Madame de Rchamp promised Jean that she
would intercede with her motherinlaw but she hadnt much faith in
the result and when she came out of the old ladys room she whispered
Shes just sitting there holding her breath

The next day Jean himself advanced to the attack His grandmother was
the most intelligent member of the family and she knew he knew it and
liked him for having found it out so when he had her alone she listened
to him without resorting to any valvular tricks Of course he
explained youre much too clever not to understand that the times have
changed and manners with them and that what a woman was criticised for
doing yesterday she is ridiculed for not doing today Nearly all the
old social thoushaltnots have gone intelligent people nowadays dont
give a fig for them and that simple fact has abolished them They
only existed as long as there was some one left for them to scare His
grandmother listened with a sparkle of admiration in her ancient eyes
And of course Jean pursued that cant be the real reason for your
opposing my marriagea marriage with a young girl youve always known
who has been received here

Ah thats itweve always known her the old lady snapped him up

What of that I dont see

Of course you dont Youre here so little you dont hear things

What things

Things in the air that blow about You were doing your military
service at the time

At what time

She leaned forward and laid a warning hand on his arm Why did
Corvenaire leave her all that moneywhy

But why notwhy shouldnt he Jean stammered indignant Then she
unpacked her baga heap of vague insinuations baseless conjectures
village tattle all at the last analysis based as he succeeded
in proving and making her own on a word launched at random by a
discharged maidservant who had retailed her grievance to the cures
housekeeper Oh she does what she likes with Monsieur le Marquis the
young miss She knows how On that single phrase the neighbourhood
had raised a slander built of adamant

Well Ill give you an idea of what a determined fellow Rchamp is when
I tell you he pulled it downor thought he did He kept his temper
hunted up the servants record proved her a liar and dishonest cast
grave doubts on the discretion of the cures housekeeper and poured
such a flood of ridicule over the whole flimsy fable and those who
had believed in it that in sheer shamefacedness at having based her
objection on such grounds his grandmother gave way and brought his
parents toppling down with her

All this happened a few weeks before the war and soon afterward Mlle
Malo came down to Rchamp Jean had insisted on her coming he wanted
her presence there as his betrothed to be known to the neighbourhood
As for her she seemed delighted to come I could see from Rechamps
tone when he reached this part of his story that he rather thought I
should expect its heroine to have shown a becoming reluctanceto
have stood on her dignity He was distinctly relieved when he found I
expected no such thing

Shes simplicity itselfits her great quality Vain complications
dont exist for her because she doesnt see them thats what my
people cant be made to understand

I gathered from the last phrase that the visit had not been a complete
success and this explained his having let out when he first told me
of his fears for his family that he was sure Mlle Malo would not have
remained at Rchamp if she could help it Oh no decidedly the visit
was not a success

You see he explained with a halfembarrassed smile it was partly
her fault Other girls as clever but lesshow shall I sayless
proud would have adapted themselves arranged things avoided startling
allusions She wouldnt stoop to that she talked to my family as
naturally as she did to me You can imagine for instance the effect of
her saying One night after a supper at Montmartre I was walking home
with two or three pals It was her way of affirming her convictions
and I adored her for itbut I wished she wouldnt

And he depicted to my joy the neighbours rumbling over to call in
heraldic barouches the mothers alonewith embarrassed excuses for not
bringing their daughters and the agony of not knowing till they were
in the room if Yvonne would receive them with lowered lids and folded
hands sitting by in a pose de fiance while the elders talked or
if she would take the opportunity to air her views on the separation of
Church and State or the necessity of making divorce easier Its not
 he explained that she really takes much interest in such questions
shes much more absorbed in her music and painting But anything her
eye lights on sets her mind dancingas she said to me once Its your
mothers friends bonnets that make me stand up for divorce He broke
off abruptly to add Good God how far off all that nonsense seems




IV

The next day we started for Rchamp not sure if we could get through
but bound to anyhow It was the coldest day wed had the sky steel
the earth iron and a snowwind howling down on us from the north The
Vosges are splendid in winter In summer they are just plump puddingy
hills when the wind strips them they turn to mountains And we seemed
to have the whole country to ourselvesthe black firs the blue
shadows the beechwoods cracking and groaning like rigging the bursts
of snowy sunlight from cold clouds Not a soul in sight except the
sentinels guarding the railways muffled to the eyes or peering out
of their huts of pineboughs at the crossroads Every now and then we
passed a long string of seventyfives or a train of supply waggons or
army ambulances and at intervals a cavalryman cantered by his cloak
bellied out by the gale but of ordinary people about the common jobs of
life not a sign

The sense of loneliness and remoteness that the absence of the civil
population produces everywhere in eastern France is increased by the
fact that all the names and distances on the milestones have been
scratched out and the signposts at the crossroads thrown down It was
done presumably to throw the enemy off the track in September and the
signs have never been put back The result is that one is forever losing
ones way for the soldiers quartered in the district know only the
names of their particular villages and those on the march can tell you
nothing about the places they are passing through We had got badly
off our road several times during the trip but on the last days run
Rchamp was in his own country and knew every yard of the wayor
thought he did We had turned off the main road and were running along
between rather featureless fields and woods crossed by a good many
woodroads with nothing to distinguish them but he continued to push
ahead saying

We dont turn till we get to a manorhouse on a stream with a big
papermill across the road He went on to tell me that the millowners
lived in the manor and were old friends of his people good old local
stock who had lived there for generations and done a lot for the
neighbourhood

Its queer I dont see their villagesteeple from this rise The
village is just beyond the house How the devil could I have missed the
turn We ran on a little farther and suddenly he stopped the motor
with a jerk We were at a crossroad with a stream running under the
bank on our right The place looked like an abandoned stoneyard I never
saw completer ruin To the left a fortified gate gaped on emptiness to
the right a millwheel hung in the stream Everything else was as flat
as your dinnertable

Was this what you were trying to see from that rise I asked and I
saw a tear or two running down his face

They were the kindest people their only son got himself shot the first
month in Champagne

He had jumped out of the car and was standing staring at the level
waste The house was therethere was a splendid lime in the court I
used to sit under it and have a glass of vin cris de Lorraine with the
old people Over there where that cinderheap is all their children
are buried He walked across to the graveyard under a blackened
walla bit of the apse of the vanished churchand sat down on a
gravestone If the devils have done this hereso close to us he
burst out and covered his face

An old woman walked toward us down the road Rchamp jumped up and ran
to meet her Why Marie Jeanne what are you doing in these ruins The
old woman looked at him with unastonished eyes She seemed incapable of
any surprise They left my house standing Im glad to see Monsieur
 she simply said We followed her to the one house left in the waste of
stones It was a tworoomed cottage propped against a cowstable
but fairly decent with a curtain in the window and a cat on the sill
Rchamp caught me by the arm and pointed to the doorpanel Oberst von
Scharlach was scrawled on it He turned as white as your tablecloth
and hung on to me a minute then he spoke to the old woman The
officers were quartered here that was the reason they spared your
house

She nodded Yes I was lucky But the gentlemen must come in and have a
mouthful

Rchamps finger was on the name And this onethis was their
commanding officer

I suppose so Is it somebodys name She had evidently never
speculated on the meaning of the scrawl that had saved her

You remember himtheir captain Was his name Scharlach Rchamp
persisted

Under its rich weathering the old womans face grew as pale as his
Yes that was his nameI heard it often enough

Describe him then What was he like Tall and fair Theyre all
thatbut what else What in particular

She hesitated and then said This one wasnt fair He was dark and
had a scar that drew up the left corner of his mouth

Rchamp turned to me Its the same I heard the men describing him at
Moulins

We followed the old woman into the house and while she gave us some
bread and wine she told us about the wrecking of the village and the
factory It was one of the most damnable stories Ive heard yet Put
together the worst of the typical horrors and youll have a fair idea of
it Murder outrage torture Scharlachs programme seemed to be
fairly comprehensive She ended off by saying His orderly showed me a
silvermounted flute he always travelled with and a beautiful paintbox
mounted in silver too Before he left he sat down on my doorstep and
made a painting of the ruins

Soon after leaving this place of death we got to the second lines and
our troubles began We had to do a lot of talking to get through the
lines but what Rchamp had just seen had made him eloquent
Luckily too the ambulance doctor a charming fellow was short of
tetanusserum and I had some left and while I went over with him to
the pinebranch hut where he hid his wounded I explained Rchamps
case and implored him to get us through Finally it was settled that
we should leave the ambulance therefor in the lines the ban against
motors is absoluteand drive the remaining twelve miles A sergeant
fished out of a farmhouse a toothless old woman with a furry horse
harnessed to a twowheeled trap and we started off by roundabout
woodtracks The horse was in no hurry nor the old lady either for
there were bits of road that were pretty steadily currycombed by shell
and it was to everybodys interest not to cross them before twilight
Jean de Rchamps excitement seemed to have dropped he sat beside me
dumb as a fish staring straight ahead of him I didnt feel talkative
either for a word the doctor had let drop had left me thinking That
poor old granny mind the shells Not she he had said when our crazy
chariot drove up She doesnt know them from snowflakes any more
Nothing matters to her now except trying to outwit a German Theyre
all like that where Scharlachs beenyouve heard of him She had only
one boyhalfwitted he cocked a broomhandle at them and they burnt
him Oh shell take you to Rchamp safe enough

Where Scharlachs beenso he had been as close as this to Rchamp I
was wondering if Jean knew it and if that had sealed his lips and given
him that flinty profile The old horses woolly flanks jogged on under
the bare branches and the old womans bent back jogged in time with it
She never once spoke or looked around at us It isnt the noise we
make thatll give us away I said at last and just then the old woman
turned her head and pointed silently with the osiertwig she used as a
whip Just ahead of us lay a heap of ruins the wreck apparently of
a great chteau and its dependencies Lermont Rchamp exclaimed
turning white He made a motion to jump out and then dropped back into
the seat Whats the use he muttered He leaned forward and touched
the old womans shoulder

I hadnt heard of thiswhen did it happen

In September

They did it

Yes Our wounded were there Its like this everywhere in our country

I saw Jean stiffening himself for the next question At Rchamp too

She relapsed into indifference I havent been as far as Rchamp

But you must have seen people whod been thereyou must have heard

Ive heard the masters were still thereso there must be something
standing Maybe though she reflected theyre in the cellars

We continued to jog on through the dusk




V


Theres the steeple Rchamp burst out

Through the dimness I couldnt tell which way to look but I suppose in
the thickest midnight he would have known where he was He jumped from
the trap and took the old horse by the bridle I made out that he was
guiding us into a long village street edged by houses in which
every light was extinguished The snow on the ground sent up a pale
reflection and I began to see the gabled outline of the houses and
the steeple at the head of the street The place seemed as calm and
unchanged as if the sound of war had never reached it In the open space
at the end of the village Rchamp checked the horse

The elmtheres the old elm in front of the church he shouted in
a voice like a boys He ran back and caught me by both hands It was
true thennothings touched The old woman asked Is this Rchamp
 and he went back to the horses head and turned the trap toward a tall
gate between park walls The gate was barred and padlocked and not a
gleam showed through the shutters of the porters lodge but Rchamp
after listening a minute or two gave a low call twice repeated and
presently the lodge door opened and an old man peered out WellI
leave you to brush in the rest Old family servant tears and hugs and
so on I know you affect to scorn the cinema and this was it tremolo
and all Hang it This wars going to teach us not to be afraid of the
obvious

We piled into the trap and drove down a long avenue to the house Black
as the grave of course but in another minute the door opened and
there in the hall was another servant screening a lightand then
more doors opened on another cinemascene fine old drawingroom with
family portraits shaded lamp domestic group about the fire They
evidently thought it was the servant coming to announce dinner and
not a head turned at our approach I could see them all over Jeans
shoulder a greyhaired lady knitting with stiff fingers an old
gentleman with a high nose and a weak chin sitting in a big carved
armchair and looking more like a portrait than the portraits a pretty
girl at his feet with a dogs head in her lap and another girl who
had a Red Cross on her sleeve at the table with a book She had been
reading aloud in a rich veiled voice and broke off her last phrase
to say Dinner Then she looked up and saw Jean Her dark face
remained perfectly calm but she lifted her hand in a just perceptible
gesture of warning and instantly understanding he drew back and pushed
the servant forward in his place

Madame la Comtesseit is some one outside asking for Mademoiselle

The dark girl jumped up and ran out into the hall I remember wondering
Is it because she wants to have him to herself firstor because shes
afraid of their being startled I wished myself out of the way but she
took no notice of me and going straight to Jean flung her arms about
him I was behind him and could see her hands about his neck and
her brown fingers tightly locked There wasnt much doubt about those
two

The next minute she caught sight of me and I was being rapidly tested
by a pair of the finest eyes I ever sawI dont apply the term to their
setting though that was fine too but to the look itself a look at
once warm and resolute allpromising and allpenetrating I really
cant do with fewer adjectives

Rchamp explained me and she was full of thanks and welcome not
excessive butwell I dont knoweloquent She gave every intonation
all it could carry and without the least emphasis thats the wonder

She went back to prepare the parents as they say in melodrama and
in a minute or two we followed What struck me first was that these
insignificant and inadequate people had the command of the grand
gesturehad la ligne The mother had laid aside her knittingnot
dropped itand stood waiting with open arms But even in clasping
her son she seemed to include me in her welcome I dont know how to
describe it but they never let me feel I was in the way I suppose
thats part of what you call distinction knowing instinctively how to
deal with unusual moments

All the while I was looking about me at the fine secure old room in
which nothing seemed altered or disturbed the portraits smiling from
the walls the servants beaming in the doorwayand wondering how such
things could have survived in the trail of death and havoc we had been
following

The same thought had evidently struck Jean for he dropped his sisters
hand and turned to gaze about him too

Then nothings touchednothing I dont understand he stammered

Monsieur de Rchamp raised himself majestically from his chair
crossed the room and lifted Yvonne Malos hand to his lips Nothing is
touchedthanks to this hand and this brain

Madame de Rchamp was shining on her son through tears Ah yeswe owe
it all to Yvonne

All all Grandmamma will tell you Simone chimed in and Yvonne
brushing aside their praise with a halfimpatient laugh said to her
betrothed But your grandmother You must go up to her at once

A wonderful specimen that grandmother I was taken to see her after
dinner She sat by the fire in a bare panelled bedroom bolt upright
in an armchair with ears a knittingtable at her elbow with a shaded
candle on it

She was even more withered and ancient than she looked in her
photograph and I judge shed never been pretty but she somehow made
me feel as if Id got through with prettiness I dont know exactly what
she reminded me of a dried bouquet or something rich and clovy that
had turned brittle through long keeping in a sandalwood box I suppose
her sandalwood box had been Good Society Well I had a rare evening
with her Jean and his parents were called down to see the cur who had
hurried over to the chteau when he heard of the young mans arrival
and the old lady asked me to stay on and chat with her She related
their experiences with uncanny detachment seeming chiefly to resent
the indignity of having been made to descend into the cellarto avoid
French shells if youll believe it the Germans had the decency not to
bombard us she observed impartially I was so struck by the absence
of rancour in her tone that finally out of sheer curiosity I made
an allusion to the horror of having the enemy under ones roof Oh
I might almost say I didnt see them she returned I never go
downstairs any longer and they didnt do me the honour of coming beyond
my door A glance sufficed theman old woman like me she added with a
phosphorescent gleam of coquetry

But they searched the chteau surely Oh a mere form they were
very decentvery decent she almost snapped at me There was a first
moment of course when we feared it might be hard to get Monsieur de
Rchamp away with my young grandson but Mlle Malo managed that very
cleverly They slipped off while the officers were dining She looked
at me with the smile of some arch old lady in a Louis XV pastel My
grandson Jeans fiance is a very clever young woman in my time no
young girl would have been so sure of herself so cool and quick After
all there is something to be said for the new way of bringing up girls
My poor daughterinlaw at Yvonnes age was a bleating baby she is so
still at times The convent doesnt develop character Im glad Yvonne
was not brought up in a convent And this champion of tradition smiled
on me more intensely

Little by little I got from her the story of the German approach the
distracted fugitives pouring in from the villages north of Rchamp the
sound of distant cannonading and suddenly the next afternoon after a
reassuring lull the sight of a single spiked helmet at the end of the
drive In a few minutes a dozen followed mostly officers then all at
once the place hummed with them There were supply waggons and motors in
the court bundles of hay stacks of rifles artillerymen unharnessing
and rubbing down their horses The crowd was hot and thirsty and in a
moment the old lady to her amazement saw wine and cider being handed
about by the Rchamp servants Or so at least I was told she added
correcting herself for its not my habit to look out of the window I
simply sat here and waited Her seat as she spoke might have been a
curule chair

Downstairs it appeared Mlle Malo had instantly taken her measures
She didnt sit and wait Surprised in the garden with Simone she had
made the girl walk quietly back to the house and receive the officers
with her on the doorstep The officer in commandcaptain or whatever
he washad arrived in a bad temper cursing and swearing and growling
out menaces about spies The day was intensely hot and possibly he had
had too much wine At any rate Mlle Malo had known how to put him in
his place and when he and the other officers entered they found
the diningtable set out with refreshing drinks and cigars melons
strawberries and iced coffee The clever creature She even remembered
that they liked whipped cream with their coffee

The effect had been miraculous The captainwhat was his name Yes
Chariot ChariotCaptain Chariot had been specially complimentary on
the subject of the whipped cream and the cigars Then he asked to see
the other members of the family and Mlle Malo told him there were only
twotwo old women He made a face at that and said all the same he
should like to meet them and she answered One is your hostess the
Comtesse de Rchamp who is ill in bedfor my poor daughterinlaw
was lying in bed paralyzed with rheumatismand the other her
motherinlaw a very old lady who never leaves her room

But arent there any men in the family he had then asked and she had
said Oh yestwo The Comte de Rchamp and his son

And where are they

In England Monsieur de Rchamp went a month ago to take his son on a
trip

The officer said I was told they were here today and Mlle Malo
replied You had better have the house searched and satisfy yourself

He laughed and said The idea had occurred to me She laughed also
and sitting down at the piano struck a few chords Captain Chariot who
had his foot on the threshold turned backSimone had described the
scene to her grandmother afterward Some of the brutes it seems are
musical the old lady explained and this was one of them While he
was listening some soldiers appeared in the court carrying another who
seemed to be wounded It turned out afterward that hed been climbing a
garden wall after fruit and cut himself on the broken glass at the top
but the blood was enoughthey raised the usual dreadful outcry about
an ambush and a lieutenant clattered into the room where Mlle Malo
sat playing Stravinsky The old lady paused for her effect and I was
conscious of giving her all she wanted

Well

Will you believe it It seems she looked at her watchbracelet and said
Do you gentlemen dress for dinner I dobut weve still time for a
little Moussorgskyor whatever wild names they call themselvesif
youll make those people outside hold their tongues Our captain looked
at her again laughed gave an order that sent the lieutenant right
about and sat down beside her at the piano Imagine my stupour dear
sir the drawingroom is directly under this room and in a moment I
heard two voices coming up to me Well I wont conceal from you that
his was the finest But then I always adored a barytone She folded her
shrivelled hands among their laces After that the Germans were
trs bientrs bien They stayed two days and there was nothing to
complain of Indeed when the second detachment came a week later they
never even entered the gates Orders had been left that they should be
quartered elsewhere Of course we were lucky in happening on a man of
the world like Captain Chariot

Yes very lucky Its odd though his having a French name

Very It probably accounts for his breeding she answered placidly
and left me marvelling at the happy remoteness of old age




VI

The next morning early Jean de Rchamp came to my room I was struck
at once by the change in him he had lost his first glow and seemed
nervous and hesitating I knew what he had come for to ask me to
postpone our departure for another twentyfour hours By rights we
should have been off that morning but there had been a sharp brush a
few kilometres away and a couple of poor devils had been brought to
the chteau whom it would have been death to carry farther that day and
criminal not to hurry to a base hospital the next morning Weve simply
got to stay till tomorrow youre in luck I said laughing

He laughed back but with a frown that made me feel I had been a brute
to speak in that way of a respite due to such a cause

The men will pull through you knowtrust Mlle Malo for that I
said

His frown did not lift He went to the window and drummed on the pane

Do you see that breach in the wall down there behind the trees
Its the only scratch the place has got And think of Lennont Its
incrediblesimply incredible

But its like that everywhere isnt it Everything depends on the
officer in command

Yes thats it I suppose I havent had time to get a consecutive
account of what happened theyre all too excited Mlle Malo is the
only person who can tell me exactly how things went He swung about on
me Look here it sounds absurd what Im asking but try to get me an
hour alone with her will you

I stared at the request and he went on still halflaughing You
see they all hang on me my father and mother Simone the cur the
servants The whole village is coming up presently they want to stuff
their eyes full of me Its natural enough after living here all these
long months cut off from everything But the result is I havent said
two words to her yet

Well you shall I declared and with an easier smile he turned to
hurry down to a mass of thanksgiving which the cur was to celebrate
in the private chapel My parents wanted it he explained and after
that the whole village will be upon us But later

Later Ill effect a diversion I swear I will I assured him



By daylight decidedly Mlle Malo was less handsome than in the
evening It was my first thought as she came toward me that afternoon
under the limes Jean was still indoors with his people receiving
the village I rather wondered she hadnt stayed there with him
Theoretically her place was at his side but I knew she was a young
woman who didnt live by rule and she had already struck me as having a
distaste for superfluous expenditures of feeling

Yes she was less effective by day She looked older for one thing her
face was pinched and a little sallow and for the first time I noticed
that her cheekbones were too high Her eyes too had lost their velvet
depth fine eyes still but not unfathomable But the smile with
which she greeted me was charming it ran over her tired face like a
lamplighter kindling flames as he runs

I was looking for you she said Shall we have a little talk The
reception is sure to last another hour every one of the villagers is
going to tell just what happened to him or her when the Germans came

And youve run away from the ceremony

Im a trifle tired of hearing the same adventures retold she said
still smiling

But I thought there were no adventuresthat that was the wonder of
it

She shrugged It makes their stories a little dull at any rate weve
not a hero or a martyr to show She had strolled farther from the house
as we talked leading me in the direction of a bare horsechestnut walk
that led toward the park

Of course Jeans got to listen to it all poor boy but I neednt she
explained

I didnt know exactly what to answer and we walked on a little way in
silence then she said If youd carried him off this morning he would
have escaped all this fuss After a pause she added slowly On the
whole it might have been as well

To carry him off

Yes She stopped and looked at me I wish you would

WouldNow

Yes now as soon as you can Hes really not strong yethes drawn
and nervous So are you I thought And the excitement is greater
than you can perhaps imagine

I gave her back her look Why I think I can imagine

She coloured up through her sallow skin and then laughed away her blush
Oh I dont mean the excitement of seeing me But his parents his
grandmother the cur all the old associations

I considered for a moment then I said As a matter of fact youre
about the only person he hasnt seen

She checked a quick answer on her lips and for a moment or two we faced
each other silently A sudden sense of intimacy of complicity almost
came over me What was it that the girls silence was crying out to me

If I take him away now he wont have seen you at all I continued

She stood under the bare trees keeping her eyes on me Then take
him away now she retorted and as she spoke I saw her face change
decompose into deadly apprehension and as quickly regain its usual calm
From where she stood she faced the courtyard and glancing in the same
direction I saw the throng of villagers coming out of the chteau Take
him awaytake him away at once she passionately commanded and the
next minute Jean de Rchamp detached himself from the group and began to
limp down the walk in our direction

What was I to do I cant exaggerate the sense of urgency Mlle Malos
appeal gave me or my faith in her sincerity No one who had seen her
meeting with Rchamp the night before could have doubted her feeling for
him if she wanted him away it was not because she did not delight in
his presence Even now as he approached I saw her face veiled by
a faint mist of emotion it was like watching a fruit ripen under a
midsummer sun But she turned sharply from the house and began to walk
on

Cant you give me a hint of your reason I suggested as I followed

My reason Ive given it I suppose I looked incredulous for she
added in a lower voice I dont want him to hearyetabout all the
horrors

The horrors I thought there had been none here

All around us Her voice became a whisper Our friends our
neighbours every one

He can hardly avoid hearing of that can he And besides since youre
all safe and happy Look here I broke off hes coming after us
Dont we look as if we were running away

She turned around suddenly paler and in a stride or two Rchamp was
at our side He was pale too and before I could find a pretext for
slipping away he had begun to speak But I saw at once that he didnt
know or care if I was there

What was the name of the officer in command who was quartered here he
asked looking straight at the girl

She raised her eyebrows slightly Do you mean to say that after
listening for three hours to every inhabitant of Bchamp you havent
found that out

They all call him something different My grandmother says he had a
French name she calls him Chariot

Your grandmother was never taught German his name was the Oberst von
Scharlach She did not remember my presence either the two were still
looking straight in each others eyes

Bchamp had grown white to the lips he was rigid with the effort to
control himself

Why didnt you tell me it was Scharlach who was here he brought out
at last in a low voice

She turned her eyes in my direction I was just explaining to Mr
Greer

To Mr Greer He looked at me too halfangrily

I know the stories that are about she continued quietly and I was
saying to your friend that since we had been so happy as to be spared
it seemed useless to dwell on what has happened elsewhere

Damn what happened elsewhere I dont yet know what happened here

I put a hand on his arm Mlle Malo was looking hard at me but I
wouldnt let her see I knew it Im going to leave you to hear the
whole story now I said to Rchamp

But there isnt any story for him to hear she broke in She pointed
at the serene front of the chteau looking out across its gardens to
the unscarred fields Were safe the place is untouched Why brood on
other horrorshorrors we were powerless to help

Rchamp held his ground doggedly But the mans name is a curse and an
abomination Wherever he went he spread ruin

So they say Maynt there be a mistake Legends grow up so quickly in
these dreadful times Here she looked about her again at the peaceful
scenehere he behaved as you see For heavens sake be content with
that

Content He passed his hand across his forehead Im blind with
joyor should be if only

She looked at me entreatingly almost desperately and I took hold of
Rchamps arm with a warning pressure

My dear fellow dont you see that Mlle Malo has been under a great
strain La joie fait peurthats the trouble with both of you

He lowered his head Yes I suppose it is He took her hand And kissed
it I beg your pardon Greers right were both on edge

Yes Ill leave you for a little while if you and Mr Greer will excuse
me She included us both in a quiet look that seemed to me extremely
noble and walked slowly away toward the chteau Rchamp stood gazing
after her for a moment then he dropped down on one of benches at
the edge of the path He covered his face with his hands
ScharlachScharlach I heard him say

We sat there side by side for ten minutes or more without speaking
Finally I said Look here Rchampshes right and youre wrong I
shall be sorry I brought you here if you dont see it before its too
late

His face was still hidden but presently he dropped his hands and
answered me I do see Shes saved everything for memy people and
my house and the ground were standing on And I worship it because she
walks on it

And so do your people the wars done that for you anyhow I reminded
him




VII

The morning after we were off before dawn Our time allowance was up
and it was thought advisable on account of our wounded to slip across
the exposed bit of road in the dark

Mlle Malo was downstairs when we started pale in her white dress but
calm and active We had borrowed a farmers cart in which our two men
could be laid on a mattress and she had stocked our trap with food and
remedies Nothing seemed to have been forgotten While I was settling
the men I suppose Rchamp turned back into the hall to bid her goodbye
anyhow when she followed him out a moment later he looked quieter
and less strained He had taken leave of his parents and his sister
upstairs and Yvonne Malo stood alone in the dark driveway watching us
as we drove away

There was not much talk between us during our slow drive back to the
lines We had to go it a snails pace for the roads were rough and
there was time for meditation I knew well enough what my companion was
thinking about and my own thoughts ran on the same lines Though the
story of the German occupation of Rchamp had been retold to us a dozen
times the main facts did not vary There were little discrepancies of
detail and gaps in the narrative here and there but all the household
from the astute ancestress to the last bewildered pantryboy were
at one in saying that Mlle Malos coolness and courage had saved the
chateau and the village The officer in command had arrived full of
threats and insolence Mlle Malo had placated and disarmed him turned
his suspicions to ridicule entertained him and his comrades at dinner
and contrived during that timeor rather while they were making music
afterward which they did for half the night it seemedthat Monsieur
de Rchamp and Alain should slip out of the cellar in which they had
been hidden gain the end of the gardens through an old hidden passage
and get off in the darkness Meanwhile Simone had been safe upstairs
with her mother and grandmother and none of the officers lodged in the
chteau hadafter a first hasty inspectionset foot in any part of the
house but the wing assigned to them On the third morning they had left
and Scharlach before going had put in Mlle Malos hands a
letter requesting whatever officer should follow him to show
every consideration to the family of the Comte de Rchamp and if
possibleowing to the grave illness of the Countessavoid taking up
quarters in the chteau a request which had been scrupulously observed

Such were the amazing but undisputed facts over which Rchamp and I in
our different ways were now pondering He hardly spoke and when he did
it was only to make some casual reference to the road or to our wounded
soldiers but all the while I sat at his side I kept hearing the echo
of the question he was inwardly asking himself and hoping to God he
wouldnt put it to me

It was nearly noon when we finally reached the lines and the men had to
have a rest before we could start again but a couple of hours later we
landed them safely at the base hospital From there we had intended
to go back to Paris but as we were starting there came an unexpected
summons to another point of the front where there had been a successful
nightattack and a lot of Germans taken in a blownup trench The place
was fifty miles away and off my beat but the number of wounded on
both sides was exceptionally heavy and all the available ambulances had
already started An urgent call had come for more and there was nothing
for it but to go so we went

We found things in a bad mess at the second line shantyhospital where
they were dumping the wounded as fast as they could bring them in At
first we were told that none were fit to be carried farther that night
and after we had done what we could we went off to hunt up a shakedown
in the village But a few minutes later an orderly overtook us with a
message from the surgeon There was a German with an abdominal wound who
was in a bad way but might be saved by an operation if he could be got
back to the base before midnight

Would we take him at once and then come back for others

There is only one answer to such requests and a few minutes later we
were back at the hospital and the wounded man was being carried out on
a stretcher In the shaky lantern gleam I caught a glimpse of a livid
face and a torn uniform and saw that he was an officer and nearly done
for Rchamp had climbed to the box and seemed not to be noticing what
was going on at the back of the motor I understood that he loathed the
job and wanted not to see the face of the man we were carrying so when
we had got him settled I jumped into the ambulance beside him and called
out to Bchamp that we were ready A second later an infirmier ran
up with a little packet and pushed it into my hand His papers he
explained I pocketed them and pulled the door shut and we were off

The man lay motionless on his back conscious but desperately weak
Once I turned my pocketlamp on him and saw that he was youngabout
thirtywith damp dark hair and a thin face He had received a
fleshwound above the eyes and his forehead was bandaged but the rest
of the face uncovered As the light fell on him he lifted his eyelids
and looked at me his look was inscrutable

For half an hour or so I sat there in the dark the sense of that face
pressing close on me It was a damnable facemeanly handsome basely
proud In my one glimpse of it I had seen that the man was suffering
atrociously but as we slid along through the night he made no sound
At length the motor stopped with a violent jerk that drew a single moan
from him I turned the light on him but he lay perfectly still lips
and lids shut making no sign and I jumped out and ran round to the
front to see what had happened

The motor had stopped for lack of gasolene and was stock still in the
deep mud Rchamp muttered something about a leak in his tank As he
bent over it the lantern flame struck up into his face which was set
and businesslike It struck me vaguely that he showed no particular
surprise

Whats to be done I asked

I think I can tinker it up but weve got to have more essence to go on
with

I stared at him in despair it was a good hours walk back to the lines
and we werent so sure of getting any gasolene when we got there But
there was no help for it and as Rchamp was dead lame no alternative
but for me to go

I opened the ambulance door gave another look at the motionless man
inside and took out a remedy which I handed over to Rchamp with a word
of explanation You know how to give a hypo Keep a close eye on him
and pop this in if you see a changenot otherwise

He nodded Do you suppose hell die he asked below his breath

No I dont If we get him to the hospital before morning I think hell
pull through

Oh all right He unhooked one of the motor lanterns and handed it
over to me Ill do my best he said as I turned away

Getting back to the lines through that pitchblack forest and finding
somebody to bring the gasolene back for me was about the weariest job I
ever tackled I couldnt imagine why it wasnt daylight when we finally
got to the place where I had left the motor It seemed to me as if I had
been gone twelve hours when I finally caught sight of the grey bulk of
the car through the thinning darkness

Rchamp came forward to meet us and took hold of my arm as I was
opening the door of the car The mans dead he said

I had lifted up my pocketlamp and its light fell on Rchamps face
which was perfectly composed and seemed less gaunt and drawn than at
any time since we had started on our trip

Dead Whyhow What happened Did you give him the hypodermic I
stammered taken aback

No time to He died in a minute

How do you know he did Were you with him

Of course I was with him Rchamp retorted with a sudden harshness
which made me aware that I had grown harsh myself But I had been almost
sure the man wasnt anywhere near death when I left him I opened the
door of the ambulance and climbed in with my lantern He didnt appear
to have moved but he was dead sure enoughhad been for two or three
hours by the feel of him It must have happened not long after I
left Well Im not a doctor anyhow

I dont think Rchamp and I exchanged a word during the rest of that
run But it was my fault and not his if we didnt By the mere rub of
his sleeve against mine as we sat side by side on the motor I knew he
was conscious of no bar between us he had somehow got back in the
nights interval to a state of wholesome stolidity while I on the
contrary was tingling all over with exposed nerves

I was glad enough when we got back to the base at last and the grim
load we carried was lifted out and taken into the hospital Rchamp
waited in the courtyard beside his car lighting a cigarette in the
cold early sunlight but I followed the bearers and the surgeon into the
whitewashed room where the dead man was laid out to be undressed I had
a burning spot at the pit of my stomach while his clothes were ripped
off him and the bandages undone I couldnt take my eyes from the
surgeons face But the surgeon with a big batch of wounded on his
hands was probably thinking more of the living than the dead and
besides we were near the front and the body before him was an enemys

He finished his examination and scribbled something in a notebook
Death must have taken place nearly five hours ago he merely remarked
it was the conclusion I had already come to myself

And how about the papers the surgeon continued You have them I
suppose This way please

We left the halfstripped body on the bloodstained oilcloth and he
led me into an office where a functionary sat behind a littered desk

The papers Thank you You havent examined them Let us see then

I handed over the leather notecase I had thrust into my pocket the
evening before and saw for the first time its silveredged corners and
the coronet in one of them The official took out the papers and spread
them on the desk between us I watched him absently while he did so

Suddenly he uttered an exclamation Ahthats a haul he said and
pushed a bit of paper toward me On it was engraved the name Oberst
Graf Benno von Scharlach

A good riddance said the surgeon over my shoulder

I went back to the courtyard and saw Rchamp still smoking his cigarette
in the cold sunlight I dont suppose Id been in the hospital ten
minutes but I felt as old as Methuselah

My friend greeted me with a smile Ready for breakfast he said and
a little chill ran down my spine But I said Oh all rightcome
along

For after all I knew there wasnt a paper of any sort on that
man when he was lifted into my ambulance the night before the French
officials attend to their business too carefully for me not to have been
sure of that And there wasnt the least shred of evidence to prove that
he hadnt died of his wounds during the unlucky delay in the forest or
that Rchamp had known his tank was leaking when we started out from the
lines

I could do with a caf complet couldnt you Rchamp suggested
looking straight at me with his good blue eyes and arm in arm we
started off to hunt for the inn
