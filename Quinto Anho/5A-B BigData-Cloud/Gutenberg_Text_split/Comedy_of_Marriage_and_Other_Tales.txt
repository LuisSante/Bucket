ACT I




SCENE I

Mme de Sallus in her drawingroom seated in a corner by the
fireplace Enter Jacques de RANDOL noiselessly glances to see that no
one is looking and kisses Mme de Sallus quickly upon her hair She
starts utters a faint cry and turns upon him

MME DE SALLUS

Oh How imprudent you are

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Dont be afraid no one saw me

MME DE SALLUS

But the servants

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Oh they are in the outer hall

MME DE SALLUS

How is that No one announced you

JACQUES DE RANDOL

No they simply opened the door for me

MME DE SALLUS

But what will they think

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Well they will doubtless think that I dont count

MME DE SALLUS

But I will not permit it I must have you announced in future It does
not look well

JACQUES DE RANDOL laughs

Perhaps they will even go so far as to announce your husband

MME DE SALLUS

Jacques this jesting is out of place

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Forgive me Sits Are you waiting for anybody

MME DE SALLUS

Yesprobably You know that I always receive when I am at home

JACQUES DE RANDOL

I know that I always have the pleasure of seeing you for about five
minutesjust enough time to ask you how you feel and then some one
else comes insome one in love with you of coursewho impatiently
awaits my departure

MME DE SALLUS smiles

Well what can I do I am not your wife so how can it be otherwise

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Ah If you only were my wife

MME DE SALLUS

If I were your wife

JACQUES DE RANDOL

I would snatch you away for five or six months far from this horrible
town and keep you all to myself

MME DE SALLUS

You would soon have enough of me

JACQUES DE RANDOL

No no

MME DE SALLUS

Yes yes

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Do you know that it is absolute torture to love a woman like you

MME DE SALLUS bridles

And why

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Because I covet you as the starving covet the food they see behind the
glassy barriers of a restaurant

MME DE SALLUS

Oh Jacques

JACQUES DE RANDOL

I tell you it is true A woman of the world belongs to the world that
is to say to everyone except the man to whom she gives herself He can
see her with open doors for a quarter of an hour every three daysnot
oftener because of servants In exceptional cases with a thousand
precautions with a thousand fears with a thousand subterfuges she
visits him once or twice a month perhaps in a furnished room Then she
has just a quarter of an hour to give him because she has just left
Madame X in order to visit Madame Z where she has told her coachman to
take her If he complains she will not come again because it is
impossible for her to get rid of her coachman So you see the
coachman and the footman and Madame Z and Madame X and all the
others who visit her house as they would a museuma museum that never
closesall the hes and all the shes who eat up her leisure minute by
minute and second by second to whom she owes her time as an employee
owes his time to the State simply because she belongs to the worldall
these persons are like the transparent and impassable glass they keep
you from my love

MME DE SALLUS dryly

You seem upset today

JACQUES DE RANDOL

No no but I hunger to be alone with you You are mine are you not
Or I should say I am yours Isnt it true I spend my life in looking
for opportunities to meet you Our love is made up of chance meetings
of casual bows of stolen looks of slight touchesnothing more We
meet on the avenue in the morninga bow we meet at your house or at
that of some other acquaintancetwenty words we dine somewhere at the
same table too far from each other to talk and I dare not even look at
you because of hostile eyes Is that love We are simply acquaintances

MME DE SALLUS

Then you would like to carry me off

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Unhappily I cannot

MME DE SALLUS

Then what

JACQUES DE RANDOL

I do not know I only know this life is wearing me out

MME DE SALLUS

It is just because there are so many obstacles in the way of your love
that it does not fade

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Oh Madeline can you say that

MME DE SALLUS softening

Believe me dear if your love has to endure these hardships it is
because it is not lawful love

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Well I never met a woman as positive as you Then you think that if
chance made me your husband I should cease to love you

MME DE SALLUS

Not all at once perhaps buteventually

JACQUES DE RANDOL

What you say is revolting to me

MME DE SALLUS

Nevertheless it is quite true You know that when a confectioner hires
a greedy saleswoman he says to her Eat all the sweets you wish my
dear She stuffs herself for eight days and then she is satisfied for
the rest of her life

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Ah Indeed But why do you include me in that class

MME DE SALLUS

Really I do not knowperhaps as a joke

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Please do not mock me

MME DE SALLUS

I say to myself here is a man who is very much in love with me So far
as I am concerned I am perfectly free morally since for two years
past I have altogether ceased to please my husband Now since this man
loves me why should I not love him

JACQUES DE RANDOL

You are philosophicand cruel

MME DE SALLUS

On the contrary I have not been cruel Of what do you complain

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Stop you anger me with this continual raillery Ever since I began to
love you you have tortured me in this manner and now I do not even
know whether you have the slightest affection for me

MME DE SALLUS

Well you must admit that I have always beengoodnatured

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Oh you have played a queer little game From the day I first met you I
felt that you were coquetting with me coquetting mysteriously
obscurely coquetting as only you can without showing it to others
Little by little you conquered me with looks with smiles with
pressures of the hand without compromising yourself without pledging
yourself without revealing yourself You have been horribly
uprightand seductive I have loved you with all my soul yes
sincerely and loyally and today I do not know what feeling you have in
the depths of your heart what thoughts you have hidden in your brain
in fact I knowI know nothing I look at you and I see a woman who
seems to have chosen me and seems also to have forgotten that she has
chosen me Does she love me or is she tired of me Has she simply made
an experimenttaken a lover in order to see to know to
tastewithout desire hunger or thirst There are days when I ask
myself if among those who love you and who tell you so unceasingly there
is not one whom you really love

MME DE SALLUS

Good heavens Really there are some things into which it is not
necessary to inquire

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Oh how hard you are Your tone tells me that you do not love me

MME DE SALLUS

Now what are you complaining about Of things I do not
saybecauseI do not think you have anything else to reproach me
with

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Forgive me I am jealous

MME DE SALLUS

Of whom

JACQUES DE RANDOL

I do not know I am jealous of everything that I do not know about you

MME DE SALLUS

Yes and without my knowing anything about these things too

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Forgive me I love you too muchso much that everything disturbs me

MME DE SALLUS

Everything

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Yes everything

MME DE SALLUS

Are you jealous of my husband

JACQUES DE RANDOL amazed

What an idea

MME DE SALLUS dryly

Well you are wrong

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Always this raillery

MME DE SALLUS No I want to speak to you seriously about him and to
ask your advice

JACQUES DE RANDOL

About your husband

MME DE SALLUS seriously

Yes I am not laughing or rather I do not laugh any more In lighter
tone Then you are not jealous of my husband And yet you know he is
the only man who has authority over me

JACQUES DE RANDOL

It is just because he has authority that I am not jealous A womans
heart gives nothing to the man who has authority

MME DE SALLUS

My dear a husbands right is a positive thing it is a titledeed that
he can lock upjust as my husband has for more than two yearsbut it
is also one that he can use at any given moment as lately he has seemed
inclined to do

JACQUES DE RANDOL astonished

You tell me that your husband

MME DE SALLUS

Yes

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Impossible

MME DE SALLUS bridles

And why impossible

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Because your husband hashasother occupations

MME DE SALLUS

Well it pleases him to vary them it seems

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Jesting apart Madeline what has happened

MME DE SALLUS

Ah Ah Then you are becoming jealous of him

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Madeline I implore you tell me are you mocking me or are you
speaking seriously

MME DE SALLUS

I am speaking seriously indeed very seriously

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Then what has happened

MME DE SALLUS

Well you know my position although I have never told you all my past
life It is all very simple and very brief At the age of nineteen I
married the Count de Sallus who fell in love with me after he had seen
me at the OpraComique He already knew my fathers lawyer He was very
nice to me in those early days yes very nice and I really believed he
loved me As for myself I was very circumspect in my behavior toward
him very circumspect indeed so that he could never cast a shadow of
reproach on my name

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Well did you love him

MME DE SALLUS

Good gracious Why ask such questions

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Then you did love him

MME DE SALLUS

Yes and no If I loved him it was the love of a little fool but I
certainly never told him for positively I do not know how to show love

JACQUES DE RANDOL

I can vouch for that

MME DE SALLUS

Well it is possible that I cared for him sometimes idiotically like a
timid restless trembling awkward little girl always in fear of that
disturbing thingthe love of a manthat disturbing thing that is
sometimes so sweet As for himyou know him He was a sweetheart a
society sweetheart who are always the worst of all Such men really
have a lasting affection only for those girls who are fitting companions
for clubmengirls who have a habit of telling doubtful stories and
bestowing depraved kisses It seems to me that to attract and to hold
such people the nude and obscene are necessary both in word and in
bodyunlessunlessit is true that men are incapable of loving any
woman for a length of time

However I soon became aware that he was indifferent to me for he used
to kiss me as a matter of course and look at me without realizing my
presence and in his manners in his actions in his conversation he
showed that I attracted him no longer As soon as he came into the room
he would throw himself upon the sofa take up the newspaper read it
shrug his shoulders and when he read anything he did not agree with he
would express his annoyance audibly Finally one day he yawned and
stretched his arms in my face On that day I understood that I was no
longer loved Keenly mortified I certainly was But it hurt me so much
that I did not realize it was necessary to coquet with him in order to
retain his affection I soon learned that he had a mistress a woman of
the world Since then we have lived separate livesafter a very stormy
explanation

JACQUES DE RANDOL

What do you mean What sort of explanation

MME DE SALLUS

Well

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Abouthis mistress

MME DE SALLUS

Yes and no I find it difficult to express myself To avoid my
suspicions he found himself obliged doubtless to dissimulate from time
to time although rarely and to feign a certain affection for his
legitimate wife the woman who had the right to his affection I told
him that he might abstain in future from such a mockery of love

JACQUES DE RANDOL

How did you tell him that

MME DE SALLUS

I dont remember

JACQUES DE RANDOL

It must have been amusing

MME DE SALLUS

No he appeared very much surprised at first Then I formulated a nice
little speech and learned it by heart in which I asked him to carry
such intermittent fancies elsewhere He understood me saluted me very
courteously anddid as I asked him

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Did he never come back

MME DE SALLUS

Never until

JACQUES DE RANDOL interrupts

Has he never again tried to tell you of his love

MME DE SALLUS

No never until

JACQUES DE RANDOL interrupts

Have you regretted it

MME DE SALLUS

That is of small importance What is of importance though is that he
has had innumerable mistresses whom he entertains whom he supports
whom he takes out It is this that has irritated and humiliated mein
fact cut me to the quick But then I took heart of grace and too late
two years too late I took a loveryou

JACQUES DE RANDOL kisses her hand

And I Madeline I love you with my whole soul

MME DE SALLUS

Well all this is not at all proper

JACQUES DE RANDOL

What do you mean by all this

MME DE SALLUS

Life in generalmy husbandhis mistressesmyselfand you

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Your wordsprove beyond a doubt that you do not love me

MME DE SALLUS

Why

JACQUES DE RANDOL

You dare to say of love that it is not proper If you loved me it might
be divine but a loving woman would abhor a phrase which should contain
such an idea What True love not proper

MME DE SALLUS

Possibly It all depends upon the point of view For myself I see too
much

JACQUES DE RANDOL

What do you see

MME DE SALLUS

I see too well too far too clearly

JACQUES DE RANDOL

You do not love me

MME DE SALLUS

If I did not love youa littleI should have had no excuse for giving
myself to you

JACQUES DE RANDOL

A littlejust sufficient to warrant that excuse

MME DE SALLUS

But I do not excuse myself I accuse myself

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Then you did love me a littleand thennowyou love me no more

MME DE SALLUS

Do not let us argue

JACQUES DE RANDOL

You do nothing else

MME DE SALLUS

No I only judge the present by the past the only just ideas and sane
notions of life one can form are those concerning that which is past

JACQUES DE RANDOL

And do you regret

MME DE SALLUS

Perhaps

JACQUES DE RANDOL

And what about tomorrow

MME DE SALLUS

I do not know

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Is it nothing to you to have one who is yours body and soul MME DE
SALLUS shrugs her shoulders

Yes mine today

JACQUES DE RANDOL vehemently

And tomorrow

MME DE SALLUS shrugs her shoulders again

Yes the tomorrow that follows tonight but not the tomorrow of a
year hence

JACQUES DE RANDOL emphatically

You shall see But how about your husband

MME DE SALLUS

Does he annoy you

JACQUES DE RANDOL By heaven

MME DE SALLUS

Hush Archly My husband has fallen in love with me again

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Is it possible

MME DE SALLUS indignantly

What do you mean by such an insolent question and why should it not be
possible

JACQUES DE RANDOL

A man falls in love with his wife before he marries her but after
marriage he never commits the same mistake

MME DE SALLUS

But perhaps he has never really been in love with me until now

JACQUES DE RANDOL

It is absolutely impossible that he could have lived with youeven in
his curt cavalier fashionwithout loving you

MME DE SALLUS indifferently

It is of little importance He has either loved me in the past or is
now beginning to love me

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Truly I do not understand you Tell me all about it

MME DE SALLUS

But I have nothing to tell He declares his love for me takes me in his
arms and threatens me with his conjugal rights This upsets me
torments me and annoys me

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Madeline you torture me

MME DE SALLUS quickly

And what about me Do you think that I do not suffer I know that I am
not exactly a faithful woman since I received your addresses but I
have and shall retain a single heart It is either you or he It
will never be you and he For me that would be infamythe greatest
infamy of a guilty woman the sharing of her hearta thing that debases
her One may fall perhaps because there are ditches along the wayside
and it is not always easy to follow the right path But if one falls
that is no reason to throw oneself in the abyss

JACQUES DE RANDOL takes her in his arms and kisses her

I simply adore you

MME DE SALLUS melts

And I too love you dearly Jacques and that is the reason why I fear

JACQUES DE RANDOL

But tell me Madeline how long has it been since your husband reformed

MME DE SALLUS

Possibly fifteen days or three weeks

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Without relapse

MME DE SALLUS

Without relapse

JACQUES DE RANDOL

I will explain the mystery The fact of the matter is this your husband
has simply become a widower

MME DE SALLUS

What do you say

JACQUES DE RANDOL

I mean that your husband is unattached just now and seeks to spend his
leisure time with his wife

MME DE SALLUS

But I tell you that he is in love with me

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Yesyesand no He is in love with youand also with another Tell
me his temper is usually bad isnt it

MME DE SALLUS

Execrable

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Well then here is a man in love with you who shows his wonderful
return of tenderness by moods that are simply unsupportablefor they
are unsupportable arent they

MME DE SALLUS

Absolutely

JACQUES DE RANDOL

If he wooed you with tenderness you would not feel fear You would say
to yourself My turn has come at last and then he would inspire you
with a little pity for him for a woman has always a sneaking sort of
compassion for the man who loves her even though that man be her
husband

MME DE SALLUS

Perhaps that is true

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Is he nervous preoccupied

MME DE SALLUS

Yes

JACQUES DE RANDOL

And he is abrupt with you not to say brutal He demands his right
without even praying for it

MME DE SALLUS

True

JACQUES DE RANDOL

My darling for the moment you are simply a substitute

MME DE SALLUS

Oh no no

JACQUES DE RANDOL

My dearest girl your husbands latest mistress was Madame de Bardane
whom he left very abruptly about two months ago to run after the
Santelli

MME DE SALLUS

What the singer

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Yes a capricious saucy cunning venal little woman A woman not at
all uncommon upon the stage or in the world either for that matter

MME DE SALLUS

Then that is why he haunts the Opra

JACQUES DE RANDOL laughs

Without a doubt

MME DE SALLUS dreamily

No no you are deceiving yourself

JACQUES DE RANDOL emphatically

The Santelli resists him and repulses him then burdened with a heart
full of longing that has no outlet he deigns to offer you a portion

MME DE SALLUS

My dear you are dreaming If he were in love with the Santelli he
would not tell me that he loves me If he were so entirely preoccupied
with this creature he would not woo me If he coveted her he would not
desire me at the same time

JACQUES DE RANDOL

How little you understand certain kinds of men Men like your husband
once inoculated with the poison of lovewhich in them is nothing but
brutal desiremen like him I say when a woman they desire escapes or
resists them become raging beasts They behave like madmen like men
possessed with arms outstretched and lips wide open They must love
some one no matter whom just as a mad dog with open jaws bites anything
and everybody The Santelli has unchained this raging brute and you
find yourself face to face with his dripping jaws Take care You call
that love It is nothing but animal passion

MME DE SALLUS sarcastically

Really you are very unfair to him I am afraid jealousy is blinding
you

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Oh no I am not deceiving myself you may be sure

MME DE SALLUS

Yes I think you are Formerly my husband neglected and abandoned me
doubtless finding me very insipid but now he finds me much improved
and has returned to me It is very easy to understand and moreover it
is the worse for him for he must believe that I have been a
faithful wife to him all my life

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Madeline

MME DE SALLUS

Well what

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Does a girl cease to be a faithful wife if when deserted by the man
who has assumed charge of her existence and her happiness and her
love and her ideals she refuses to resign herselfyoung beautiful
and full of hopeto eternal isolation and everlasting solitude

MME DE SALLUS

I think I have already told you that there are certain things which it
is not necessary to discuss and this is one of them The front door
bell sounds twice Here is my husband Please be silent He is in a
gloomy mood just now

JACQUES DE RANDOL rises

I think I shall go I am not in love with your husband any more for
many reasons and it is difficult for me to be polite to him when I
despise him and when I know that he ought to despise me and would
despise me when I shake hands with him did he know all

MME DE SALLUS annoyed

How many times must I tell you that all this is entirely out of place




SCENE II

The same including M de Sallus

Enter M de Sallus evidently in a bad temper He looks for a moment
at Mme de Sallus and at Jacques de Randol who is taking his leave
then comes forward

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Ah Sallus

M DE SALLUS

How are you Randol Surely you are not going because I came

JACQUES DE RANDOL

No but my time is up I have an appointment at the club at midnight
and now it is half after eleven They shake hands Have you come
from the first performance of Mahomet

M DE SALLUS

Oh Of course

JACQUES DE RANDOL

People say that it should be a great success

M DE SALLUS

It doubtless will be

JACQUES DE RANDOL shakes hands again with De SALLUS and Madame de
Sallus

Well till I see you again

M DE SALLUS

Till then my dear fellow

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Madame adieu

MME DE SALLUS

Adieu Monsieur de Randol Exit Randol




SCENE III

M de Sallus and Mme de Sallus

M DE SALLUS sinks into an armchair

Was Randol here any length of time

MME DE SALLUS

No possibly half an hour

M DE SALLUS meditatively

Half an hour plus a whole hour makes an hour and a half does it not
Time seems to fly when you are with him

MME DE SALLUS

What do you mean by an hour and a half

M DE SALLUS

Just what I say When I saw the carriage waiting at the door I asked
the footman who was within He told me that it was M Jacques de
Randol Has he been here long I asked He has been here since ten
 said the footman Admitting that the man might have been mistaken we
will say in the matter of a quarter of an hour that would make an hour
and a quarter at the least

MME DE SALLUS

Oh ho What is this new attitude of yours Have I not a right to
receive whom I like now

M DE SALLUS

Oh my dear I deny you nothing nothing nothing The only thing that
astonishes me is that you do not know the difference between half an
hour and an hour and a half

MME DE SALLUS

Are you looking for a scene If you wish a quarrel say so I shall know
how to answer you You are simply in a bad temper Go to bed and sleep
if you can

M DE SALLUS

I am not looking for a quarrel neither am I in bad humor I only state
that time flies with you when you pass it in the company of Jacques de
Randol

MME DE SALLUS

Yes it does go quickly far more quickly than when I am with you

M DE SALLUS

He is a very charming fellow and I know you like him and moreover he
must like you very much since he comes here every day

MME DE SALLUS

These insinuations are distasteful to me Please speak plainly and say
what you mean Are you assuming the rle of a jealous husband

M DE SALLUS

God forbid I have too much confidence in you and far too much esteem
for you to reproach you with anything for I know that you have too
much tact ever to give rise to calumny or scandal

MME DE SALLUS

Do not play with words You think that M Jacques de Randol comes too
often to this houseto your house

M DE SALLUS

I do not find any fault with you for that

MME DE SALLUS

Thank you You simply have not the right However since you adopt this
attitude let us settle this question once for all for I loathe
misunderstandings It seems to me that you have an exceedingly short
memory Let me come to your aid Be frank with me Through some
occurrence the nature of which I do not know your attitude is
different today from that of the past two years Cast your memory over
the past to the time when you began to neglect me in a manner that was
plain to all I became very uneasy Then I knewI was told and I
sawthat you were in love with Madame de Servires I told you how hurt
I was how grieved I was What did you reply Just what every man
replies when he no longer loves the woman who reproaches him You
shrugged your shoulders smiled impatiently told me I was mad and then
expounded to meI must admit in a most skillful mannerthose grand
principles of freedom in love that are adopted by every husband who
deceives his wife and thinks she will not deceive him You gave me to
understand that marriage is not a bond but simply an association of
mutual interests a social rather than a moral alliance that it does
not demand friendship or affection between married couples provided
there be no scandal You did not absolutely confess the existence of
your mistresses but you pleaded extenuating circumstances You were
very sarcastic upon the subject of those poor silly women who object to
their husbands being gallant toward other women since according to
you such gallantry is one of the laws of the polished society to which
you belong You laughed at the foolish man who does not dare to pay
compliments to a woman in the presence of his own wife and ridiculed
the gloomy look of a wife whose eyes follow her husband into every
corner imagining that because the poor man disappears into an adjoining
room he is at the feet of a rival All this was very airy funny and
disagreeable wrapped up in compliments and spiced with cynicismsweet
and bitter at the same time and calculated to banish from the heart all
love for a smooth false and wellbred man who could talk in such a
manner I understood I wept I suffered and then I shut my door upon
you You made no objection you judged me better than you thought and
since then we have lived completely separate lives Such has been the
case for the past two years two long years and more which certainly
have not seemed more than six months to you We go into society as
usual we return from society as usual and we each enter our own temple
of life The situation was established by you in consequence of your
first infidelity an infidelity which has been followed by many others
I have said nothing I have resigned myself to the situation and I have
banished you from my heart Now that I have finished what do you wish

M DE SALLUS

My dear I am not asking for anything I do not even wish to answer the
very aggressive speech you have done me the honor to make I only wish
to give you advicethe advice of a friendupon a situation that may
possibly endanger your reputation You are beautiful always in the
public eye and much envied Scandal could have easy birth

MME DE SALLUS

Pardon me If we are to speak of scandal I must have leave to balance
my account with you

M DE SALLUS

Come do not let us joke over this thing I speak to you as a
friendseriously as a friend As to what you have said about me it is
all extremely exaggerated

MME DE SALLUS

Not at all You have never tried to conceal in fact you have actually
proclaimed to all the world your infidelitiesa fact which gives me the
right to go and do likewise and my friend believe what I say

M DE SALLUS

One moment

MME DE SALLUS

Let me finish According to you I am beautiful I am young and yet
condemned by my husband to live and watch him live as if I were a
widow Look at me rises is it just to consign me to play the rle
of an abandoned Ariadne while my husband runs from this woman to that
woman and this girl to that girl Grows excited A faithful wife I
cry you mercy Is a faithful wife compelled to sacrifice all her life
all her happiness all her affections everything in fact every
privilege every expectation every claim which is hers by birth and
for which she has been born Look at me Am I made for a nunnery The
fact that I married you should answer that question And yet you
you who took me from my fathers house neglect me to run after
others And what others I am not in their circle neither am I one of
those who would share your life with others So much the worse for
youfor I am free and you have no right to give me advice since I am
free

M DE SALLUS

My dear girl be calm You misunderstand me completely I have never
suspected you Indeed I have the most profound esteem and friendship
for youa loving friendship which grows greater every day I have no
wish to comment upon that past with which you reproach me so cruelly
Perhaps I am a little tootoowhat shall I say

MME DE SALLUS

Oh Say that you belong to the period of the Regency I know that method
of excusing all male weaknesses and follies Oh yes that eighteenth
century that dainty century so full of elegance so full of
delicious fantasies and adorable whims Alas my dear that is
ancient history

M DE SALLUS

No no you misunderstand me again Believe me I am and have been above
everything tootoomuch of a Parisian too much accustomed to turning
night into day for the sedate life of marriage I have been too much
accustomed to go behind the scenes of theaters to various clubs to a
thousand other forms of dissipation and you know a man cannot change
all at onceit takes time Marriage seeks to change us all too
suddenly It ought to give us time to get accustomed to it little by
little You would practically take away from me the joy of life were I
to behave as you seem to desire

MME DE SALLUS

I am so grateful and now perhaps you wish to offer me a new proofa
new proof

M DE SALLUS

Oh as you please Really when a man who has lived as I have marries
he can hardly help looking upon his wife as a new mistressI mean to
say a faithful mistressand it is only when it is too late that he
understands more clearlycomes to his senses and repents

MME DE SALLUS

Well my friend it is too late As I have already told you I mean to
have my innings I have taken nearly three years to think it over You
may think that is long but I need some amusement as well as you The
fact that I have taken nearly three years to think it over is a
compliment to you but you fail to see it

M DE SALLUS

Madeline this jesting is altogether out of place

MME DE SALLUS

Oh no because I am compelled to think that every one of your
mistresses was far more attractive than I since you have preferred them
to me

M DE SALLUS

What sort of mood are you in

MME DE SALLUS

In the same mood that I always am It is you who have changed

M DE SALLUS

True I have changed

MME DE SALLUS

And that is to say

M DE SALLUS

That I have been an idiot

MME DE SALLUS

And that

M DE SALLUS

I am sane once more

MME DE SALLUS

And that

M DE SALLUS

That I am again in love with my wife

MME DE SALLUS

You must have returned to your youth

M DE SALLUS

What do you say

MME DE SALLUS

I say that you must have returned to your youth

M DE SALLUS

What do you mean

MME DE SALLUS

Let me illustrate When you are young you are always hungry and when a
youth is hungry he often eats things that he would not eat at another
time Well I am the dishthe dish that you have neglected in your
days of plenty the dish to which you return in the days of
scarcityslowly for which I thank you

M DE SALLUS

I have never looked upon you as you think You pain me as well as
astonish me

MME DE SALLUS

So much the worse for both of us If I astonish you you repel me Learn
now once for all that I am not made for the rle of a substitute

M DE SALLUS approaches her takes her hand and presses a long kiss
upon it

Madeline I swear to you that I love you in truth devotedly now and
forever

MME DE SALLUS ironically

You must really believe it Suddenly But who is the woman that
attractsand repels youjust now

M DE SALLUS

Madeline I swear

MME DE SALLUS

Oh a truce to your swearing I know that you have just broken with one
of your mistresses you need another and you cannot find one so you
come to me For nearly three years you have forgotten all about me so
that now you find I am somewhat of a novelty It is not your wife you
are seeking now but a woman with whom you have formerly had a rupture
and with whom you now desire to make up To speak the truth you are
simply playing the game of a libertine

M DE SALLUS

I do not ask you whether you be my wife or not my wife You are the
woman I love the woman who possesses my heart You are the woman of
whom I dream whose image follows me everywhere whom I continually
desire It happens that you are my wife So much the worse or so much
the better What matters it

MME DE SALLUS

Truly it is a distinguished part that you offer me After Mademoiselle
Zozo after Mademoiselle Lilie Mademoiselle Tata you have the audacity
to offer to your wifeto Madame de Sallusthe place left vacant
asking her to become her husbands mistress for a short space of time

M DE SALLUS

No now andforever

MME DE SALLUS

Pardon me You ask that I should rebecome your wife forever That is
out of the question I have already ceased to entertain the idea The
reason may be obscure but nevertheless it is real and after all the
idea of making me your legitimate mistress seems to be far more
entertaining to you than assuming the rle of a faithful husband

M DE SALLUS laughs

Well why should not the wife become the husbands mistress You are
right in what you say you are absolutely free and I own my faults Yet
I am in love with youfor the second time if you willand I say to you
here and now Madeline since you confess that your heart is empty have
pity upon me for I tell you that I love you

MME DE SALLUS

And you ask me to give you a husbands right

M DE SALLUS

I do

MME DE SALLUS

And you acknowledge that I am free absolutely free

M DE SALLUS

I do

MME DE SALLUS

And you really wish me to become your mistress

M DE SALLUS

I do

MME DE SALLUS

You understand what I meanyour mistress

M DE SALLUS

Yes

MME DE SALLUS sarcastically

Well well I think I would rather accept another offer that I have but
since you are good enough to ask me to give you the preference I may
give it to youfor a fair sum

M DE SALLUS

What do you mean

MME DE SALLUS

Just what I say Listen Do you consider me as attractive as any of your
mistresses Now be frank with me

M DE SALLUS

A thousand times more

MME DE SALLUS

Really

M DE SALLUS

I swear it

MME DE SALLUS

What better than the best

M DE SALLUS

A thousand times

MME DE SALLUS

Well tell me now truly how much has the one you liked best among all
your numerous mistresses cost you let us sayin three months

M DE SALLUS

I cannot tell

MME DE SALLUS

Listen to me I repeat the question How much has the most charming of
your numerous mistresses cost you in the space of three monthsnot only
in money but in gifts of jewelry in dainty little suppers in
ceremonious dinners in theater boxesin everything

M DE SALLUS

How can I tell

MME DE SALLUS

You should be able to Come let us make an estimate Did you give her a
round sum or did you pay for everything separately However I know you
are not a man to bother over details so I conclude that you gave her a
round sum

M DE SALLUS

Madeline you are absolutely unbearable

MME DE SALLUS

Follow me closely When you began to neglect me you took away three
horses from our stablesone of them was mine and the other two were
yours Then you took away a coachman and a footman you then found it
necessary to make me economize at home in order that you might be
extravagant abroad

M DE SALLUS

That is not true

MME DE SALLUS

Oh yes it is I have every date do not deny it for I shall confound
you if you do You also stopped giving me jewels for of course you
had other ears other fingers other wrists and other necks to adorn
You also deprived me of one of my nights at the Opra and I do not know
how many other things less important And all this according to my
idea should mean about five thousand francs a month Am I not right

M DE SALLUS

You may be but you are mad

MME DE SALLUS

No no confess did the most expensive one of your mistresses cost you
about five thousand francs a month

M DE SALLUS

You are crazy

MME DE SALLUS

If you are going to answer me thus I bid you good evening She rises
as if to retire but M de Sallus interposes

M DE SALLUS

Come now Madeline a truce to this jesting

MME DE SALLUS in a determined manner

Five thousand francs Tell me did she cost you five thousand francs

M DE SALLUS shrugs his shoulders

Oh yes thereabouts

MME DE SALLUS looks him straight in the face

Ah ah Well listen If you will give me immediately five thousand
francs you may be my husband for a monthbut only a month

M DE SALLUS

You have lost your head

MME DE SALLUS

Well farewell good night

M DE SALLUS

What a farce Stop Madeline let us talk seriously

MME DE SALLUS

About what

M DE SALLUS

Ofofhang itof my love for you

MME DE SALLUS archly

But thats not a serious question at all

M DE SALLUS

I swear it is

MME DE SALLUS

Hypocrite You make me thirsty with so much talk Goes to a
chiffonier where there is a decanter and various liqueurs and pours
herself out a glass of water At the instant she begins to drink M de
Sallus steals up and kisses her on the back of the neck She turns with
a start and throws the glass of water in his face

M DE SALLUS

I suppose you think that funny

MME DE SALLUS

It may or may not be Certainly what you have done or tried to do was
ridiculous

M DE SALLUS

Madeline I ask

MME DE SALLUS

Fivethousandfrancs

M DE SALLUS

But that would be idiotic

MME DE SALLUS

And why

M DE SALLUS

Ask me why a husband should pay his wifehis lawful wifewhen he has
the right

MME DE SALLUS

Oh no no You may have the strength but I can have my revenge

M DE SALLUS

Madeline

MME DE SALLUS

Fivethousandfrancs

M DE SALLUS

I should be an object of ridicule forever if I were to pay my
wifeyesnot only an object of ridicule but an idiot an imbecile

MME DE SALLUS

Well dont you think it is still more imbecile when you have such a
wife as I toto go outside andpay mistresses

M DE SALLUS

Madeline I confess it but nowwe are husband and wife and it is not
necessary to ruin me is it

MME DE SALLUS

Allow me When you took your wealththe wealth which was also partly
mine by marriageto pay for your folly you committed an action that
was more than doubtful In fact it was criminal for you ruined me at
the same time you ruined yourself I use your own language I have
refrained from asking you more about the folly that is in question
moreover the five thousand francs that you must give me will be spent
upon your own house You must admit that is practical economy But I
know you I know that you are never in love with anything that is lawful
and right so in paying dearlyvery dearly because I shall probably
seek an increasefor what you have the right to take you will find
ourliaisonfar more to your taste Smiles Good night I am
going to bed

M DE SALLUS angrily

Will you take it in cash or have a cheque

MME DE SALLUS haughtily

I prefer cash

M DE SALLUS opening a pocketbook

I have only three banknotes I will give you the rest in a cheque
Writes a cheque and hands it to Mme de Sallus

MME DE SALLUS takes the cheque looks at M de Sallus with disgust
and Speaks in harsh tones

You are just the kind of man I took you to be After paying your
numerous mistresses you actually consent to pay me as if I were like
themwithout any feeling of disgust or realizing the difference in our
situation You have said that I asked too much you have pleaded the
fear of ridicule but you could not understand that you were consenting
to buy memeyour wife You wished to possess me for a little
as a sort of variation to your usual list although your heart must have
told you that it was degrading to me to be placed on such a plane You
did not recoil from such an idea but pursued it just as you pursue
them and the more eagerly because I was more expensive But you have
deceived yourself not me Not thus will you ever regain possession of
your wife Adieu Monsieur Throws the money in his face and makes a
haughty exit




ACT II




SCENE I

Madame de Sallus alone in her drawingroom as in Act I She is
writing she stops and looks at the clock A servant announces Monsieur
Jacques de Randol

JACQUES DE RANDOL after kissing Mme de Salluss hand

I trust you are well Madame

MME DE SALLUS

Oh yes thank you

Exit servant

JACQUES DE RANDOL

What is it all about Your letter has completely upset me I thought
some accident had occurred and I came immediately

MME DE SALLUS looks at him steadfastly

My dear Jacques we must decide upon some course of action immediately
The important hour has come

JACQUES DE RANDOL surprised

What do you mean

MME DE SALLUS

For two days I have undergone all the anguish that a womans heart can
endure

JACQUES DE RANDOL still more surprised

What has happened

MME DE SALLUS

I am about to tell you but I wish to do so with calmness and moderation
lest you think me mad That is the reason why I sent for you

JACQUES DE RANDOL

You know that I am yours entirely Tell me what I must do

MME DE SALLUS

I cannot live near him any longer It is absolutely impossible It is an
hourly crucifixion

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Near your husband

MME DE SALLUS

Yes my husband

JACQUES DE RANDOL

What has he done

MME DE SALLUS

It is necessary to revert to the other evening after you took your
leave When we were alone he tried to make a jealous scene with you as
the subject

JACQUES DE RANDOL

With me as the subject

MME DE SALLUS

Yes a scene which proved to me that he had been watching us

JACQUES DE RANDOL

How

MME DE SALLUS

He had been questioning a servant

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Nothing more than that

MME DE SALLUS

No That in itself however is not of much importance for I believe he
really likes you But after that he told me of his love for me
Perhaps I was a little too insolent too disdainful I do not know
exactly how far I went but I found myself in such a perplexing such a
painful such an extraordinary situation that I dared everything to
escape it

JACQUES DE RANDOL

What did you do

MME DE SALLUS

I sought to wound him so deeply that he would leave me forever

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Apparently you have not succeeded

MME DE SALLUS

No

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Of course not that method never does succeed On the contrary it often
brings about a reconciliation

MME DE SALLUS

The next day during luncheon he was sulky irritable and gloomy
Then as he was rising from the table he said I have not forgotten
your behavior of yesterday and shall not let you forget it You wish
for war let it be war but I warn you that I shall conquer you because
I am your master I answered him Be it so but if you drive me to
extremity take careit is not always safe to make a woman desperate

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Especially when that woman is his wife And what did he reply

MME DE SALLUS

He did not reply in words but he treated me brutally

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Did he strike you

MME DE SALLUS

Yes and no He jostled me he squeezed me he suffocated me I have
bruises all along my arms but he did not strike me

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Then what did he do

MME DE SALLUS

He hugged and embraced me trying to overcome my resistance

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Is that all

MME DE SALLUS

What do you mean by saying Is that all Dont you think that is
enough

JACQUES DE RANDOL

You do not understand me I only wish to know whether he struck you

MME DE SALLUS

Oh no I am not afraid of that from him but luckily I was able to ring
the bell

JACQUES DE RANDOL

You rang the bell

MME DE SALLUS

Yes

JACQUES DE RANDOL

What a thing to do Smiles And when the servant came did you ask
him to show your husband out

MME DE SALLUS pouts

You seem to find this very funny

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Oh no my dear Madame it is all exceedingly painful to me but I
cannot help realizing the grotesqueness of the situation Pardon
meand what then

MME DE SALLUS

I ordered my carriage And then as soon as Joseph had gone out my
husband said with that arrogant air which you know so well in him
Today or tomorrowit matters not which

JACQUES DE RANDOL

And

MME DE SALLUS

And that is almost all

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Almost

MME DE SALLUS

Yes because since then I have locked myself in my room as soon as I
heard him coming in

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Havent you seen him since

MME DE SALLUS

Oh yes several times but only for a few minutes each time

JACQUES DE RANDOL

What has he said to you

MME DE SALLUS

Little or nothing He either sneers or insolently asks whether I am less
savage today Last night at the table he brought out a little book
which he read during dinner As I did not wish to appear embarrassed or
anxious and desired to maintain my dignity I said Your manners
toward me are certainly exceedingly courteous He smiled and replied
What did you say It is strange that for reading you should choose
the time that we are together I said He answered Great heavens It
is all your fault since you do not care to be amiable Besides this
little book is very interesting It is the Civil Code Perhaps you would
like to become acquainted with some clauses in it They would certainly
interest you Then he read me the law concerning marriage the duties
of a wife and the rights of a husband Then he looked me full in the
face and asked me whether I understood I answered in the same tone
that I understood too muchespecially did I understand the kind of man
I had married Then I went out and I have not seen him since

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Havent you seen him today

MME DE SALLUS

No He lunched alone As for myself I have thought over the situation
and have decided not to meet him ttette any more

JACQUES DE RANDOL

But are you quite sure that at bottom his attitude is not induced by
anger by wounded vanity by disappointment and perhaps by a little
bravado Possibly he will behave himself better in future Tonight he
is at the Opra The Santelli has scored a great success in Mahomet
 and I think she has invited him to supper after the performance Now if
the supper is very much to his taste he will probably be in good humor
when he comes home

MME DE SALLUS

Oh How provoking you are Cant you understand that I am in the power
of this man that I belong to him even more than his valet or his dog
because he has those abominable legal rights over me The Code your
barbarous Code puts me entirely in his power without any possible
defense on my part save actually killing me he can do everything
Cant you understand that Cant you realize the horror of my situation
Imagine save actual murder he can do anything to me and he has the
strengthnot only physical but legalto obtain anything from me And
I I have not a single avenue of escape from a man whom I despise and
hate And that is the law made by you men He took me married me
deserted me On my part I have an absolutely moral right to leave him
And yet despite this righteous hatred this overpowering disgust this
loathing which creeps through me in the presence of the man who has
scorned me deceived me and who has fluttered right under my eyes
from girl to girlthis man I say has the right to demand from me a
shameful and infamous concession I have no right to hide myself I have
no right even to a key to my own door Everything belongs to himthe
key the door and even the woman who hates him It is monstrous Can
you imagine such a horrible situation That a woman should not be
mistress of herself should not even have the sacred right of preserving
her person from a loathsome stain And all this is the consequence of
the infamous law which you men have made

JACQUES DE RANDOL appealingly

My darling I fully understand what you must be suffering but how can I
help it No magistrate can protect you no statute can preserve you

MME DE SALLUS

I know it But when you have neither mother nor father to protect you
when the law is against you and when you shrink from complicity in
those degrading transactions to which many women yield themselves there
is always one means of escape

JACQUES DE RANDOL

And that

MME DE SALLUS

Flight

JACQUES DE RANDOL

You mean to say

MME DE SALLUS

Flight

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Alone

MME DE SALLUS

Nowith you

JACQUES DE RANDOL

With me Are you dreaming

MME DE SALLUS

No so much the better The scandal of it will prevent him from taking
me back I have gained courage now Since he forces me to dishonor I
shall see that that dishonor is complete and overwhelmingeven though
it be the worse for him and for me

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Oh Beware beware my darling You are in one of those moments of
exaltation and nervous excitement in which a woman sometimes commits a
folly that is irreparable

MME DE SALLUS

Well I would rather commit such a folly and ruin myselfif that be
ruinthan expose myself to the infamous struggle with which each day I
am threatened

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Madeline hear me You are in a terrible situation but for Gods sake
do not throw yourself into one that is irretrievable Be calm I implore
you

MME DE SALLUS

Well what do you advise

JACQUES DE RANDOL

I do not know we shall see But I do not I cannot advise you to
venture on a scandal which will put you outside the pale of society

MME DE SALLUS

Well yes there is another law an unwritten law which permits one to
have lovers even though it be shameful because sarcastically it
does not outrage society

JACQUES DE RANDOL

That is not the question The thing is to avoid taking up a wrong
position in your quarrel with your husband Have you decided to leave
him

MME DE SALLUS

Yes

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Finally and forever

MME DE SALLUS

Yes

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Do you mean for all time

MME DE SALLUS

For all time

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Well now be cautious be careful and cunning guard your reputation
and your name Make neither commotion nor scandal and await your
opportunity

MME DE SALLUS ironically

And must I continue to be very charming when he returns to me and be
ready for all his fancies

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Oh Madeline I speak to you in the truest friendship

MME DE SALLUS bitterly

In the truest friendship

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Yea as a friend who loves you far too dearly to advise you to commit
any folly

MME DE SALLUS

And loves me just enough to advise me to be complaisant to a man I
despise

JACQUES DE RANDOL

I Never never My most ardent desire is to be with you forever Get a
divorce and then if you still love me let us wed

MME DE SALLUS

Oh yes yestwo years from now Certainly you are a patient lover

JACQUES DE RANDOL

But supposing I were to carry you off he would take you back tomorrow
would shut you up in his house and would never get a divorce lest you
should become my wife

MME DE SALLUS

Well do you mean to say I could fly nowhere but to your house that I
could not hide myself in such fashion that he would never find me

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Yes you could hide yourself but it would be necessary for you to live
abroad under another name or buried in the country till death That is
the curse of our love In three months you would hate me I never will
let you commit such a folly

MME DE SALLUS

I thought you loved me enough to fly with me but it seems that I am
mistaken Adieu

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Madeline listen to me for Gods

MME DE SALLUS Jacques take me or leave meanswer

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Madeline I implore you

MME DE SALLUS

Never Adieu Rises and goes to the door

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Once more I implore you Madeline listen to me

MME DE SALLUS

Oh no no adieu De Randol takes her by the arms she frees herself
angrily Unhand me Let me go or I shall call for help

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Call if you will but listen to me I would not that you should ever be
able to reproach me for the madness that you meditate God forbid that
you should hate me but bound to me by this flight that you propose
you would carry with you forever a keen and unavailing regret that I
allowed you to do it

MME DE SALLUS

Let me go I despise you Let me go

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Well if you wish to fly why let us fly

MME DE SALLUS

Oh no not now I know you now It is too late Let me go

JACQUES DE RANDOL

I have done exactly what I ought to have done I have said exactly what
I ought to have said consequently I am no longer responsible for you
and you have no right to reproach me with the consequences So let us
fly

MME DE SALLUS

Oh no it is too late and I do not care to accept sacrifices

JACQUES DE RANDOL

There is no more any question of sacrifice To fly with you is my most
ardent desire

MME DE SALLUS astonished

You are mad

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Well suppose I am mad That is only natural since I love you

MME DE SALLUS

What do you mean

JACQUES DE RANDOL

I mean what I say I love you I have nothing else to say Let us fly

MME DE SALLUS

Ah you were altogether too cautious just now to become so brave all at
once

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Will you ever understand me Listen to me When I first realized that I
adored you I made a solemn vow concerning what might happen between you
and me The man who falls in love with a woman such as you a woman
married yet deserted a slave in fact yet morally free institutes
between her and himself a bond which only she can break The woman risks
everything Ay it is just because she does this because she gives
everythingher heart her body her soul her honor her life because
she has foreseen all the miseries all the dangers all the misfortunes
that can happen because she dares to take so bold and fearless a step
and because she is ready and determined to hazard everythinga husband
who could kill her and a world that would scorn herit is for all this
and for the heroism of her conjugal infidelity that her lover in
taking her ought to foresee all to guard her against every ill that
can possibly happen I have nothing more to say I spoke at first as a
calm and foreseeing man who wished to protect you against
everythingnow I am simply and only the man who loves you Order me as
you please

MME DE SALLUS

That is all very prettily said but is it true

JACQUES DE RANDOL

I swear it

MME DE SALLUS

You wish to fly with me

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Yes

MME DE SALLUS

From the bottom of your heart

JACQUES DE RANDOL

From the bottom of my heart

MME DE SALLUS

Today

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Yes and whenever you please

MME DE SALLUS

It is now a quarter to eight My husband will be coming in directly for
we dine at eight I shall be free at half past nine or ten oclock

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Where shall I wait for you

MME DE SALLUS

At the end of the street in a coup The bell rings There he is
and for the last time thank God




SCENE II

The same characters and M de Sallus

M DE SALLUS enters To Jacques de Randol who has risen to take his
leave

Well you are not going again are you Why it seems that I need only
come in to make you take your leave

JACQUES DE RANDOL

No no my dear fellow you dont make me go but I must

M DE SALLUS

That is just what I say You always go the very moment I come in Of
course I understand that a husband is less attractive than a wife But
at least let me believe that I am not objectionable to you
Laughs

JACQUES DE RANDOL

On the contrary my dear fellow you know I like you And if you would
acquire the habit of coming into your own house without ringing the
bell you would never find me taking my leave when you come

M DE SALLUS

How is that Is it not natural to ring the door bell

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Oh yes but a ring of the bell always makes me feel that I must go and
surely coming into your own house you can dispense with that habit

M DE SALLUS

I dont understand you

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Why it is very simple When I visit people whom I like such as Madame
de Sallus and yourself I do not expect to meet the Paris that flutters
from house to house in the evening gossiping and scandalizing I have
had my experience of gossip and tittletattle It needs only one of
these talkative dames or men to take away all the pleasure there is for
me in visiting the lady on whom I happen to have called Sometimes when
I am anchored perforce upon my seat I feel lost I do not know how to
get away I have to take part in the whirlpool of foolish chatter I
know all the set questions and answers better than I do the catechism
itself and it bores me to have to remain until the very end and hear
the very last opinion of some fool upon the comedy or the book or the
divorce or the marriage or the death that is being discussed Now do
you understand why I always get up and go at the sound of a bell

M DE SALLUS laughs

What you say is very true Drawingrooms now are not habitable from four
oclock to seven and our wives have no right to complain if we leave
them to go to the club

MME DE SALLUS sarcastically

Nevertheless I do not see my way to receiving ballet girls or chorus
girls or actresses or socalled painters poets musicians and
othersin order to keep you near me

M DE SALLUS

I do not ask so much as that All I desire is a few witty fellows some
charming women and by no means a crowd

MME DE SALLUS

You talk nonsense you cannot pick and choose

JACQUES DE RANDOL

No truly you cannot sift and strain the flow of idiocy that you meet
in the drawingrooms of today

M DE SALLUS

Why

MME DE SALLUS

Simply because it is as it istoday

M DE SALLUS

What a pity How I should love the intimacy of a small and carefully
selected circle of men and women

MME DE SALLUS

You

M DE SALLUS

Yes why not

MME DE SALLUS laughs

Ha ha ha What a charming little intimate circle you would bring to
me Ha ha ha The fascinating men and the fashionable women that you
would invite My dear sir it is I who would leave the house then

M DE SALLUS

My dear girl I only asked for three or four women like yourself

MME DE SALLUS

Pray repeat that

M DE SALLUS

Three or four such women as you

MME DE SALLUS

If you need four I can understand how you found your house lonesome

M DE SALLUS

You understand very well what I wish to say and it is not necessary for
me to explain myself And you know that you need only be alone to please
me better than I could possibly be pleased elsewhere

MME DE SALLUS

Really I do not recognize you I am afraid you must be illvery ill
You are not going to die are you

M DE SALLUS

Oh chaff me as much as you like you wont worry me

MME DE SALLUS

And is this mood of yours going to last

M DE SALLUS

Forever

MME DE SALLUS

Men often change

M DE SALLUS turns to Jacques de Randol

My dear Randol will you give us the pleasure of your company at dinner
tonight You may help me to turn aside the epigrams that my wife seems
to have barbed and ready for me

JACQUES DE RANDOL

A thousand thanks my dear Sallus You are very very good but
unfortunately I am not free

M DE SALLUS

But my dear fellow send your excuses

JACQUES DE RANDOL

I cannot

M DE SALLUS

Are you dining in town

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Yes wellnot altogether I have an appointment at nine oclock

M DE SALLUS

Is it very important

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Very important

M DE SALLUS

With a lady

JACQUES DE RANDOL

My dear fellow what a question

M DE SALLUS

Oh I am discreet But that need not prevent you from dining with us

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Thank you my dear fellow I cannot

M DE SALLUS

You know you can go away when you wish

JACQUES DE RANDOL

But I am not in evening dress

M DE SALLUS

I can easily send for your things

JACQUES DE RANDOL

No truly thank you I cannot

M DE SALLUS to Mme de Sallus

My dear girl wont you keep Randol

MME DE SALLUS

Why ask me You know that I have no influence over him

M DE SALLUS

You are charming enough to influence the world this evening so why
cant you make him stay

MME DE SALLUS

Good gracious I cannot make my friends stay in order to please you and
keep them in your house against their wish Bring your friends

MME DE SALLUS sarcastically

Good gracious How you surprise meand how you honor me

M DE SALLUS

No it is a pleasure to be with you

MME DE SALLUS

What a charming mood you are in tonight

M DE SALLUS

Now ask Randol to remain

SCENE III

M de Sallus and M Jacques de Randol

M DE SALLUS

My dear fellow you will do me the greatest service if you will pass the
whole evening here

JACQUES DE RANDOL

But I have told you that I cannot

M DE SALLUS

Is it altogetherabsolutelyimpossible

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Absolutely

M DE SALLUS

I most earnestly ask you to remain

JACQUES DE RANDOL

And why

M DE SALLUS

For the best of reasonsbecausebecause I want to make peace with my
wife

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Peace Is there a rupture between you

M DE SALLUS

Not a very great one but you know what you have seen this evening

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Is it your fault or hers

M DE SALLUS

Oh mine I suppose

JACQUES DE RANDOL

The devil

M DE SALLUS

I have had annoyances outside serious annoyances and they have made me
badtempered so much so that I have been unpleasant and aggressive in
my behavior toward her

JACQUES DE RANDOL

But I dont see how a third party can contribute toward peace between
you

M DE SALLUS

My dear fellow you will enable me to make her understand in an indirect
manner while avoiding all indelicate and wounding explanations that my
ideas concerning life have altogether changed

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Then you wish to beto bereconciled to her altogether

M DE SALLUS

Oh no no noon the contrary

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Pardon me I do not understand you

M DE SALLUS

Listen I wish to establish and maintain a status quo of a pacific
neutralitya sort of Platonic peace Laughs But I am going into
details that cannot interest you

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Pardon me again From the moment that you ask me to play a part in this
very interesting affair I must know exactly what part I am to play

M DE SALLUS

Why just a conciliatory rle

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Then you wish to conclude a peace without restrictions for yourself

M DE SALLUS

Now you have it

JACQUES DE RANDOL

That is to say that after the disappointments and annoyances of which
you have just told me and which I presume are ended you wish to have
peace at home and yet be free to enjoy any happiness that you may
acquire outside

M DE SALLUS

Let me go farther My dear fellow the present situation between my wife
and myself is very much strained and I never care to find myself alone
with her altogether because my position is a false one

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Oh in that case my dear fellow I will remain

M DE SALLUS

All the evening

JACQUES DE RANDOL

All the evening

M DE SALLUS

My dear De Randol you are indeed a friend I shall never forget it

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Oh never mind that A short silence Were you at the Opra last
night

M DE SALLUS

As usual

JACQUES DE RANDOL

So it is a good performance

M DE SALLUS

Admirable

JACQUES DE RANDOL

The Santelli scored a great success didnt she

M DE SALLUS

Not only a success but a veritable triumph She was recalled six times

JACQUES DE RANDOL

She is good isnt she

M DE SALLUS

More than admirable She never sang better In the first act she has a
long recitative O God of all believers hear my prayer which made
the body of the house rise to their feet And in the third act after
that phrase Bright heaven of beauty I never saw such enthusiasm

JACQUES DE RANDOL

She was pleased

M DE SALLUS

Pleased She was enchanted

JACQUES DE RANDOL

You know her well dont you

M DE SALLUS

Oh yes for some time back I had supper with her and some of her
friends after the performance

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Were there many of you

M DE SALLUS

No about a dozen You know she is rather particular

JACQUES DE RANDOL

It is pleasant to be intimate with her is it not

M DE SALLUS

Exquisite And then you know she is a woman in a million I do not
know whether you agree with me but I find there are so few women that
are really women

JACQUES DE RANDOL laughs

I have found that out

M DE SALLUS

Yes and you have found out that there are women who have a feminine
air but who are not women

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Explain yourself

M DE SALLUS

Good gracious Our society women with very rare exceptions are simply
pictures they are pretty they are distinguished but they charm you
only in their drawingrooms The part they play consists entirely in
making men admire their dress their dainty ways all of which are
assumed

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Men love them nevertheless

M DE SALLUS

Oh very rarely my dear fellow

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Pardon me

M DE SALLUS

Oh yes dreamers do But menreal menmen who are passionate men who
are positive men who are tender do not love the society woman of
today since she is incapable of love My dear fellow look around you
You see intrigueseveryone sees them but can you lay your finger upon
a single real love affaira love that is disinterested such a love as
there used to beinspired by a single woman of our acquaintance Dont
I speak the truth It flatters a man to have a mistressit flatters
him it amuses him and then it tires him But turn to the other picture
and look at the woman of the stage There is not one who has not at
least five or six love affairs on the carpet idiotic follies causing
bankruptcy scandal and suicides Men love them yes they love these
women because these women know how to inspire love and because they are
loving women Yes indeed they know how to conquer men they
understand the seduction of a smile they know how to attract seize
and wrap us up in their hearts how to enslave us with a look and they
need not be beautiful at that They have a conquering power that we
never find in our wives

JACQUES DE RANDOL

And the Santelli is a seductress of this kind

M DE SALLUS

She is first among the first Ah the cunning little coquette She
knows how to make men run after her

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Does she do only that

M DE SALLUS

A woman of that sort does not give herself the trouble of making men run
after her unless she has some further object in view

JACQUES DE RANDOL

The devil You make me believe you attend two first nights in the same
evening

M DE SALLUS

My dear boy dont imagine such a thing

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Great heavens you have such a satisfied and triumphant airan air so
desirous of calm at home If I am deceived I am sorryfor your sake

M DE SALLUS

Well we will assume that you are deceived and




SCENE IV

The same and Mme de Sallus

M DE SALLUS gaily

Well my dear Jacques remains He has consented for my sake

MME DE SALLUS

I congratulate you And how did you achieve that miracle

M DE SALLUS

Oh easily enough in the course of conversation

MME DE SALLUS

And of what have you been talking

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Of the happiness that comes to a man who remains quietly at home

MME DE SALLUS

That sort of happiness has but little attraction for me I like the
excitement of travel

JACQUES DE RANDOL

There is a time for everything and travel is very often inopportune and
very inconvenient

MME DE SALLUS

But how about that important appointment of yours at nine oclock Have
you given it up altogether Monsieur de Randol

JACQUES DE RANDOL

I have Madame

MME DE SALLUS

You are very changeable

JACQUES DE RANDOL

No no I am simply adapting myself to circumstances

M DE SALLUS

Will you pardon me if I write a note Sits at desk at the other end of
the drawingroom

MME DE SALLUS to Jacques de Randol

What has happened

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Oh nothing everything is all right

MME DE SALLUS

When do we go

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Not at all

MME DE SALLUS

Are you mad Why

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Please dont ask me now about it

MME DE SALLUS

I am sure that he is laying a trap for us

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Not at all He is very quiet very contented and has absolutely no
suspicion

MME DE SALLUS

Then what does it all mean

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Now be calm He is happy I tell you

MME DE SALLUS

That is not true

JACQUES DE RANDOL

I tell you it is He has made me the confidant of all his happiness

MME DE SALLUS

It is just a trick he wishes to watch us

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Oh no he is confiding and conciliatory The only fear he has is of
you

MME DE SALLUS

Of me

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Yes in the same way that you are all the time afraid of him

MME DE SALLUS

Great heavens You have lost your head You are talking at random

JACQUES DE RANDOL

ListenI am sure that he intends to go out this evening

MME DE SALLUS

Well in that case let us go out too

JACQUES DE RANDOL

No noI tell you there is nothing more for us to fear

MME DE SALLUS

What nonsense You will end by maddening me with your blindness

M DE SALLUS from the other end of the drawingroom

My dear I have some good news for you I have been able to get another
night at the Opera for you every week

MME DE SALLUS

Really it is very good of you to afford me the opportunity of
applauding Madame Santelli so often

M DE SALLUS from the same place

Well she is very clever

JACQUES DE RANDOL

And everybody says she is charming

MME DE SALLUS irritably

Yes it is only such women who please men

JACQUES DE RANDOL

You are unjust

MME DE SALLUS

Oh my dear Randol it is only for such women that men commit follies
and sarcastically understand me the measure of a mans folly is
often the measure of his love

M DE SALLUS from the same place

Oh no my dear girlmen do not marry them and marriage is the only
real folly that a man can commit with a woman

MME DE SALLUS

A beautiful idea truly when a woman has to endure all mans caprices

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Oh no not having anything to lose they have nothing to risk

MME DE SALLUS

Ah men are sad creatures They marry a young girl because she is demure
and selfcontained and they leave her on the morrow to dangle after a
girl who is not young and who certainly is not demure her chief
attraction being that all the rich and wellknown men about town have at
one time been in her favor The more danglers she has after her the
more she is esteemed the more she is sought after and the more she is
respected that is to say with that kind of Parisian respect which
accrues to a woman in the degree of her notorietya notoriety due
either to the scandal she creates or the scandal men create about her
Ah yes you men are so nice in these things

M DE SALLUS laughs gently

Take care One would think you were jealous

MME DE SALLUS

I Jealous For whom do you take me The butler announces Madame is
served Hands a letter to M de Sallus

MME DE SALLUS to Jacques de Randol

Your arm M Jacques de Randol

JACQUES DE RANDOL in a low tone

How I love you

MME DE SALLUS indifferently

Just a little I suppose

JACQUES DE RANDOL

Ah no with all my soul

M DE SALLUS after reading his letter

Come along then let us go to dinner I have to go out this evening

ACT I




SCENE I

A richly yet classically furnished drawingroom in M de Petitprs
house A table C sofas R chairs and armchairs L Wide
doors C opening upon a terrace or gallery Doors R and L of
C Lighted lamps

Enter from R M de Petitpr Monsieur Martinel Madame de Ronchard
Lon de Petitpr Jean and Gilberte Gilberte is in her bridal

MME DE RONCHARD after bowing to M Martinel whose arm she
relinquishes seats herself R

Gilberte Gilberte

GILBERTE leaves Jeans arm

What is it Auntie

MME DE RONCHARD

The coffee my dear child

GILBERTE goes to the table

I will give you some Auntie

MME DE RONCHARD

Dont soil your gown

LON comes up

No no not today shall my sister serve coffee The day of her
marriage No indeed I will take care of that To Mme de Ronchard
You know that I am a lawyer my dear Aunt and therefore can do
everything

MME DE RONCHARD

Oh I know your abilities Lon and I appreciate them

LON smiles and gives his Aunt a cup of coffee

You are too good

MME DE RONCHARD taking cup dryly

For what they are worth

LON aside turns to the table

There she goes againanother little slap at me That is never wanting
offers a cup to Martinel You will take a small cup wont you M
Martinel and a nip of old brandy with it I know your tastes We will
take good care of you

MARTINEL

Thank you Lon

LON to Petitpr

Will you have a cup father

PETITPR

I will my son

LON to the newly married couple seated L and talking aside

And you you bridal pair there The couple absorbed in each other do
not answer Oh I suppose we must not bother you He sets cup down
on the table

PETITPR to Martinel

You dont smoke I believe

MARTINEL

Never thank you

MME DE RONCHARD

You astonish me My brother and Lon would not miss smoking each day for
anything in the world But what an abomination a cigar is

PETITPR

A delicious abomination Clarisse

LON turns to Mme de Ronchard

Almost all abominations are delicious Auntie in fact many of them to
my personal knowledge are exquisite

MME DE RONCHARD

You naughty fellow

PETITPR takes Lons arm

Come and smoke in the billiardroom since your aunt objects to it here

LON to Petitpr

The day when she will love anything except her spaniels

PETITPR

Hold your tongue and come along Exit C

MARTINEL to Mme de Ronchard

This is the sort of marriage that I likea marriage that in this Paris
of yours you dont have very often After the wedding breakfast which
takes place directly after you come from the church all the guests go
home even the maids of honor and the ushers The married couple remain
at home and dine with their parents or relatives In the evening they
play billiards or cards just as on an ordinary night the newly married
couple entertain each other Gilberte and Jean rise and hand in
hand slowly retire C Then before midnight good night

MME DE RONCHARD aside

Which is altogether very bourgeois

MARTINEL sits R upon the sofa beside Mme de Ronchard

As to newly married couplesinstead of going on that absurd and
traditional thing you call a honeymoon it is far better for them to go
at once to the apartment or house prepared for them I dare say you will
think my plan lacking in fashion and display but I cannot help that
For myself I must say that I like absence of all ostentation

MME DE RONCHARD

Your plan is not according to the customs of polite society Monsieur

MARTINEL

Polite society indeed Why there are thirtysix different kinds of
polite society For instance take Havre

MME DE RONCHARD interrupts

I know only ours Corrects herself That is I mean to say mine
which is the correct one

MARTINEL

Oh naturally naturally Nevertheless simple as it may be this
marriage is an acknowledged fact and I hope that you have taken into
your good books my dear nephew who until now

MME DE RONCHARD

I can hardly help doing so since he is my brothers soninlaw and my
nieces husband

MARTINEL

Well that is not the only thing is it I am very happy that the affair
is overalthough my life has been spent in the midst of difficulties

MME DE RONCHARD

What Your life

MARTINEL

I mean commercial difficulties not matrimonial

MME DE RONCHARD

What commercial difficulties can you haveyou a Croesus who has just
given five hundred thousand francs in dowry to his nephew With a
sigh Five hundred thousand francs Just what my late husband
squandered

MARTINEL

Oh Yes I know that Madame de Ronchard

MME DE RONCHARD sighs again

I was ruined and deserted after just one year of married life
Monsieurone year I just had time to realize how happy I could be for
the scoundrel the wretch knew how to make me love him

MARTINEL

Then he was a scoundrel

MME DE RONCHARD

Oh Monsieur he was a man of fashion

MARTINEL

Well that did not prevent him from

MME DE RONCHARD

Oh dont let us talk any more about my misfortunes It would be too
long and too sad and everybody else is so happy here just now

MARTINEL

And I am happier than anybody else I assure you My nephew is such a
good fellow I love him as I would a son Now as for myself I made my
fortune in trade

MME DE RONCHARD aside

That is very evident

MARTINEL resumes

In the seagoing trade But my nephew will gain fame for our name by his
renown as an artist the only difference between us is that he makes his
fortune with his brushes and I have made mine with ships Art today
Madame may be as important as trade but it is less profitable Take my
nephew Although he has made a very early success it is I who have
enabled him to When my poor brother died his wife following him almost
immediately I found myself while quite a young man left alone with
this baby Well I made him learn everything that I could He studied
chemistry music and literature but he had a leaning toward art more
than to the other things I assure you that I encouraged him in it and
you see how he has succeeded He is only just thirty is well known and
has just been decorated

MME DE RONCHARD dryly

Thirty years old and only just decorated that is slow for an artist

MARTINEL

Pshaw He will make up for lost time Rises But I am afraid I am
getting boastful You must pardon me I am a plain man and just now a
little exhilarated by dining It is all Petitprs fault His Burgundy
is excellent It is a wine that you may say is a friend to wisdom And
we are accustomed to drink a good deal at Havre Takes up his glass of
brandy and finishes it

MME DE RONCHARD aside

Surely that is enough about Havre

MARTINEL turns to Mme de Ronchard

Well there is a treaty between usa treaty which will lastwhich no
foolishness can break such as that which has failed to break this
marriage

MME DE RONCHARD rises and crosses L

Foolishness You speak very lightly about it But now that the marriage
is a thing accomplished it is all right I had destined my niece for
another sphere than a painters world However when you cant get a
thrush eat a blackbird as the proverb says

MARTINEL

But a white blackbird Madame for your niece is a pearl Let me tell
you the happiness of these children will be the happiness of my
declining years

MME DE RONCHARD

I wish that it may be Monsieur without daring to hope for it

MARTINEL

Never mind There are two things on which I am an expertthe merits of
women and of wine

MME DE RONCHARD aside

Especially upon the latter

MARTINEL

They are the only two things worth knowing in life




SCENE II

The same characters and Petitpr who enters C with Lon

PETITPR

Now that this redletter day has gone by as any other day goes will you
play a game of billiards with me Monsieur Martinel

MARTINEL

Most certainly I am very fond of billiards

LON comes down stage

You are like my father It seems to me that when anyone begins to like
billiards at all they become infatuated with the game and you two
people are two of a kind

MARTINEL

My son when a man grows old and has no family he has to take refuge
in such pleasures as these If you take baitfishing as your diversion
in the morning and billiards for the afternoon and evening you have two
kinds of amusement that are both worthy and attractive

LON

Oh ho Baitfishing indeed That means to say getting up early and
sitting with your feet in the water through wind and rain in the hope of
catching perhaps each quarter of an hour a fish about the size of a
match And you call that an attractive pastime

MARTINEL

I do without a doubt But do you believe that there is a single lover
in the world capable of doing as much for his mistress throughout ten
twelve or fifteen years of life If you asked my opinion I think he
would give it up at the end of a fortnight

MME DE RONCHARD

Of a truth he would

LON interrupts

Pardon me I should give it up at the end of a week

MARTINEL

You speak sensibly

PETITPR

Come along my dear fellow

MARTINEL

Shall we play fifty up

PETITPR

Fifty up will do

MARTINEL turns to Mme de Ronchard

We shall see you again shortly Madame

MME DE RONCHARD

Well I have had enough of Havre for the present

Exit Martinel and Petitpr C




SCENE III

Leon and Mme de Ronchard

LON

Martinel is a good fellow Not a man of culture but bright as sunshine
and straight as a rule

MME DE RONCHARD seated L

He is lacking in distinction of manner

LON inadvertently

How about yourself Aunt

MME DE RONCHARD

What do you mean

LON corrects himself and approaches Mme de Ronchard

I said how about yourself You know what I meanyou have such an
intimate knowledge of the world that you are a better judge of human
nature than anyone I know

MME DE RONCHARD

Indeed I am You were too small a boy to recollect it but
nevertheless I went a great deal into society before my husband spent
all my money and let me tell you that I was a great success For
instance at a grand ball given by the Turkish ambassador at which I
was dressed as Salammb

LON interrupts

What you the Carthaginian princess

MME DE RONCHARD

Certainly Why not Let me tell you that I was greatly admired for my
appearance was exquisite My dear that was in eighteen hundred and
sixty

LON sits near Mme de Ronchard

Oh no dates for goodness sake no dates

MME DE RONCHARD

It is not necessary to be sarcastic

LON

What I sarcastic God forbid It is simply this in view of the fact
that you did not wish this marriage to take place and that I did and
that the marriage has taken place I feel very happy Do you understand
me It is a triumph for me and I must confess that I feel very
triumphant this evening Tomorrow however vanish the triumpher and
there will remain only your affectionate little nephew Come smile
Auntie At heart you are not as illnatured as you pretend to be and
that is proved by the generosity of soul you have evinced in founding at
Neuilly despite your modest means a hospital forlost dogs

MME DE RONCHARD

What else could I do When a woman is alone and has no childrenand I
was married such a short timedo you know what I am after all Simply
an old maid and like all old maids

LON finishes the sentence for her

You love toy dogs

MME DE RONCHARD

As much as I hate men

LON

You mean to say one man Well I could hardly blame you for hating him

MME DE RONCHARD

And you know for what kind of girl he abandoned and ruined me You never
saw her did you

LON

Pardon me I did see her once in the ChampsElyses I was walking with
you and my father A gentleman and lady came toward us you became
excited quickened your steps and clutched nervously at my fathers
arm and I heard you say in a low voice Dont look at them it is
she

MME DE RONCHARD

And what were you doing

LON

II was looking at him

MME DE RONCHARD rises

And you thought her horrible didnt you

LON

I really dont know You know I was only eleven years old

MME DE RONCHARD crosses R

You are insufferable Go away or I shall strike you

LON soothingly and rising

There there Aunt I wont do it again I will be good I promise you
if you will forgive me

MME DE RONCHARD rises as if to go out C

I will not

LON

Please do

MME DE RONCHARD returns

I will not If it were simply a case of teasing me I could let it pass
for I can take care of myself but you have done your sister a wrong
and that is unforgivable

LON

How

MME DE RONCHARD stands R of table and drums on it with her
fingers

Why this marriage You brought it about

LON imitates her action at L of table

That is true and I did right Moreover I shall never be tired
asserting that what I did was right

MME DE RONCHARD still tapping on the table

And for my part I shall never be tired of saying that Gilberte has not
married the right man

LON still tapping

Well what kind of man do you think Gilberte ought to have married

MME DE RONCHARD

A man of position a public official or an eminent physician oran
engineer

LON

Do you mean a theatrical engineer

MME DE RONCHARD

There are other kinds of engineers Then above all she should not have
married a handsome man

LON

Do you reproach Jean for his good looks If you do my dear Aunt there
are a good many men in the world who must plead guilty Suppose even
that a man has no need of good looks it does not follow that he ought
to be ugly

MME DE RONCHARD sits on a little stool by the table clasps her
hands and looks upward

My husband was handsome nay superb a veritable guardsmanand I know
how much it cost me

LON

It might have cost you a great deal more if he had been ugly Mme de
Ronchard rises to go away Besides Jean is not only goodlooking but
he is good He is not vain but modest and he has genius which is
manifesting itself more and more every day He will certainly attain
membership in the Institute That would please you would it not That
would be worth more than a simple engineer and moreover every woman
finds him charming except you

MME DE RONCHARD

Thats the very thing for which I blame him He is too good and too
honest He has already painted the portraits of a crowd of women and he
will continue to do that They will be alone with him in his studio for
hours at a time and everybody knows what goes on in those studios

LON

You have been accustomed to go there my dear Aunt

MME DE RONCHARD dreamily

Oh yes Corrects herself I mean to say once I went to Horace
Vernets studio

LON

The painter of battle scenes

MME DE RONCHARD

Well what I say of Jean I say of all artiststhat they ought not to
be allowed to marry into a family of lawyers and magistrates such as
ours Such doings always bring trouble I ask you as a man is it
possible to be a good husband under such conditionsamong a crowd of
women continually around you who do nothing but unrobe and redress
themselves whether they be clients or models pointedly especially
models Mme de Ronchard rises and Lon is silent I said
models Lon

LON

I understand you Aunt You make a very pointed and delicate allusion to
Jeans past Well what of it If he did have one of his models for a
mistress he loved her and loved her sincerely for three years

MME DE RONCHARD

You mean to tell me a man can love such women

LON

Every woman can be loved my dear Aunt and this woman certainly
deserved to be loved more than most women

MME DE RONCHARD

A great thing truly for a model to be pretty That is the essential
thing I should think

LON

Whether it be essential or not it is nevertheless very nice to be
pretty But this girl was better than pretty for she had a nature which
was exceptionally tender good and sincere

MME DE RONCHARD

Well then why did he leave her

LON

What Can you ask me such a questionyou who know so much about the
world and the worlds opinions Folds his arms Would you advocate
free love

MME DE RONCHARD indignantly

You know I would not

LON seriously

Listen The truth is that it happened to Jean as it has happened to
many others besides himthat is to say there was a pretty little
nineteenyearold girl whom he met whom he loved and with whom he
established an intimacy little by littlean intimacy which lasted one
two three yearsthe usual duration of that sort of thing Then as
usually happens there came a rupturea rupture which is sometimes
violent sometimes gentle but which is never altogether goodnatured
Then also as usual in such cases each went a separate waythe eternal
ending which is always prosaic because it is true to life But the one
thing that distinguishes Jeans liaison from the usual affair is the
truly admirable character of the girl in the case

MME DE RONCHARD

Oh admirable character Mademoiselletell me what is the name of this
young lady If you mentioned it I have forgotten it Mademoiselle
MusMus

LON

Musotte Auntie little Musotte

MME DE RONCHARD

Musette Pshaw thats a very common name It reminds me of the Latin
quarter and of Bohemian life With disgust Musette

LON

No no not Musette Musotte with an O instead of an E She is named
Musotte because of her pretty little nose cant you understand
Musotte the name explains itself

MME DE RONCHARD with contempt

Oh yes a findesicle Musotte which is still worse Musotte is not
a name

LON

My dear Aunt it is only a nickname The nickname of a model Her true
name is Henriette Lvque


MME DE RONCHARD puzzled

Lvque

LON

Yes Lvque What does this questioning mean It is just as I told you
or else I know nothing about it Now Henriette Lvque or Musotte if
you prefer that term has not only been faithful to Jean during the
course of her love affair with him has not only been devoted and
adoring and full of a tenderness which was ever watchful but at the
very hour of her rupture with him she gave proof of her greatness of
soul She accepted everything without reproach without recrimination
the poor little girl understood everythingunderstood that all was
finished and finished forever With the intuition of a woman she felt
that Jeans love for my sister was real and deep she bowed her head to
circumstances and she departed accepting without a murmur the
loneliness that Jeans action brought upon her She carried her fidelity
to the end for she would have slain herself sooner than become
hesitating out of respect for Mme de Ronchard a courtesan And this
I know

MME DE RONCHARD

And has Jean never seen her since

LON

Not once and that is more than eight months ago He wished for news of
her and he gave me the task of getting it I never found her and I have
never been able to gain any knowledge of her so cunningly did she
arrange this flight of hersthis flight which was so noble and so
selfsacrificing Changing his tone But I dont know why I repeat
all this You know it just as well as I do for I have told it to you a
dozen times

MME DE RONCHARD

It is just as incredible at the twentieth time as at the first

LON

It is nevertheless the truth

MME DE RONCHARD sarcastically

Well if it is really the truth you were terribly wrong in helping Jean
to break his connection with such an admirable woman

LON

Oh no Aunt I only did my duty You have even called me hairbrained
and perhaps you were right but you know that I can be very serious when
I wish If this threeyearold liaison had lasted until now Jean
would have been ruined

MME DE RONCHARD

Well how could we help that

LON

Well these things are frightfulthese entanglementsI cant help
using the word It was my duty as a friendand I wish to impress it
upon youto rescue Jean and as a brother it was my duty to marry my
sister to such a man as he The future will tell you whether I was right
or not Coaxingly And then my dear Aunt when later you have a
little nephew or a little niece to take care of to dandle in your arms
you will banish all these little spaniels that you are taking care of at
Neuilly

MME DE RONCHARD

The poor little darlings I abandon them Dont you know that I love
them as a mother loves her children

LON

Oh yes you can become an aunt to them then because you will have to
become a mother to your little nephew

MME DE RONCHARD

Oh hold your tongue you irritate me Jean appears with Gilberte
for a moment at C

JEAN to servant entering R

Joseph have you forgotten nothing especially the flowers

SERVANT

Monsieur and Madame may rest assured that everything has been done

Exit servant L

LON to Mme de Ronchard

Look at them arent they a bonny couple




SCENE IV

The same with Jean and Gilberte

JEAN approaches Mme de Ronchard and speaks to her

Do you know of whom we were talking just now We were talking of you

LON aside

Ahem ahem

JEAN

Yes I was just saying that I had not made you a present on the occasion
of my nuptials because the choosing of it demanded a great deal of
reflection

MME DE RONCHARD dryly

But Gilberte made me a very pretty one for you both Monsieur

JEAN

But that is not enough I have been looking for something which I
thought would be particularly acceptable to you and do you know what I
found It is a very small thing but I ask you Madame to be so good as
to accept this little pocketbook which holds some banknotes for the
benefit of your dear little deserted pets You can add to your home for
these little pets some additional kennels on the sole condition that you
will allow me from time to time to come and pet your little pensioners
and on the additional condition that you will not pick out the most
vicious among them to greet me

MME DE RONCHARD greatly impressed

With all my heart I thank you How good of you to think of my poor
little orphans

LON whispers to Jean

You diplomat you

JEAN

There is nothing extraordinary about it Madame I am very fond of dumb
animals They are really the fosterbrothers of man sacrificed for
them slaves to them and in many cases their food They are the true
martyrs of the world

MME DE RONCHARD

What you say is very true Monsieur and I have often thought of it in
that way For instance take those poor horses scourged and beaten by
coachmen in the streets

LON with sarcastic emphasis

And the pheasants Auntie and the partridges and the blackcock falling
on all sides under a hail of lead flying panicstricken before the
horrible massacre of the guns

MME DE RONCHARD

Oh dont talk like that it makes me shudder it is horrible

JEAN turns to Gilberte

Horrible indeed

LON after a pause in light tone

Perhaps so but they are good eating

MME DE RONCHARD

You are pitiless

LON aside to his aunt

Pitiless perhaps toward animals but not pitiless like you toward
people

MME DE RONCHARD in the same tone

What do you mean by that

LON in the same tone pointing to Jean and Gilberte who are
seated on a sofa R

Do you think that your presence here can be acceptable to those two
lovers Takes her arm My father has certainly finished smoking
come into the billiardroom for a little while

MME DE RONCHARD

And what are you going to do

LON

I am going down into my study on the ground floor and I shall come up
here after a little while

MME DE RONCHARD sarcastically

Your study indeedyour studioyou mean you rascal where your
clients aremodels

LON with mock modesty

Oh Auntie My clients at least dont unrobealas Exit Lon R
giving a mock benediction to the lovers Children receive my
benediction

Exit Madame de Ronchard C




SCENE V

Jean and Gilberte seated on the sofa at right

JEAN

At last you are my wife Mademoiselle

GILBERTE

Mademoiselle

JEAN

Forgive me I hardly know how to address you

GILBERTE

Call me Gilberte There is nothing shocking about that is there

JEAN

Gilberte at last at last at last you are my wife

GILBERTE

And truly not without a good deal of trouble

JEAN

And what a dainty energetic little creature you are How you fought
with your father and with your aunt for it is only through you and
thanks to you that we are married for which I thank you with all my
heartthe heart which belongs to you

GILBERTE

But it is only because I trusted you and that is all

JEAN

And have you only trust for me

GILBERTE

Stupid boy You know that you pleased me If you had only pleased me my
confidence in you would have been useless One must love first Without
that Monsieur nothing can come

JEAN

Call me Jean just as I have called you Gilberte

GILBERTE hesitates

But that is not altogether the same thing It seems to methatthatI
cannot do it Rises and crosses L

JEAN rises

But I love you I am no trifler believe me I love you I am the man
who loves you because he has found in you qualities that are
inestimable You are one of those perfect creatures who have as much
brains as sentiment and the sentimentality that permeates you is not
the sickly sentimentality of ordinary women It is that gloriously
beautiful faculty of tenderness which characterizes great souls and
which one never meets elsewhere in the world And then you are so
beautiful so graceful with a grace that is all your own and I who am
a painter you know how I adore the beautiful Then above everything
you drew me to you but not only that you wiped out the traces of the
world from my mind and eyes

GILBERTE

I like to hear you say that But dont talk any more just now in that
way because it embarrasses me However I know for I try to foresee
everything that to enjoy these things I must listen to them today for
your words breathe the passion of a lover Perhaps in the future your
words will be as sweet for they could not help being so when a man
speaks as you spoke and loves as you appear to love but at the same
time they will be different

JEAN

Oh

GILBERTE sits on stool near the table

Tell me it over again

JEAN

What drew me to you was the mysterious harmony between your natural form
and the soul within it Do you recollect my first visit to this house

GILBERTE

Oh yes very well My brother brought you to dinner and I believe that
you did not wish to come

JEAN laughs

If that were true it was very indiscreet of your brother to tell you
And he told you that I am annoyed that he did so and I confess I did
hesitate somewhat for you know I was an artist accustomed to the
society of artists which is lively witty and sometimes rather free
and I felt somewhat disturbed at the idea of entering a house so serious
as yoursa house peopled by dignified lawyers and young ladies But I
was so fond of your brother I found him so full of novelty so gay so
wittily sarcastic and discerning under his assumed levity that not
only did I go everywhere with him but I followed him to the extent of
meeting you And I never cease to thank him for it Do you remember when
I entered the drawingroom where you and your family were sitting you
were arranging in a china vase some flowers that had just been sent to
you

GILBERTE

I do

JEAN

Your father spoke to me of my Uncle Martinel whom he had formerly
known This at once formed a link between us for all the time that I
was talking to him I was watching you arrange your flowers

GILBERTE smiles

You looked far too long and too steadfastly for a first introduction

JEAN

I was looking at you as an artist looks and was admiring you for I
found your figure your movements and your entire self attractive And
then for the last six months I have often come to this house to which
your brother invited me and whither your presence attracted me and
finally I felt your sway as a lover feels the sway of the one he adores
There was an inexplicable unseen attraction calling me to you Sits
beside her R of table Then a dim idea entered my brainan idea
that one day you might become my wife It gained possession of my soul
and I immediately took steps to renew the friendship between your father
and my uncle The two men again became friends Did you never divine my
maneuvers

GILBERTE

Divine your maneuvers No I suspected a little at times but I was so
astounded that a man like youin the full flush of success so well
known so sought aftershould concern himself with such a little
unimportant girl as I that really I could place no faith in the
sincerity of your attention

JEAN

Nevertheless we quickly knew how to understand each other did we not

GILBERTE

Your character pleased me I felt that you were loyal and then you
entertained me greatly for you brought into our house that artistic air
which gave my fancies life I ought to tell you that my brother had
already warned me that I should like you You know that Lon loves you

JEAN

I know it and I think it was in his brain that the first idea of our
marriage had birth After a short silence You remember our return
from SaintGermain after we had dined in the Henri IV Pavilion

GILBERTE

I remember it well

JEAN

My uncle and your aunt were in the front of the landau and you and I on
the rear seat and in another carriage were your father and Lon What a
glorious spring night But how coldly you treated me

GILBERTE

I was so embarrassed

JEAN

You ought to recall that I put to you that day a question which I had
already asked you because you cannot deny that I had paid you very
tender attention and that you had captured my heart

GILBERTE

True Nevertheless it surprised and upset me Oh how often have I
remembered it since But I have never been able to recall the very words
you used Do you remember them

JEAN

No they came from my lips issuing from the bottom of my heart like a
prayer for mercy I only know that I told you that I should never
reenter your house if you did not give me some little hope that there
should be a day when you would know me better You pondered a long time
before you answered me but you spoke in such a low tone that I was
anxious to make you repeat it

GILBERTE takes up his sentence and speaks as if in a dream

I said that it would pain me greatly if I should see you no more

JEAN

Yes that is what you said

GILBERTE

You have forgotten nothing

JEAN

Could anyone forget that With deep emotion Do you know what I
think As we look at each other and examine our hearts our souls our
mutual understanding our love I verily believe that we have set out on
the true road to happiness Kisses her For a moment they are
silent

GILBERTE rises

But I must leave you Goes toward door L I must prepare for our
journey Meanwhile go and find my father

JEAN follows her

Yes but tell me before you go that you love me

GILBERTE

YesI love you

JEAN kisses her forehead

My only one

Exit Gilberte L a second after Enter M Martinel C with a very
agitated air and a letter in his hand

MARTINEL perceives Jean quickly slips the letter into his pocket
then recollecting himself

Have you seen Lon

JEAN

No are you looking for him

MARTINEL

No no I have just a word to say to him concerning an engagement of
small importance

JEAN perceives Lon

Wait a moment Here he comes

Enter Lon R Exit Jean C




SCENE VI

Martinel and Lon

MARTINEL goes quickly up to Lon

I must have five minutes with you Something terrible has happened
Never in the course of my life have I been placed in so awkward and so
embarrassing a situation

LON

Quick What is it

MARTINEL

I had just finished my game at billiards when a servant brought me a
letter addressed to M Martinel without any Christian name by which to
identify it but with these words on the letter Exceedingly urgent I
thought it was addressed to me so I tore open the envelope and I read
words intended for Jeanwords which have wellnigh taken away my
reason I came to find you in order to ask advice for this is a thing
which must be decided upon the moment

LON

Tell me what is it

MARTINEL

I am responsible for my own actions M Lon and I would ask advice of
no one if the matter concerned myself only but unfortunately it
concerns Jean therefore I hesitatethe matter is so grave and then
the secret is not mineI came upon it accidentally

LON

Tell me quickly and do not doubt my faith

MARTINEL

I do not doubt your faith Here is the letter It is from Dr Pellerin
who is Jeans physician who is his friend our friend a good fellow a
free liver and a physician to many women of the world and one who
would not write such things unless necessity compelled him Hands the
letter to Lon who holds it close to his eyes

LON reads

MY DEAR FRIEND

I am more than annoyed at having to communicate with you upon this
evening above every other evening upon such a subject as this But I
am sure that if I did otherwise you would never forgive me Your former
mistress Henriette Lvque is dying and would bid you farewell
Throws a glance at Martinel who signs to him to continue She will
not live through the night She dies after bringing into the world some
fifteen days ago a child who on her deathbed she swears is yours So
long as she was in no danger she determined to leave you in ignorance
of this childs existence But today doomed to death she calls to
you I know how you have loved her in the past But you must do as you
think fit She lives in the Rue Chaptal at Number  Let me know how I
can serve you my dear fellow and believe me

Always yours

PELLERIN


MARTINEL

There you are That letter came this evening That is to say at the one
moment above all others when such a misfortune could threaten the whole
futurethe whole life of your sister and of Jean What would you do if
you were I Would you keep this confounded letter or would you give it
to him If I keep it we may save appearances but such an act would be
unworthy of me

LON energetically

I should say so You must give the letter to Jean

MARTINEL

Well what will he do

LON

He alone is the judge of his own actions We have no right to hide
anything from him

MARTINEL

Supposing he consults me

LON

He will not do it In such situations a man consults only his
conscience

MARTINEL

But he treats me like a father If he hesitates a moment between his
attention to his wife and the effacement of his happiness what shall I
tell him to do

LON

Just what you would do yourself in like case

MARTINEL

My impulse would be to go to the woman What would be yours

LON resolutely

I should go

MARTINEL

But how about your sister

LON sadly seating himself by the table

Yes my poor little sister What an awakening for her

MARTINEL after a few seconds hesitation crosses abruptly from L
to R

No it is too hard a thing to do I shall not give him this letter I
shall be blamed perhaps but so much the worse In any case I save him

LON

You cannot do such a thing sir We both know my sister poor little
girl and I am sure that if this marriage is annulled she will die
Rises When a man has for three years enjoyed the love of such a
woman as the one who sends for him he cannot refuse to see her on her
deathbed whatever may happen


MARTINEL

What will Gilberte do

LON

She worships Jeanbut you know how proud she is

MARTINEL

Will she accept the situation Will she forgive it

LON

Of that I am very doubtful especially after all that has been said
about this poor girl in the family circle But what does that matter
Jean must be warned at once I am going to find him and bring him to
you Rises as if to go out C

MARTINEL

Well how would you like me to tell him

LON Simply give him the letter Exit Lon C




SCENE VII

MARTINEL alone

Poor children in the midst of their happiness and at the zenith of joy
And that other poor girl who is now suffering and slowly dying
Heavens How unjust and how cruel life is at times




SCENE VIII

Reenter Lon with Jean

JEAN walks briskly to C of stage

What is it all about

MARTINEL

One minute my poor boy read this and forgive me for having opened
your letter I opened it because I thought it was intended for me
Gives letter to Jean and watches him read it Lon also watches
him standing L

JEAN after reading the letter speaks to himself in a low tone
touched with deep but contained emotion

I must do it I owe it to her To Martinel Uncle I leave my wife
in your charge Say nothing until I return and remain here till I come
back Wait for me Turns to Lon I know you well enough to realize
that you do not disapprove of what I am doing To you I confide my
future I am going Turns to the door R but after casting a glance
at the door L which leads to his wifes chamber says to Lon To
you I owe the love your sister has bestowed upon me Help me now to
preserve it

Exit quickly R




SCENE IX

Martinel and Lon

MARTINEL seated R

What shall we do now What are we going to say What explanations can we
give

LON

Let me manage it It is only right that I should do it since I brought
about this marriage

MARTINEL rises

Well Id dearly love to be fortyeight hours older Rising I
confess I do not like these love tragedies and moreover the fact of the
child entering into the case is awful What is going to become of that
poor little mortal We cannot send him to the foundling asylum Enter
Gilberte L Gilberte




SCENE X

Gilberte has removed her marriage robes and now wears a handsome house
gown She carries an opera cloak which she throws over a chair neat the
door

GILBERTE

Where is Jean

LON

Do not be disturbed he will be back directly

GILBERTE in astonishment

Has he gone out

LON

Yes

GILBERTE

Gone out And on this evening above all others

LON

A sudden and grave circumstance compelled him to go out for an hour

GILBERTE excitedly

What is going on What is it that you are hiding from me Your story is
impossible Some awful misfortune must have happened

LON AND MARTINEL together

Oh no no

GILBERTE

Then what is it Tell me Speak

LON

I cannot tell you anything Be patient for an hour It is Jeans duty to
tell you of the sudden and unexpected call which has summoned him hence
at such a time

GILBERTE

What curious words you use A sudden and unexpected call He is an
orphanhis uncle is his only relativethen what Who Why Oh God
how you frighten me

LON

There are duties of many kinds my dear friendship pity sympathy can
impose many of them But I must not say any more Be patient for an
hour I implore you

GILBERTE to Martinel

And you Uncle Speak I implore you What is he doing Where has he
gone I feeloh I feel the shadow of a terrible misfortune hovering
over us speak I entreat

MARTINEL with tears in his eyes

But I cannot tell you any more my dear child I cannot Like your
brother I promised to say nothing and I would have done just as Jean
has done Wait for an hour I beseech youjust an hour

GILBERTE

And you too are upset It must be a catastrophe

MARTINEL

No no The fact that you are so distressed agitates me because you
know I love you with my whole heart Embraces her

GILBERTE to Lon

You have spoken of friendship of pity and of sympathy but if it were
any of these reasons you could tell me so meanwhile as I look at you
two I feel that here is some unspoken reason some mystery which
appalls me

LON resolutely

My dear little sister wont you trust in me

GILBERTE

Yes you ought to know all

LON

Will you trust me absolutely

GILBERTE

Absolutely

LON

I swear to you on my faith as a gentleman that I would have done just
as Jean has done that his absolute fidelity to you his fidelity which
perhaps is even exaggerated by love for you is the only reason which
had led him to forget at this very moment the very thing that he has
gone to learn anew

GILBERTE looks Lon straight in the eyes

I believe you Lon and I thank you Nevertheless I tremble yet and I
shall tremble until he returns If you swear to me that my husband was
entirely ignorant of the cause which has made him leave me at this
supreme moment I will content myself as well as I can trusting in you
two She stretches both hands to the two men




SCENE XI

The same with M de Petitpr and Mme de Ronchard who enters
quickly C

PETITPR

What is this I hear Jean Martinel gone out

MARTINEL

He is coming back very soon sir

PETITPR

But why on earth did he go out on such an evening as this without a word
of explanation to his wife Turns to Gilberte You know nothing about
it do you

GILBERTE seated L of table

Father I know nothing at all about it

MME DE RONCHARD

And without a word of explanation to the family That is indeed a lack
of courtesy

PETITPR to Martinel

And why has he acted in this way sir

MARTINEL

Your son knows as much as I do sir but neither of us can reveal it to
you Moreover your daughter has consented to wait until she can learn
all about it from her husband on his return

PETITPR

My daughter has consentedbut I do not consent Besides it seems that
you alone were forewarned of this sudden departure

MME DE RONCHARD in agitation to Martinel

It was to you they brought the letter and you were the one who read it
first

MARTINEL

You are correctly informed Madame a letter was delivered here but I
would not shoulder the responsibility of this matter and I showed the
letter to your son sir turns to Petitpr and asked his advice with
the intention of following it

LON

The advice that I gave is exactly what my brotherinlaw has done of his
own volition and I esteem him all the more for it

PETITPR turns to Lon

It is I who should have been consulted not you If Jeans action is
indeed excusable his want of courtesy is absolutely unpardonable

MME DE RONCHARD

It is scandalous

LON to M Petitpr

Yes it would have been better to consult you but the urgency of the
matter did not allow it You would have discussed the matter my aunt
would have discussed the matter we should all have discussed the matter
the whole night long and you know there are times when one cannot
afford to lose even seconds Silence was necessary until Jeans return
When he does return he will hide nothing from you and I feel sure that
you will judge him as I myself have judged him

MME DE RONCHARD turns to Martinel

But this letter from whom did it come

MARTINEL

Oh I can tell you that It came from a physician

MME DE RONCHARD

From a physiciana physicianthen he must have a sick patientand it
is on account of this patient that he made Jean come to him But who is
the patient Oh ho I surmise that it is a womanthat womanhis
former mistress who has played this card today Sick I suppose she has
made a pretense of poisoning herself in order to show him that she loves
him still and will always love him Oh the little wretch To Lon
This is the kind of people you stand up for Yes you

LON

It would be only reasonable my dear Aunt not to air all these
revolting theories of yours in Gilbertes presence especially when you
really know nothing at all

GILBERTE rises

Do not speak any more about it I pray you Everything that I have heard
just now distresses me beyond measure I will wait for my husband I do
not wish to know anything except from his lips as I have absolute
confidence in him If misfortune has threatened us I will not hear such
things talked of Exit L accompanied by Petitpr Short
silence

MME DE RONCHARD turns to Lon

Well Lon do you always win You see what charming fellows these
husbands areevery one of them




ACT II




SCENE I

Musottes bedroom neatly furnished but without luxury Disordered bed
stands L A screen stands L I E almost hiding Musotte who
lies stretched at length upon a steamerchair Beside the bed is a
cradle the head of which is turned up stage On the mantelpiece and on
small tables at R and L are vials of medicine cups chafingdish
etc A table stands R I E Musotte is sleeping La Babin and
Mme Flache stand C looking at her

LA BABIN in low tones

How she sleeps

MME FLACHE in the same voice

But she will not sleep long now unless she is going into her last
sleep

LA BABIN

Oh there is no chance of that That is enough to give one the horrors
Fancy losing ones life for a child

MME FLACHE

But how can you prevent it Death is as necessary as birth or the world
would become too small for us all

LA BABIN sits R of table

All people ought to die in the same way and at the same ageevery one
of us then one would know what to expect

MME FLACHE pours out some tea

What simple ideas you have Madame Babin Personally I would rather not
know the hour of my death I would sooner finish my life while sleeping
in the middle of the nightduring slumberwithout sufferingby a
sudden failure of the heart

LA BABIN

Look at the sick woman How silly of her to wish to rest upon that
steamerchair as she has done The doctor told her plainly that such an
effort would probably finish her

MME FLACHE sits L of table

Oh I understand her motive When a girl like her has a lover she
commits every kind of folly and more especially nurse when they are
at all coquettish but you country people do not know anything about
such things They are coquettish through and through That is the reason
she wished to look her prettiest She was afraid of being thought ugly
dont you understand So I had to put on her peignoir and tidy her
up and arrange her hair just as I have done

LA BABIN

Oh these Parisians It is necessary that they should have a hairdresser
even to the last gasp A short silence But will this gentleman of
hers come

MME FLACHE

I do not think so Men are not overfond of obeying the calls of their
former mistresses at such times and then this lover of hers was
married today poor fellow

LA BABIN

Well that is a joke

MME FLACHE

I should say so

LA BABIN

Certainly then he wont come In such a case would you go to see a
man

MME FLACHE

Oh if I loved him very much I should go

LA BABIN

Even if you were marrying another the same day

MME FLACHE

Just the same For such a combination of circumstances would pierce my
heart would penetrate me with a strong emotionand oh I am so fond
of such emotions

LA BABIN

Well so far as I am concerned I certainly would not go I should be
too much afraid of the shock

MME FLACHE

But Doctor Pellerin asserts that the man will come

LA BABIN

Do you know this physician well

MME FLACHE

Who Doctor Pellerin

LA BABIN

Yes he has the air of a charming man of the world

MME FLACHE

Oh yes he is all that but he is also a good physician Then he is
such good company and has such a smooth tongue And you know he is not
physician to the Opera for nothing

LA BABIN

That little puppy of a

MME FLACHE

A puppy You dont very often find puppies among men of his caliber and
thenoh how he used to love the girls Oh oh Although for the
matter of that there are many physicians who are like him It was at
the Opera that I first met him

LA BABIN

At the Opera

MME FLACHE

Yes at the Opera You know I was a dancer there for eight years Yes
indeed even Ijust as you see me a dancer at the Opera

LA BABIN

You Madame Flache

MME FLACHE

Yes my mother was a midwife and taught me the business at the same
time that she taught me dancing because she always said it was well to
have two strings to your bow Dancing you see is all very well
provided you are not too ambitious of appearing on first nights but
unhappily that was the case with me I was as slender as a thread when
I was twenty and very agile but I grew fat and scant of breath and
became rather heavy in my steps so when my mother died as I had my
diploma as a midwife I took her apartment and her business and I added
the title of Midwife to the Opera for all their business comes to me
They like me very much there When I was dancing they used to call me
Mademoiselle Flacchi the premire

LA BABIN

Then you have been married since then

MME FLACHE

No but a woman in my profession should always assume the title of
Madame for the sake of its dignity You know it gives confidence But
how about you nurse from what place do you come You know you have
only just come here and nobody consulted me about engaging you

LA BABIN

I am from Yvetot

MME FLACHE

Is this your first engagement as a nurse

LA BABIN

No my third I have had two daughters and a little boy

MME FLACHE

And your husband is he a farmer or a gardener

LA BABIN Simply

I am not married

MME FLACHE laughing

Not married and with three children Upon my word let me compliment
you you are indeed precocious

LA BABIN

Dont talk about it it was not my will It is the good God who does
these things One cannot prevent it

MME FLACHE

How simple you are Now you will probably have a fourth child

LA BABIN

Thats very possible

MME FLACHE

Well what does your lover do What is his business Or perhaps you have
more than one

LA BABIN with indignation

There has never been more than one I give you my word upon my hope of
salvation He is a lemonadeseller at Yvetot

MME FLACHE

Is he a handsome fellow

LA BABIN

I believe you indeed He is handsome Confidentially If I tell you
all this it is only because you are a midwife and a midwife in such
affairs as this is like a priest in the confessional But you Madame
Flache you who have been a dancer at the Opera you must also have
had surelylittle love affairslittle intrigues

MME FLACHE evidently flattered and in a dreamy tone

Oh yes one or two

LA BABIN laughs

And have you never hadthis sort of accident Points to the cradle

MME FLACHE

No

LA BABIN

How did that come

MME FLACHE rises and approaches the mantelpiece

Probably because I was a midwife

LA BABIN

Well I know one in your profession who has had five

MME FLACHE with contempt

She evidently did not come from Paris

LA BABIN

Thats true she came from Courbevoie

MUSOTTE in a feeble voice Is no one there

MME FLACHE

She is awakening There there Folds up the screen which hides the
long steamerchair

MUSOTTE

Hasnt he come yet

MME FLACHE

No

MUSOTTE

He will arrive too latemy God My God

MME FLACHE

What an idea He will come

MUSOTTE

And my little darlingmy child

MME FLACHE

He is sleeping like an angel

MUSOTTE after looking at herself in a handmirror

I must not look like this when he comes Oh God Bring my childI want
to see him

MME FLACHE

But if I show him to you he will wake up and who knows if he will go to
sleep again

MUSOTTE

Bring the cradle here A gesture of refusal from Mme Flache Yes
yes I insist Mme Flache and the nurse gently bring the cradle to
her Nearer nearer so that I can see him wellthe darling My
child my child And I am going to leave him Soon I shall disappear
into the unknown Oh God what agony

MME FLACHE

Now dont go worrying yourself like that you are not as ill as you
think I have seen lots worse than you Come come you are going to
recover Take away the cradle nurse They put the cradle again in its
place then to the nurse That will do that will do Watch me You
know very well that it is only I who can quiet it Sits near the
cradle and sings a lullaby while rocking it

  A little gray fowl
  Came into the barn
  To lay a big egg
  For the good boy that sleeps
  Go to sleep go to sleep
  My little chicken
  Go to sleep sleep my chick

LA BABIN stands near the end of the mantelpiece drinks the sugared
water and slips loaf sugar into her pocket aside

I must not forget the main thing I have just seen in the kitchen the
remains of a leg of mutton to which I should like to go and say a few
words I am breaking in two with hunger just now

MME FLACHE sings softly

  A little black fowl
  Came into the room
  To lay a big egg
  For the good boy that sleeps
  Sleep sleep my little chicken
  Sleep oh sleep my chick

MUSOTTE from the long chair after moaning several times

Has he gone to sleep again

MME FLACHE goes toward Musotte

Yes Mademoiselle just as if he were a little Jesus Do you wish to
know what I think about him this young man lying here You will lead
him to the altar for his marriage He is a jewel like yourself my
dear

MUSOTTE

Do you really think him pretty

MME FLACHE

On the honor of a midwife I have seldom brought into the world one so
pretty It is a pleasure to know that one has brought to the light such
a little Cupid as he is

MUSOTTE

And to think that in a few hours perhaps I shall see him no more look
at him no more love him no more

MME FLACHE

Oh no no You are talking unreasonably

MUSOTTE

Ah I know it too well I heard you talking with the nurse I know that
the end is very near this night perhaps Would the doctor have written
to Jean to come and see me on this eveningthe evening of his
marriageif I were not at the point of death The bell rings
Musotte utters a cry Ah there he is it is he Quick quick Oh
God how I suffer Exit Mme Flache C Musotte gazes after her
Enter Dr Pellerin in evening clothes




SCENE II

MUSOTTE despairingly

Ah it is not he

PELLERIN approaches Musotte

Has he not come yet

MUSOTTE

He will not come

DR PELLERIN

He will I am certain of it I know it

MUSOTTE

No

DR PELLERIN

I swear it Turns toward Mme Flache Hasnt he answered the note
yet

MME FLACHE

No Doctor

DR PELLERIN

Well he will come How is my patient

MME FLACHE

She has rested a little

MUSOTTE in an agitated voice

All is over I feel that I shall not rest any more until he comes or
until I depart without having seen him

DR PELLERIN

He will come if you will go to sleep immediately and sleep until
tomorrow morning

MUSOTTE

You would not have written to him to come this evening if I had been
able to wait until tomorrow morning The bell rings If that is not
he I am lostlost Mme Flache runs to open the door Musotte
listens intently and hears from below a mans voice then murmurs
despairingly It is not he

MME FLACHE reenters with a vial in her hand

It is the medicine from the chemist

MUSOTTE agitated

Oh God how horrible He is not coming what have I done Doctor show
me my child I will see him once more

DR PELLERIN

But he sleeps my little Musotte

MUSOTTE

Well he has plenty of time in the future for sleep

DR PELLERIN

Come come calm yourself

MUSOTTE

If Jean does not come who will take care of my childfor it is Jeans
child I swear to you Do you believe me Oh how I loved him

DR PELLERIN

Yes my dear little child we believe you But please be calm

MUSOTTE with increasing agitation

Tell me when you went away just now where did you go

DR PELLERIN

To see a patient

MUSOTTE

That is not true You went to see Jean and he would not come with you
or he would be here now

DR PELLERIN

On my word of honor no

MUSOTTE

Yes I feel it You have seen him and you do not dare to tell me for
fear it would kill me

DR PELLERIN

Ah the fever is coming back again This must not go on I dont wish
you to be delirious when he comes Turns to Mme Flache We must
give her a hypodermic injection Give me the morphia Mme Flache
brings the needle and morphia from the mantelpiece and gives it to
Dr Pellerin

MUSOTTE uncovers her own arm

But for this relief I do not know how I should have borne up during the
last few days Dr Pellerin administers the hypodermic

DR PELLERIN

Now you must go to sleep I forbid you to speak I wont answer you
and I tell you of a certainty that in a quarter of an hour Jean will be
here Musotte stretches herself out obediently upon the couch and goes
to sleep

LA BABIN silently replaces the screen which hides Musotte

How she sleeps What a benediction that drug is But I dont want any of
it It scares me it is a devils potion Sits near the cradle and
reads a newspaper

MME FLACHE in a low voice to Dr Pellerin

Oh the poor girl what misery

DR PELLERIN in the same tone

Yes she is a brave girl It is some time since I first met her with
Jean Martinel who gave her three years of complete happiness She has a
pure and simple soul

MME FLACHE

Well will this Monsieur Martinel come

DR PELLERIN

I think so He is a man of feeling but it is a difficult thing for him
to leave his wife and his people on such a day as this

MME FLACHE

It certainly is a most extraordinary case A veritable fiasco

DR PELLERIN

It is indeed

MME FLACHE changes her tone

Where have you been just now You did not put on evening dress and a
white cravat to go and see a patient

DR PELLERIN

I went to see the first part of the Montargy ballet danced

MME FLACHE interested and leaning upon the edge of the table

And was it good Tell me

DR PELLERIN sits L of table

It was very well danced

MME FLACHE

The new directors do things in style dont they

DR PELLERIN

Jeanne Merali and Gabrielle Poivrier are first class

MME FLACHE

Poivrierthe little Poivrieris it possible As to Merali I am not so
much astonished although she is distinctly ugly she has her good
points And how about Mauri

DR PELLERIN

Oh a marvelan absolute marvel who dances as no one else can A human
bird with limbs for wings It was absolute perfection

MME FLACHE

Are you in love with her

DR PELLERIN

Oh no merely an admirer You know how I worship the dance

MME FLACHE

And the danseuses also at times Lowering her eyes Come have
you forgotten

DR PELLERIN

One can never forget artists of your worth my dear

MME FLACHE

You are simply teasing me

DR PELLERIN

I only do you justice You know that formerly when I was a young
doctor I had for you a very ardent passion which lasted six weeks Tell
me dont you regret the time of the grand fte

MME FLACHE

A little But reason comes when one is young no longer and I have
nothing to complain of My business is very prosperous

DR PELLERIN

You are making money then They tell me that you are giving dainty
little dinners

MME FLACHE

I believe you and I have a particularly good chef Wont you give me
the pleasure of entertaining you at dinner one of these days my dear
Doctor

DR PELLERIN

Very willingly my dear

MME FLACHE

Shall I have any other physicians or do you prefer to come alone

DR PELLERIN

Alone if you please I am not fond of a third party The bell
rings

MUSOTTE awakens

Ah some one rang run and see Exit Mme Flache A short silence

A VOICE without

Madame Henriette Lvque

MUSOTTE emitting an anguished cry

Ah it is he There he is Makes an effort to rise Enter Jean
Martinel Jean Jean At last Springs up and stretches her arms to
him




SCENE III

The samewith Jean Martinel

JEAN comes rapidly forward kneels near the long steamerchair and
kisses Musottes hands

My poor little Musotte They begin to weep and dry their eyes then
they remain silent and motionless At last Jean rises and holds up his
hand to Dr Pellerin

PELLERIN

Did I do well

JEAN

You did indeed and I thank you

PELLERIN introduces them

Madame Flache the midwifethe nurseindicates the cradle with a
grave gesture and there

JEAN approaches the cradle and lifts the little curtain takes up the
child and kisses it on the mouth then lays it down again

He is a splendid boy

DR PELLERIN

A very pretty child

MME FLACHE

A superb morselone of my prettiest

JEAN in a low voice

And Musotte how is she

MUSOTTE who has heard him

II am almost lost I know surely that all is over To Jean Take
that little chair dear and seat yourself near me and let us talk as
long as I am able to speak I have so many things to say to you for we
shall never be together any more I am so glad to see you again that
nothing else now seems of any importance

JEAN approaching her Dont agitate yourself Dont get excited

MUSOTTE

How can I help being agitated at seeing you again

JEAN sits on the low chair takes Musottes hand

My poor Musotte I cannot tell you what a shock it was to me when I
learned just now that you were so ill

MUSOTTE

And on this day of all days It must have shocked you greatly

JEAN

What Do you know of it then

MUSOTTE

Yes since I felt so ill I kept myself informed about you every day in
order that I might not pass away without having seen you and spoken to
you again for I have so much to say to you At a sign from Jean
Mme Flache Pellerin and La Babin exit R




SCENE IV

Musotte and Jean

MUSOTTE

Then you received the letter

JEAN

Yes

MUSOTTE

And you came immediately

JEAN

Certainly

MUSOTTE

Thanksah thanks I hesitated a long time before warning
youhesitated even this morning but I heard the midwife talking with
the nurse and learned that tomorrow perhaps it might be too late so I
sent Doctor Pellerin to call you immediately

JEAN

Why didnt you call me sooner

MUSOTTE

I never thought that my illness would become so serious I did not wish
to trouble your life

JEAN points to the cradle

But that child How is it that I was not told of this sooner

MUSOTTE

You would never have known it if his birth had not killed me I would
have spared you this painthis cloud upon your life When you left me
you gave me enough to live upon Everything was over between us and
besides at any other moment than this would you believe me if I said
to you This is your child

JEAN

Yes I have never doubted you

MUSOTTE

You are as good as ever my Jean No no I am not lying to you he is
yours that little one there I swear it to you on my deathbed I swear
it to you before God

JEAN

I have already told you that I believed you I have always believed you

MUSOTTE

Listen this is all that has happened As soon as you left me I became
very ill I suffered so much that I thought I was going to die The
doctor ordered a change of air You remember it was in the spring I
went to SaintMaloto that old relative of whom I have often talked to
you

JEAN

Yes yes

MUSOTTE

It was in SaintMalo after some days that I realized that you had left
me a pledge of your affection My first desire was to tell you
everything for I knew that you were an honest manthat you would have
recognized this child perhaps even have given up your marriage but I
would not have had you do that All was over was it notand it was
better that it should be so I knew that I could never be your wife
smiles Musotte me Madame Martineloh no

JEAN

My poor dear girl How brutal and hard we men are without thinking of
it and without wishing to be so

MUSOTTE

Dont say that I was not made for you I was only a little model and
you you were a rising artist and I never thought that you would belong
to me forever Jean sheds tears No no dont cry you have nothing
to reproach yourself with You have always been so good to me It is
only God who has been cruel to me

JEAN

Musotte

MUSOTTE

Let me go on I remained at SaintMalo without revealing my condition
Then I came back to Paris and here some months afterward the little one
was bornthe child When I fully understood what had happened to me I
experienced at first such fear yes such fear Then I remembered that
he was bone of your bone and flesh of your flesh that you had given
him life and that he was a pledge from you But one is so stupid when
one knows nothing Ones ideas change just as ones moods change and I
became contented all at once contented with the thought that I would
bring him up that he would grow to be a man that he would call me
mother Weeps Now he will never call me mother He will never put
his little arms around my neck because I am going to leave him because
I am going awayI dont know where but there where everybody goes
Oh God My God

JEAN

Calm yourself my little Musotte Would you be able to speak as you do
speak if you were as ill as you think you are

MUSOTTE

You do not see that the fever is burning within me that I am losing my
head and dont know longer what I say

JEAN

No no please calm yourself

MUSOTTE

Pet me pet me Jean and you will calm me

JEAN kisses her hair then resumes

There there dont speak any more for a minute or two Let us remain
quietly here near each other

MUSOTTE

But I must speak to you I have so many things to say to you yet and do
not know how to say them My head is beyond my control Oh my God how
shall I do it Raises herself looks around her and sees the cradle
Ah yes I know I recollect it is he my child Tell me Jean what
will you do with him You know that I am an orphan and when I am gone
he will be here all alonealone in the world Poor little thing Listen
Jean my head is quite clear now I shall understand very well what you
answer me now and the peace of my closing moments depends upon it I
have no one to leave the little one to but you

JEAN

I promise you that I will take him look after him and bring him up

MUSOTTE

As a father

JEAN

As a father

MUSOTTE

You have already seen him

JEAN

Yes

MUSOTTE

Go and look at him again Jean goes over to the cradle

JEAN

He is pretty isnt he

MUSOTTE

Everybody says so Look at him the poor little darling who has enjoyed
only a few days of life as yet He belongs to us You are his father I
am his mother but soon he will have a mother no more In anguish
Promise me that he shall always have a father

JEAN goes over to her

I promise it my darling

MUSOTTE

A true father who will always love him well

JEAN I promise it

MUSOTTE

You will be goodvery goodto him

JEAN

I swear it to you

MUSOTTE

And then there is something elsebut I dare not

JEAN

Tell it to me

MUSOTTE

Since I came back to Paris I have sought to see you without being seen
by you and I have seen you three times Each time you were with
herwith your sweetheart your wife and with a gentlemanher father
I think Oh how I looked at her I asked myself Will she love him as
I have loved him Will she make him happy Is she good Tell me do you
really believe she is very good

JEAN

Yes darling I believe it

MUSOTTE

You are very certain of it

JEAN

Yes indeed

MUSOTTE

And I thought so too simply from seeing her pass by She is so pretty
I have been a little jealous and I wept on coming back But what are
you going to do now as between her and your son

JEAN

I shall do my duty

MUSOTTE

Your duty Does that mean by her or by him

JEAN

By him

MUSOTTE

Listen Jean when I am no more ask your wife from me from the mouth
of a dead woman to adopt him this dear little morsel of humanityto
love him as I would have loved him to be a mother to him in my stead
If she is tender and kind she will consent Tell her how you saw me
sufferthat my last prayer my last supplication on earth was offered
up for her Will you do this

JEAN

I promise you that I will

MUSOTTE

Ah How good you are Now I fear nothing my poor little darling is
safe and I am happy and calm Ah how calm I am You didnt know did
you that I called him Jean after you That does not displease you
does it

JEAN weeps

No no

MUSOTTE

You weepso you still love me a little Jean Ah how I thank you for
this But if I only could live it must be possible I feel so much
better since you came here and since you have promised me all that I
have asked you Give me your hand At this moment I can recall all our
life together and I am contentalmost gay in fact I can laughsee
I can laugh though I dont know why Laughs

JEAN

Oh calm yourself for my sake dear little Musotte

MUSOTTE

If you could only understand how recollections throng upon me Do you
remember that I posed for your Mendiante for your Violet Seller
 for your Guilty Woman which won for you your first medal And do you
remember the breakfast at Ledoyens on Varnishing Day There were more
than twentyfive at a table intended for ten What follies we committed
especially that little littlewhat did he call himselfI mean that
little comic fellow who was always making portraits which resembled no
one Oh yes Tavernier And you took me home with you to your studio
where you had two great manikins which frightened me so and I called to
you and you came in to reassure me Oh how heavenly all that was Do
you remember Laughs again Oh if that life could only begin over
again Cries suddenly Ah what pain To Jean who is going for
the doctor No stay stay Silence A sudden change comes over her
face See Jean what glorious weather If you like we will take the
baby for a sail on a river steamboat that will be so jolly I love
those little steamboats they are so pretty They glide over the water
quickly and without noise Now that I am your wife I can assert
myselfI am armed Darling I never thought that you would marry me
And look at our little onehow pretty he is and how he grows He is
called Jean after you And II have my two little Jeansminealtogether
mine You dont know how happy I am And the little one walks today for
the first time Laughs aloud with her arms stretched out pointing to
the child which she thinks is before her

JEAN weeps

Musotte Musotte Dont you know me

MUSOTTE

Indeed I know you Am I not your wife Kiss me darling Kiss me my
little one

JEAN takes her in his arms weeping and repeating

Musotte Musotte Musotte rises upon her couch and with a gesture to
Jean points to the cradle toward which he goes nodding Yes yes
 with his head When Jean reaches the cradle Musotte who has raised
herself upon her hands falls lifeless upon the long steamerchair
Jean frightened calls out Pellerin Pellerin




SCENE V

The same Pellerin Mme Flache and La Babin enter quickly R

PELLERIN who has gone swiftly to Musotte feels her pulse and
listens at the heart

Her heart is not beating Give me a mirror Madame Flache

JEAN

My God Mme Flache gives a handmirror to Pellerin who holds it
before the lips of Musotte Pause

PELLERIN in a low voice

She is dead

JEAN takes the dead womans hand and kisses it fondly his voice
choked with emotion

Farewell my dear little Musotte To think that a moment ago you were
speaking to mea moment ago you were looking at me you saw me and
nowall is over

PELLERIN goes to Jean and takes him by the shoulder

Now you must go at once Go You have nothing more to do here Your
duty is over

JEAN rises

full of tears I shall see you again directly my little Jean

Exit quickly




ACT III




SCENE I

Same setting as in Act I

Monsieur de Petitpr Mme de Ronchard M Martinel and Lon

MME DE RONCHARD walks about in an agitated manner

Seven minutes to midnight It is nearly two hours since Jean left us

LEON seated L

But my dear Aunt just allow a half hour in the carriage for going and
a half hour for returning and there remains just one hour for the
business he had to attend to

MME DE RONCHARD

Was it so very long thenthe business that called him hence

LEON

Yes my dear Aunt and now why worry yourself by counting the minutes
Your agitation will change nothing in the end and will not hasten
Jeans return by a single second or make the hands of the clock move
more quickly

MME DE RONCHARD

How can you ask me not to worry when my mind is full of anxiety when my
heart is beating and I feel the tears rising into my eyes

LON

But my dear Aunt you know very well you do not feel as badly as that

MME DE RONCHARD

Oh you irritate me

MARTINEL seated near the table

Dont torment yourself Madame True the situation is a rather delicate
one but it need not disquiet you or frighten us if we know how to
bring to its consideration at this moment coolness and reason

LON

Just so my dear Aunt Monsieur Martinel speaks truly

MME DE RONCHARD crosses R

You ought to be beaten you two You know everything and wont tell
anything How annoying men are There is never any means of making them
tell a secret

MARTINEL

Jean will come presently and will tell you everything Have a little
patience

PETITPR

Yes let us be calm Let us talk of other things or be silent if we
can

MME DE RONCHARD

Be silent That is about the most difficult thing

A SERVANT enters R

A gentleman wishes to see M Martinel

MARTINEL rises

Pardon me for a moment To the servant Very well I am coming
Exit R




SCENE II

MME DE RONCHARD approaches servant quickly

Baptiste Baptiste Who is asking for M Martinel

SERVANT

I do not know Madame It was the hall porter who came upstairs

MME DE RONCHARD

Well run now and look without showing yourself and come back and tell
us at once

PETITPR who has risen at the entrance of the servant

No I will permit no spying let us wait We shall not have to wait long
now To the servant You may go Exit servant

MME DE RONCHARD to Petitpr

I do not understand you at all You are absolutely calm One would think
that your daughters happiness was nothing to you For myself I am
profoundly agitated

PETITPR

That will do no good Sits near the table R Let us talktalk
reasonably now that we are a family party and Monsieur Martinel is
absent

MME DE RONCHARD Sits R

If that man would only go back to Havre

LON Sits L of table

That would not change anything even if he could go back to Havre

PETITPR

For my part I think

MME DE RONCHARD interrupts

Do you wish to hear my opinion Well I think that they are preparing us
for some unpleasant surprise that they wish to entrap us as one might
say

PETITPR

But why In whose interest Jean Martinel is an honest man and he loves
my child Lon whose judgment I admire although he is my son

LEON

Thank you father

PETITPR

Lon bears Jean as much affection as esteem As to the uncle

MME DE RONCHARD

Dont talk about them I pray It is this woman who is seeking to entrap
us She has played some little comedy and she chooses today above all
others for its dnouement It is her stage climax her masterpiece of
treachery

LON

As in The Ambigu

MME DE RONCHARD

Do not laugh I know these women I have suffered enough at their hands

PETITPR

Oh my poor Clarisse if you really understood them you would have held
your husband better than you did

MME DE RONCHARD rises

What do you mean by understanding them Pardon meto live with that
roisterer coming in upon me when and whence he pleasedI prefer my
broken life and my lonelinesswith you

PETITPR

No doubt you are right from your point of view of a married woman but
there are other points of view perhaps less selfish and certainly
superior such as that of family interest

MME DE RONCHARD

Of family interest indeed Do you mean to say that I was wrong from the
point of view of the family interestyou a magistrate

PETITPR

My duties as a magistrate have made me very prudent for I have seen
pass under my eyes many equivocal and terrible situations which not
only agonized my conscience but gave me many cruel hours of indecision
Man is often so little responsible and circumstances are often so
powerful Our impenetrable nature is so capricious our instincts are so
mysterious that we must be tolerant and even indulgent in the presence
of faults which are not really crimes and which exhibit nothing vicious
or abandoned in the man himself

MME DE RONCHARD

So then to deceive ones wife is not deceitful and you say such a
thing before your son Truly a pretty state of affairs Crosses L

LON

Oh I have my opinion also about that my dear Aunt

PETITPR rises

It is not almost a crimeit is one But it is looked upon today as so
common a thing that one scarcely punishes it at all It is punished by
divorce which is a house of refuge for most men The law prefers to
separate them with decencytimidly rather than drag them apart as in
former times

MME DE RONCHARD

Your learned theories are revolting and I wish

LON rises

Ah here is Monsieur Martinel




SCENE III

The same and Monsieur Martinel

MARTINEL with great emotion

I come to fulfill an exceedingly difficult task Jean who has gone to
his own house before daring to present himself here has sent Doctor
Pellerin to me I am commissioned by him to make you acquainted with the
sad position in which Jean finds himselfin which we all find
ourselves

MME DE RONCHARD

Ah ha Now I am going to learn something

MARTINEL

By a letter which you will read presently we have learned this evening
in this house of a new misfortune A woman of whose existence you are
all aware was at the point of death

MME DE RONCHARD

Did I not predict that she would do just this thing

LON

Let M Martinel speak my dear Aunt

MME DE RONCHARD

And now that this woman has seen him how does she feelhis dying
patient Better without a doubt

MARTINEL quietly

She died Madame died before his eyes

MME DE RONCHARD

Died this evening Impossible

MARTINEL

Nevertheless it is so Madame

LON aside

Poor little Musotte

MARTINEL

There is a serious thing to be considered here This woman left a child
and that childs father is Jean

MME DE RONCHARD stupefied

A child

MARTINEL to Petitpr

Read the physicians letter Monsieur Hands Petitpr the letter
and Petitpr reads it

MME DE RONCHARD

He had a child and he has never confessed it has never said anything
about it has hidden it from us What infamy

MARTINEL

He would have told you in due time

MME DE RONCHARD

He would have told That is altogether too strongyou are mocking us

LON

But my dear Aunt let my father answer I shall go and find Gilberte
She will be dying of anxiety We have no right to hide the truth from
her any longer I am going to acquaint her with it

MME DE RONCHARD accompanying him to the door

You have a pleasant task but you will not succeed in arranging matters

LON at door L

In any case I shall not embroil them with each other as you would

Exit L




SCENE IV

Petitpr Martinel and Madame de Ronchard

PETITPR who has finished reading the letter

Then Martinel you say that your nephew was ignorant of the situation
of this woman

MARTINEL

Upon my honor

MME DE RONCHARD

It is incredible

MARTINEL

I will answer you in a word If my nephew had known of this situation
would he have done what he has this evening

PETITPR

Explain yourself more clearly

MARTINEL

It is very simple If he had known sooner of the danger this woman was
in do you think that he would have waited until the last moment and
have chosen this very eveningthis supreme momentto say goodbye to
this poor dying woman and to reveal to you the existence of his
illegitimate son No men hide these unfortunate children when and how
they please You know that as well as I Monsieur To run the risk of
throwing us all into such a state of emotion and threatening his own
future as he has done it would seem that Jean must be a madman and he
is by no means that Had he known sooner of this situation do you think
that he would not have confided in me and that I would have been so
stupidyes Ias not to avert this disaster Why I tell you it is as
clear as day

MME DE RONCHARD agitated walks to and fro rapidly L

Clear as the dayclear as the day

MARTINEL

Yes indeed If we had not received this piece of news as a bomb which
destroys the power of reflection if we could have taken time to reason
the thing out to make plans we could have hidden everything from you
and the devil would have been in it before you would have known
anything Our fault has been that of being too sincere and too loyal
Yet I do not regret it it is always better to act openly in life

MME DE RONCHARD

Permit me Monsieur

PETITPR

Silence Clarisse To Martinel Be it so Monsieur There is no
question of your honor or of your loyalty which have been absolutely
patent in this unfortunate affair I willingly admit that your nephew
knew nothing of the situation but how about the child What is there to
prove that it is Jeans

MARTINEL

Jean alone can prove or disprove that He believes it and you know that
it is not to his interest to believe it There is nothing very joyful
about such a complicationa poor little foundling thrusting himself
upon one like a thunderbolt without warning and upon the very evening
of ones marriage But Jean believes that the child is his and Iand
all of usmust we not accept it as he has accepted it as the childs
father has accepted it Come now A short silence You ask me to
prove to you that this child belongs to Jean

MME DE RONCHARD AND PETITPR together

Yes

MARTINEL

Then first prove to me that it is not Jeans child

MME DE RONCHARD

You ask an impossibility

MARTINEL

And so do you The principal judge in the matter look you is my nephew
himself We others can do nothing but accept his decision

MME DE RONCHARD

But meanwhile

PETITPR

Silence Clarisse Monsieur Martinel is right

MME DE RONCHARD ironically

Say that again

MARTINEL

There can be no better reason Madame To Petitpr I was quite sure
that you would understand me Monsieur for you are a man of sense

MME DE RONCHARD

And what am I then

MARTINEL

You are a woman of the world Madame

MME DE RONCHARD

And it is exactly as a woman of the world that I protest Monsieur You
have a very pretty way of putting things but none the less this is a
fact Jean Martinel brings to his bride as a nuptial present on the
day of his marriage an illegitimate child Well I ask you woman of
the world or not can she accept such a thing

PETITPR

My sister is in the right this time Monsieur Martinel

MME DE RONCHARD

And by no means too soon

PETITPR

It is evident that a situation exists patent and undeniable which
places us in an awkward dilemma We have wedded our daughter to a man
supposedly free from all ties and all complications in life and then
comeswhat you know has come The consequences should be endured by
him not by us We have been wounded and deceived in our confidence and
the consent that we have given to this marriage we should certainly have
refused had we known the actual circumstances

MME DE RONCHARD

We should have refused I should say sonot only once but twice
Besides this child if Jean brings it into the house will certainly be
a cause of trouble among us all Consider Gilberte will probably become
a mother in her turn and then what jealousies what rivalries what
hatred perhaps will arise between this intruder and her own children
This child will be a veritable apple of discord

MARTINEL

Oh no no he will not be a burden to anyone Thanks to Jeans
liberality this childs mother will have left him enough to live
comfortably and later when he has become a man he will travel no
doubt He will do as I have done as ninetenths of the human race do

PETITPR

Well until then who will take care of it

MARTINEL

I if it is agreeable I am a free man retired from business and it
will give me something to do something to distract me I am ready to
take him with me at once the poor little thinglooks at Mme de
Ronchard unless Madame who is so fond of saving lost dogs

MME DE RONCHARD

That child I Oh that would be a piece of foolishness

MARTINEL

Yet Madame if you care to have him I will yield my right most
willingly

MME DE RONCHARD

But Monsieur I never said

MARTINEL

Not as yet true but perhaps you will say it before very long for I am
beginning to understand you You are an assumed manhater and nothing
else You have been unhappy in your married life and that has embittered
youjust as milk may turn upon its surface but at the bottom of the
churn there is butter of fine quality

MME DE RONCHARD frowns

What a comparisonmilkbutterpshaw how vulgar

PETITPR

But Clarisse

MARTINEL

Here is your daughter




SCENE V

The same and Gilberte and Leon who enter L

PETITPR approaches Gilberte

Before seeing your husband again if you decide to see him it is
necessary that we should decide exactly what you are going to say to
him

GILBERTE greatly moved sits L of table

I knew it was some great misfortune

MARTINEL sits beside her

Yes my child but there are two kinds of misfortunethose that come
from the faults of men and those that spring purely from the hazards of
fate that is to say destiny In the first case the man is guilty in
the second case he is a victim Do you understand me

GILBERTE

Yes Monsieur

MARTINEL

A misfortune of which some one person is the victim can also wound
another person very cruelly But will not the heart of this second
wounded and altogether innocent person bestow a pardon upon the
involuntary author of her disaster

GILBERTE in a sad voice

That depends upon the suffering which she undergoes

MARTINEL Meanwhile you knew that before Jean loved you before he
conceived the idea of marrying you he hadan intrigue You accepted
the fact as one which had nothing exceptional about it

GILBERTE

I did accept it

MARTINEL

And now your brother may tell you the rest

GILBERTE

Yes Monsieur

MARTINEL

What shall I say to Jean

GILBERTE

I am too much agitated to tell you yet This woman of whom I did not
think at all whose very existence was a matter of indifference to
meher death has frightened me It seems that she has come between Jean
and me and will always remain there Everything that I have heard of
her prophesies this estrangement But you knew herthis woman did you
not Monsieur

MARTINEL

Yes Madame and I can say nothing but good of her Your brother and I
have always looked upon her as irreproachable in her fidelity to Jean
She loved him with a pure devoted absolute and lasting affection I
speak as a man who has deplored deeply this intrigue for I look upon
myself as a father to Jean but we must try to be just to everyone

GILBERTE

And did Jean love her very much too

MARTINEL

Oh yes certainly he did but his love began to wane Between them
there was too much of a moral and social distance He lived with her
however drawn to her by the knowledge of the deep and tender affection
which she bestowed upon him

GILBERTE gravely

And Jean went to see her die

MARTINEL

He had just time to say farewell to her

GILBERTE to herself

If I could only tell what passed between them at that moment Ah this
wretched death is worse for me than if she were alive

MME DE RONCHARD rises R and goes up stage

I really do not understand you my dear The woman has diedso much the
better for you May God deliver you from all such

GILBERTE

No my dear Aunt the feeling I have just now is so painful that I would
sooner know her to be far away than to know her dead

PETITPR comes down

Yes I admit that is the sentiment of a woman moved by a horrible
catastrophe but there is one grave complication in the matterthat of
the child Whatever may be done with it he will none the less be the
son of my soninlaw and a menace to us all

MME DE RONCHARD

And a subject for ridicule See what the world will say of us in a
little while

LON

Leave the world to itself my dear Aunt and let us occupy ourselves
with our own business Goes to Gilberte Now Gilberte is it the
idea of the child that moves you so deeply

GILBERTE

Oh nothe poor little darling

PETITPR

Such is the foolishness of women who know nothing of life

LON

Well father why if we have so many different viewsaccording as we
are spectators or actors in the course of eventswhy is there so much
difference between the life of the imagination and the actual life
between that which one ought to do that which you would that others
should do and that which you do yourself Yes what has happened is
very painful but the surprise of the event its coincidence with the
nuptial day makes it still more painful We magnifyeverything in our
emotion when it is ourselves that misfortune touches Suppose for a
moment that you had read this in your daily newspaper

MME DE RONCHARD seated L of table indignantly

In my daily newspaper

LON

Or in a romance What emotion we should feel what tears we should shed
How your sympathy would quickly go out to the poor little child whose
birth was attained at the cost of his mothers life How Jean would go
up in your esteem how frank how loyal how stanch in his fealty you
would consider him while on the other hand if he had deserted the
dying woman and had spirited away the little one into some distant
village you would not have had enough scorn for him or enough insults
for him You would look upon him as a being without heart and without
fear and you my dear Aunt thinking of the innumerable little bad
dogs who owe you their lives you would cry out with forcible gestures
What a miserable scoundrel

MARTINEL seated L

Thats perfectly true

MME DE RONCHARD

Dogs are worth more than men

LON

Little children are not men my dear Aunt They have not had time to
become bad

PETITPR

All that is very ingenious Leon and your special pleading is
magnificent

MME DE RONCHARD

Yes if you would only plead like that at the Palais

PETITPR

But this has nothing to do with a romance or with imaginary personages
We have married Gilberte to a young man in the ordinary conditions of
life

MME DE RONCHARD

Without enthusiasm

PETITPR

Without enthusiasm it is true but nevertheless they are married just
the same Now on the evening of his nuptials he brings us a presentI
must say I do not care for a present which bawls

LON

What does that prove unless it is that your soninlaw is a brave man
What he has just donerisked his happiness in order to accomplish his
dutydoes it not say better than anything else could how capable of
devotion he is

MARTINEL

Clear as the day

MME DE RONCHARD aside

And this man from Havre admires him

PETITPR

Then you maintain that Gilberte on the day of her entry upon married
life should become the adopted mother of the son of her husbands
mistress

LON

Exactly just as I maintain all that is honorable and disinterested And
you would think as I do if the thing did not concern your daughter

PETITPR

No it is an inexcusable situation

LON

Well then what do you propose to do

PETITPR

Well nothing less than a divorce The scandal of this night is
sufficient

MME DE RONCHARD rises

Gilberte divorced You dont dream of that do you Have all our friends
closing their doors on her the greater part of her relatives lost to
her Divorced Come come in spite of your new law that has not yet
come into our custom and shall not come in so soon Religion forbids it
the world accepts it only under protest and when you have against you
both religion and the world

PETITPR

But statistics prove

MME DE RONCHARD

Pshaw Statistics You can make them say what you wish No no divorce
for Gilberte In a soft low voice Simply a legal separationthat
is admissible at least and it is good form Let them separate I am
separatedall fashionable people separate and everything goes all
right but as to divorce

LON seriously

It seems to me that only one person has a right to speak in this matter
and we are forgetting her too long Turns to Gilberte You have
heard everything Gilberte you are mistress of your own judgment and of
your decision Upon a word from you depend either pardon or rupture My
father has made his argument What does your heart say Gilberte tries
to speak but stops and breaks down Think always that in refusing to
pardon Jean you wound me and if I see you unhappy from your
determination to say no I shall suffer exceedingly Monsieur Martinel
asks from you at once an answer for Jean Let us do better I will go
and find him It is from your lips it is above all in your eyes that
he will learn his fate Brings her gently to the front of the stage
My little sister my dear little sister dont be too proud dont be
too haughty Listen to that which your chagrin murmurs in your soul
Listen well but do not mistake it for pride

GILBERTE

But I have no pride I do not know how I feel I am ill My joy has been
blighted and it poisons me

LON

Take care It takes so little in such moments as these to make wounds
which are incurable

GILBERTE

No no I am too much distressed Perhaps I shall be hard for I am
afraid of him and of myself I am afraid of breaking off everything or
of yielding everything

LON

I am going to find Jean

GILBERTE resolutely

No I do not wish to see him I forbid it

LON

Let me tell you something my little Gilberte You are less intelligent
than I thought

GILBERTE

Why

LON

Because in such moments as these it is necessary to say yes or no at
once Jean appears at door R




SCENE VI

The same and Jean Martinel standing at door R

GILBERTE with a stifled cry

It is he

LON goes up to Jean and taking him by the hand

Welcome

JEAN

I am like a prisoner awaiting the decision of his judgeswhether it be
acquittal or death The moments through which I have just passed I shall
never forget

LON

Your uncle and I have said all that we had to say Now speak for
yourself

JEAN

I do not know how It must be to my wife alone I dare not speak before
you all I ask but a moment After that I go and I shall leave the
house if my wifes attitude indicates that I ought I shall do exactly
what she would have me I shall become that which she may order But I
must hear from her own lips her decision as to my life To
Gilberte You cannot refuse me that Madame It is the only prayer that
I shall ever make to you I swear if this request to you remains
ungranted They stand face to face and look at each other

GILBERTE

No I cannot refuse you Father Aunt please leave me alone for a few
minutes with Monsieur Martinel You can see that I am perfectly calm

PETITPR

Butbut

JEAN determinedly to M Petitpr

Monsieur I shall not gainsay your will in anything I shall do nothing
without your approval I have not returned here to contest your
authority or to speak of rights but I respectfully ask permission to
remain alone a few minutes withmy wife Consider that this is perhaps
our last interview and that our future depends upon it

MME DE RONCHARD

It is solely the future of Gilberte which concerns me

JEAN to Mme de Ronchard

I appeal simply to your heart Madame your heart which has suffered
Do not forget that your irritation and your bitterness against me come
from the misfortune that another man has inflicted upon you Your life
has been broken by him Do not wish the same for me You have been
unhappy married scarcely a year Points to Gilberte Will you say
that she shall be married scarcely a day and that later she shall talk
of her broken lifeceaselessly guarding in her mind the memory of this
evenings disaster At a movement of Mme de Ronchard I know you to
be kind although you deny it and I promise you Madame that if I
remain Gilbertes husband I shall love you as a son as a son worthy of
you

MME DE RONCHARD very much moved

A son He has stirred me deeply Whispers to Petitpr Come away
let us leave them alone Embraces Gilberte

PETITPR to Jean

Well so be it Monsieur Rises and exit C offering his arm to
Mme de Ronchard

MARTINEL to Lon

They are going to talk with that touches his heart it is the only
true eloquence

Exit with Lon C




SCENE VII


Gilberte and Jean

JEAN

You know all do you not

GILBERTE

Yes And I have been deeply wounded

JEAN

I hope you do not accuse me of lying or of any other dissimulation

GILBERTE

Oh no

JEAN

Do you blame me for having left you this evening


GILBERTE

I blame no one who does his duty

JEAN

You did not know this womanand she is dead

GILBERTE

It is just because she is dead that she troubles me thus

JEAN

Impossible you must have another reason With hesitation The
child

GILBERTE quickly

No no dont deceive yourself The poor little darling it is not his
fault No I suffer from something which is peculiar to myself which
can come only from me and which I cannot confess to you It is a sorrow
deep in my heart so keen when I felt it spring to birth under the
words of my brother and your uncle that should I ever experience it
again when living with you as your wife I should never be able to
dispel it

JEAN

What is it

GILBERTE

I cannot tell it Sits L

JEAN stands

Listen to me It is necessary that at this moment there should not be
between us the shadow of a misunderstanding All our life depends upon
it You are my wife but I admit that you are absolutely free after what
has happened I will do as you wish I am ready to agree to everything
you desire even to a divorce if you demand it But what will happen to
me after that I do not know for I love you so that the thought of
losing you after winning you will throw me mercilessly into some
desperate resolve Sees Gilberte moved I do not seek to soften
you to move youI simply tell you the naked truth I feel and I have
felt during the whole night through all the shocks and horrible
emotions of the drama that has just been enacted that you hold for me
the keenest wound If you banish me now I am a lost man

GILBERTE much moved

Do you really love me as much as that

JEAN

With a love that I feel is ineffaceable

GILBERTE

Did you love her

JEAN

I did indeed love her I experienced a tender attachment for a gentle
and devoted girl In a low voice with passion Listen that which I
am going to tell you is unworthy perhaps infamous but I am only a
human being feeble as anyone else Well just now in the presence of
this poor dying girl my eyes were filled with tears and my sobs choked
meall my being vibrated with sorrow but at the bottom of my soul in
the depths of my being I thought only of you

GILBERTE rises quickly

Do you mean that

JEAN simply

I cannot lie to you

GILBERTE

Well do you know what made me suffer just now when my brother told me
of this intrigue and death I can tell it to you now I was jealous It
was unworthy of me wasnt it Jealous of this poor dead woman But he
spoke so well of her as to move me and I felt that she loved you so
much that you might find me perhaps indifferent and cold after her and
that hurt me so I had so much fear of experiencing that that I thought
of renouncing you

JEAN

And nowGilberte Gilberte

GILBERTE extends her hands

I am here Jean take me

JEAN

Ah how grateful I am Kisses her hands then immediately after with
emotion But here another anguish seizes me I have promised this poor
woman to take and cherish this child in my own home Gilberte makes a
movement That is not all Do you know what her last thought her last
prayer was She entreated me to commend the child to you

GILBERTE

To me

JEAN

To you Gilberte

GILBERTE profoundly moved

She did this the poor woman Did she believe that I would take

JEAN

She hoped it and in that hope her death was made easier

GILBERTE in exalted mood crosses R

Yes I will take it where is it

JEAN

At my house

GILBERTE

At your house You must go to it immediately

JEAN

What leave you now at this moment

GILBERTE

We will go together since I was to have accompanied you to your house
this evening

JEAN joyously

Oh Gilberte But your father will not let us go

GILBERTE

Well do you know what we must do since my packing is finished and my
maid awaits me at your house You must carry me off

JEAN

Carry you off

GILBERTE

Give me my cloak and let us go All can be explained tomorrow Shows
the cloak that she had left upon the chair in the first act My cloak
please

JEAN picks up the cloak quickly and throws it over her shoulders

You are the most adorable creature Gilberte takes his arm and they go
toward door R

Yes run along darlingthere is a little one over there who waits for
a mother

THE LANCERS WIFE AND OTHER TALES




THE LANCERS WIFE


It was after Bourbakis defeat in the east of France The army broken
up decimated and worn out had been obliged to retreat into
Switzerland after that terrible campaign It was only the short
duration of the struggle that saved a hundred and fifty thousand men
from certain death Hunger the terrible cold and forced marches in the
snow without boots over bad mountainous roads had caused the
francstireurs especially the greatest suffering for we were without
tents and almost without food always in front when we were marching
toward Belfort and in the rear when returning by the Jura Of our
brigade that had numbered twelve hundred men on the first of January
there remained only twentytwo pale thin ragged wretches when at
length we succeeded in reaching Swiss territory

There we were safe and could rest Everybody knows what sympathy was
shown to the unfortunate French army and how well it was cared for We
all gained fresh life and those who had been rich and happy before the
war declared that they had never experienced a greater feeling of
comfort than they did then Just think We actually had something to eat
every day and could sleep every night

Meanwhile the war continued in the east of France which had been
excluded from the armistice Besanon still kept the enemy in check and
the latter had their revenge by ravaging the Comte Franch Sometimes we
heard that they had approached quite close to the frontier and we saw
Swiss troops who were to form a line of observation between us and the
Germans set out on their march

But this hurt our pride and as we regained health and strength the
longing for fighting laid hold of us It was disgraceful and irritating
to know that within two or three leagues of us the Germans were
victorious and insolent to feel that we were protected by our
captivity and to feel that on that account we were powerless against
them

One day our captain took five or six of us aside and spoke to us about
it long and earnestly He was a fine fellow that captain He had been
a sublieutenant in the Zouaves was tall and thin and as hard as steel
and during the whole campaign had given a great deal of trouble to the
Germans He fretted in inactivity and could not accustom himself to the
idea of being a prisoner and of doing nothing

Confound it he said to us does it not pain you to know that there
are a lot of uhlans within two hours of us Does it not almost drive you
mad to know that those beggarly wretches are walking about as masters in
our mountains where six determined men might kill a whole troop any
day I cannot endure it any longer and I must go there

But how can you manage it Captain

How It is not very difficult Just as if we had not done a thing or
two within the last six months and got out of woods that were guarded
by men very different from the Swiss The day that you wish to cross
over into France I will undertake to get you there

That may be but what shall we do in France without any arms

Without arms We will get them over yonder by Jove

You are forgetting the treaty another soldier said we shall run the
risk of doing the Swiss an injury if Manteuffel learns that they have
allowed prisoners to return to France

Come said the captain those are all poor reasons I mean to go and
kill some Prussians that is all I care about If you do not wish to do
as I do well and good only say so at once I can quite well go by
myself I do not require anybodys company

Naturally we all protested and as it was quite impossible to make the
captain alter his mind we felt obliged to promise to go with him We
liked him too much to leave him in the lurch since he had never failed
us in any extremity and so the expedition was decided on




II


The captain had a plan of his own a plan he had been cogitating over
for some time A man in that part of the country whom he knew was
going to lend him a cart and six suits of peasants clothes We could
hide under some straw at the bottom of the wagon which would be loaded
with Gruyre cheese This cheese he was supposed to be going to sell in
France The captain told the sentinels that he was taking two friends
with him to protect his goods in case anyone should try to rob him
which did not seem an extraordinary precaution A Swiss officer seemed
to look at the wagon in a knowing manner but that was in order to
impress his soldiers In a word neither officers nor men made it out

Get on the captain said to the horses as he cracked his whip while
our men quietly smoked their pipes I was half suffocated in my box
which only admitted the air through some holes in front while at the
same time I was nearly frozen for it was terribly cold

Get on the captain said again and the wagon loaded with Gruyre
cheese entered France

The Prussian lines were very badly guarded as the enemy trusted to the
watchfulness of the Swiss The sergeant spoke North German while our
captain spoke the bad German of the Four Cantons so they could not
understand each other The sergeant however pretended to be very
intelligent and in order to make us believe that he understood us they
allowed us to continue our journey and after traveling for seven hours
being continually stopped in the same manner we arrived at a small
village of the Jura in ruins at nightfall

What were we going to do Our only arms were the captains whip our
uniforms the peasants blouses and our food the Gruyre cheese Our
sole riches consisted in our ammunition packets of cartridges which we
had stowed away inside some of the huge cheeses We had about a thousand
of them just two hundred each but then we wanted rifles and they must
be chassepots luckily however the captain was a bold man of an
inventive mind and this was the plan that he hit upon

While three of us remained hidden in a cellar in the abandoned village
he continued his journey as far as Besanon with the empty wagon and one
man The town was invested but one can always make ones way into a
town among the hills by crossing the tableland till within about ten
miles of the walls and then by following paths and ravines on foot
They left their wagon at Omans among the Germans and escaped out of it
at night on foot so as to gain the heights which border the river
Doubs the next day they entered Besanon where there were plenty of
chassepots There were nearly forty thousand of them left in the
arsenal and General Roland a brave marine laughed at the captains
daring project but let him have six rifles and wished him good luck
 There he also found his wife who had been through all the war with us
before the campaign in the east and who had been only prevented by
illness from continuing with Bourbakis army She had recovered
however in spite of the cold which was growing more and more intense
and in spite of the numberless privations that awaited her she insisted
on accompanying her husband He was obliged to give way to her and all
three the captain his wife and our comrade started on their
expedition

Going was nothing in comparison to returning They were obliged to
travel by night so as to avoid meeting anybody as the possession of
six rifles would have made them liable to suspicion But in spite of
everything a week after leaving us the captain and his two men were
back with us again The campaign was about to begin




III


The first night of his arrival the captain began it himself Under the
pretext of examining the country round he went along the highroad I
must tell you that the little village which served as our fortress was a
small collection of poor badly built houses which had been deserted
long before It lay on a steep slope which terminated in a wooded
plain The country people sold wood they sent it down the ravines
which are called coules locally and which led down to the plain and
there they stacked it into piles which were sold thrice a year to the
wood merchants The spot where this market was held was indicated by two
small houses by the side of the highroad which served for
publichouses The captain had gone down there by one of these
coules

He had been gone about half an hour and we were on the lookout at the
top of the ravine when we heard a shot The captain had ordered us not
to stir and only to come to him when we heard him blow his trumpet It
was made of a goats horn and could be heard a league off but it gave
no sound and in spite of our cruel anxiety we were obliged to wait in
silence with our rifles by our side

To go down these coules is easy you need only let yourself glide
down but it is more difficult to get up again You have to scramble up
by catching hold of the hanging branches of the trees and sometimes on
all fours by sheer strength A whole mortal hour passed and still the
captain did not come nothing moved in the brushwood The captains wife
began to grow impatient what could he be doing Why did he not call us
Did the shot that we had heard proceed from an enemy and had he killed
or wounded our leader her husband They did not know what to think but
I myself fancied that either he was dead or that his enterprise was
successful I was merely anxious and curious to know which

Suddenly we heard the sound of his trumpet and were much surprised
that instead of coming from below as we had expected it came from the
village behind us What did that mean It was a mystery to us but the
same idea struck us all that he had been killed and that the Prussians
were blowing the trumpet to draw us into an ambush We therefore
returned to the cottage keeping a careful lookout with our fingers on
the trigger and hiding under the branches But his wife in spite of our
entreaties rushed on leaping like a tigress She thought that she had
to avenge her husband and had fixed the bayonet to her rifle We lost
sight of her at the moment that we heard the trumpet again and a few
moments later we heard her calling out to us

Come on come on he is alive it is he

We hastened on and saw the captain smoking his pipe at the entrance of
the village but strangely enough he was on horseback

Ah said he to us you see that there is something to be done here
Here I am on horseback already I knocked over a uhlan yonder and took
his horse I suppose they were guarding the wood but it was by drinking
and swilling in clover One of them the sentry at the door had not
time to see me before I gave him a sugarplum in his stomach and then
before the others could come out I jumped on to the horse and was off
like a shot Eight or ten of them followed me I think but I took the
crossroads through the wood I have got scratched and torn a bit but
here I am And now my good fellows attention and take care Those
brigands will not rest until they have caught us and we must receive
them with rifle bullets Come along let us take up our posts

We set out One of us took up his position a good way from the village
of the crossroads I was posted at the entrance of the main street
where the road from the level country enters the village while the two
others with the captain and his wife took up positions in the middle
of the village near the church whose tower served for an observatory
and citadel

We had not been in our places long before we heard a shot followed by
another then two then three The first was evidently a
chassepotone recognized it by the sharp report which sounds like
the crack of a whipwhile the other three came from the lancers
carbines

The captain was furious He had given orders to the outpost to let the
enemy pass and merely to follow them at a distance if they marched
toward the village and to join me when they had gone well between the
houses Then they were to appear suddenly take the patrol between two
fires and not allow a single man to escape for posted as we were the
six of us could have hemmed in ten Prussians if needful

That confounded Pidelot has roused them the captain said and they
will not venture to come on blindfold any longer And then I am quite
sure that he has managed to get wounded himself somehow or other for we
hear nothing of him It serves him right why did he not obey orders
 And then after a moment he grumbled in his beard After all I am
sorry for the poor fellow he is so brave and shoots so well

The captain was right in his conjectures We waited until evening
without seeing the uhlans they had retreated after the first attack
but unfortunately we had not seen Pidelot either Was he dead or a
prisoner When night came the captain proposed that we should go out and
look for him and so the three of us started At the crossroads we found
a broken rifle and some blood while the ground was trampled down But
we did not find either a wounded man or a dead body although we
searched every thicket At midnight we returned without having
discovered anything of our unfortunate comrade

It is very strange the captain growled They must have killed him
and thrown him into the bushes somewhere they cannot possibly have
taken him prisoner as he would have called out for help I cannot
understand it all Just as he said that bright red flames shot up in
the direction of the inn on the highroad which illuminated the sky

Scoundrels cowards shouted the captain I will bet that they have
set fire to the two houses in the marketplace in order to have their
revenge and then they will scuttle off without saying a word They will
be satisfied with having killed a man and setting fire to two houses
All right It shall not pass over like that We must go for them they
will not like to leave their illuminations in order to fight

It would be a great stroke of luck if we could set Pidelot free at the
same time said some one

The five of us set off full of rage and hope In twenty minutes we had
got to the bottom of the coule and had not yet seen anyone when
within a hundred yards of the inn The fire was behind the house and so
all that we saw of it was the reflection above the roof However we
were walking rather slowly as we were afraid of a trap when suddenly
we heard Pidelots wellknown voice It had a strange sound however
for it was at the same time dull and vibrant stifled and clear as if
he was calling out as loud as he could with a gag in his mouth He
seemed to be hoarse and panting and the unlucky fellow kept exclaiming
Help Help

We sent all thoughts of prudence to the devil and in two bounds were at
the back of the inn where a terrible sight met our eyes





IV


Pidelot was being burned alive He was writhing in the middle of a heap
of fagots against a stake to which they had fastened him and the
flames were licking him with their sharp tongues When he saw us his
tongue seemed to stick in his throat he drooped his head and seemed as
if he were going to die It was only the affair of a moment to upset the
burning pile to scatter the embers and to cut the ropes that fastened
him

Poor fellow In what a terrible state we found him The evening before
he had had his left arm broken and it seemed as if he had been badly
beaten since then for his whole body was covered with wounds bruises
and blood The flames had also begun their work on him and he had two
large burns one on his loins and the other on his right thigh and his
beard and his hair were scorched Poor Pidelot

Nobody knows the terrible rage we felt at this sight We would have
rushed headlong at a hundred thousand Prussians Our thirst for
vengeance was intense but the cowards had run away leaving their crime
behind them Where could we find them now Meanwhile however the
captains wife was looking after Pidelot and dressing his wounds as
best she could while the captain himself shook hands with him
excitedly In a few minutes he came to himself

Good morning Captain good morning all of you he said Ah the
scoundrels the wretches Why twenty of them came to surprise us

Twenty do you say

Yes there was a whole band of them and that is why I disobeyed
orders Captain and fired on them for they would have killed you all
So I preferred to stop them That frightened them and they did not
venture to go further than the crossroads They were such cowards Four
of them shot at me at twenty yards as if I had been a target and then
they slashed me with their swords My arm was broken so that I could
only use my bayonet with one hand

But why did you not call for help

I took good care not to do that for you would all have come and you
would neither have been able to defend me nor yourselves being only
five against twenty

You know that we should not have allowed you to have been taken poor
old fellow

I preferred to die by myself dont you see I did not want to bring
you there for it would have been a mere ambush

Well we will not talk about it any more Do you feel rather easier

No I am suffocating I know that I cannot live much longer The
brutes They tied me to a tree and beat me till I was half dead and
then they shook my broken arm but I did not make a sound I would
rather have bitten my tongue out than have called out before them Now I
can say what I am suffering and shed tears it does one good Thank you
my kind friends

Poor Pidelot But we will avenge you you may be sure

Yes yes I want you to do that Especially there is a woman among
them who passes as the wife of the lancer whom the captain killed
yesterday She is dressed like a lancer and it was she who tortured me
the most yesterday and suggested burning me In fact it was she who set
fire to the wood Oh the wretch the bruteAh how I am suffering My
loins my arms and he fell back panting and exhausted writhing in his
terrible agony while the captains wife wiped the perspiration from his
forehead We all shed tears of grief and rage as if we had been
children I will not describe the end to you he died half an hour
later but before that he told us in which direction the enemy had gone
When he was dead we gave ourselves time to bury him and then we set
out in pursuit of them with our hearts full of fury and hatred

We will throw ourselves on the whole Prussian army if it be needful
 the captain said but we will avenge Pidelot We must catch those
scoundrels Let us swear to die rather than not to find them and if I
am killed first these are my orders all the prisoners that you make
are to be shot immediately and as for the lancers wife she is to be
violated before she is put to death

She must not be shot because she is a woman the captains wife said
If you survive I am sure that you would not shoot a woman Outraging
her will be quite sufficient But if you are killed in this pursuit I
want one thing and that is to fight with her I will kill her with my
own hands and the others can do what they like with her if she kills
me

We will outrage her We will burn her We will tear her to pieces
Pidelot shall be avenged an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth

The next morning we unexpectedly fell on an outpost of uhlans four
leagues away Surprised by our sudden attack they were not able to
mount their horses nor even to defend themselves and in a few moments
we had five prisoners corresponding to our own number The captain
questioned them and from their answers we felt certain that they were
the same whom we had encountered the previous day Then a very curious
operation took place One of us was told off to ascertain their sex and
nothing can depict our joy when we discovered what we were seeking among
them the female executioner who had tortured our friend

The four others were shot on the spot with their backs toward us and
close to the muzzles of our rifles and then we turned our attention to
the woman What were we going to do with her I must acknowledge that we
were all of us in favor of shooting her Hatred and the wish to avenge
Pidelot had extinguished all pity in us and we had forgotten that we
were going to shoot a woman But a woman reminded us of it the
captains wife at her entreaties therefore we determined to keep her
a prisoner The captains poor wife was to be severely punished for this
act of clemency

The next day we heard that the armistice had been extended to the
eastern part of France and we had to put an end to our little campaign
Two of us who belonged to the neighborhood returned home So there
remained only four of us all told the captain his wife and two men
We belonged to Besanon which was still being besieged in spite of the
armistice

Let us stop here said the captain I cannot believe that the war is
going to end like this The devil take it Surely there are men still
left in France and now is the time to prove what they are made of The
spring is coming on and the armistice is only a trap laid for the
Prussians During the time that it lasts a new army will be formed and
some fine morning we shall fall upon them again We shall be ready and
we have a hostagelet us remain here

We fixed our quarters there It was terribly cold and we did not go out
much as somebody had always to keep the female prisoner in sight

She was sullen and never spoke save to refer to her husband whom the
captain had killed She looked at him continually with fierce eyes and
we felt that she was tortured by a wild longing for revenge That seemed
to us to be the most suitable punishment for the terrible torments that
she had made Pidelot suffer for impotent vengeance is such intense
pain

Alas we who knew how to avenge our comrade ought to have known that
this woman would find a way to avenge her husband and should have been
on our guard It is true that one of us kept watch every night and that
at first we tied her by a long rope to the great oak bench that was
fastened to the wall But by and by as she had never tried to escape
in spite of her hatred for us we relaxed our extreme prudence and
allowed her to sleep somewhere else and without being tied What had we
to fear She was at the end of the room a man was on guard at the door
and between her and the sentinel the captains wife and two other men
used to lie She was alone and unarmed against four so there could be
no danger

One night when we were asleep and the captain was on guard the
lancers wife was lying more quietly in her corner than usual She had
even smiled during the evening for the first time since she had been our
prisoner Suddenly however in the middle of the night we were
awakened by a terrible cry We got up groping about Scarcely were we
up when we stumbled over a furious couple who were rolling about and
fighting on the ground It was the captain and the lancers wife We
threw ourselves on to them and separated them in a moment She was
shouting and laughing and he seemed to have the death rattle All this
took place in the dark Two of us held her and when a light was struck
a terrible sight met our eyes The captain was lying on the floor in a
pool of blood with an enormous wound in his throat and his sword
bayonet that had been taken from his rifle was sticking in the red
gaping wound A few minutes afterward he died without having been able
to utter a word

His wife did not shed a tear Her eyes were dry her throat was
contracted and she looked at the lancers wife steadfastly and with a
calm ferocity that inspired fear

This woman belongs to me she said to us suddenly You swore to me
not a week ago to let me kill her as I chose if she killed my husband
and you must keep your oath You must fasten her securely to the
fireplace upright against the back of it and then you can go where you
like but far from here I will take my revenge on her to myself Leave
the captains body and we three he she and I will remain here

We obeyed and went away She promised to write to us to Geneva as we
were returning there




VI


Two days later I received the following letter dated the day after we
had left It had been written at an inn on the highroad

My Friend

I am writing to you according to my promise For the moment I am at
this inn where I have just handed my prisoner over to a Prussian
officer

I must tell you my friend that this poor woman left two children in
Germany She had followed her husband whom she adored as she did not
wish him to be exposed to the risks of war by himself and as her
children were with their grandparents I have learned all this since
yesterday and it has turned my ideas of vengeance into more humane
feelings At the very moment when I felt pleasure in insulting this
woman and in threatening her with the most fearful tormentsin
recalling Pidelot who had been burned alive and in threatening her
with a similar death she looked at me coldly and said

Why should you reproach me Frenchwoman You think that you will do
right in avenging your husbands death is not that so

Yes I replied

Very well then in killing him I did what you are going to do in
burning me I avenged my husband for your husband killed him

Well I replied as you approve of this vengeance prepare to endure
it

I do not fear it

And in fact she did not seem to have lost courage Her face was calm
and she looked at me without trembling while I brought wood and dried
leaves together and feverishly threw on to them the powder from some
cartridges to make her funeral pile the more cruel

I hesitated in my thoughts of persecution for a moment But the
captains body was there pale and covered with blood and he seemed to
be looking at me with large glassy eyes and I applied myself to my
work again after kissing his pale lips Suddenly however on raising my
head I saw that she was crying and I felt rather surprised

So you are frightened I said to her

No but when I saw you kiss your husband I thought of mine of all
whom I love

She continued to sob but stopping suddenly she said to me in broken
words and in a low voice

Have you any children

A shiver ran over me for I guessed that this poor woman had some She
asked me to look in a pocketbook which was in her bosom and in it I saw
two photographs of quite young children a boy and a girl with those
kind gentle chubby faces that German children have In it there were
also two locks of light hair and a letter in a large childish hand
beginning with German words which meant My dear little mother

I could not restrain my tears my dear friend and so I untied her and
without venturing to look at the face of my poor dead husband who was
not to be avenged I went with her as far as the inn She is free I
have just left her and she kissed me with tears I am going upstairs to
my husband come as soon as possible my dear friend to look for our
two bodies

I set off with all speed and when I arrived there was a Prussian patrol
at the cottage When I asked what it all meant I was told that there
was a captain of francstireurs and his wife inside both dead I gave
their names they saw that I knew them and I begged to be allowed to
undertake their funeral

Somebody has already undertaken it was the reply Go in if you wish
to as you knew them You can settle about their funeral with their
friend

I went in The captain and his wife were lying side by side on a bed
and were covered by a sheet I raised it and saw that the woman had
inflicted a wound in her throat similar to that from which her husband
had died

At the side of the bed there sat watching and weeping the woman who
had been mentioned to me as their last friend It was the lancers wife




HAUTOT SENIOR AND HAUTOT JUNIOR




I


In front of the building half farmhouse half manorhouse one of those
rural habitations of a mixed character which were all but seigneurial
and which are at the present time occupied by large cultivators the
dogs lashed beside the appletrees in the orchard near the house kept
barking and howling at the sight of the shootingbags carried by the
gamekeepers and the boys In the spacious diningroom kitchen Hautot
Senior and Hautot Junior M Bermont the taxcollector and M Mondaru
the notary were taking a bite and drinking some wine before going out
to shoot for it was the opening day

Hautot Senior proud of all his possessions talked boastfully
beforehand of the game which his guests were going to find on his lands
He was a big Norman one of those powerful ruddy bony men who can
lift wagonloads of apples on their shoulders Half peasant half
gentleman rich respected influential invested with authority he
made his son Csar go as far as the third form at school so that he
might be an educated man and there he had brought his studies to a stop
for fear of his becoming a fine gentleman and paying no attention to the
land

Csar Hautot almost as tall as his father but thinner was a good son
docile content with everything full of admiration respect and
deference for the wishes and opinions of his sire

M Bermont the taxcollector a stout little man who showed on his red
cheeks a thin network of violet veins resembling the tributaries and the
winding courses of rivers on maps asked

And haresare there any hares on it

Hautot Senior answered As many as you like especially in the
Puysatier lands

Which direction shall we begin in asked the notary a jolly notary
fat and pale bigpaunched too and strapped up in an entirely new
hunting costume bought at Rouen

Well that way through these grounds We will drive the partridges
into the plain and we will beat there again

And Hautot Senior rose up They all followed his example took their
guns out of the corners examined the locks stamped with their feet in
order to feel themselves firmer in their boots which were rather hard
not having as yet been rendered flexible by the heat of the blood Then
they went out and the dogs standing erect at the ends of their
leashes gave vent to piercing howls while beating the air with their
paws

They set forth for the lands referred to These consisted of a little
glen or rather a long undulating stretch of inferior soil which had on
that account remained uncultivated furrowed with mountaintorrents
covered with ferns an excellent preserve for game

The sportsmen took up their positions at some distance from each other
Hautot Senior posting himself at the right Hautot Junior at the left
and the two guests in the middle The keeper and those who carried the
gamebags followed It was the anxious moment when the first shot is
awaited when the heart beats a little while the nervous finger keeps
feeling at the trigger every second

Suddenly the shot went off Hautot Senior had fired They all stopped
and saw a partridge breaking off from a covey which was rushing along at
great speed to fall down into a ravine under a thick growth of
brushwood The sportsman becoming excited rushed forward with rapid
strides thrusting aside the briers which stood in his path and
disappeared in his turn into the thicket in quest of his game

Almost at the same instant a second shot was heard

Ha ha the rascal exclaimed M Bermont he will unearth a hare down
there

They all waited with their eyes riveted on the heap of branches through
which their gaze failed to penetrate

The notary making a speakingtrumpet of his hands shouted

Have you got them

Hautot Senior made no response

Then Csar turning toward the keeper said to him

Just go and assist him Joseph We must keep walking in a straight
line Well wait

And Joseph an old stump of a man lean and knotty all of whose joints
formed protuberances proceeded at an easy pace down the ravine
searching at every opening through which a passage could be effected
with the cautiousness of a fox Then suddenly he cried

Oh come come an unfortunate thing has occurred

They all hurried forward plunging through the briers

The elder Hautot who had fallen on his side in a fainting condition
kept both his hands over his stomach from which flowed down upon the
grass through the linen vest torn by the lead long streamlets of blood
As he was laying down his gun in order to seize the partridge within
reach of him he had let the firearm fall and the second discharge
going off with the shock had torn open his entrails They drew him out
of the trench they removed his clothes and they saw a frightful wound
through which the intestines came out Then after having bandaged him
the best way they could they brought him back to his own house and
awaited the doctor who had been sent for as well as a priest

When the doctor arrived he gravely shook his head and turning toward
young Hautot who was sobbing on a chair

My poor boy said he this does not look well

But when the dressing was finished the wounded man moved his fingers
opened his mouth then his eyes cast around him troubled haggard
glances then appeared to search about in his memory to recollect to
understand and he murmured

Ah good God this has done for me

The doctor held his hand

Why no why no some days of rest merelyit will be nothing

Hautot returned

It has done for me My stomach is split open I know it well

Then all of a sudden

I want to talk to the son if I have the time

Hautot Junior in spite of himself shed tears and kept repeating like
a little boy

Ppa ppa poor ppa

But the father in a firmer tone

Come stop cryingthis is not the time for it I have to talk to you
Sit down there quite close to me It will be quickly done and I shall
be more calm As for the rest of you kindly give me one minute

They all went out leaving the father and son face to face

As soon as they were alone

Listen son you are twentyfour years one can say things like this to
you And then there is not such mystery about these matters as we import
into them You know well that your mother has been seven years dead
isnt that so and that I am not more than fortyfive years myself
seeing that I got married at nineteen Is not that true

The son faltered

Yes it is true

So then your mother has been seven years dead and I have remained a
widower Well a man like me cannot remain without a wife at
thirtyeight isnt that true

The son replied

Yes it is true

The father out of breath quite pale and his face contracted with
suffering went on

God what pain I feel Well you understand Man is not made to live
alone but I did not want to take a successor to your mother since I
promised her not to do so Thenyou understand

Yes father

So I kept a young girl at Rouen Rue dEperlan  in the third story
the second doorI tell you all this dont forgetbut a young girl
who has been very nice to me loving devoted a true woman eh You
comprehend my lad

Yes father

So then if I am carried off I owe something to her something
substantial that will place her in a safe position You understand

Yes father

I tell you that she is an honest girl and that but for you and the
remembrance of your mother and again but for the house in which we
three lived I would have brought her here and then married her for
certainlistenlisten my lad I might have made a willI havent
done so I did not wish to do sofor it is not necessary to write down
thingsthings of this sortit is too hurtful to the legitimate
childrenand then it embroils everythingit ruins everyone Look you
the stamped paper theres no need of itnever make use of it If I am
rich it is because I have not made waste of what I have during my own
life You understand my son

Yes father

Listen againlisten well to me So then I have made no willI did
not desire to do soand then I knew what you were you have a good
heart you are not niggardly not too near in any way I said to myself
that when my end approached I would tell you all about it and that I
would beg of you not to forget the girl And then listen again When I
am gone make your way to the place at onceand make such arrangements
that she may not blame my memory You have plenty of means I leave it
to youI leave you enough Listen You wont find her at home every day
in the week She works at Madame Moreaus in the Rue Beauvoisine Go
there on a Thursday That is the day she expects me It has been my day
for the past six years Poor little thing she will weepI say all
this to you because I have known you so well my son One does not tell
these things in public either to the notary or to the priest They
happeneveryone knows thatbut they are not talked about save in case
of necessity Then there is no outsider in the secret nobody except the
family because the family consists of one person alone You
understand

Yes father

Do you promise

Yes father

Do you swear it

Yes father

I beg of you I implore of you so do not forget I bind you to it

No father

You will go yourself I want you to make sure of everything

Yes father

And then you will seeyou will see what she will explain to you As
for me I can say no more to you You have vowed to do it

Yes father

Thats good my son Embrace me Farewell I am going to break up Im
sure Tell them they may come in

Young Hautot embraced his father groaning while he did so then always
docile he opened the door and the priest appeared in a white surplice
carrying the holy oils

But the dying man had closed his eyes and he refused to open them again
he refused to answer he refused to show even by a sign that he
understood

He had spoken enough this man he could speak no more Besides he now
felt his heart calm he wanted to die in peace What need had he to make
a confession to the deputy of God since he had just done so to his son
who constituted his own family

He received the last rites was purified and absolved in the midst of
his friends and his servants on their bended knees without any movement
of his face indicating that he still lived

He expired about midnight after four hours convulsive movements which
showed that he must have suffered dreadfully in his last moments




II


It was on the following Tuesday that they buried him the shooting had
opened on Sunday On his return home after having accompanied his
father to the cemetery Csar Hautot spent the rest of the day weeping
He scarcely slept at all on the following night and he felt so sad on
awakening that he asked himself how he could go on living

However he kept thinking until evening that in order to obey the last
wish of his father he ought to repair to Rouen next day and see this
girl Catholine Donet who resided in the Rue dEperlan in the third
story second door He had repeated to himself in a whisper just as a
little boy repeats a prayer this name and address a countless number of
times so that he might not forget them and he ended by lisping them
continually without being able to stop or to think of what they were
so much were his tongue and his mind possessed by the commission

Accordingly on the following day about eight oclock he ordered
Graindorge to be yoked to the tilbury and set forth at the quick
trotting pace of the heavy Norman horse along the highroad from
Ainville to Rouen He wore his black frockcoat a tall silk hat on his
head and breeches with straps and he did not on account of the
occasion dispense with the handsome costume the blue overalls which
swelled in the wind protecting the cloth from dust and from stains and
which was to be removed quickly the moment he jumped out of the coach

He entered Rouen accordingly just as it was striking ten oclock drew
up as he had usually done at the Htel des BonEnfants in the Rue des
TroisMarcs submitted to the hugs of the landlord and his wife and
their five children for they had heard the melancholy news After that
he had to tell them all the particulars about the accident which caused
him to shed tears to repel all the proffered attentions which they
sought to thrust upon him merely because he was wealthy and to decline
even the breakfast they wanted him to partake of thus wounding their
sensibilities

Then having wiped the dust off his hat brushed his coat and removed
the mud stains from his boots he set forth in search of the Rue
dEperlan without venturing to make inquiries from anyone for fear of
being recognized and arousing suspicions

At length being unable to find the place he saw a priest passing by
and trusting to the professional discretion which churchmen possess he
questioned the ecclesiastic

He had only a hundred steps farther to go it was exactly the second
street to the right

Then he hesitated Up to that moment he had obeyed like a mere animal
the expressed wish of the deceased Now he felt quite agitated
confused humiliated at the idea of finding himselfthe sonin the
presence of this woman who had been his fathers mistress All the
morality which lies buried in our breasts heaped up at the bottom of
our sensuous emotions by centuries of hereditary instruction all that
he had been taught since he had learned his catechism about creatures
of evil life the instinctive contempt which every man entertains for
them even though he may marry one of them all the narrow honesty of
the peasant in his character was stirred up within him and held him
back making him grow red with shame

But he said to himself

I promised the father I must not break my promise

Then he gave a push to the door of the house bearing the number 
which stood ajar discovered a gloomylooking staircase ascended three
flights perceived a door then a second door came upon the string of a
bell and pulled it The ringing which resounded in the apartment
before which he stood sent a shiver through his frame The door was
opened and he found himself facing a young lady very well dressed a
brunette with a fresh complexion who gazed at him with eyes of
astonishment

He did not know what to say to her and she who suspected nothing and
who was waiting for him to speak did not invite him to come in They
stood looking thus at one another for nearly half a minute at the end
of which she said in a questioning tone

You have something to tell me Monsieur

He falteringly replied

I am M Hautots son

She gave a start turned pale and stammered out as if she had known him
for a long time

Monsieur Csar

Yes

And what next

I have come to speak to you on the part of my father

She articulated

Oh my God

She then drew back so that he might enter He shut the door and followed
her into the interior Then he saw a little boy of four or five years
playing with a cat seated on the floor in front of a stove from which
rose the steam of dishes which were being kept hot

Take a seat she said

He sat down

She asked

Well

He no longer ventured to speak keeping his eyes fixed on the table
which stood in the center of the room with three covers laid on it one
of which was for a child He glanced at the chair which had its back
turned to the fire They had been expecting him That was his bread
which he saw and which he recognized near the fork for the crust had
been removed on account of Hautots bad teeth Then raising his eyes
he noticed on the wall his fathers portrait the large photograph taken
at Paris the year of the exhibition the same as that which hung above
the bed in the sleeping apartment at Ainville

The young woman again asked

Well Monsieur Csar

He kept staring at her Her face was livid with anguish and she waited
her hands trembling with fear

Then he took courage

Well Mamzelle papa died on Sunday last just after he had opened the
shooting

She was so much overwhelmed that she did not move After a silence of a
few seconds she faltered in an almost inaudible tone

Oh it is not possible

Then on a sudden tears showed themselves in her eyes and covering her
face with her hands she burst out sobbing

At that point the little boy turned round and seeing his mother
weeping began to howl Then realizing that this sudden trouble was
brought about by the stranger he rushed at Csar caught hold of his
breeches with one hand and with the other hit him with all his strength
on the thigh And Csar remained agitated deeply affected with this
woman mourning for his father at one side of him and the little boy
defending his mother at the other He felt their emotion taking
possession of himself and his eyes were beginning to brim over with the
same sorrow so to recover his selfcommand he began to talk

Yes he said the accident occurred on Sunday at eight oclock

And he told as if she were listening to him all the facts without
forgetting a single detail mentioning the most trivial matters with the
minuteness of a countryman And the child still kept assailing him
making kicks at his ankles

When he came to the time at which his father had spoken about her her
attention was caught by hearing her own name and uncovering her face
she said

Pardon me I was not following you I would like to knowif you do not
mind beginning over again

He related everything at great length with stoppages breaks and
reflections of his own from time to time She listened to him eagerly
now perceiving with a womans keen sensibility all the sudden changes of
fortune which his narrative indicated and trembling with horror every
now and then exclaiming

Oh my God

The little fellow believing that she had calmed down ceased beating
Csar in order to catch his mothers hand and he listened too as if
he understood

When the narrative was finished young Hautot continued

Now we will settle matters together in accordance with his wishes
Listen I am well off he has left me plenty of means I dont want you
to have anything to complain about

But she quickly interrupted him

Oh Monsieur Csar Monsieur Csar not today I am cut to the
heartanother timeanother day No not today If I accept listen
Tis not for myselfno no no I swear to you Tis for the child
Besides this provision will be put to his account

Thereupon Csar scared divined the truth and stammering

So thentis histhe child

Why yes she said

And Hautot Junior gazed at his brother with a confused emotion intense
and painful

After a lengthened silence for she had begun to weep afresh Csar
quite embarrassed went on

Well then Mamzelle Donet I am going When would you wish to talk
this over with me

She exclaimed

Oh no dont go dont go Dont leave me all alone with Emile I
would die of grief I have no longer anyone anyone but my child Oh
what wretchedness what wretchedness Monsieur Csar Stop Sit down
again You will say something more to me You will tell me what he was
doing over there all the week

And Csar resumed his seat accustomed to obey

She drew over another chair for herself in front of the stove where the
dishes had all this time been simmering took Emile upon her knees and
asked Csar a thousand questions about his father with reference to
matters of an intimate nature which made him feel without reasoning on
the subject that she had loved Hautot with all the strength of her
frail womans heart

And by the natural concatenation of his ideaswhich were rather
limited in numberhe recurred once more to the accident and set about
telling the story over again with all the same details

When he said He had a hole in his stomachyou could put your two
fists into it she gave vent to a sort of shriek and the tears gushed
forth again from her eyes

Then seized by the contagion of her grief Csar began to weep too
and as tears always soften the fibers of the heart he bent over Emile
whose forehead was close to his own mouth and kissed him

The mother recovering her breath murmured

Poor lad he is an orphan now

And so am I said Csar

And they ceased to talk

But suddenly the practical instinct of the housewife accustomed to be
thoughtful about many things revived in the young womans breast

You have perhaps taken nothing all the morning Monsieur Csar

No Mamzelle

Oh you must be hungry You will eat a morsel

Thanks he said I am not hungry I have had too much trouble

She replied

In spite of sorrow we must live You will not refuse to let me get
something for you And then you will remain a little longer When you
are gone I dont know what will become of me

He yielded after some further resistance and sitting down with his
back to the fire facing her he ate a plateful of tripe which had been
bubbling in the stove and drank a glass of red wine But he would not
allow her to uncork the bottle of white wine He several times wiped the
mouth of the little boy who had smeared all his chin with sauce

As he was rising up to go he asked

When would you like me to come back to speak about this business to
you Mamzelle Donet

If it is all the same to you say next Thursday Monsieur Csar In
that way I would lose none of my time as I always have my Thursdays
free

That will suit menext Thursday

You will come to lunch Wont you

Oh On that point I cant give you a promise

The reason I suggested it is that people can chat better when they are
eating One has more time too

Well be it so About twelve oclock then And he took his departure
after he had again kissed little Emile and pressed Mademoiselle Donets
hand




III


The week appeared long to Csar Hautot He had never before found
himself alone and the isolation seemed to him insupportable Till now
he had lived at his fathers side just like his shadow followed him
into the fields superintended the execution of his orders and when
they had been a short time separated again met him at dinner They had
spent the evenings smoking their pipes face to face with one another
chatting about horses cows or sheep and the grip of their hands when
they rose up in the morning might have been regarded as a manifestation
of deep family affection on both sides

Now Csar was alone he went vacantly through the process of dressing
the soil in autumn every moment expecting to see the tall gesticulating
silhouette of his father rising up at the end of a plain To kill time
he entered the houses of his neighbors told about the accident to all
who had not heard of it and sometimes repeated it to the others Then
after he had finished his occupations and his reflections he would sit
down at the side of the road asking himself whether this kind of life
was going to last forever

He frequently thought of Mademoiselle Donet He liked her He considered
her thoroughly respectable a gentle and honest young woman as his
father had said Yes undoubtedly she was an honest girl He resolved to
act handsomely toward her and to give her two thousand francs a year
settling the capital on the child He even experienced a certain
pleasure in thinking that he was going to see her on the following
Thursday and arrange this matter with her And then the notion of this
brother this little chap of five who was his fathers son plagued
him annoyed him a little and at the same time excited him He had as
it were a family in this brat sprung from a clandestine alliance who
would never bear the name of Hautot a family which he might take or
leave just as he pleased but which would recall his father

And so when he saw himself on the road to Rouen on Thursday morning
carried along by Graindorge trotting with clattering footbeats he felt
his heart lighter more at peace than he had hitherto felt it since his
bereavement

On entering Mademoiselle Donets apartment he saw the table laid as on
the previous Thursday with the sole difference that the crust had not
been removed from the bread He pressed the young womans hand kissed
Emile on the cheeks and sat down more or less as if he were in his own
house his heart swelling in the same way Mademoiselle Donet seemed to
him a little thinner and paler She must have grieved sorely She wore
now an air of constraint in his presence as if she understood what she
had not felt the week before under the first blow of her misfortune and
she exhibited an excessive deference toward him a mournful humility
and made touching efforts to please him as if to pay him back by her
attentions for the kindness he had manifested toward her They were a
long time at lunch talking over the business which had brought him
there She did not want so much money It was too much She earned
enough to live on herself but she only wished that Emile might find a
few sous awaiting him when he grew big Csar held out however and
even added a gift of a thousand francs for herself for the expense of
mourning

When he had taken his coffee she asked

Do you smoke

YesI have my pipe

He felt in his pocket Good God He had forgotten it He was becoming
quite woebegone about it when she offered him a pipe of his fathers
that had been shut up in a cupboard He accepted it took it up in his
hand recognized it smelled it spoke of its quality in a tone of
emotion filled it with tobacco and lighted it Then he set Emile
astride on his knee and made him play the cavalier while she removed
the tablecloth and put the soiled plates at one end of the sideboard in
order to wash them as soon as he was gone

About three oclock he rose up with regret quite annoyed at the
thought of having to go

Well Mademoiselle Donet he said I wish you good evening and am
delighted to have found you like this

She remained standing before him blushing much affected and gazed at
him while she thought of the other

Shall we not see one another again she said

He replied simply

Why yes Mamzelle if it gives you pleasure

Certainly Monsieur Csar Will next Thursday suit you then

Yes Mademoiselle Donet

You will come to lunch of course

Wellif you are so kind as to invite me I cant refuse

It is understood then Monsieur Csarnext Thursday at twelve the
same as today

Thursday at twelve Mamzelle Donet




NO QUARTER


The broad sunlight threw its burning rays on the fields and under this
shower of flame life burst forth in glowing vegetation from the earth
As far as the eye could see the soil was green and the sky was blue to
the verge of the horizon The Norman farms scattered through the plain
seemed at a distance like little woods inclosed each in a circle of thin
beechtrees Coming closer on opening the wormeaten stile one fancied
that he saw a giant garden for all the old appletrees as knotted as
the peasants were in blossom The weatherbeaten black trunks crooked
twisted ranged along the inclosure displayed beneath the sky their
glittering domes rosy and white The sweet perfume of their blossoms
mingled with the heavy odors of the open stables and with the fumes of
the steaming dunghill covered with hens and their chickens It was
midday The family sat at dinner in the shadow of the peartree planted
before the doorthe father the mother the four children the two
maidservants and the three farm laborers They scarcely uttered a word
Their fare consisted of soup and of a stew composed of potatoes mashed
up in lard

From time to time one of the maidservants rose up and went to the
cellar to fetch a pitcher of cider

The husband a big fellow of about forty stared at a vinetree quite
exposed to view which stood close to the farmhouse twining like a
serpent under the shutters the entire length of the wall

He said after a long silence

The fathers vinetree is blossoming early this year Perhaps it will
bear good fruit

The peasants wife also turned round and gazed at the tree without
speaking

This vinetree was planted exactly in the place where the father of the
peasant had been shot

It was during the war of  The Prussians were in occupation of the
entire country General Faidherbe with the Army of the North was at
their head

Now the Prussian staff had taken up its quarters in this farmhouse The
old peasant who owned it Pre Milon received them and gave them the
best treatment he could

For a whole month the German vanguard remained on the lookout in the
village The French were posted ten leagues away without moving and
yet each night some of the uhlans disappeared

All the isolated scouts those who were sent out on patrol whenever
they started in groups of two or three never came back

They were picked up dead in the morning in a field near a farmyard in
a ditch Their horses even were found lying on the roads with their
throats cut by a saber stroke These murders seemed to have been
accomplished by the same men who could not be discovered

The country was terrorized Peasants were shot on mere information
women were imprisoned attempts were made to obtain revelations from
children by fear

But one morning Pre Milon was found stretched in his stable with a
gash across his face

Two uhlans ripped open were seen lying three kilometers away from the
farmhouse One of them still grasped in his hand his bloodstained
weapon He had fought and defended himself

A council of war having been immediately constituted in the open air
in front of the farmhouse the old man was brought before it

He was sixtyeight years old He was small thin a little crooked with
long hands resembling the claws of a crab His faded hair scanty and
slight like the down on a young duck allowed his scalp to be plainly
seen The brown crimpled skin of his neck showed the big veins which
sank under his jaws and reappeared at his temples He was regarded in
the district as a miser and a hard man in business transactions

He was placed standing between four soldiers in front of the kitchen
table which had been carried out of the house for the purpose Five
officers and the Colonel sat facing him The Colonel was the first to
speak

Pre Milon he said in French since we came here we have had
nothing to say of you but praise You have always been obliging and
even considerate toward us But today a terrible accusation rests on
you and the matter must be cleared up How did you get the wound on
your face

The peasant gave no reply

The Colonel went on

Your silence condemns you Pre Milon But I want you to answer me do
you understand Do you know who has killed the two uhlans who were found
this morning near the crossroads

The old man said in a clear voice

It was I

The Colonel surprised remained silent for a second looking steadfully
at the prisoner Pre Milon maintained his impassive demeanor his air
of rustic stupidity with downcast eyes as if he were talking to his
cure There was only one thing that could reveal his internal agitation
the way in which he slowly swallowed his saliva with a visible effort
as if he were choking

The old peasants familyhis son Jean his daughterinlaw and two
little children stood ten paces behind scared and dismayed

The Colonel continued

Do you know also who killed all the scouts of our army whom we have
found every morning for the past month lying here and there in the
fields

The old man answered with the same brutal impassiveness

It was I

It is you then that killed them all

All of themyes it was I

You alone

I alone

Tell me the way you managed to do it

This time the peasant appeared to be affected the necessity of speaking
at some length incommoded him

I know myself I did it the way I found easiest

The Colonel proceeded

I warn you you must tell me everything You will do well therefore
to make up your mind about it at once How did you begin it

The peasant cast an uneasy glance toward his family who remained in a
listening attitude behind him He hesitated for another second or so
then all of a sudden he came to a resolution on the matter

I came home one night about ten oclock and the next day you were
here You and your soldiers gave me fifty crowns for forage with a cow
and two sheep Said I to myself As long as I get twenty crowns out of
them Ill sell them the value of it But then I had other things in my
heart which Ill tell you about now I came across one of your
cavalrymen smoking his pipe near my dike just behind my barn I went
and took my scythe off the hook and I came back with short steps from
behind while he lay there without hearing anything And I cut off his
head with one stroke like a feather while he only said Oof You have
only to look at the bottom of the pond youll find him there in a coal
bag with a big stone tied to it

I got an idea into my head I took all he had on him from his boots to
his cap and I hid them in the bakehouse in the Martin wood behind the
farmyard

The old man stopped The officers speechless looked at one another
The examination was resumed and this is what they were told

Once he had accomplished this murder the peasant lived with only one
thought To kill the Prussians He hated them with the sly and
ferocious hatred of a countryman who was at the same time covetous and
patriotic He had got an idea into his head as he put it He waited for
a few days

He was allowed to go and come freely to go out and return just as he
pleased as long as he displayed humility submissiveness and
complaisance toward the conquerors

Now every evening he saw the cavalrymen bearing dispatches leaving the
farmhouse and he went out one night after discovering the name of the
village to which they were going and after picking up by associating
with the soldiers the few words of German he needed

He made his way through his farmyard slipped into the wood reached the
bakehouse penetrated to the end of the long passage and having found
the clothes of the soldier which he had hidden there he put them on
Then he went prowling about the fields creeping along keeping to the
slopes so as to avoid observation listening to the least sounds
restless as a poacher

When he believed the time had arrived he took up his position at the
roadside and hid himself in a clump of brushwood He still waited At
length near midnight he heard the galloping of a horses hoofs on the
hard soil of the road The old man put his ear to the ground to make
sure that only one cavalryman was approaching then he got ready

The uhlan came on at a very quick pace carrying some dispatches He
rode forward with watchful eyes and strained ears As soon as he was no
more than ten paces away Pre Milon dragged himself across the road
groaning Hilfe hilfe Help help

The cavalryman drew up recognized a German soldier dismounted believed
that he was wounded leaped down from his horse drew near the prostrate
man never suspecting anything and as he stooped over the stranger he
received in the middle of the stomach the long curved blade of the
saber He sank down without any death throes merely quivering with a
few last shudders

Then the Norman radiant with the mute joy of an old peasant rose up
and merely to please himself cut the dead soldiers throat After that
he dragged the corpse to the dike and threw it in

The horse was quietly waiting for its rider Pre Milon got on the
saddle and started across the plain at the gallop

At the end of an hour he perceived two more uhlans approaching the
staffquarters side by side He rode straight toward them crying
Hilfe hilfe The Prussians let him come on recognizing the uniform
without any distrust

And like a cannon ball the old man shot between the two bringing both
of them to the ground with his saber and a revolver The next thing he
did was to cut the throats of the horsesthe German horses Then
softly he reentered the bakehouse and hid the horse he had ridden
himself in the dark passage There he took off the uniform put on once
more his own old clothes and going to his bed slept till morning

For four days he did not stir out awaiting the close of the open
inquiry as to the cause of the soldiers deaths but on the fifth day
he started out again and by a similar stratagem killed two more
soldiers

Thenceforth he never stopped Each night he wandered about prowled
through the country at random cutting down some Prussians sometimes
here sometimes there galloping through the deserted fields under the
moonlight a lost uhlan a hunter of men Then when he had finished his
task leaving behind him corpses lying along the roads the old horseman
went to the bakehouse where he concealed both the animal and the
uniform About midday he calmly returned to the spot to give the horse a
feed of oats and some water and he took every care of the animal
exacting therefore the hardest work

But the night before his arrest one of the soldiers he attacked put
himself on his guard and cut the old peasants face with a slash of a
saber

He had however killed both of them He had even managed to go back and
hide his horse and put on his everyday garb but when he reached the
stable he was overcome by weakness and was not able to make his way
into the house

He had been found lying on the straw his face covered with blood

When he had finished his story he suddenly lifted his head and glanced
proudly at the Prussian officers

The Colonel tugging at his mustache asked

Have you anything more to say

No nothing more we are quits I killed sixteen not one more not one
less

You know you have to die

I ask for no quarter

Have you been a soldier

Yes I served at one time And tis you killed my father who was a
soldier of the first Emperor not to speak of my youngest son Franois
whom you killed last month near Evreux I owed this to you and Ive
paid you back Tis tit for tat

The officers stared at one another

The old man went on

Eight for my father eight for my sonthat pays it off I sought for
no quarrel with you I dont know you I only know where you came from
You came to my house here and ordered me about as if the house was
yours I have had my revenge and Im glad of it

And stiffening up his old frame he folded his arms in the attitude of a
humble hero

The Prussians held a long conference A captain who had also lost a son
the month before defended the brave old farmer

Then the Colonel rose up and advancing toward Pre Milon he said
lowering his voice

Listen old man There is perhaps one way of saving your lifeit is

But the old peasant was not listening to him and fixing his eyes
directly on the German officer while the wind made the scanty hair move
to and fro on his skull he made a frightful grimace which shriveled up
his pinched countenance scarred by the saberstroke and puffing out
his chest he spat with all his strength right into the Prussians
face

The Colonel stupefied raised his hand and for the second time the
peasant spat in his face

All the officers sprang to their feet and yelled out orders at the same
time

In less than a minute the old man still as impassive as ever was stuck
up against the wall and shot while he cast a smile at Jean his eldest
son and then at his daughterinlaw and the two children who were
staring with terror at the scene




THE ORPHAN


Mademoiselle Source had adopted this boy under very sad circumstances
She was at the time thirtysix years old She was disfigured having in
her infancy slipped off her nurses lap into the fireplace and getting
her face so shockingly burned that it ever afterward presented a
frightful appearance This deformity had made her resolve not to marry
for she did not want any man to marry her for her money

A female neighbor of hers being left a widow during her pregnancy died
in childbirth without leaving a sou Mademoiselle Source took the
newborn child put him out to nurse reared him sent him to a
boardingschool then brought him home in his fourteenth year in order
to have in her empty house somebody who would love her who would look
after her who would make her old age pleasant

She resided on a little property four leagues away from Rennes and she
now dispensed with a servant The expenses having increased to more than
double what they had been since this orphans arrival her income of
three thousand francs was no longer sufficient to support three persons

She attended to the housekeeping and the cooking herself and sent the
boy out on errands letting him further occupy himself with cultivating
the garden He was gentle timid silent and caressing And she
experienced a deep joy a fresh joy at being embraced by him without
any apparent surprise or repugnance being exhibited by him on account of
her ugliness He called her Aunt and treated her as a mother

In the evening they both sat down at the fireside and she got nice
things ready for him She heated some wine and toasted a slice of bread
and it made a charming little meal before going to bed She often took
him on her knees and covered him with kisses murmuring in his ear with
passionate tenderness She called him My little flower my cherub my
adored angel my divine jewel He softly accepted her caresses
concealing his head on the old maids shoulder Although he was now
nearly fifteen years old he had remained small and weak and had a
rather sickly appearance

Sometimes Mademoiselle Source brought him to the city to see two married
female relatives of hers distant cousins who were living in the
suburbs and who were the only members of her family in existence The
two women had always found fault with her for having adopted this boy
on account of the inheritance but for all that they gave her a cordial
welcome having still hopes of getting a share for themselves a third
no doubt if what she possessed were only equally divided

She was happy very happy always taken up with her adopted child She
bought books for him to improve his mind and he devoted himself
ardently to reading

He no longer now climbed on her knees to fondle her as he had formerly
done but instead would go and sit down in his little chair in the
chimneycorner and open a volume The lamp placed at the edge of the
little table above his head shone on his curly hair and on a portion
of his forehead he did not move he did not raise his eyes he did not
make any gesture He read on interested entirely absorbed in the
adventures which formed the subject of the book

She seated opposite to him gazed at him with an eager steady look
astonished at his studiousness jealous often on the point of bursting
into tears

She said to him now and then You will fatigue yourself my treasure
 in the hope that he would raise his head and come across to embrace her
but he did not even answer her he had not heard or understood what she
was saying he paid no attention to anything save what he read in these
pages

For two years he devoured an incalculable number of volumes His
character changed

After this he asked Mademoiselle Source many times for money which she
gave him As he always wanted more she ended by refusing for she was
both regular and energetic and knew how to act rationally when it was
necessary to do so By dint of entreaties he obtained a large sum one
night from her but when he urged her to give him another sum a few days
later she showed herself inflexible and did not give way to him
further in fact

He appeared to be satisfied with her decision

He again became quiet as he had formerly been loving to remain seated
for entire hours without moving plunged in deep reverie He now did
not even talk to Madame Source merely answering her remarks with short
formal words Nevertheless he was agreeable and attentive in his manner
toward her but he never embraced her now

She had by this time grown slightly afraid of him when they sat facing
one another at night at opposite sides of the fireplace She wanted to
wake him up to make him say something no matter what that would break
this dreadful silence which was like the darkness of a wood But he did
not appear to listen to her and she shuddered with the terror of a poor
feeble woman when she had spoken to him five or six times successively
without being able to get a word out of him

What was the matter with him What was going on in that closedup head
When she had been thus two or three hours sitting opposite him she felt
herself getting daft and longed to rush away and to escape into the
open country in order to avoid that mute eternal companionship and also
some vague danger which she could not define but of which she had a
presentiment

She frequently shed tears when she was alone What was the matter with
him When she gave expression to a desire he unmurmuringly carried it
into execution When she wanted to have anything brought to her from the
city he immediately went there to procure it She had no complaint to
make of him no indeed And yet

Another year flitted by and it seemed to her that a new modification
had taken place in the mind of the young man She perceived it she felt
it she divined it How No matter She was sure she was not mistaken
but she could not have explained in what the unknown thoughts of this
strange youth had changed

It seemed to her that till now he had been like a person in a hesitating
frame of mind who had suddenly arrived at a determination This idea
came to her one evening as she met his glance a fixed singular glance
which she had not seen in his face before

Then he commenced to watch her incessantly and she wished she could
hide herself in order to avoid that cold eye riveted on her

He kept staring at her evening after evening for hours together only
averting his eyes when she said utterly unnerved

Do not look at me like that my child

Then he bowed his head

But the moment her back was turned she once more felt that his eye was
upon her Wherever she went he pursued her with his persistent gaze

Sometimes when she was walking in her little garden she suddenly
noticed him squatted on the stump of a tree as if he were lying in wait
for her and again when she sat in front of the house mending stockings
while he was digging some cabbagebed he kept watching her as he
worked in a sly continuous fashion

It was in vain that she asked him

Whats the matter with you my boy For the last three years you have
become very different I dont find you the same Tell me what ails you
and what you are thinking of I beg of you

He invariably replied in a quiet weary tone

Why nothing ails me Aunt

And when she persisted appealing to him thus Ah my child answer me
answer me when I speak to you If you knew what grief you caused me you
would always answer and you would not look at me that way Have you any
trouble Tell me Ill console you he would turn away with a tired
air murmuring

But there is nothing the matter with me I assure you

He had not grown much having always a childish aspect although the
features of his face were those of a man They were however hard and
badly cut He seemed incomplete abortive only half finished and
disquieting as a mystery He was a close impenetrable being in whom
there seemed always to be some active dangerous mental travail taking
place

Mademoiselle Source was quite conscious of all this and she could not
from that time forth sleep at night so great was her anxiety
Frightful terrors dreadful nightmares assailed her She shut herself up
in her own room and barricaded the door tortured by fear

What was she afraid of She could not tell

Fear of everything of the night of the walls of the shadows thrown by
the moon on the white curtains of the windows and above all fear of
him

Why What had she to fear Did she know what it was She could live this
way no longer She felt certain that a misfortune threatened her a
frightful misfortune

She set forth secretly one morning and went into the city to see her
relatives She told them about the matter in a gasping voice The two
women thought she was going mad and tried to reassure her

She said

If you knew the way he looks at me from morning till night He never
takes his eyes off me At times I feel a longing to cry for help to
call in the neighbors so much am I afraid But what could I say to
them He does nothing to me except to keep looking at me

The two female cousins asked

Is he ever brutal to you Does he give you sharp answers

She replied

No never he does everything I wish he works hard he is steady but
I am so frightened I dont mind that much He has something in his head
I am certain of thatquite certain I dont care to remain all alone
like that with him in the country

The relatives scared by her words declared to her that they were
astonished and could not understand her and they advised her to keep
silent about her fears and her plans without however dissuading her
from coming to reside in the city hoping in that way that the entire
inheritance would eventually fall into their hands

They even promised to assist her in selling her house and in finding
another near them

Mademoiselle Source returned home But her mind was so much upset that
she trembled at the slightest noise and her hands shook whenever any
trifling disturbance agitated her

Twice she went again to consult her relatives quite determined now not
to remain any longer in this way in her lonely dwelling At last she
found a little cottage in the suburbs which suited her and privately
she bought it

The signature of the contract took place on a Tuesday morning and
Mademoiselle Source devoted the rest of the day to the preparations for
her change of residence

At eight oclock in the evening she got into the diligence which passed
within a few hundred yards of her house and she told the conductor to
let her down in the place where it was his custom to stop for her The
man called out to her as he whipped his horses

Good evening Mademoiselle Sourcegood night

She replied as she walked on

Good evening Pre Joseph Next morning at half past seven the
postman who conveyed letters to the village noticed at the crossroad
not far from the highroad a large splash of blood not yet dry He said
to himself Hallo some boozer must have been bleeding from the nose

But he perceived ten paces farther on a pockethandkerchief also stained
with blood He picked them up The linen was fine and the postman in
alarm made his way over to the dike where he fancied he saw a strange
object

Mademoiselle Source was lying at the foot on the grass her throat cut
open with a knife

An hour later the gendarmes the examining magistrate and other
authorities made an inquiry as to the cause of death

The two female relatives called as witnesses told all about the old
maids fears and her last plans

The orphan was arrested Since the death of the woman who had adopted
him he wept from morning till night plunged at least to all
appearance in the most violent grief

He proved that he had spent the evening up to eleven oclock in a cafe
Ten persons had seen him having remained there till his departure

Now the driver of the diligence stated that he had set down the murdered
woman on the road between half past nine and ten oclock

The accused was acquitted A will a long time made which had been left
in the hands of a notary in Rennes made him universal legatee So he
inherited everything

For a long time the people of the country put him into quarantine as
they still suspected him His house which was that of the dead woman
was looked upon as accursed People avoided him in the street

But he showed himself so goodnatured so open so familiar that
gradually these horrible doubts were forgotten He was generous
obliging ready to talk to the humblest about anything as long as they
cared to talk to him

The notary Matre Rameay was one of the first to take his part
attracted by his smiling loquacity He said one evening at a dinner at
the taxcollectors house

A man who speaks with such facility and who is always in goodhumor
could not have such a crime on his conscience

Touched by this argument the others who were present reflected and
they recalled to mind the long conversations with this man who made them
stop almost by force at the road corners to communicate his ideas to
them who insisted on their going into his house when they were passing
by his garden who could crack a joke better than the lieutenant of the
gendarmes himself and who possessed such contagious gaiety that in
spite of the repugnance with which he inspired them they could not keep
from always laughing when in his company

All doors were opened to him after a time

He is today the mayor of his own community




A LIVELY FRIEND


They had beer constantly in each others society for a whole winter in
Paris After having lost sight of each other as generally happens in
such cases after leaving college the two friends met again one night
long years after already old and whitehaired the one a bachelor the
other married

M de Meroul lived six months in Paris and six months in his little
chteau at Tourbeville Having married the daughter of a gentleman in
the district he had lived a peaceful happy life with the indolence of
a man who has nothing to do With a calm temperament and a sedate mind
without any intellectual audacity or tendency toward revolutionary
independence of thought he passed his time in mildly regretting the
past in deploring the morals and the institutions of today and in
repeating every moment to his wife who raised her eyes to heaven and
sometimes her hands also in token of energetic assent

Under what a government do we live great God

Madame de Meroul mentally resembled her husband just as if they had
been brother and sister She knew by tradition that one ought first of
all to reverence the Pope and the King

And she loved them and respected them from the bottom of her heart
without knowing them with a poetic exaltation with a hereditary
devotion with all the sensibility of a wellborn woman She was kindly
in every feeling of her soul She had no child and was incessantly
regretting it

When M de Meroul came across his old schoolfellow Joseph Mouradour at a
ball he experienced from this meeting a profound and genuine delight
for they had been very fond of one another in their youth

After exclamations of astonishment over the changes caused by age in
their bodies and their faces they had asked one another a number of
questions as to their respective careers

Joseph Mouradour a native of the south of France had become a
councillorgeneral in his own neighborhood Frank in his manners he
spoke briskly and without any circumspection telling all his thoughts
with sheer indifference to prudential considerations He was a
Republican of that race of goodnatured Republicans who make their own
ease the law of their existence and who carry freedom of speech to the
verge of brutality

He called at his friends address in Paris and was immediately a
favorite on account of his easy cordiality in spite of his advanced
opinions Madame de Meroul exclaimed

What a pity such a charming man

M de Meroul said to his friend in a sincere and confidential tone
You cannot imagine what a wrong you do to our country He was attached
to his friend nevertheless for no bonds are more solid than those of
childhood renewed in later life Joseph Mouradour chaffed the husband
and wife called them my loving turtles and occasionally gave vent to
loud declarations against people who were behind the age against all
sorts of prejudices and traditions

When he thus directed the flood of his democratic eloquence the married
pair feeling ill at ease kept silent through a sense of propriety and
goodbreeding then the husband tried to turn off the conversation in
order to avoid any friction Joseph Mouradour did not want to know
anyone unless he was free to say what he liked

Summer came round The Merouls knew no greater pleasure than to receive
their old friends in their country house at Tourbeville It was an
intimate and healthy pleasure the pleasure of homely gentlefolk who had
spent most of their lives in the country They used to go to the nearest
railway station to meet some of their guests and drove them to the
house in their carriage watching for compliments on their district on
the rapid vegetation on the condition of the roads in the department
on the cleanliness of the peasants houses on the bigness of the cattle
they saw in the fields on everything that met the eye as far as the
edge of the horizon

They liked to have it noticed that their horse trotted in a wonderful
manner for an animal employed a part of the year in fieldwork and they
awaited with anxiety the newcomers opinion on their family estate
sensitive to the slightest word grateful for the slightest gracious
attention

Joseph Mouradour was invited and he announced his arrival The wife and
the husband came to meet the train delighted to have the opportunity of
doing the honors of their house

As soon as he perceived them Joseph Mouradour jumped out of his
carriage with a vivacity which increased their satisfaction He grasped
their hands warmly congratulated them and intoxicated them with
compliments

He was quite charming in his manner as they drove along the road to the
house he expressed astonishment at the height of the trees the
excellence of the crops and the quickness of the horse

When he placed his foot on the steps in front of the chateau M de
Meroul said to him with a certain friendly solemnity

Now you are at home

Joseph Mouradour answered Thanks old fellow I counted on that For
my part besides I never put myself out with my friends Thats the
only hospitality I understand

Then he went up to his own room where he put on the costume of a
peasant as he was pleased to describe it and he came down again not
very long after attired in blue linen with yellow boots in the
careless rigout of a Parisian out for a holiday He seemed too to
have become more common more jolly more familiar having assumed along
with his wouldbe rustic garb a free and easy swagger which he thought
suited the style of dress His new apparel somewhat shocked M and
Madame de Meroul who even at home on their estate always remained
serious and respectable as the particle de before their name exacted
a certain amount of ceremonial even with their intimate friends

After lunch they went to visit the farms and the Parisian stupefied the
respectable peasants by talking to them as if he were a comrade of
theirs

In the evening the cur dined at the housea fat old priest wearing
his Sunday suit who had been specially asked that day in order to meet
the newcomer

When Joseph saw him he made a grimace then he stared at the priest in
astonishment as if he belonged to some peculiar race of beings the like
of which he had never seen before at such close quarters He told a few
stories allowable enough with a friend after dinner but apparently
somewhat out of place in the presence of an ecclesiastic He did not
say Monsieur lAbb but merely Monsieur and he embarrassed the
priest with philosophical views as to the various superstitions that
prevailed on the surface of the globe

He remarked

Your God Monsieur is one of those persons whom we must respect but
also one of those who must be discussed Mine is called Reason he has
from time immemorial been the enemy of yours

The Merouls greatly put out attempted to divert his thoughts The cur
left very early

Then the husband gently remarked

You went a little too far with that priest

But Joseph immediately replied

Thats a very good joke too Am I to bother my brains about a
devildodger At any rate do me the favor of not ever again having such
an old fogy to dinner Confound his impudence

But my friend remember his sacred character

Joseph Mouradour interrupted him

Yes I know We must treat them like girls who get roses for being well
behaved Thats all right my boy When these people respect my
convictions I will respect theirs

This was all that happened that day

Next morning Madame de Meroul on entering her drawingroom saw lying
on the table three newspapers which made her draw back in horror Le
Voltaire La Rpublique Franaise and La Justice

Presently Joseph Mouradour still in his blue blouse appeared on the
threshold reading LIntransigant attentively He exclaimed

Here is a splendid article by Rochefort That fellow is marvelous

He read the article in a loud voice laying so much stress on its most
striking passages that he did not notice the entrance of his friend

M de Meroul had a paper in each hand Le Gaulois for himself and Le
Clarion for his wife

The ardent prose of the masterwriter who overthrew the empire
violently declaimed recited in the accent of the south rang through
the peaceful drawingroom shook the old curtains with their rigid
folds seemed to splash the walls the large upholstered chairs the
solemn furniture fixed in the same position for the past century with a
hail of words rebounding impudent ironical and crushing

The husband and the wife the one standing the other seated listened
in a state of stupor so scandalized that they no longer even ventured
to make a gesture Mouradour flung out the concluding passage in the
article as one sets off a stream of fireworks then in an emphatic tone
he remarked

Thats a stinger eh

But suddenly he perceived the two prints belonging to his friend and he
seemed himself for a moment overcome with astonishment Then he came
across to his host with great strides demanding in an angry tone

What do you want to do with these papers

M de Meroul replied in a hesitating voice

Why thesethese are mymy newspapers

Your newspapers Look here now you are only laughing at me You will
do me the favor to read mine to stir you up with a few new ideas and
as for yoursthis is what I do with them

And before his host filled with confusion could prevent him he seized
the two newspapers and flung them out through the window Then he
gravely placed La Justice in the hands of Madame de Meroul and Le
Voltaire in those of her husband himself sinking into an armchair to
finish LIntransigant

The husband and the wife through feelings of delicacy made a show of
reading a little then they handed back the Republican newspapers which
they touched with their fingertips as if they had been poisoned

Then Mouradour burst out laughing and said

A week of this sort of nourishment and Ill have you converted to my
ideas

At the end of a week in fact he ruled the house He had shut the door
on the cur whom Madame de Meroul went to see in secret He gave orders
that neither the Gaulois nor the Clarion were to be admitted into
the house which a manservant went to get in a mysterious fashion at the
postoffice and which on his entrance were hidden away under the sofa
cushions He regulated everything just as he liked always charming
always goodnatured a jovial and allpowerful tyrant

Other friends were about to come on a visit religious people with
Legitimist opinions The master and mistress of the chateau considered
it would be impossible to let them meet their lively guest and not
knowing what to do announced to Joseph Mouradour one evening that they
were obliged to go away from home for a few days about a little matter
of business and they begged of him to remain in the house alone

He showed no trace of emotion and replied

Very well tis all the same to me Ill wait here for you as long as
you like What I say is thisthere need be no ceremony between friends
Youre quite right to look after your own affairswhy the devil
shouldnt you Ill not take offense at your doing that quite the
contrary It only makes me feel quite at my ease with you Go my
friendsIll wait for you

M and Madame de Meroul started next morning

He is waiting for them




THE BLIND MAN


How is it that the sunlight gives us such joy Why does this radiance
when it falls on the earth fill us so much with the delight of living
The sky is all blue the fields are all green the houses all white and
our ravished eyes drink in those bright colors which bring mirthfulness
to our souls And then there springs up in our hearts a desire to dance
a desire to run a desire to sing a happy lightness of thought a sort
of enlarged tenderness we feel a longing to embrace the sun

The blind as they sit in the doorways impassive in their eternal
darkness remain as calm as ever in the midst of this fresh gaiety and
not comprehending what is taking place around them they continue every
moment to stop their dogs from gamboling

When at the close of the day they are returning home on the arm of a
young brother or a little sister if the child says It was a very fine
day the other answers I could notice that twas fine Lulu wouldnt
keep quiet

I have known one of these men whose life was one of the most cruel
martyrdoms that could possibly be conceived

He was a peasant the son of a Norman farmer As long as his father and
mother lived he was more or less taken care of he suffered little save
from his horrible infirmity but as soon as the old people were gone a
life of atrocious misery commenced for him A dependent on a sister of
his everybody in the farmhouse treated him as a beggar who is eating
the bread of others At every meal the very food he swallowed was made a
subject of reproach against him he was called a drone a clown and
although his brotherinlaw had taken possession of his portion of the
inheritance the soup was given to him grudginglyjust enough to save
him from dying

His face was very pale and his two big white eyes were like wafers He
remained unmoved in spite of the insults inflicted upon him so shut up
in himself that one could not tell whether he felt them at all

Moreover he had never known any tenderness his mother had always
treated him very unkindly caring scarcely at all for him for in
country places the useless are obnoxious and the peasants would be
glad like hens to kill the infirm of their species

As soon as the soup had been gulped down he went to the door in summer
time and sat down to the chimneycorner in winter time and after
that never stirred till night He made no gesture no movement only
his eyelids quivering from some nervous affection fell down sometimes
over his white sightless orbs Had he any intellect any thinking
faculty any consciousness of his own existence Nobody cared to inquire
as to whether he had or no

For some years things went on in this fashion But his incapacity for
doing anything as well as his impassiveness eventually exasperated his
relatives and he became a laughingstock a sort of martyred buffoon a
prey given over to native ferocity to the savage gaiety of the brutes
who surrounded him

It is easy to imagine all the cruel practical jokes inspired by his
blindness And in order to have some fun in return for feeding him
they now converted his meals into hours of pleasure for the neighbors
and of punishment for the helpless creature himself

The peasants from the nearest houses came to this entertainment it was
talked about from door to door and every day the kitchen of the
farmhouse was full of people For instance they put on the table in
front of his plate when he was beginning to take the soup a cat or a
dog The animal instinctively scented out the mans infirmity and
softly approaching commenced eating noiselessly lapping up the soup
daintily and when a rather loud licking of the tongue awakened the
poor fellows attention it would prudently scamper away to avoid the
blow of the spoon directed at it by the blind man at random

Then the spectators huddled against the walls burst out laughing
nudged each other and stamped their feet on the floor And he without
ever uttering a word would continue eating with the aid of his right
hand while stretching out his left to protect and defend his plate

At another time they made him chew corks bits of wood leaves or even
filth which he was unable to distinguish

After this they got tired even of these practical jokes and the
brotherinlaw mad at having to support him always struck him cuffed
him incessantly laughing at the useless efforts of the other to ward
off or return the blows Then came a new pleasurethe pleasure of
smacking his face And the plowmen the servantgirls and even every
passing vagabond were every moment giving him cuffs which caused his
eyelashes to twitch spasmodically He did not know where to hide himself
and remained with his arms always held out to guard against people
coming too close to him

At last he was forced to beg

He was placed somewhere on the highroad on marketdays and as soon as
he heard the sound of footsteps or the rolling of a vehicle he reached
out his hat stammering

Charity if you please

But the peasant is not lavish and for whole weeks he did not bring
back a sou

Then he became the victim of furious pitiless hatred And this is how
he died

One winter the ground was covered with snow and it froze horribly Now
his brotherinlaw led him one morning at this season a great distance
along the highroad in order that he might solicit alms The blind man
was left there all day and when night came on the brotherinlaw told
the people of his house that he could find no trace of the mendicant
Then he added

Pooh best not bother about him He was cold and got some one to take
him away Never fear hes not lost Hell turn up soon enough tomorrow
to eat the soup

Next day he did not come back

After long hours of waiting stiffened with the cold feeling that he
was dying the blind man began to walk Being unable to find his way
along the road owing to its thick coating of ice he went on at random
falling into dikes getting up again without uttering a sound his sole
object being to find some house where he could take shelter

But by degrees the descending snow made a numbness steal over him and
his feeble limbs being incapable of carrying him farther he had to sit
down in the middle of an open field He did not get up again

The white flakes which kept continually falling buried him so that his
body quite stiff and stark disappeared under the incessant
accumulation of their rapidly thickening mass and nothing any longer
indicated the place where the corpse was lying

His relatives made pretense of inquiring about him and searching for him
for about a week They even made a show of weeping

The winter was severe and the thaw did not set in quickly Now one
Sunday on their way to mass the farmers noticed a great flight of
crows who were whirling endlessly above the open field and then like
a shower of black rain descended in a heap at the same spot ever going
and coming

The following week these gloomy birds were still there There was a
crowd of them up in the air as if they had gathered from all corners of
the horizon and they swooped down with a great cawing into the shining
snow which they filled curiously with patches of black and in which
they kept rummaging obstinately A young fellow went to see what they
were doing and discovered the body of the blind man already half
devoured mangled His wan eyes had disappeared pecked out by the long
voracious beaks

And I can never feel the glad radiance of sunlit days without sadly
remembering and gloomily pondering over the fate of the beggar so
deprived of joy in life that his horrible death was a relief for all
those who had known him




THE IMPOLITE SEX


MADAME DE X TO MADAME DE L

ETRETAT Friday

MY DEAR AUNTI am going to pay you a visit without making much fuss
about it I shall be at Les Fresnes on the second of September the day
before the hunting season opens I do not want to miss it so that I may
tease these gentlemen You are very obliging Aunt and I would like you
to allow them to dine with you as you usually do when there are no
strange guests without dressing or shaving for the occasion on the
ground that they are fatigued

They are delighted of course when I am not present But I shall be
there and I shall hold a review like a general at the dinnerhour
and if I find a single one of them at all careless in dress no matter
how little I mean to send him down to the kitchen to the servantmaids

The men of today have so little consideration for others and so little
good manners that one must be always severe with them We live indeed in
an age of vulgarity When they quarrel with one another they attack one
another with insults worthy of street porters and in our presence
they do not conduct themselves even as well as our servants It is at
the seaside that you see this most clearly They are to be found there
in battalions and you can judge them in the lump Oh what coarse
beings they are

Just imagine in a train one of them a gentleman who looked well as I
thought at first sight thanks to his tailor was dainty enough to take
off his boots in order to put on a pair of old shoes Another an old
man who was probably some wealthy upstart these are the most
illbred while sitting opposite to me had the delicacy to place his
two feet on the seat quite close to me This is a positive fact

At the wateringplaces there is an unrestrained outpouring of
unmannerliness I must here make one admissionthat my indignation is
perhaps due to the fact that I am not accustomed to associate as a rule
with the sort of people one comes across here for I should be less
shocked by their manners if I had the opportunity of observing them
oftener In the inquiryoffice of the hotel I was nearly thrown down by
a young man who snatched the key over my head Another knocked against
me so violently without begging my pardon or lifting his hat coming
away from a ball at the Casino that he gave me a pain in the chest It
is the same way with all of them Watch them addressing ladies on the
terrace they scarcely ever bow They merely raise their hands to their
headgear But indeed as they are all more or less bald it is the best
plan

But what exasperates and disgusts me especially is the liberty they take
of talking publicly without any precaution whatsoever about the most
revolting adventures When two men are together they relate to each
other in the broadest language and with the most abominable comments
really horrible stories without caring in the slightest degree whether
a womans ear is within reach of their voices Yesterday on the beach
I was forced to go away from the place where I sat in order not to be
any longer the involuntary confidant of an obscene anecdote told in
such immodest language that I felt as much humiliated as I was indignant
at having heard it Would not the most elementary goodbreeding have
taught them to speak in a lower tone about such matters when we are near
at hand Etretat is moreover the country of gossip and scandal From
five to seven oclock you can see people wandering about in quest of
nasty stories about others which they retail from group to group As
you remarked to me my dear Aunt tittletattle is the mark of petty
individuals and petty minds It is also the consolation of women who are
no longer loved or sought after It is enough for me to observe the
women who are fondest of gossiping to be persuaded that you are quite
right

The other day I was present at a musical evening at the Casino given by
a remarkable artist Madame Masson who sings in a truly delightful
manner I took the opportunity of applauding the admirable Coquelin as
well as two charming boarders of the Vaudeville M and Meillet I
was able on the occasion to see all the bathers collected together
this year on the beach There were not many persons of distinction among
them

One day I went to lunch at Yport I noticed a tall man with a beard who
was coming out of a large house like a castle It was the painter Jean
Paul Laurens He is not satisfied apparently with imprisoning the
subjects of his pictures he insists on imprisoning himself

Then I found myself seated on the shingle close to a man still young of
gentle and refined appearance who was reading some verses But he read
them with such concentration with such passion I may say that he did
not even raise his eyes toward me I was somewhat astonished and I
asked the conductor of the baths without appearing to be much
concerned the name of this gentleman I laughed inwardly a little at
this reader of rhymes he seemed behind the age for a man This person
I thought must be a simpleton Well Aunt I am now infatuated about
this stranger Just fancy his name is Sully Prudhomme I turned round
to look at him at my ease just where I sat His face possesses the two
qualities of calmness and elegance As somebody came to look for him I
was able to hear his voice which is sweet and almost timid He would
certainly not tell obscene stories aloud in public or knock against
ladies without apologizing He is sure to be a man of refinement but
his refinement is of an almost morbid vibrating character I will try
this winter to get an introduction to him

I have no more news to tell you my dear Aunt and I must interrupt this
letter in haste as the posthour is near I kiss your hands and your
cheeks

Your devoted niece

BERTHE DE X

PSI should add however by way of justification of French
politeness that our fellowcountrymen are when traveling models of
good manners in comparison with the abominable English who seem to have
been brought up by stableboys so much do they take care not to
incommode themselves in any way while they always incommode their
neighbors


MADAME DE L TO MADAME DE X

LES FRESNES Saturday

My dear childMany of the things you have said to me are very
reasonable but that does not prevent you from being wrong Like you I
used formerly to feel very indignant at the impoliteness of men who as
I supposed constantly treated me with neglect but as I grew older and
reflected on everything putting aside coquetry and observing things
without taking any part in them myself I perceived this muchthat if
men are not always polite women are always indescribably rude

We imagine that we should be permitted to do anything my darling and
at the same time we consider that we have a right to the utmost respect
and in the most flagrant manner we commit actions devoid of that
elementary goodbreeding of which you speak with passion

I find on the contrary that men have for us much consideration as
compared with our bearing toward them Besides darling men must needs
be and are what we make them In a state of society where women are
all true gentlewomen all men would become gentlemen

Mark my words just observe and reflect

Look at two women meeting in the street What an attitude each assumes
toward the other What disparaging looks What contempt they throw into
each glance How they toss their heads while they inspect each other to
find something to condemn And if the footpath is narrow do you think
one woman will make room for another or will beg pardon as she sweeps
by Never When two men jostle each other by accident in some narrow
lane each of them bows and at the same time gets out of the others
way while we women press against each other stomach to stomach face
to face insolently staring each other out of countenance

Look at two women who are acquaintances meeting on a staircase before
the drawingroom door of a friend of theirs to whom one has just paid a
visit and to whom the other is about to pay a visit They begin to talk
to each other and block up the passage If anyone happens to be coming
up behind them man or woman do you imagine that they will put
themselves half an inch out of their way Never never

I was waiting myself with my watch in my hands one day last winter at
a certain drawingroom door Behind me two gentlemen were also waiting
without showing any readiness to lose their temper like me The reason
was that they had long grown accustomed to our unconscionable insolence

The other day before leaving Paris I went to dine with no less a
person than your husband in the ChampsElysees in order to enjoy the
open air Every table was occupied The waiter asked us not to go and
there would soon be a vacant table

At that moment I noticed an elderly lady of noble figure who having
paid the amount of her check seemed on the point of going away She saw
me scanned me from head to foot and did not budge For more than a
full quarter of an hour she sat there immovable putting on her gloves
and calmly staring at those who were waiting like myself Now two young
men who were just finishing their dinner having seen me in their turn
quickly summoned the waiter in order to pay whatever they owed and at
once offered me their seats even insisting on standing while waiting
for their change And bear in mind my fair niece that I am no longer
pretty like you but old and whitehaired

It is we do you see who should be taught politeness and the task
would be such a difficult one that Hercules himself would not be equal
to it You speak to me about Etretat and about the people who indulge
in tittletattle along the beach of that delightful wateringplace It
is a spot now lost to me a thing of the past but I found much
amusement there in days gone by

There were only a few of us people in good society really good
society and a few artists and we all fraternized We paid little
attention to gossip in those days

Well as we had no insipid Casino where people only gather for show
where they talk in whispers where they dance stupidly where they
succeed in thoroughly boring one another we sought some other way of
passing our evenings pleasantly Now just guess what came into the head
of one of our husbandry Nothing less than to go and dance each night in
one of the farmhouses in the neighborhood

We started out in a group with a streetorgan generally played by Le
Poittevin the painter with a cotton nightcap on his head Two men
carried lanterns We followed in procession laughing and chattering
like a pack of fools

We woke up the farmer and his servantmaids and laboring men We got
them to make onionsoup horror and we danced under the appletrees
to the sound of the barrelorgan The cocks waking up began to crow in
the darkness of the outhouses the horses began prancing on the straw of
their stables The cool air of the country caressed our cheeks with the
smell of grass and of newmown hay

How long ago it is How long ago it is It is thirty years since then

I do not want you my darling to come for the opening of the hunting
season Why spoil the pleasure of our friends by inflicting on them
fashionable toilettes after a day of vigorous exercise in the country
This is the way child that men are spoiled I embrace you

Your old aunt

GENEVIEVE DE L




THE CAKE


Let us say that her name was Madame Anserre so as not to reveal her real
name

She was one of those Parisian comets which leave as it were a trail of
fire behind them She wrote verses and novels she had a poetic heart
and was rarely beautiful She opened her doors to very fewonly to
exceptional people those who are commonly described as princes of
something or other To be a visitor at her house constituted a claim a
genuine claim to intellect at least this was the estimate set on her
invitations Her husband played the part of an obscure satellite To be
the husband of a comet is not an easy thing This husband had however
an original idea that of creating a State within a State of possessing
a merit of his own a merit of the second order it is true but he did
in fact in this fashion on the days when his wife held receptions
hold receptions also on his own account He had his special set who
appreciated him listened to him and bestowed on him more attention
than they did on his brilliant partner

He had devoted himself to agricultureto agriculture in the Chamber
There are in the same way generals in the Chamberthose who are born
who live and who die on the round leather chairs of the War Office
are all of this sort are they not Sailors in the Chamberviz in
the Admiraltycolonizers in the Chamber etc etc So he had studied
agriculture had studied it deeply indeed in its relations to the
other sciences to political economy to the Fine Artswe dress up the
Fine Arts with every kind of science and we even call the horrible
railway bridges works of art At length he reached the point when it
was said of him He is a man of ability He was quoted in the
technical reviews his wife had succeeded in getting him appointed a
member of a committee at the Ministry of Agriculture

This latest glory was quite sufficient for him

Under the pretext of diminishing the expenses he sent out invitations
to his friends for the day when his wife received hers so that they
associated together or rather did notthey formed two distinct groups
Madame with her escort of artists academicians and ministers
occupied a kind of gallery furnished and decorated in the style of the
Empire Monsieur generally withdrew with his agriculturists into a
smaller portion of the house used as a smokingroom and ironically
described by Madame Anserre as the Salon of Agriculture

The two camps were clearly separate Monsieur without jealousy
moreover sometimes penetrated into the Academy and cordial
handshakings were exchanged but the Academy entertained infinite
contempt for the Salon of Agriculture and it was rarely that one of the
princes of science of thought or of anything else mingled with the
agriculturists

These receptions occasioned little expensea cup of tea a cake that
was all Monsieur at an earlier period had claimed two cakes one for
the Academy and one for the agriculturists but Madame having rightly
suggested that this way of acting seemed to indicate two camps two
receptions two parties Monsieur did not press the matter so that they
used only one cake of which Madame Anserre did the honors at the
Academy and which then passed into the Salon de Agriculture

Now this cake was soon for the Academy a subject of observation well
calculated to arouse curiosity Madame Anserre never cut it herself
That function always fell to the lot of one or other of the illustrious
guests The particular duty which was supposed to carry with it
honorable distinction was performed by each person for a pretty long
period in one case for three months scarcely ever for more and it was
noticed that the privilege of cutting the cake carried with it a heap
of other marks of superioritya sort of royalty or rather very
accentuated viceroyalty

The reigning cutter spoke in a haughty tone with an air of marked
command and all the favors of the mistress of the house were for him
alone

These happy individuals were in moments of intimacy described in hushed
tones behind doors as the favorites of the cake and every change of
favorite introduced into the Academy a sort of revolution The knife was
a scepter the pastry an emblem the chosen ones were congratulated The
agriculturists never cut the cake Monsieur himself was always excluded
although he ate his share

The cake was cut in succession by poets by painters and by novelists
A great musician had the privilege of measuring the portions of the cake
for some time an ambassador succeeded him Sometimes a man less well
known but elegant and sought after one of those who are called
according to the different epochs true gentleman or perfect
knight or dandy or something else seated himself in his turn
before the symbolic cake Each of them during this ephemeral reign
exhibited greater consideration toward the husband then when the hour
of his fall had arrived he passed on the knife toward the other and
mingled once more with the crowd of followers and admirers of the
beautiful Madame Anserre

This state of things lasted a long time but comets do not always shine
with the same brilliance Everything gets worn out in society One would
have said that gradually the eagerness of the cutters grew feebler they
seemed to hesitate at times when the tray was held out to them this
office once so much coveted became less and less desired It was
retained for a shorter time they appeared to be less proud of it

Madame Anserre was prodigal of smiles and civilities Alas no one was
found any longer to cut it voluntarily The newcomers seemed to decline
the honor The old favorites reappeared one by one like dethroned
princes who have been replaced for a brief spell in power Then the
chosen ones became few very few For a month oh prodigy M Anserre
cut open the cake then he looked as if he were getting tired of it and
one evening Madame Anserre the beautiful Madame Anserre was seen
cutting it herself But this appeared to be very wearisome to her and
next day she urged one of her guests so strongly to do it that he did
not dare to refuse

The symbol was too well known however the guests stared at one another
with scared anxious faces To cut the cake was nothing but the
privileges to which this favor had always given a claim now frightened
people therefore the moment the dish made its appearance the
academicians rushed pellmell into the Salon of Agriculture as if to
shelter themselves behind the husband who was perpetually smiling And
when Madame Anserre in a state of anxiety presented herself at the
door with a cake in one hand and the knife in the other they all seemed
to form a circle around her husband as if to appeal to him for
protection

Some years more passed Nobody cut the cake now but yielding to an old
inveterate habit the lady who had always been gallantly called the
beautiful Madame Anserre looked out each evening for some devotee to
take the knife and each time the same movement took place around her a
general flight skillfully arranged and full of combined maneuvers that
showed great cleverness in order to avoid the offer that was rising to
her lips

But one evening a young man presented himself at her receptionan
innocent unsophisticated youth He knew nothing about the mystery of
the cake accordingly when it appeared and when all the rest ran away
when Madame Anserre took from the manservants hands the dish and the
pastry he remained quietly by her side

She thought that perhaps he knew about the matter she smiled and in a
tone which showed some emotion said

Will you be kind enough dear Monsieur to cut this cake

He displayed the utmost readiness and took off his gloves flattered at
such an honor being conferred on him

Oh to be sure Madame with the greatest pleasure

Some distance away in the corner of the gallery in the frame of the
door which led into the Salon of the Agriculturists faces which
expressed utter amazement were staring at him Then when the spectators
saw the newcomer cutting without any hesitation they quickly came
forward

An old poet jocosely slapped the neophyte on the shoulder

Bravo young man he whispered in his ear

The others gazed at him with curiosity Even the husband appeared to be
surprised As for the young man he was astonished at the consideration
which they suddenly seemed to show toward him above all he failed to
comprehend the marked attentions the manifest favor and the species of
mute gratitude which the mistress of the house bestowed on him

It appears however that he eventually found out

At what moment in what place was the revelation made to him Nobody
could tell but when he again presented himself at the reception he
had a preoccupied air almost a shamefaced look and he cast around him
a glance of uneasiness

The bell rang for tea The manservant appeared Madame Anserre with a
smile seized the dish casting a look about her for her young friend
but he had fled so precipitately that no trace of him could be seen any
longer Then she went looking everywhere for him and ere long she
discovered him in the Salon of the Agriculturists With his arm locked
in that of the husband he was consulting that gentleman as to the means
employed for destroying phylloxera

My dear Monsieur she said to him will you be so kind as to cut this
cake for me

He reddened to the roots of his hair and hanging down his head
stammered out some excuses Thereupon M Anserre took pity on him and
turning toward his wife said

My dear you might have the goodness not to disturb us We are talking
about agriculture So get your cake cut by Baptiste

And since that day nobody has ever cut Madame Anserres cake




THE CORSICAN BANDIT


The road with a gentle winding reached the middle of the forest The
huge pinetrees spread above our heads a mournfullooking vault and
gave forth a kind of long sad wail while at either side their
straight slender trunks formed as it were an army of organpipes
from which seemed to issue the low monotonous music of the wind through
the treetops

After three hours walking there was an opening in this row of tangled
branches Here and there an enormous pineparasol separated from the
others opening like an immense umbrella displayed its dome of dark
green then all of a sudden we gained the boundary of the forest some
hundreds of meters below the defile which leads into the wild valley of
Niolo

On the two projecting heights which commanded a view of this pass some
old trees grotesquely twisted seemed to have mounted with painful
efforts like scouts who had started in advance of the multitude heaped
together in the rear When we turned round we saw the entire forest
stretched beneath our feet like a gigantic basin of verdure whose
edges which seemed to reach the sky were composed of bare racks
shutting in on every side

We resumed our walk and ten minutes later we found ourselves in the
defile

Then I beheld an astonishing landscape Beyond another forest a valley
but a valley such as I had never seen before a solitude of stone ten
leagues long hollowed out between two high mountains without a field
or a tree to be seen This was the Niolo valley the fatherland of
Corsican liberty the inaccessible citadel from which the invaders had
never been able to drive out the mountaineers

My companion said to me It is here that all our bandits have taken
refuge

Ere long we were at the further end of this chasm so wild so
inconceivably beautiful

Not a blade of grass not a plantnothing but granite As far as our
eyes could reach we saw in front of us a desert of glittering stone
heated like an oven by a burning sun which seemed to hang for that very
purpose right above the gorge When we raised our eyes toward the crests
we stood dazzled and stupefied by what we saw They looked red and
notched like festoons of coral for all the summits are made of
porphyry and the sky overhead seemed violet lilac discolored by the
vicinity of these strange mountains Lower down the granite was of
scintillating gray and under our feet it seemed rasped pounded we
were walking over shining powder At our right along a long and
irregular course a tumultuous torrent ran with a continuous roar And
we staggered along under this heat in this light in this burning
arid desolate valley cut by this ravine of turbulent water which seemed
to be ever hurrying onward without being able to fertilize these rocks
lost in this furnace which greedily drank it up without being penetrated
or refreshed by it

But suddenly there was visible at our right a little wooden cross sunk
in a little heap of stones A man had been killed there and I said to
my companion

Tell me about your bandits

He replied

I knew the most celebrated of them the terrible St Lucia I will tell
you his history

His father was killed in a quarrel by a young man of the same district
it is said and St Lucia was left alone with his sister He was a weak
and timid youth small often ill without any energy He did not
proclaim the vendetta against the assassin of his father All his
relatives came to see him and implored of him to take vengeance he
remained deaf to their menaces and their supplications

Then following the old Corsican custom his sister in her
indignation carried away his black clothes in order that he might not
wear mourning for a dead man who had not been avenged He was insensible
to even this outrage and rather than take down from the rack his
fathers gun which was still loaded he shut himself up not daring to
brave the looks of the young men of the district

He seemed to have even forgotten the crime and he lived with his
sister in the obscurity of their dwelling

But one day the man who was suspected of having committed the murder
was about to get married St Lucia did not appear to be moved by this
news but no doubt out of sheer bravado the bridegroom on his way to
the church passed before the two orphans house

The brother and the sister at their window were eating little fried
cakes when the young man saw the bridal procession moving past the
house Suddenly he began to tremble rose up without uttering a word
made the sign of the cross took the gun which was hanging over the
fireplace and went out

When he spoke of this later on he said I dont know what was the
matter with me it was like fire in my blood I felt that I should do
it that in spite of everything I could not resist and I concealed the
gun in a cave on the road to Corte

An hour later he came back with nothing in his hand and with his
habitual sad air of weariness His sister believed that there was
nothing further in his thoughts

But when night fell he disappeared

His enemy had the same evening to repair to Corte on foot
accompanied by his two bridesmen

He was pursuing his way singing as he went when St Lucia stood
before him and looking straight in the murderers face exclaimed Now
is the time and shot him pointblank in the chest

One of the bridesmen fled the other stared at the young man saying

What have you done St Lucia

Then he was going to hasten to Corte for help but St Lucia said in a
stern tone

If you move another step Ill shoot you through the legs

The other aware that till now he had always appeared timid said to
him You would not dare to do it and he was hurrying off when he
fell instantaneously his thigh shattered by a bullet

And St Lucia coming over to where he lay said

I am going to look at your wound if it is not serious Ill leave you
there if it is mortal Ill finish you off

He inspected the wound considered it mortal and slowly reloading his
gun told the wounded man to say a prayer and shot him through the
head

Next day he was in the mountains

And do you know what this St Lucia did after this

All his family were arrested by the gendarmes His uncle the cur who
was suspected of having incited him to this deed of vengeance was
himself put into prison and accused by the dead mans relatives But he
escaped took a gun in his turn and went to join his nephew in the
cave

Next St Lucia killed one after the other his uncles accusers and
tore out their eyes to teach the others never to state what they had
seen with their eyes

He killed all the relatives all the connections of his enemys family
He massacred during his life fourteen gendarmes burned down the houses
of his adversaries and was up to the day of his death the most terrible
of the bandits whose memory we have preserved

                                   

The sun disappeared behind Monte Cinto and the tall shadow of the
granite mountain went to sleep on the granite of the valley We
quickened our pace in order to reach before night the little village of
Albertaccio nothing better than a heap of stones welded beside the
stone flanks of a wild gorge And I said as I thought of the bandit

What a terrible custom your vendetta is

My companion answered with an air of resignation

What would you have A man must do his duty




THE DUEL


In society they called him The handsome Signoles He called himself
Viscount Gontran Joseph de Signoles

An orphan and master of a sufficient fortune he cut something of a
figure as the saying is He had an attractive form enough readiness of
speech to make some attempt at wit a certain natural grace of manner
an air of nobility and pride and a mustache which was both formidable
and pleasant to the eyea thing that pleases the ladies

He was in demand in drawingrooms sought for by waltzers and he
inspired in men that smiling enmity which one has for people of
energetic physique He was suspected of some love affairs which showed
him capable of much discretion for a young man He lived happy
tranquil in a state of moral wellbeing most complete It was well
known that he was good at handling a sword and still better with a
pistol

If I were to fight he said I should choose a pistol With that
weapon I am sure of killing my man

Now one evening having escorted two young women friends of his to
the theater being also accompanied by their husbands he offered them
after the play an ice at Tortonis They had been there about ten
minutes when he perceived that a gentleman seated at a neighboring
table gazed persistently at one of the ladies of his party She seemed
troubled and disturbed lowering her eyes Finally she said to her
husband

That man is staring me out of countenance I do not know him do you

The husband who had seen nothing raised his eyes but declared

No not at all

The young woman replied half laughing half angry It is very
annoying that individual is spoiling my ice

The husband shrugged his shoulders replying

Pshaw Pay no attention to him If we were to notice all the insolent
people we meet there would be no end to it

But the Viscount arose brusquely He could not allow this unknown man to
spoil an ice he had offered It was to him that the injury was
addressed as it was through him and for him that his friends had
entered this caf The affair then concerned him only He advanced
toward the man and said to him

You have sir a manner of looking at these ladies that is not to be
tolerated I beg to ask you to cease this attention

The other replied So you command me to keep the peace do you

With set teeth the Viscount answered Take care sir or you will
force me to forget myself

The gentleman replied with a single word an obscene word which
resounded from one end of the caf to the other and made each guest
start with a sudden movement as if they were all on springs Those that
were in front turned around all the others raised their heads three
waiters turned about on their heels as if on pivots the two ladies at
the counter bounded forward then entirely turned their backs upon the
scene as if they had been two automatons obeying the same manipulation

There was a great silence Then suddenly a sharp noise rent the air
The Viscount had struck his adversary Everybody got up to interpose
Cards were exchanged

After the Viscount had returned home he walked up and down his room at
a lively pace for some minutes He was too much agitated to reflect upon
anything One idea only hovered over his mind a duel and yet this
idea awoke in him as yet no emotion whatever He had done what he ought
to do he had shown himself what he ought to be People would talk of
it approve of it and congratulate him He said aloud in a high voice
as one speaks when he is much troubled in thought

What a beast that man is

Then he sat down and began to reflect He would have to find some
seconds in the morning Whom should he choose He thought over the
people of his acquaintance who were the most celebrated and in the best
positions He took finally Marquis de la TourNoire and Colonel
Bourdin a great lord and a soldier who was very strong Their names
would carry in the journals He perceived that he was thirsty and he
drank one after the other three glasses of water then he began to
walk again He felt himself full of energy By showing himself
hotbrained resolute in all things by exacting rigorous dangerous
conditions and by claiming a serious duel a very serious one his
adversary would doubtless withdraw and make some excuses

He took up the card which he had drawn from his pocket and thrown upon
the table and reread it as he had in the caf by a glance of the
eye and again in the cab on returning home by the light of a gas jet
George Lamil  Moncey street That was all

He examined these assembled letters which appeared so mysterious to him
his senses all confused George Lamil Who was this man What had he
done Why had he looked at that woman in such a way Was it not
revolting that a stranger an unknown should come to trouble his life
thus at a blow because he had been pleased to fix his insolent gaze
upon a woman And the Viscount repeated again in a loud voice

What a brute

Then he remained motionless standing thinking his look ever fixed
upon the card A certain anger against this piece of paper was awakened
in him a hateful anger which was mingled with a strange sentiment of
malice It was stupid this whole story He took a penknife which lay
open at his hand and pricked the card through the middle ofthe printed
name as if he were using a poignard upon some one

So he must fight Should he choose the sword or pistol for he
considered himself the insulted one With the sword he risked less but
with the pistol there was a chance of his adversary withdrawing It is
rarely that a duel with the sword is mortal a reciprocal prudence
hindering the combatants from keeping near enough to each other for the
point to strike very deep with the pistol he risked his life very
seriously but he could also meet the affair with all the honors of the
situation and without arriving at a meeting He said aloud

It is necessary to be firm He will be afraid

The sound of his own voice made him tremble and he began to look about
him He felt very nervous He drank still another glass of water then
commenced to undress preparatory to retiring

When he was ready he put out his light and closed his eyes Then he
thought

I have all day tomorrow to busy myself with my affairs I must sleep
first in order to be calm

He was very warm under the clothes but he could not succeed in falling
asleep He turned and turned again remained for five minutes upon his
back then placed himself upon his left side then rolled over to the
right

He was still thirsty He got up and drank Then a kind of disquiet
seized him

Can it be that I am afraid said he

Why should his heart begin to beat so foolishly at each of the customary
noises about his roomwhen the clock was going to strike and the
spring made that little grinding noise as it raised itself to make the
turn And he found it was necessary for him to open his mouth in order
to breathe for some seconds following this start so great was his
feeling of oppression He began to reason with himself upon the
possibilities of the thing

What have I to fear

No certainly he should not fear since he was resolved to follow it
out to the end and since he had fully made up his mind to fight without
a qualm But he felt himself so profoundly troubled that he asked
himself

Can it be that I am afraid in spite of myself

And this doubt invaded him this disquiet this fear if a force more
powerful than his will dominating irresistible should conquer him
what would happen to him Yes what would happen Certainly he could
walk upon the earth if he wished to go there But if he should tremble
And if he should lose consciousness And he thought of his situation of
his reputation of his name

And a singular desire took possession of him to get up and look at
himself in the glass He relighted his candle When he perceived his
face reflected in the polished glass he scarcely knew himself and it
seemed to him that he had never seen himself before His eyes appeared
enormous he was pale certainly he was pale very pale

He remained standing there before the mirror He put out his tongue as
if to examine the state of his health and suddenly this thought entered
his brain after the fashion of a bullet

After tomorrow at this time I shall perhaps be dead

And his heart began to beat furiously

After tomorrow at this time I shall perhaps be dead This person
opposite me this being I have so often seen in this glass will be no
more How can it be I am here I see myself I feel that I am alive
and in twentyfour hours I shall be stretched upon that bed dead my
eyes closed cold inanimate departed

He turned around to the bed and distinctly saw himself stretched on his
back in the same clothes he had worn on going out In his face were the
lines of death and a rigidity in the hands that would never stir again

Then a fear of his bed came over him and in order to see it no more he
passed into his smokingroom Mechanically he took a cigar lighted it
and began to walk about He was cold He went toward the bell to waken
his valet but he stopped with his hand on the cord

This man would perceive at once that I am afraid

He did not ring but made a fire His hands trembled a little from a
nervous shiver when they came in contact with any object His mind
wandered his thoughts from trouble became frightened hasty and
sorrowful an intoxication seemed to invade his mind as if he were
drunk And without ceasing he asked

What am I going to do What is going to become of me

His whole body was vibrating traversed by a jerking and a trembling he
got up and approached the window opening the curtains

The day had dawned a summer day A rosecolored sky made the city rosy
on roof and wall A great fall of spread out light like a caress from
the rising sun enveloped the waking world and with this light a gay
rapid brutal hope invaded the heart of the Viscount He was a fool to
allow himself to be thus cast down by fear even before anything was
decided before his witnesses had seen those of this George Lamil
before he yet knew whether he were going to fight a duel

He made his toilette dressed himself and walked out with firm step

He repeated constantly in walking It will be necessary for me to be
energetic very energetic I must prove that I am not afraid

His witnesses the Marquis and the Colonel placed themselves at his
disposal and after having shaken hands with him energetically
discussed the conditions The Colonel asked

Do you wish it to be a serious duel

The Viscount responded Very serious

The Marquis continued Will you use a pistol

Yes

We leave you free to regulate the rest

The Viscount enunciated in a dry jerky voice

Twenty steps at the order and on raising the arm instead of lowering
it Exchange of bullets until one is grievously wounded

The Colonel declared in a satisfied tone

These are excellent conditions You shoot well all the chances are in
your favor

They separated The Viscount returned home to wait for them His
agitation appeased for a moment grew now from minute to minute He
felt along his arms his legs and in his breast a kind of trembling of
continued vibration he could not keep still either sitting or
standing There was no longer an appearance of saliva in his mouth and
each instant he made a noisy movement with his tongue as if to unglue
it from the roof of his mouth

He wished to breakfast but he could not eat Then the idea came to him
of drinking to give himself courage and he brought out a small bottle of
rum which he swallowed in six little glasses one after the other

A heat like that of a burning fire invaded him followed almost
immediately by a numbness of the soul He thought

I have found the remedy Now all goes well

But at the end of an hour he had emptied the bottle and his state of
agitation became intolerable He felt a foolish impulse to roll on the
ground to cry out and bite Then night fell

A stroke of the bell gave him such a shock that he had not sufficient
strength left to rise and receive his witnesses He dared not even speak
to them to say Good evening to pronounce a single word for fear that
they would discover a change in his voice

The Colonel announced

All is arranged according to the conditions that you have fixed upon
Your adversary claimed the privileges of the offended but he soon
yielded and accepted all His witnesses are two military men

The Viscount pronounced the word

Thanks

The Marquis continued

Excuse us if we only come in and go out for we have still a thousand
things to occupy our attention A good doctor will be necessary since
the combat is only to cease after a severe wound and you know that
bullets are no trifles Then a place must be found in some proximity
to a house where we may carry the wounded if necessary etc etc
finally we have but two or three hours for it

The Viscount for the second time articulated

Thanks

The Colonel asked

How is it with you Are you calm

Yes very calm thank you

The two men then retired

When he again found himself alone it seemed to him that he was mad His
domestic having lighted the lamps he seated himself before his table to
write some letters After having traced at the top of a page This is
my testament he arose with a shake and put it away from him feeling
himself incapable of forming two ideas or of sufficient resolution to
decide what was to be done

So he was going to fight a duel There was no way to avoid it How could
he ever go through it He wished to fight it was his intention and firm
resolution so to do and yet he felt that in spite of all his effort
of mind and all the tension of his will he would not be able to
preserve even the necessary force to go to the place of meeting He
tried to imagine the combat his own attitude and the position of his
adversary

From time to time his teeth chattered in his mouth with a little hard
noise He tried to read and took down the Chateauvillard code of
dueling Then he asked himself

Has my opponent frequently fought Is he known Is he classed How am I
to know

He remembered Baron de Vauxs book upon experts with the pistol and he
ran through it from one end to the other George Lamil was not
mentioned Nevertheless if this man were not an expert he would not so
readily have accepted this dangerous weapon and these mortal conditions

He opened in passing a box of Gastinne Renettes which stood on a
little stand took out one of the pistols held it in a position to
fire and raised his arm But he trembled from head to foot and the gun
worked upon all his senses

Then he said It is impossible I cannot fight in this condition

He looked at the end of the barrel at that little black deep hole that
spits out death he thought of the dishonor of the whisperings in his
circle of the laughs in the drawingrooms of the scorn of the ladies
of the allusions of the journals of all the insults that cowards would
throw at him

He continued to examine the weapon and raising the cock he suddenly
saw a priming glittering underneath like a little red flame The pistol
was loaded then through a chance forgetfulness And he found in this
discovery a confused inexplicable joy

If in the presence of the other man he did not have that calm noble
bearing that he should have he would be lost forever He would be
spotted branded with the sign of infamy hunted from the world And
this calm heroic bearing he would not have he knew it he felt it
However he was brave since he did wish to fight He was brave
since The thought that budded never took form even in his own mind
for opening his mouth wide he brusquely thrust the barrel of his pistol
into his throat and pulled the trigger

When his valet hearing the report hastened to him he found him dead
upon his back A jet of blood had splashed upon the white paper on the
table and made a great red spot upon these four words

This is my testament

Section   Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment  Many small donations
 to  are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all  states of the United
States  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States  US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section   General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone  For forty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included  Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

     wwwgutenbergorg
