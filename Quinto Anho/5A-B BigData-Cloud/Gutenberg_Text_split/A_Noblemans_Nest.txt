                           A NOBLEMANS NEST
                                    I


The brilliant spring day was inclining toward the evening tiny
rosetinted cloudlets hung high in the heavens and seemed not to be
floating past but retreating into the very depths of the azure

In front of the open window of a handsome house in one of the outlying
streets of O    the capital of a Government sat two women one
fifty years of age the other seventy years old and already aged

The former was named Mrya Dmtrievna Kaltin Her husband formerly
the governmental procurator well known in his day as an active
officiala man of energetic and decided character splenetic and
stubbornhad died ten years previously He had received a fairly good
education had studied at the university but having been born in a
povertystricken class of society he had early comprehended the
necessity of opening up a way for himself and of accumulating money
Mrya Dmtrievna had married him for love he was far from uncomely in
appearance he was clever and when he chose he could be very amiable
Mrya Dmtrievna her maiden name had been Pstoff had lost her
parents in early childhood had spent several years in Moscow in a
government educational institute and on returning thence had lived
fifty versts from O    in her native village Pokrvskoe with
her aunt and her elder brother This brother soon removed to Petersburg
on service and kept his sister and his aunt on short commons until his
sudden death put an end to his career Mrya Dmtrievna inherited
Pokrvskoe but did not live there long during the second year after
her marriage to Kaltin who succeeded in conquering her heart in the
course of a few days Pokrvskoe was exchanged for another estate much
more profitable but ugly and without a manorhouse and at the same
time Kaltin acquired a house in the town of O    and settled
down there permanently with his wife A large garden was attached to the
house on one side it joined directly on to the open fields beyond the
town Kaltinwho greatly disliked the stagnation of the countryhad
evidently made up his mind that there was no reason for dragging out
existence on the estate Mrya Dmtrievna many a time in her own mind
regretted her pretty Pokrvskoe with its merry little stream its broad
meadows and verdant groves but she opposed her husband in nothing and
worshipped his cleverness and knowledge of the world But when after
fifteen years of married life he died leaving a son and two daughters
Mrya Dmtrievna had become so wonted to her house and to town life
that she herself did not wish to leave O   

In her youth Mrya Dmtrievna had enjoyed the reputation of being a
pretty blonde and at the age of fifty her features were not devoid of
attraction although they had become somewhat swollen and indefinite in
outline She was more sentimental than kind and even in her mature age
she had preserved the habits of her schooldays she indulged herself
was easily irritated and even wept when her ways were interfered with
on the other hand she was very affectionate and amiable when all her
wishes were complied with and when no one contradicted her Her house
was one of the most agreeable in the town Her fortune was very
considerable not so much her inherited fortune as that acquired by her
husband Both her daughters lived with her her son was being educated at
one of the best government institutions in Petersburg

The old woman who was sitting by the window with Mrya Dmtrievna was
that same aunt her fathers sister with whom she had spent several
years in days gone by at Pokrvskoe Her name was Mrfa Timofevna
Pstoff She bore the reputation of being eccentric had an independent
character told the entire truth to every one straight in the face and
with the most scanty resources bore herself as though she possessed
thousands She had not been able to endure the deceased Kaltin and as
soon as her niece married him she retired to her tiny estate where she
lived for ten whole years in the henhouse of a peasant Mrya
Dmtrievna was afraid of her Blackhaired and briskeyed even in her
old age tiny sharpnosed Mrfa Timofevna walked quickly held
herself upright and talked rapidly and intelligibly in a shrill
ringing voice She always wore a white cap and a white jacket

What art thou doing that for she suddenly inquired of Mrya
DmtrievnaWhat art thou sighing about my mother

Because said the otherWhat wonderfully beautiful clouds

So thou art sorry for them is that it

Mrya Dmtrievna made no reply

Isnt that Gedenovsky coming yondersaid Mrfa Timofevna
briskly moving her knittingneedles she was knitting a huge motleyhued
scarf He might keep thee company in sighingor if not he might
tell us some lie or other

How harshly thou always speakest about him Sergyi Petrvitch is
anestimable man

Estimable repeated the old woman reproachfully

And how devoted he was to my dead husband remarked Mrya
Dmtrievnato this day I cannot think of it with indifference

I should think not he pulled him out of the mire by his earsgrowled
Mrfa Timofevna and her knittingneedles moved still more swiftly in
her hands

He looks like such a meek creatureshe began againhis head is all
grey but no sooner does he open his mouth than he lies or calumniates
And hes a State Councillor to boot Well hes a priests son and
theres nothing more to be said

Who is without sin aunty Of course he has that weakness Sergyi
Petrvitch received no educationof course he does not speak French
but say what you will he is an agreeable man

Yes hes always licking thy hand He doesnt talk Frenchwhat a
calamity Im not strong on the French dialect myself T would be
better if he did not speak any language at all then he wouldnt lie But
there he is by the wayspeak of the devil added Mrfa Timofevna
glancing into the streetThere he strides thine agreeable man What a
longlegged fellow just like a stork

Mrya Dmtrievna adjusted her curls Mrfa Timofevna watched her
with a grin

Hast thou not a grey hair there my mother Thou shouldst scold thy
Palshka Why doesnt she see it

Oh aunty youre always so muttered Mrya Dmtrievna with
vexation and drummed on the arm of her chair with her fingers

Sergyi Petrvitch Gedenovsky squeaked a redcheeked pagelad
springing in through the door




                                   II


There entered a man of lofty stature in a neat coat short trousers
grey chamoisskin gloves and two necktiesone black on top and the
other white underneath Everything about him exhaled decorum and
propriety beginning with his goodlooking face and smoothly brushed
templecurls and ending with his boots which had neither heels nor
squeak He bowed first to the mistress of the house then to Mrfa
Timofevna and slowly drawing off his gloves took Mrya Dmtrievnas
hand After kissing it twice in succession with respect he seated
himself without haste in an armchair and said with a smile as he
rubbed the very tips of his fingers

And is Elizavta Mikhalovna well

Yesreplied Mrya Dmtrievnashe is in the garden

And Elna Mikhalovna

Lynotchka is in the garden also Is there anything new

How could there fail to be maam how could there fail to bereturned
the visitor slowly blinking his eyes and protruding his lips Hm 
now heres a bit of news if you please and a very astounding bit
Lavrtzky Fedor Ivnitch has arrived

Fdyaexclaimed Mrfa TimofevnaBut come now my father art
not thou inventing that

Not in the least maam I saw him myself

Well thats no proof

He has recovered his health finelywent on Gedenovsky pretending
not to hear Mrfa Timofevnas remarkhe has grown broader in the
shoulders and the rosy colour covers the whole of his cheeks

He has recovered his healthejaculated Mrya Dmtrievna with
pausesthat means that he had something to recover from

Yes maamreturned GedenovskyAny other man in his place
would have been ashamed to show himself in the world

Why sointerrupted Mrfa Timofevnawhat nonsense is this A man
returns to his native placewhat would you have him do with himself And
as if he were in any way to blame

The husband is always to blame madam I venture to assure you when the
wife behaves badly

Thou sayest that my good sir because thou hast never been married
thyself Gedenovsky smiled in a constrained way

Permit me to inquire he asked after a brief pausefor whom is that
very pretty scarf destined

Mrfa Timofevna cast a swift glance at him

It is destinedshe retortedfor the man who never gossips nor uses
craft nor lies if such a man exists in the world I know Fdya well
his sole fault is that he was too indulgent to his wife Well he married
for love and nothing good ever comes of those lovemarriagesadded the
old woman casting a sidelong glance at Mrya Dmtrievna and
risingAnd now dear little father thou mayest whet thy teeth on
whomsoever thou wilt only not on me Im going away I wont
interfereAnd Mrfa Timofevna withdrew

There she is always like thatsaid Mrya Dmtrievna following her
aunt with her eyesAlways

Its her age Theres no help for it maam remarked
GedenovskyThere now she permitted herself to say the man who
does not use craft But who doesnt use craft nowadays its the spirit
of the age One of my friends a very estimable person and I must tell
you a man of no mean rank was wont to say that nowadays a hen
approaches a grain of corn craftilyshe keeps watching her chance to get
to it from one side But when I look at you my lady you have a truly
angelic disposition please to favour me with your snowwhite little
hand

Mrya Dmtrievna smiled faintly and extended her plump hand with the
little finger standing out apart to Gedenovsky He applied his lips to
it and she moved her armchair closer to him and bending slightly
toward him she asked in a low tone

So you have seen him Is he reallyall right well cheerful

He is cheerful maam all right maam returned Gedenovsky in a
whisper

And you have not heard where his wife is now

She has recently been in Paris maam now I hear she has removed to
the kingdom of Italy

It is dreadful reallyFdyas position I do not know how he can
endure it Accidents do happen with every one in fact but he one may
say has been advertised all over Europe

Gedenovsky sighed

Yes maam yes maam Why she they say has struck up acquaintance
with artists and pianists and as they call it in their fashion with
lions and wild beasts She has lost her shame completely

It is very very sadsaid Mrya Dmtrievnaon account of the
relationship for you know Sergyi Petrvitch hes my nephew once
removed

Of course maam of course maam How could I fail to be aware of
everything which relates to your family Upon my word maam

Will he come to see uswhat do you think

We must assume that he will maam but I hear that he is going to his
country estate

Mrya Dmtrievna cast her eyes heavenward

Akh Sergyi Petrvitch when I think of it how circumspectly we
women must behave

There are different sorts of women Mrya Dmtrievna Unfortunately
there are some of fickle character  well and its a question of age
also then again the rules have not been inculcated in their
childhood Sergyi Petrvitch pulled a checked blue handkerchief out
of his pocket and began to unfold itSuch women exist of course
Sergyi Petrvitch raised a corner of the handkerchief to his eyes
one after the otherbut generally speaking if we take into
consideration that is There is an unusual amount of dust in town
he concluded

Maman mamanscreamed a pretty little girl of eleven as she rushed
into the roomVladmir Nikolitch is coming to our house on
horseback

Mrya Dmtrievna rose Sergyi Petrvitch also rose and bowedOur
most humble salute to Elna Mikhalovna he said and withdrawing into
a corner out of propriety he began to blow his long and regularlyformed
nose

What a splendid horse he has went on the little girlHe was at
the gate just now and told Liza and me that he would ride up to the
porch

The trampling of hoofs became audible and a stately horseman on a fine
brown steed made his appearance in the street and halted in front of
the open window




                                   III


Good afternoon Mrya Dmtrievnaexclaimed the horseman in a
ringing agreeable voiceHow do you like my new purchase

Mrya Dmtrievna went to the window

Good afternoon Woldemar Akh what a magnificent horse From whom did
you buy it

From the remount officer He asked a high price the robber

What is its name

Orlando But thats a stupid name I want to change it Eh bien
eh bien mon garon What a turbulent beast The horse snorted
shifted from foot to foot and tossed his foaming muzzle

Pat him Lnotchka have no fears

The little girl stretched her hand out of the window but Orlando
suddenly reared up and leaped aside The rider did not lose control
gripped the horse with his knees gave him a lash on the neck with his
whip and despite his opposition placed him once more in front of the
window

Prenez garde prenez gardeMrya Dmtrievna kept repeating

Pat him Lynotchkareturned the riderI will not permit him to
be wilful

Again the little girl stretched forth her hand and timidly touched the
quivering nostrils of Orlando who trembled incessantly and strained at
the bit

Bravoexclaimed Mrya Dmtrievnaand now dismount and come
in

The horseman turned his steed round adroitly gave him the spurs and
after dashing along the street at a brisk gallop rode into the yard A
minute later he ran in through the door of the anteroom into the
drawingroom flourishing his whip at the same moment on the threshold
of another door a tall graceful blackhaired girl of nineteenMrya
Dmtrievnas eldest daughter Lizamade her appearance




                                   IV


The young man with whom we have just made the reader acquainted was
named Vladmir Nikolitch Pnshin He served in Petersburg as an
official for special commissions in the Ministry of the Interior He had
come to the town of O    to execute a temporary governmental
commission and was under the command of GovernorGeneral Zonnenberg to
whom he was distantly related Pnshins father a staffcaptain of
cavalry on the retired list a famous gambler a man with a crumpled
visage and a nervous twitching of the lips had passed his whole life in
the society of people of quality had frequented the English Clubs in
both capitals and bore the reputation of an adroit not very
trustworthy but charming and jolly fellow In spite of his adroitness
he found himself almost constantly on the very verge of indigence and
left behind him to his only son a small and impaired fortune On the
other hand he had after his own fashion taken pains with his
education Vladmir Nikolitch spoke French capitally English well
and German badly but it is permissible to let fall a German word in
certain circumstanceschiefly humorouscest mme trs chic as
the Petersburg Parisians express themselves Vladmir Nikolitch
already understood at the age of fifteen how to enter any drawingroom
whatever without embarrassment how to move about in it agreeably and to
withdraw at the proper time Pnshins father had procured for his son
many influential connections as he shuffled the cards between two
rubbers or after a successful capture of all the tricks he let slip no
opportunity to drop a nice little word about his Voldka to some
important personage who was fond of social games On his side Vladmir
Nikolitch during his stay in the university whence he emerged with
the rank of actual student made acquaintance with several young men of
quality and became a frequenter of the best houses He was received
gladly everywhere he was extremely goodlooking easy in his manners
entertaining always well and ready for everything where it was
requisite he was respectful where it was possible he was insolent a
capital companion un charmant garon The sacred realm opened out
before him Pnshin speedily grasped the secret of the science of
society he understood how to imbue himself with genuine respect for its
decrees he understood how with halfbantering gravity to busy himself
with nonsense and assume the appearance of regarding everything serious
as trivial he danced exquisitely he dressed in English style In a
short time he became renowned as one of the most agreeable and adroit
young men in Petersburg Pnshin was in reality very adroitno less
so than his father but he was also very gifted He could do
everything he sang prettily he drew dashingly he wrote verses he
acted very far from badly on the stage He had only just passed his
twentyeighth birthday but he was already Junior Gentleman of the
Emperors bedchamber and had a very tolerable rank Pnshin firmly
believed in himself in his brains in his penetration he advanced
boldly and cheerfully at full swing his life flowed along as on oil He
was accustomed to please everybody old and young and imagined that he
was a judge of people especially of women he did know well their
everyday weaknesses As a man not a stranger to art he felt within him
both fervour and some enthusiasm and rapture and in consequence of
this he permitted himself various deviations from the rules he caroused
he picked up acquaintance with persons who did not belong to society
and in general maintained a frank and simple demeanour but in soul he
was cold and cunning and in the midst of the wildest carouse his clever
little brown eye was always on guard and watching this bold this free
young man could never forget himself and get completely carried away To
his honour it must be said that he never bragged of his conquests He
had hit upon Mrya Dmtrievnas house immediately on his arrival in
O    and had promptly made himself entirely at home there Mrya
Dmtrievna fairly adored him

Pnshin amiably saluted all who were in the room shook hands with Mrya
Dmtrievna and Lizavta Mikhalovna lightly tapped Gedenovsky on the
shoulder and whirling round on his heels caught Lynotchka by the head
and kissed her on the brow

And you are not afraid to ride such a vicious horseMrya
Dmtrievna asked him

Good gracious it is a very peaceable beast but Ill tell you what I am
afraid of Im afraid to play preference with Sergyi Petrvitch last
night at the Byelentzyns he won my last farthing

Gedenovsky laughed a shrill and servile laugh he fawned on the
brilliant young official from Petersburg the pet of the governor In his
conversations with Mrya Dmtrievna he frequently alluded to
Pnshins remarkable capacities For why should not I praise him he
argued The young man is making a success in the highest sphere of life
discharges his service in an exemplary manner and is not the least bit
proud Moreover even in Petersburg Pnshin was considered an energetic
official he got through an immense amount of work he alluded to it
jestingly as is befitting a fashionable man who attaches no particular
importance to his labours but he was an executor The higher officials
love such subordinates he never had the slightest doubt himself that
if he so wished he could become a Minister in course of time

You are pleased to say that I beat you at cardsremarked
Gedenovskybut who was it that won twelve rubles from me last week
and besides

Villain villain Pnshin interrupted him with a caressing but almost
disdainful carelessness and without paying any further attention to him
he stepped up to Liza

I have not been able to find the overture of Oberon here he
beganMme Byelentzyn was merely boasting that she had all the
classical musicas a matter of fact she has nothing except polkas and
waltzes but I have already written to Moscow and within a week I shall
have that overture By the wayhe continuedI wrote a new romance
yesterday the words also are my own Would you like to have me sing it
for you I do not know how it has turned out Mme Byelentzyn thought
it extremely charming but her words signify nothingI wish to know
your opinion However I think it will be better later on

Why later oninterposed Mrya DmtrievnaWhy not now

I obey maamsaid Pnshin with a certain bright sweet smile
which was wont to appear on his face and suddenly to vanishpushed
forward a chair with his knee seated himself at the piano and after
striking several chords he began to sing clearly enunciating the words
the following romance

       The moon floats high above the earth
         Amid the clouds so pale
       But from the crest of the sea surge moveth
         A magic ray
       The sea of my soul hath acknowledged thee
         To be its moon
       And t is movedin joy and in sorrow
         By thee alone
       With the anguish of love the anguish of dumb aspirations
         The soul is full
       I suffer pain But thou from agitation art as free
         As that moon

Pnshin sang the second couplet with peculiar expression and force the
surging of the waves could be heard in the tempestuous accompaniment
After the words I suffer pain he heaved a slight sigh dropped his
eyes and lowered his voicemorendo When he had finished Liza
praised the motive Mrya Dmtrievna said It is charmingwhile
Gedenovsky even shouted Ravishing both poetry and harmony are
equally ravishing Lynotchka with childish adoration gazed at the
singer In a word the composition of the youthful dilettante pleased all
present extremely but outside of the door of the drawingroom in the
anteroom stood an elderly man who had just arrived to whom judging by
the expression of his downcast face and the movement of his shoulders
Pnshins romance charming as it was afforded no pleasure After
waiting a while and whisking the dust from his boots with a coarse
handkerchief this man suddenly screwed up his eyes pressed his lips
together grimly bent his back which was already sufficiently bowed
without that and slowly entered the drawingroom

Ah Christofr Fedoritch good afternoonPnshin was the first of
all to exclaim and sprang hastily from his seatI had no suspicion
that you were hereI could not on any account have made up my mind to
sing my romance in your presence I know that you do not care for
frivolous music

I vas not listening remarked the newcomer in imperfect Russian and
having saluted all he remained awkwardly standing in the middle of the
room

Have you come Monsieur Lemmsaid Mrya Dmtrievnato give a
music lesson to Liza

No not to Lisafta Mikhalovna but to Elna Mikhalovna

Ah Wellvery good Lynotchka go upstairs with Monsieur Lemm

The old man was on the point of following the little girl but Pnshin
stopped him

Do not go away after the lesson Christofr Fedoritchhe
saidLizavta Mikhalovna and I will play a Beethoven sonata for
four hands

The old man muttered something but Pnshin went on in German
pronouncing his words badly

Lizavta Mikhalovna has shown me the spiritual cantata which you
presented to hertis a very fine thing Please do not think that I am
incapable of appreciating serious musicquite the contrary it is
sometimes tiresome but on the other hand it is very beneficial

The old man crimsoned to his very ears cast a sidelong glance at Liza
and hastily left the room

Mrya Dmtrievna requested Pnshin to repeat the romance but he
declared that he did not wish to wound the ears of the learned German
and proposed to Liza that they should occupy themselves with the
Beethoven sonata Then Mrya Dmtrievna sighed and in her turn
proposed to Gedenovsky that he should take a stroll in the garden with
herI wishshe said to talk and take counsel with you still
further over our poor Fdya Gedenovsky grinned bowed took
upwith two fingers his hat and his gloves neatly laid on its brim
and withdrew in company with Mrya Dmtrievna Pnshin and Liza were
left alone in the room she fetched the sonata and opened it both
seated themselves in silence at the pianoFrom above the faint
sounds of scales played by Lynotchkas uncertain little fingers were
wafted to them




                                    V


ChristopherTheodoreGottlieb Lemm was born in the year  in the
kingdom of Saxony in the town of Chemnitz of poor musicians His father
played the French horn his mother the harp he himself at the age of
five was already practising on three different instruments At eight
years of age he became an orphan and at the age of ten he began to earn
a bit of bread for himself by his art For a long time he led a wandering
life played everywherein inns at fairs and at peasant weddings and
at balls at last he got into an orchestra and rising ever higher and
higher he attained to the post of director He was rather a poor
executant but he possessed a thorough knowledge of music At the age of
twentyeight he removed to Russia He was imported by a great gentleman
who himself could not endure music but maintained an orchestra as a
matter of pride Lemm lived seven years with him in the capacity of
musical conductor and left him with empty hands the gentleman was
ruined and wished to give him a note of hand but afterward refused him
even thisin a word did not pay him a farthing People advised him to
leave the country but he was not willing to return home in poverty from
Russia from great Russia that goldmine of artists he decided to
remain and try his luck For the space of twenty years he did try his
luck he sojourned with various gentry he lived in Moscow and in the
capitals of various governments he suffered and endured a great deal he
learned to know want he floundered like a fish on the ice but the idea
of returning to his native land never abandoned him in the midst of all
these calamities to which he was subjected it alone upheld him But it
did not suit Fate to render him happy with this last and first joy at
the age of fifty ill prematurely infirm he got stranded in the town of
O    and there remained for good having finally lost all hope of
quitting the Russia which he detested and managing after a fashion to
support his scanty existence by giving lessons Lemms external
appearance did not predispose one in his favour He was small of stature
roundshouldered with shoulderblades which projected crookedly and a
hollow chest with huge flat feet with paleblue nails on the stiff
unbending fingers of his sinewy red hands he had a wrinkled face
sunken cheeks and tightlycompressed lips that he was incessantly
moving as though chewing which added to his customary taciturnity
produced an almost malevolent impression his grey hair hung in elflocks
over his low brow his tiny motionless eyes smouldered like coals which
had just been extinguished he walked heavily swaying his clumsy body
from side to side at every step Some of his movements were suggestive of
the awkward manner in which an owl in a cage plumes itself when it is
conscious that it is being watched though it itself hardly sees anything
with its huge yellow timorously and dozily blinking eyes Confirmed
inexorable grief had laid upon the poor musician its ineffaceable seal
had distorted and disfigured his already illfavoured figure but for any
one who knew enough not to stop at first impressions something unusual
was visible in this halfwrecked being A worshipper of Bach and Handel
an expert in his profession gifted with a lively imagination and with
that audacity of thought which is accessible only to the German race
Lemm in course of timewho knowsmight have entered the ranks of the
great composers of his native land if life had led him differently but
he had not been born under a fortunate star He had written a great deal
in his dayand he had not succeeded in seeing a single one of his
compositions published he had not understood how to set about the matter
in the proper way to cringe opportunely to bustle at the right moment
Once long long ago one of his admirers and friends also a German and
also poor had published two of his sonatas at his own expenseand the
whole edition remained in the cellars of the musical shops they had
vanished dully without leaving a trace as though some one had flung
them into the river by night At last Lemm gave up in despair moreover
his years were making themselves felt he had begun to grow rigid to
stiffen as his fingers stiffened also Alone with an aged cook whom he
had taken from the almshouse he had never been married he lived on in
O    in a tiny house not far from the Kaltin residence he
walked a great deal read the Bible and collections of Protestant psalms
and Shakespeare in Schlegels translation It was long since he had
composed anything but evidently Liza his best pupil understood how
to arouse him he had written for her the cantata to which Pnshin had
alluded He had taken the words for this cantata from the psalms several
verses he had composed himself it was to be sung by two chorusesthe
chorus of the happy and the chorus of the unhappy both became
reconciled in the end and sang together O merciful God have mercy
upon us sinners and purge out of us by fire all evil thoughts and
earthly hopesOn the titlepage very carefully written and even
drawn stood the following Only the Just are Right A Spiritual
Cantata Composed and dedicated to Miss Elizavta Kaltin my beloved
pupil by her teacher C T G Lemm The words Only the Just are
Right and Elizavta Kaltin were surrounded by rays Below was
added For you aloneFr Sie alleinTherefore Lemm had crimsoned
and had cast a sidelong glance at Liza it pained him greatly when
Pnshin spoke of his cantata in his presence




                                   VI


Pnshin struck the opening chords of the sonata loudly and with
decision he was playing the second hand but Liza did not begin her
part He stopped and looked at her Lizas eyes fixed straight upon
him expressed displeasure her lips were not smiling her whole face was
stern almost sad

What is the matter with youhe inquired

Why did not you keep your word said sheI showed you Christofr
Fedoritchs cantata on condition that you would not mention it to him

Pardon me Lizavta Mikhalovna it was a slip of the tongue

You have wounded himand me also Now he will not trust me any more

What would you have me do Lizavta Mikhalovna From my earliest
childhood I have never been able to endure the sight of a German
something simply impels me to stir him up

Why do you say that Vladmir Nikolitch This German is a poor
solitary broken manand you feel no pity for him You want to stir him
up

Pnshin was disconcerted

You are right Lizavta Mikhalovnahe said My eternal
thoughtlessness is responsible for the whole thing No do not say a
word I know myself well My thoughtlessness has done me many an ill
turn Thanks to it I have won the reputation of an egoist

Pnshin paused for a moment No matter how he began a conversation he
habitually wound up by speaking of himself and he did it in a charming
soft confidential almost involuntary way

And here in your househe went onyour mother likes me of
courseshe is so kind you  however I do not know your opinion of
me but your aunt on the contrary cannot bear me I must have offended
her also by some thoughtless stupid remark For she does not like me
does she

No said Liza with some hesitationyou do not please her

Pnshin swept his fingers swiftly over the keys a barely perceptible
smile flitted across his lips

Well and youhe saidDo I seem an egoist to you also

I know you very slightlyreturned Lizabut I do not consider you
an egoist on the contrary I ought to feel grateful to you

I know I know what you mean to sayPnshin interrupted her and
again ran his fingers over the keysfor the music for the books which
I bring you for the bad drawings with which I decorate your album and
so forth and so on I can do all thatand still be an egoist I venture
to think that you are not bored in my company and that you do not
regard me as a bad man but still you assume that Ihow in the world
shall I express itwould not spare my own father or friend for the sake
of a jest

You are heedless and forgetful like all worldly peoplesaid
Lizathat is all

Pnshin frowned slightly

Listen he saidlet us not talk any more about me let us play our
sonata One thing only I will ask of youhe said as with his hand he
smoothed out the leaves of the bound volume which stood on the
musicrackthink what you will of me call me an egoist evenso be
it but do not call me a worldly man that appellation is intolerable to
me Anchio son pittore I also am an artistand I will
immediately prove it to you in action Let us begin

We will begin if you pleasesaid Liza

The first adagio went quite successfully although Pnshin made more
than one mistake He played his own compositions and those which he had
practised very prettily but he read music badly On the other hand the
second part of the sonataa rather brisk allegrodid not go at all at
the twentieth measure Pnshin who had got two measures behind could
hold out no longer and pushed back his chair with a laugh

Nohe exclaimedI cannot play today it is well that Lemm does
not hear us he would fall down in a swoon

Liza rose shut the piano and turned to Pnshin

What shall we do nowshe asked

I recognise you in that question You cannot possibly sit with folded
hands Come if you like let us draw before it has grown completely
dark Perhaps the other musethe muse of drawing  whats her name
Ive forgotten  will be more gracious to me Where is your album Do
you remembermy landscape there is not finished

Liza went into the next room for her album and Pnshin when he was
left alone pulled a batiste handkerchief from his pocket polished his
nails and gazed somewhat askance at his hands They were very handsome
and white on the thumb of the left hand he wore a spiral gold ring Liza
returned Pnshin seated himself near the window and opened the album

Ahahe exclaimedI see that you have begun to copy my
landscapeand that is fine Very good Only heregive me a pencilthe
shadows are not put on thickly enough Look

And Pnshin with a bold sweep prolonged several long strokes He
constantly drew one and the same landscape in the foreground were large
dishevelled trees in the distance a meadow and sawtoothed mountains
on the horizon Liza looked over his shoulder at his work

In drawing and in life in generalsaid Pnshin bending his head
now to the right now to the leftlightness and boldness are the
principal thing

At that moment Lemm entered the room and with a curt inclination was
on the point of departing but Pnshin flung aside the album and pencil
and barred his way

Whither are you going my dear Christofr Fedoritch Are not you
going to stay and drink tea

I must go homesaid Lemm in a surly voicemy head aches

Come what nonsensestay You and I will have a dispute over
Shakespeare

My head achesrepeated the old man

We tried to play a Beethoven sonata without youwent on Pnshin
amiably encircling his waist with his arm and smiling brightlybut we
couldnt make it go at all Just imagine I couldnt play two notes in
succession correctly

You vould haf done better to sing your romantzretorted Lemm pushing
aside Pnshins arm and left the room

Liza ran after him She overtook him on the steps

Christofr Fedoritch listenshe said to him in German as she
accompanied him to the gate across the closecropped green grass of the
yardI am to blame toward youforgive me

Lemm made no reply

I showed your cantata to Vladmir Nikolitch I was convinced that he
would appreciate itand it really did please him greatly

Lemm halted

Zat is nozinghe said in Russian and then added in his native
tonguebut he cannot understand anything how is it that you do not
perceive thathe is a dilettanteand thats all there is to it

You are unjust to himreturned Lizahe understands everything and
can do nearly everything himself

Yes everything is secondclass lightweight hasty work That pleases
and he pleases and he is content with thatwell and bravo But I am
not angry that cantata and Iwe are old fools I am somewhat ashamed
but that does not matter

Forgive me Christofr Fedoritchsaid Liza again

It does not mattair it does not mattair he repeated again in
Russianyou are a goot girl  but see yonder some vun is coming to
your house Goodbye You are a fery goot girl

And Lemm with hasty strides betook himself toward the gate through
which was entering a gentleman with whom he was not acquainted clad in a
grey coat and a broadbrimmed straw hat Courteously saluting him he
bowed to all newcomers in the town of O    he turned away from his
acquaintances on the streetthat was the rule which he had laid down for
himself Lemm passed him and disappeared behind the hedge The stranger
looked after him in amazement and exchanging a glance with Liza
advanced straight toward her




                                   VII


You do not recognise mehe said removing his hatbut I recognise
you although eight years have passed since I saw you last You were a
child then I am Lavrtzky Is your mother at home Can I see her

Mamma will be very gladreplied Lizashe has heard of your
arrival

Your name is Elizavta I believesaid Lavrtzky as he mounted the
steps of the porch

Yes

I remember you well you had a face at that time such as one does not
forget I used to bring you bonbons then

Liza blushed and thought What a strange man he is Lavrtzky paused
for a minute in the anteroom Liza entered the drawingroom where
Pnshins voice and laughter were resounding he had imparted some
gossip of the town to Mrya Dmtrievna and Gedenovsky who had
already returned from the garden and was himself laughing loudly at what
he had narrated At the name of Lavrtzky Mrya Dmtrievna started in
utter trepidation turned pale and advanced to meet him

How do you do how do you do my dear cousinshe exclaimed in a
drawling and almost tearful voicehow glad I am to see you

How do you do my kind cousinreturned Lavrtzky and shook her
proffered hand in a friendly wayhow does the Lord show mercy on you

Sit down sit down my dear Fedor Ivnitch Akh how delighted I am
Permit me in the first place to present to you my daughter Liza

I have already introduced myself to Lizavta MikhalovnaLavrtzky
interrupted her

Monsieur Pnshin Sergyi Petrvitch Gedenovsky But pray sit
down I look at you and I simply cannot believe my eyes How is your
health

As you see I am blooming And you cousinI dont want to cast the
evil eye on youyou have not grown thin during these eight years

Just think what a long time it is since we saw each otherremarked
Mrya Dmtrievna dreamilyWhence come you now Where have you left
 that is I meant to sayshe hastily caught herself upI meant to
say are you to be with us long

I have just come from Berlinreturned Lavrtzkyand tomorrow I
set out for my estateprobably to remain there a long time

Of course you will live at Lavrki

No not at Lavrki but I have a tiny village about twentyfive versts
from here I am going there

The village which you inherited from Glafra Petrvna

The same

Good gracious Fedor Ivnitch You have a splendid house at
Lavrki

Lavrtzky scowled slightly

Yes  but in that little estate there is a small wing and for the
present I need nothing more That place is the most convenient for me
just now

Mrya Dmtrievna again became so perturbed that she even straightened
herself up and flung her hands apart Pnshin came to her assistance
and entered into conversation with Lavrtzky Mrya Dmtrievna
recovered her composure leaned back in her chair and only interjected a
word from time to time but all the while she gazed so compassionately
at her visitor she sighed so significantly and shook her head so
mournfully that the latter at last could endure it no longer and
asked her quite sharply was she well

Thank God yesreplied Mrya Dmtrievnawhy

Because it seemed to me that you were not quite yourself

Mrya Dmtrievna assumed a dignified and somewhat offended aspectIf
thats the way you take itshe said to herselfI dont care in the
least evidently my good man nothing affects thee any more than water
does a goose any one else would have pined away with grief but it
swells thee up more than ever Mrya Dmtrievna did not stand on
ceremony with herself she expressed herself more elegantly aloud

As a matter of fact Lavrtzky did not resemble a victim of fate His
rosycheeked purelyRussian face with its large white brow rather
thick nose and broad regular lips fairly overflowed with native
health with strong durable force He was magnificently builtand his
blond hair curled all over his head like a young mans Only in his
eyes which were blue and prominent and fixed was there to be discerned
something which was not revery nor yet weariness and his voice sounded
rather too even

In the meantime Pnshin had continued to keep up the conversation He
turned it on the profits of sugarrefining concerning which two French
pamphlets had recently made their appearance and with calm modesty
undertook to set forth their contents but without saying one word about
them

Why heres Fdya suddenly rang out Mrfa Timofevnas voice in the
adjoining room behind the halfclosed doorActually Fdya And the
old woman briskly entered the room Before Lavrtzky could rise from his
chair she clasped him in her embraceCome show thyself show
thyselfshe said moving back from his faceEh What a splendid
fellow thou art Thou hast grown older but hast not grown in the least
less comely really But why art thou kissing my handskiss me myself
if my wrinkled cheeks are not repulsive to thee Can it be that thou
didst not ask after me Well tell me is aunty alive Why thou wert
born into my arms thou rogue Well never mind that why shouldst thou
have remembered me Only thou art a sensible fellow to have come Well
my mothershe added addressing Mrya Dmtrievnahast thou given
him any refreshments

I want nothingsaid Lavrtzky hastily

Come drink some tea at least my dear little father O Lord my God He
has come no one knows whence and they dont give him a cup of tea Go
Liza and see about it as quickly as possible I remember that as a
little fellow he was a dreadful glutton and he must be fond of eating
even now

My respects Mrfa Timofevnasaid Pnshin approaching the angry
old woman from one side and bowing low

Excuse me sirretorted Mrfa TimofevnaI did not notice you
for joyThou hast grown to resemble thy mother the darlingshe went
on turning again to Lavrtzkyonly thy nose was and remains like
thy fathers Welland art thou to be long with us

I am going away tomorrow aunty

Whither

Home to Vaslievskoe

Tomorrow

Yes

Well if it must be tomorrow it must God be with theethou knowest
best Only see here thou must come to say farewellThe old woman
tapped him on the cheekI did not think I should live to see thee and
that not because I was preparing to die noI am good for another ten
years probably all we Pstoffs are tenacious of life thy deceased
grandfather used to call us doublelived but the Lord only knew how much
longer thou wouldst ramble about abroad Well but thou art a dashing
fine fellow a fine fellow thou canst still lift ten puds in one hand as
of yore I suppose Thy deceased father excuse me was cranky in some
respects but he did well when he hired a Swiss for thee thou
rememberest how thou and he had fistfights thats called gymnastics
isnt itBut why have I been cackling thus I have only been keeping
Mr Panshn she never called him Pnshin as she ought from
arguing But we had better drink tea let us go and drink it on the
terrace my dear our creamis not like what you get in your Londons and
Parises Let us go let us go and do thou Fdiusha give me thy arm
O how thick it is Theres no danger of falling with thee

All rose and betook themselves to the terrace with the exception of
Gedenovsky who quietly departed During the entire duration of
Lavrtzkys conversation with the mistress of the house Pnshin and
Mrfa Timofevna he had sat in a corner attentively blinking and
sticking out his lips in childish curiosity he now hastened to carry
the news about the new visitor throughout the town

                                                

On that same day at eleven oclock in the evening this is what was
going on at Mme Kaltins house Downstairs on the threshold of the
drawingroom Vladmir Nikolitch having seized a favourable moment
was saying farewell to Liza and telling her as he held her hand You
know who it is that attracts me hither you know why I am incessantly
coming to your house what is the use of words when everything is so
plain Liza made him no reply and without a smile and with eyebrows
slightly elevated and blushing she stared at the floor but did not
withdraw her hand and upstairs in Mrfa Timofevnas chamber by the
light of the shrinelamp which hung in front of the dim ancient holy
pictures Lavrtzky was sitting in an armchair with his elbows on his
knees and his face in his hands the old woman standing before him was
silently stroking his hair from time to time He spent more than an hour
with her after taking leave of the mistress of the house he said almost
nothing to his kind old friend and she did not interrogate him And
what was the use of talking what was there to interrogate him about She
understood everything as it was and she sympathised with everything
wherewith his heart was full to overflowing




                                  VIII


Fedor Ivnovitch Lavrtzky we must ask the readers permission to
break the thread of our narrative for a time was descended from an
ancient family of the nobility The ancestral founder of the Lavrtzkys
had come out of Prussia during the princely reign of Vasly the Blind
and had been granted two hundred quarters of land on Byezhtsk
Heights Many of his descendants were members of various branches of the
public service and sat under princes and distinguished personages in
distant governorships but not one of them ever rose above the rank of
tabledecker at the Court of the Tzars or acquired any considerable
fortune The most opulent and noteworthy of all the Lavrtzkys had been
Fedor Ivnitchs greatgrandfather Andri a harsh insolent
clever and crafty man Down to the day of which we are speaking the
fame of his arbitrary violence of his fiendish disposition his mad
lavishness and unquenchable thirst had not died out He had been very
stout and lofty of stature swarthy of visage and beardless he lisped
and appeared to be sleepy but the more softly he spoke the more did
every one around him tremble He obtained for himself a wife to match
Goggleeyed with hawklike nose with a round sallow face a gipsy by
birth quicktempered and revengeful she was not a whit behind her
husband who almost starved her to death and whom she did not survive
although she was eternally snarling at him

Andris son Pitr Fedors grandfather did not resemble his
father he was a simple squire of the steppes decidedly harebrained a
swashbuckler and dawdler rough but not malicious hospitable and fond
of dogs He was more than thirty years old when he inherited from his
father two thousand souls in capital order but he speedily dispersed
them sold a part of his estate and spoiled his houseservants Petty
little people acquaintances and nonacquaintances crawled from all
sides like blackbeetles to his spacious warm and slovenly mansion
all these ate whatever came to hand but ate their fill drank themselves
drunk and carried off what they could lauding and magnifying the
amiable host and the host when he was not in a good humour also
magnified his guestsas drones and blackguardsbut he was bored without
them Pitr Andritchs wife was a meek person he took her from a
neighbouring family at his fathers choice and command her name was
Anna Pvlovna She never interfered with anything received visitors
cordially and was fond of going out herself although powdering her
hair according to her own words was death to her They put a felt hood
on your head she was wont to narrate in her old age combed your hair
all up on top smeared it with tallow sprinkled on flour stuck in iron
pinsand you could not wash yourself afterward but to go visiting
without powder was impossiblepeople would take offencetortureShe
was fond of driving after trotters was ready to play cards from morning
until night and always covered up with her hand the few farthings of
winnings set down to her when her husband approached the cardtable but
she gave her dowry and all her money to him and required no accounting
for its use She bore him two children a son Ivn Fedors father
and a daughter Glafra

Ivn was not brought up at home but at the house of a wealthy old aunt
Princess Kubensky she had designated him as her heir had it not been
for that his father would not have let him go she dressed him like a
doll hired every sort of teacher for him provided him with a governor
a Frenchman a former abb a disciple of JeanJacques Rousseau a
certain M Courtin de Vaucelles an adroit and subtle intriguerthe
most fine fleur of the emigration as she expressed itand ended by
marrying this finefleur when she was almost seventy years of age she
transferred to his name her entire fortune and soon afterward rouged
scented with amber  la Richelieu surrounded by small negroes
slenderlegged dogs and screeching parrots she died on a crooked little
couch of the time of Louis XV with an enamelled snuffbox the work of
Petitot in her handsand died deserted by her husband the sneaking
M Courtin had preferred to retire to Paris with her money

Ivn was only in his twentieth year when this blow we are speaking of
the Princesss marriage not of her death descended upon him he did not
wish to remain in his aunts house where from a wealthy heir he had
suddenly been converted into a parasite in Petersburg the society in
which he had been reared was closed to him to service beginning with
the lowest ranks difficult and dark he felt repugnance all this took
place at the very beginning of the reign of the Emperor Alexander He
was compelled perforce to return to the country to his father Dirty
poor tattered did his native nest appear to him the dulness and soot of
existence on the steppes offended him at every step he was tormented
with boredom on the other hand every one in the house with the
exception of his mother looked upon him with unfriendly eyes His father
did not like his habits of the capital his dresssuits frilled shirts
books his flute his cleanliness in which not without reason they
scented his fastidiousness he was constantly complaining and grumbling
at his sonNothing here suits him he was wont to say at table he
is dainty he does not eat he cannot endure the odour of the servants
the stifling atmosphere the sight of drunken men disturbs him and you
mustnt dare to fight in his presence either he will not enter
government service hes frail in health forsooth phew what an
effeminate creature And all because Voltaire sticks in his head

The old man cherished a particular dislike for Voltaire and for the
fanatic Diderot although he had never read a single line of their
writings reading was not in his line Pitr Andritch was not mistaken
Diderot and Voltaire really were sticking in his sons head and not they
onlybut Rousseau and Raynal and Helvetius and many other writers of
the same sort were sticking in his headbut only in his head Ivn
Petrvitchs former tutor the retired abb and encyclopedist had
contented himself with pouring the whole philosophy of the XVIII century
into his pupil in a mass and the latter went about brimful of it it
gained lodgment within him without mingling with his blood without
penetrating into his soul without making itself felt as a firm
conviction And could convictions be demanded of a young fellow of
fifty years ago when we have not even yet grown up to them He also
embarrassed the visitors to his fathers house he loathed them and they
feared him and with his sister Glafra who was twelve years older than
he he did not get on at all

This Glafra was a strange being homely hunchbacked gaunt with
stern staring eyes and thin tightly compressed lips in face voice
and quick angular movements she recalled her grandmother the gipsy
the wife of Andri Persistent fond of power she would not even hear
of marriage The return of Ivn Petrvitch did not please her so long
as the Princess Kubensky had kept him with her she had cherished the
hope of receiving at least half of the parental estate she resembled her
grandmother in her avarice Moreover Glafra was envious of her
brother he was so cultivated he spoke French so well with a Parisian
accent while she was scarcely able to say bon jour and comment
vous portez vous To tell the truth her parents did not understand any
French at allbut that did not render it any the more pleasant for her

Ivn Petrvitch did not know what to do with himself for tedium and
melancholy he spent nearly a year in the country and it seemed to him
like ten yearsOnly with his mother did he relieve his heart and he
was wont to sit by the hour in her lowceiled rooms listening to the
simple prattle of the good woman and gorging himself with preserves It
so happened that among Anna Pvlovnas maids there was one very pretty
girl with clear gentle eyes and delicate features named Malnya both
clever and modest She pleased Ivn Petrvitch at first sight and he
fell in love with her he fell in love with her timid walk her shy
answers her soft voice her gentle smile with every passing day she
seemed to him more charming And she became attached to Ivn Petrvitch
with her whole soul as only Russian girls can become attachedand gave
herself to him

In the country manorhouse of a landed proprietor no secret can be kept
long every one soon knew of the bond between the young master and
Malnya the tidings of this connection at last reached Pitr
Andritch himself At any other time he would in all probability have
paid no heed to such an insignificant matter but he had long been in a
rage with his son and rejoiced at the opportunity to put to shame the
Petersburg philosopher and dandy Tumult shrieks and uproar arose
Malnya was locked up in the lumberroom Ivn Petrvitch was summoned
to his parent Anna Pvlovna also hastened up at the outcry She made an
effort to pacify her husband but Pitr Andritch no longer listened to
anything Like a vulture he pounced upon his son upbraided him with
immorality with impiety with hypocrisy incidentally he vented on him
all his accumulated wrath against the Princess Kubensky and
overwhelmed him with insulting epithets At first Ivn Petrvitch held
his peace and stood firm but when his father took it into his head to
threaten him with a disgraceful chastisement he lost patience The
fanatic Diderot has come on the stage again he thoughtso just wait
Ill put him in action Ill astonish you all

Thereupon in a quiet voice although trembling in every limb Ivn
Petrvitch announced to his father that there was no necessity for
upbraiding him with immorality that although he did not intend to
justify his fault yet he was ready to rectify it and that the more
willingly because he felt himself superior to all prejudicesin short
he was ready to marry Malnya By uttering these words Ivn
Petrvitch did undoubtedly attain his object he astounded Pitr
Andritch to such a degree that the latter stared with all his eyes
and was rendered dumb for a moment but he immediately recovered himself
and just as he was clad in a short coat lined with squirrelskin and
with slippers on his bare feet he flung himself with clenched fists upon
Ivn Petrvitch who that day as though expressly had his hair
dressed  la Titus and had donned a new blue English dresscoat
boots with tassels and dandified chamois trousers skintight Anna
Pvlovna shrieked at the top of her voice and covered her face with her
hands but her son ran through the whole house sprang out into the yard
rushed into the vegetable garden across the garden flew out upon the
highway and kept running without looking behind him until at last he
ceased to hear behind him the heavy tramp of his fathers footsteps and
his violent broken shouts Stop rascal he roaredstop Ill
curse thee

Ivn Petrvitch hid himself in the house of a neighbouring peasant
proprietor while Pitr Andritch returned home utterly exhausted and
perspiring and announcing almost before he had recovered his breath
that he would deprive his son of his blessing and his heritage ordered
all his idiotic books to be burned and the maid Malnya to be sent
forthwith to a distant village Kind people turned up who sought out
Ivn Petrvitch and informed him of all Mortified enraged he vowed
that he would take revenge on his father and that very night lying in
wait for the peasant cart in which Malnya was being carried off he
rescued her by force galloped off with her to the nearest town and
married her He was supplied with money by a neighbour an eternally
intoxicated and extremely goodnatured retired naval officer a
passionate lover of every sort of noble adventure as he expressed it On
the following day Ivn Petrvitch wrote a causticallycold and
courteous letter to Pitr Andritch and betook himself to an estate
where dwelt his second cousin Dmtry Pstoff and his sister Mrfa
Timofevna already known to the reader He told them everything
announced that he intended to go to Petersburg to seek a place and
requested them to give shelter to his wife for a time at least At the
word wife he fell to weeping bitterly and despite his city breeding
and his philosophy he prostrated himself humbly after the fashion of a
Russian beggar before the feet of his relatives and even beat his brow
against the floor The Pstoffs kind and compassionate people gladly
acceded to his request he spent three weeks with them in secret
expectation of a reply from his father but no reply cameand none
could come Pitr Andritch on learning of his sons marriage had
taken to his bed and had forbidden the name of Ivn Petrvitch to be
mentioned in his presence but his mother without the knowledge of her
husband borrowed five hundred rubles from the ecclesiastical supervisor
of the diocese and sent them to him together with a small holy picture
for his wife she was afraid to write but she gave orders that Ivn
Petrvitch was to be told by the lean peasant her envoy who managed to
walk sixty versts in the course of twentyfour hours that he must not
grieve too much that God willing everything would come right and his
father would convert wrath into mercy that she also would have
preferred a different daughterinlaw but that evidently God had so
willed it and she sent her maternal blessing to Malnya Sergyevna
The lean little peasant received a ruble requested permission to see his
new mistress to whom he was related as cosponsor at a baptism kissed
her hand and hastened off homeward

And Ivn Petrvitch set off for Petersburg with a light heart The
unknown future awaited him poverty perhaps menaced him but he had
bidden farewell to the life in the country which he detested and most
important of all he had not betrayed his teachers he really had put in
action and justified in fact Rousseau Diderot and la dclaration des
droits de lhomme A sense of duty accomplished of triumph of pride
filled his soul and his separation from his wife did not greatly alarm
him the necessity of living uninterruptedly with his wife would have
perturbed him more That affair was ended he must take up other affairs
In Petersburg contrary to his own expectation fortune smiled on him
Princess Kubenskywhom Monsieur Courtin had already succeeded in
abandoning but who had not yet succeeded in dyingby way in some
measure of repairing the injury which she had done to her nephew
recommended him to the good graces of all her friends and gave him five
thousand rublesalmost her last farthingand a Lepkovsky watch with
his coat of arms in a garland of cupids Three months had not elapsed
when he had already obtained a place in the Russian mission to London
and he went to sea on the first English ship which sailed there was no
thought of steamers in those days A few months later he received a
letter from Pstoff The kindhearted squire congratulated Ivn
Petrvitch on the birth of a son who had made his appearance in the
world in the village of Pokrvskoe on August   and was named
Fedor in honour of the holy martyr Fedor the Strategist Owing to
her extreme weakness Malnya Sergyevna added only a few lines but
those few lines astonished Ivn Petrvitch he was not aware that
Mrfa Timofevna had taught his wife to read and write However Ivn
Petrvitch did not give himself up for long to the sweet agitation of
paternal emotions he was paying court to one of the most famous Phrynes
or Lases of the period classical appellations were still flourishing
at that epoch the peace of Tilsit had just been concluded and
everybody was making haste to enjoyment everything was whirling round in
a sort of mad whirlwind He had very little money but he played luckily
at cards he picked up acquaintances he took part in all the
merrymakingsin a word he was dashing along under full sail

It was long before old Lavrtzky could forgive his son for his marriage
if after the lapse of half a year Ivn Petrvitch had presented himself
in contrition and had flung himself at his feet he would probably have
pardoned him after first scolding him roundly and administering a few
taps with his crutch by way of inspiring awe but Ivn Petrvitch was
living abroad and evidently cared not a rapHold your tongue Dont
dare Pitr Andritch kept repeating to his wife as soon as she tried
to incline him to mercy He ought to pray to God for me forever the pup
for not having laid my curse upon him my late father would have slain him
with his own hands the goodfornothing and he would have done right At
such terrible speeches Anna Pvlovna merely crossed herself furtively As
for Ivn Petrvitchs wife Pitr Andritch at first would not allow
her to be mentioned and even in reply to a letter of Pstoff wherein the
latter alluded to his daughterinlaw he gave orders to say to him that
he knew nothing whatever about any daughterinlaw of his and that it was
prohibited by the laws to harbour runaway maids on which point he regarded
it as his duty to warn him but later on when he learned of the birth of a
grandson he softened gave orders that inquiries should be made on the sly
concerning the health of the young mother and sent her also as though it
did not come from him a little money Fdya had not reached his first
birthday when Anna Pvlovna was seized with a fatal illness A few days
before her end when she could no longer leave her bed she declared to her
husband in the presence of the priest that she wished to see and bid
farewell to her daughterinlaw and to bestow her blessing on her
grandchild The afflicted old man soothed her and immediately sent his own
equipage for his daughterinlaw for the first time calling her Malnya
Sergyevna She came with her son and with Mrfa Timofevna who
would not let her go alone on any terms and would not have allowed her to
be affronted Half dead with terror Malnya entered Pitr Andritchs
study The nurse carried Fdya after her Pitr Andritch gazed at her
in silence she approached to kiss his hand her quivering lips hardly met
in a noiseless kiss

Well newground undried noblewomanhe said at lasthow do you
do let us go to the mistress

He rose and bent over Fdya the baby smiled and stretched out his
little white arms The old man was completely upset

Okh he saidthou orphan Thou hast plead thy fathers cause with
me I will not abandon thee my birdling

As soon as Malnya Sergyevna entered the bedchamber of Anna Pvlovna
she knelt down near the door Anna Pvlovna beckoned her to the bed
embraced her blessed her son then turning her countenance ravaged by
disease to her husband she tried to speak

I know I know what entreaty thou desirest to makesaid Pitr
Andritchdo not worry she shall stay with us and I will pardon
Vnka for her sake

Anna Pvlovna with an effort grasped her husbands hand and pressed
it to her lips On that same evening she died

Pitr Andritch kept his word He informed his son that for the sake
of his mothers dying hour for the sake of baby Fedor he restored to
him his blessing and would keep Malnya Sergyevna in his own house
Two rooms were set apart for her use in the entresol he introduced her
to his most respected visitor oneeyed Brigadier Skurykhin and to his
wife he presented her with two maids and a pageboy for errands Mrfa
Timofevna bade her farewell she detested Glafra and quarrelled with
her thrice in the course of one day

At first the poor woman found her situation painful and awkward but
afterward she learned to bear things patiently and became accustomed to
her fatherinlaw He also became accustomed to her he even grew to
love her although he almost never spoke to her although in his caresses
a certain involuntary disdain toward her was perceptible Malnya
Sergyevna had most of all to endure from her sisterinlaw Glafra
already during her mothers lifetime had succeeded in getting gradually
the entire house into her hands every one beginning with her father
was subject to her not a lump of sugar was given out without her
permission she would have consented to die rather than to share the
power with any other mistress of the house Her brothers marriage had
angered her even more than it had Pitr Andritch she took it upon
herself to teach the upstart a lesson and from the very first hour
Malnya Sergyevna became her slave

And how could she contend with the selfwilled arrogant Glafra she
who was mild constantly agitated and terrified and also weak in
health Not a day passed that Glafra did not remind her of her former
position did not praise her for not forgetting her place Malnya
Sergyevna would gladly have reconciled herself to these reminders and
praises however bitter they might be  but they took Fdya away from
her that was what broke her heart Under the pretext that she was not
competent to take charge of his education she was hardly permitted to
see him Glafra took this matter upon herself the child passed under
her full control Malnya Sergyevna began out of grief to entreat
Ivn Petrvitch in her letters to come home as speedily as possible
Pitr Andritch himself wished to see his son but he merely wrote in
reply thanking his father about his wife and for the money sent and
promising to come soonand did not come The year  recalled him at
last to his fatherland from abroad

On meeting again for the first time after their six years separation
the father and son exchanged embraces and did not allude by so much as
a word to their former dissensions they were not in the mood for it
then all Russia had risen against the enemy and both of them felt that
Russian blood was flowing in their veins Pitr Andritch at his own
expense clothed an entire regiment of soldiers But the war came to an
end the danger passed again Ivn Petrvitch began to feel bored
again he longed for faraway places for the world to which he had grown
fast and where he felt himself at home Malnya Sergyevna could not
hold him back she counted for too little with him Even her hopes had
not been realised her husband also deemed it much more fitting that
Fdyas education should be entrusted to Glafra Ivn Petrvitchs
poor wife could not withstand this blow could not endure this second
parting without a murmur in a few days she expired During the whole
course of her life she had never been able to offer resistance and she
did not combat her malady She could no longer speak the shadows of the
tomb had already descended upon her face but her features as of old
expressed patient perplexity and the steadfast gentleness of submission
with the same dumb humility she gazed at Glafra and like Anna
Pvlovna on her deathbed she kissed the hand of Pitr Andritch and
pressed her lips to Glafras hand also entrusting to her Glafra
her only son Thus ended its earthly career a kind and gentle being
torn God alone knows why from its native soil and immediately flung
aside like an uprooted sapling with its roots to the sun it faded
away it vanished without a trace that being and no one mentioned it
Those who grieved for Malnya Sergyevna were her maid and Pitr
Andritch The old man missed her silent presence Forgivefarewell
my patient one he whispered as he made her the parting reverence in
church He wept as he threw a handful of earth into the grave

He did not long survive hernot more than five years In the winter of
 he died peacefully in Moscow whither he had removed with Glafra
and his grandson and left orders in his will that he should be buried
by the side of Anna Pvlovna and Malsha Ivn Petrvitch was in
Paris at the time for his pleasure he had resigned from the service
soon after  On hearing of his fathers death he decided to return
to Russia It was necessary to consider the organisation of the estate
 and Fdya according to Glafras letter had reached the age of
twelve years and the time had arrived for occupying himself seriously
with the boys education

Ivn Petrvitch returned to Russia an Anglomaniac His closelyclipped
hair starched neckcloth longskirted yellowishgray overcoat with a
multitude of capes his sour expression of visage a certain harshness
and also indifference of demeanour his manner of talking through his
teeth a wooden abrupt laugh the absence of smiles a conversation
exclusively political and politicoeconomical a passion for bloody roast
beef and port wineeverything about him fairly reeked of Great Britain
he seemed thoroughly imbued with her spirit Butstrange to say while
he had turned into an Anglomaniac Ivn Petrvitch had simultaneously
become a patriot at all events he called himself a patriot although he
was but badly acquainted with Russia was not wedded to a single Russian
habit and expressed himself queerly in Russian in ordinary
conversation his speech was clumsy and pithless studded all over with
Gallicisms but no sooner did the discussion touch upon important topics
than Ivn Petrvitch instantly brought out such expressions as to
show new proofs of selfzeal that doth not agree with the nature of
the circumstances and so forth Ivn Petrvitch brought with him
several manuscript plans touching the organisation and amelioration of
the empire he was extremely dissatisfied with everything he sawthe
absence of system in particular stirred up his bile On meeting his
sister he announced to her with his very first words that he intended
to introduce radical reforms that henceforth everything on his estate
should proceed upon a new system Glafra Petrvna made no reply to
Ivn Petrvitch but merely set her teeth and said to herself And
what is to become of meBut when she reached the country estate in
company with her brother and her nephew she speedily regained her
composure In the house several changes actually took place the female
hangerson and drones were subjected to instant expulsion among their
number two old women suffered one who was blind and the other crippled
with paralysis also a decrepit Major of the Otchakff period who on
account of his truly astonishing voracity was fed on nothing but black
bread and lentils A decree was also issued that the former guests were
not to be received they were superseded by a distant neighbour a
fairhaired scrofulous baron a very well educated and very stupid man
New furniture from Moscow made its appearance cuspidors and bells and
washstands were introduced and they began to serve the noon breakfast
differently foreign wines took the place of vdka and homemade
liqueurs new liveries were made for the servants the motto in recto
virtus was added to the family coat of arms But in reality
Glafras power was not diminished all the disbursements and purchases
depended on her as before the imported Alsatian valet made an attempt
to vie with herand lost his place in spite of the fact that his master
took his side So far as the management the administration of the
estates was concerned Glafra Petrvna entered into all these
matters despite Ivn Petrvitchs frequently expressed intention to
infuse new life into this chaos everything remained as of yore except
that here and there the quitrents were augmented and the
husbandryservice became more oppressive and the peasants were forbidden
to apply directly to Ivn Petrvitch The patriot heartily despised his
fellowcitizens Ivn Petrvitchs system was applied in its full
force to Fdya only his education actually was subjected to radical
reform his father had exclusive charge of it



   That is to say he used such fundamentally national words as occur
      only in the Old Church Slavonic wellnigh untranslatable here also

                                   XI


Up to the time of Ivn Petrvitchs return from abroad Fdya had
been as we have already said in the hands of Glafra Petrvna He was
less than eight years of age when his mother died he had not seen her
every day and he had loved her passionately the memory of her of her
pale and gentle face her melancholy glances and timid caresses had
forever imprinted itself upon his heart but he dimly comprehended her
position in the house he was conscious that between him and her there
existed a barrier which she dared not and could not overthrow He shunned
his father and Ivn Petrvitch never petted him his grandfather
occasionally stroked his head and permitted him to kiss his hand but he
called him and considered him a little fool After the death of Malnya
Sergyevna his aunt took him in hand definitively Fdya feared
herfeared her bright keen eyes her sharp voice he dared not utter a
sound in her presence it sometimes happened that when he had merely
fidgeted on his chair she would scream out Where art thou going sit
still On Sundays after the Liturgy he was permitted to playthat is
to say he was given a thick book a mysterious book the work of a
certain MaxmovitchAmbdik entitled Symbols and Emblems This book
contained about a thousand in part very puzzling pictures with equally
puzzling explanations in five languages Cupid with a plump naked body
played a great part in these pictures To one of them labelled Saffron
and Rainbow was appended the explanation The action of this is great
 opposite another which represented A Heron flying with a violet
blossom in his mouth stood the inscription All of them are known unto
thee Cupid and a bear licking its cub was designated as Little by
little Fdya contemplated these pictures he was familiar with the
most minute details of them all some of themalways the same onesset
him to thinking and excited his imagination he knew no other diversions
When the time came to teach him languages and music Glafra Petrvna
hired for a paltry sum an elderly spinster a Swede with frightened
harelike eyes who spoke French and German indifferently played the
piano after a fashion and in addition knew how to salt cucumbers in
firstclass style In the society of this instructress of his aunt and
of an old chambermaid Vaslievna Fdya passed four whole years He
used to sit in the corner with his Emblemsand sit  and sit 
while the lowceiled room smelled of geraniums a solitary tallow candle
burned dimly a cricket chirped monotonously as though it were bored
the little clock ticked hastily on the wall a mouse stealthily scratched
and gnawed behind the wallhangings and the three old maids like the
Parc moved their knittingneedles silently and swiftly to and fro the
shadows cast by their hands now flitted again quivered strangely in the
semidarkness and strange thoughts also halfdark swarmed in the
childs head No one would have called Fdya an interesting child he
was quite pallid but fat awkwardly built and clumsya regular
peasant according to Glafra Petrvnas expression the pallor would
speedily have disappeared from his face if he had been permitted to go
out of doors more frequently He studied tolerably well although he
frequently idled he never wept on the other hand at times a fierce
obstinacy came over him then no one could do anything with him Fdya
loved none of the persons around him Woe to the heart which loves not
in its youth

Thus did Ivn Petrvitch find him and without loss of time he set to
work to apply his system to himI want to make a man of him first of
all un hommehe said to Glafra Petrvnaand not only a man
but a Spartan Ivn Petrvitch began the execution of his intention by
dressing his son in Highland garb the lad of twelve began to go about
with bare knees and with a cocks feather in his crushcap the Swede
was superseded by a young Swiss man who had learned gymnastics to
perfection music as an occupation unworthy of a man was banished
forever the natural sciences international law mathematics the
carpenters trade after the advice of JeanJacques Rousseau and
heraldry for the maintenance of knightly sentimentsthese were the
things wherewith the future man was to occupy himself he was waked at
four oclock in the morning was immediately drenched with cold water
and made to run around a tall pillar at the end of a rope he ate once a
day one dish rode on horseback practised firing a crossbow on every
convenient opportunity he exercised his strength of will after the model
of his parent and every evening he noted down in a special book an
account of the past day and his impressions and Ivn Petrvitch on
his side wrote him precepts in French in which he called him mon
fils and addressed him as vous In Russian Fdya called his father
thou but he dared not sit down in his presence The system
bewildered the boy introduced confusion into his head squeezed it but
on the other hand the new mode of life acted beneficially on his health
at first he caught a fever but soon recovered and became a fine
dashing fellow His father was proud of him and called him in his
strange jargon A son of nature my product When Fdya reached the
age of sixteen Ivn Petrvitch regarded it as his duty to instil into
him betimes scorn for the fair sexand the youthful Spartan with
timidity in his soul with the first down upon his lips full of vigour
strength and blood attempted to appear indifferent cold and harsh

Meanwhile time passed and passed Ivn Petrvitch spent the greater
part of the year at Lavrki that was the name of his paternal estate
and in the winters he went alone to Moscow stopped at an inn diligently
frequented the club orated and set forth his plans in drawingrooms and
conducted himself more like an Anglomaniac a grumbler and a statesman
than ever But the year  arrived and brought with it much woe
Ivn Petrvitchs intimate friends and acquaintances were subjected to
severe trials Ivn Petrvitch made haste to retreat to his country
estate and locked himself up in his house Another year elapsed and
Ivn Petrvitch suddenly grew feeble weakened declined his health
deserted him A freethinkerhe took to going to church and to ordering
services of prayer a Europeanhe began to steam himself at the bath to
dine at two oclock to go to bed at nine to fall asleep to the chatter
of the aged butler a statesmanhe burned all his plans all his
correspondence trembled before the governor and fidgeted in the
presence of the rural chief of police a man with a will of ironhe
whimpered and complained when an abscess broke out on him when he was
served with a plate of cold soup Glafra Petrvna again reigned over
everything in the house again clerks village bailiffs common peasants
began to creep through the back entrance to the illtempered old
hagthat was what the houseservants called her The change in Ivn
Petrvitch gave his son a great shock he was already in his nineteenth
year and had begun to reason and to free himself from the weight of the
hand which oppressed him He had noticed even before this a discrepancy
between his fathers words and deeds between his broad and liberal
theories and his harsh petty despotism but he had not anticipated such
a sudden break The inveterate egoist suddenly revealed himself at full
length Young Lavrtzky was getting ready to go to Moscow to prepare
himself for the universitywhen an unforeseen fresh calamity descended
upon the head of Ivn Petrvitch he became blind and that hopelessly
in one day

Not trusting in the skill of Russian physicians he began to take
measures to obtain permission to go abroad It was refused Then he took
his son with him and for three whole years he roamed over Russia from
one doctor to another incessantly journeying from town to town and
driving the physicians his son his servants to despair by his
pusillanimity and impatience He returned to Lavrki a perfect rag a
tearful and capricious child Bitter days ensued every one endured much
at his hands Ivn Petrvitch calmed down only while he was eating his
dinner he had never eaten so greedily nor so much all the rest of the
time he never gave himself or others any peace He prayed grumbled at
fate railed at himself reviled politics his systemreviled
everything which he had made his boast and upon which he had prided
himself everything which he had held up as an example for his son he
insisted that he believed in nothing and then prayed again he could not
bear to be left alone for a single moment and demanded from the members
of his household that they should sit uninterruptedly day and night
beside his armchair and amuse him with stories which he incessantly
interrupted with the exclamation You are inventing the whole of
itwhat trash

Glafra Petrvna had a particularly hard time he positively could not
get along without herand to the end she complied with all the invalids
whims although sometimes she could not make up her mind on the instant
to answer him lest the sound of her voice should betray her inward
wrath In this manner he lingered on two years and died in the beginning
of May when he had been carried out upon the balcony in the sunshine
Glshka Glshka the bouillon the bouillon you old foo  lisped
his stiffening tongue and without finishing the last word it became
silent forever Glafra Petrvna who had just snatched the cup of
bouillon from the hands of the butler stopped short stared her brother
in the face crossed herself slowly and broadly and withdrew in silence
and his son who was present said nothing either but leaned against
the railing of the balcony and gazed for a long time into the garden
all fragrant and verdant all glittering in the rays of the golden sun of
spring He was twentythree years old how terribly how imperceptibly
fast those three and twenty years had sped past Life was opening
before him

                                   XII


After having buried his father and entrusted to the immutable Glafra
Petrvna the management of the farming and the oversight over the
clerks young Lavrtzky betook himself to Moscow whither he was drawn
by an obscure but powerful sentiment He recognised the defects of his
education and intended to repair omissions so far as possible During
the last five years he had read a great deal and had seen some things
many thoughts had been seething in his brain any professor might have
envied him some of his knowledge but at the same time he did not know
much with which every gymnasium lad has long been familiar The
Anglomaniac had played his son an evil trick his whimsical education had
borne its fruits For long years he had abased himself before his father
without a question but when at last he had divined him the deed was
done the habits had become rooted He did not know how to make
acquaintance with people at twentythree years of age with an
indomitable thirst for love in his shamestricken heart he did not dare
to look a single woman in the eye With his clear solid but somewhat
heavy sense with his inclination to stubbornness contemplation and
indolence he ought from his earliest years to have been cast into the
whirlpool of life but he had been kept in an artificial isolation
And now the charmed circle was broken yet he continued to stand in one
spot locked up tightly compressed in himself It was ridiculous at his
age to don a students uniform but he was not afraid of ridicule his
Spartan training had served its turn to this extent at least that it had
developed in him scorn for other peoples remarksand so unabashed he
donned the uniform of a student He entered the physicomathematical
department Healthy rosycheeked with a wellgrown beard taciturn he
produced a strange impression upon his comrades they did not suspect
that in this surly man who punctually drove to the lectures in a roomy
country sledge and pair there was concealed almost a child He seemed to
them some sort of wise pedant they did not need him and did not seek his
society he avoided them In the course of the first two years which he
spent at the university he came into close contact with only one
student from whom he took lessons in Latin This student Mikhalvitch
by name an enthusiast and a poet sincerely loved Lavrtzky and quite
innocently became the cause of an important change in his fate

One day at the theatre Motchloff was then at the height of his fame
and Lavrtzky never missed a performance he saw a young girl in a box
of the beltageand although no woman ever passed his surly figure
without causing his heart to quiver it never yet had beaten so
violently With her elbows resting on the velvet of the box the young
girl sat motionless alert young life sparkled in every feature of her
pretty round darkskinned face an elegant mind was expressed in the
beautiful eyes which gazed attentively and softly from beneath slender
brows in the swift smile of her expressive lips in the very attitude of
her head her arms her neck she was charmingly dressed Beside her sat
a wrinkled sallow woman fortyfive years of age with a toothless smile
on her constrainedlyanxious and empty countenance and in the depths of
the box an elderly man was visible wearing an ample coat and a tall
neckcloth with an expression of feeble stateliness and a certain
obsequious suspicion in his little eyes with dyed moustache and
sidewhiskers an insignificant huge forehead and furrowed cheeksa
retired General by all the signs Lavrtzky could not take his eyes
from the young girl who had startled him all at once the door of the
box opened and Mikhalvitch entered The appearance of that man almost
his sole acquaintance in all Moscowhis appearance in the company of
the only young girl who had engrossed his whole attention seemed to
Lavrtzky strange and significant As he continued to gaze at the box
he noticed that all the persons in it treated Mikhalvitch like an old
friend The performance on the stage ceased to interest Lavrtzky
Motchloff himself although that evening he was in high feather did
not produce upon him the customary impression In one very pathetic
passage Lavrtzky involuntarily glanced at his beauty she was bending
her whole body forward her cheeks were aflame under the influence of
his persistent gaze her eyes which were riveted on the stage turned
slowly and rested upon him All night long those eyes flitted before
his vision At last the artificially erected dam had given way he
trembled and burned and on the following day he betook himself to
Mikhalvitch From him he learned that the beautys name was Varvra
Pvlovna Korbyn that the old man and woman who had sat with her in
the box were her father and mother and that he himself Mikhalvitch
had made their acquaintance a year previously during his stay in the
suburbs of Moscow on contract service as tutor with Count N The
enthusiast expressed himself in the most laudatory manner concerning
Varvra PvlovnaMy dear fellow he exclaimed with the impetuous
harmony in his voice which was peculiar to himthat young girl is an
amazing a talented being an artist in the genuine sense of the word
and extremely amiable to bootPerceiving from Lavrtzkys question
what an impression Varvra Pvlovna had produced upon him he himself
proposed to introduce him to her adding that he was quite at home in
their house that the General was not at all a proud man and the mother
was so stupid that she all but sucked a rag Lavrtzky blushed muttered
something unintelligible and fled For five whole days he wrestled with
his timidity on the sixth day the young Spartan donned a new uniform
and placed himself at the disposition of Mikhalvitch who being his own
valet confined himself to brushing his hairand the two set out for
the Korbyns




                                  XIII


The father of Varvra Pvlovna Pvel Petrvitch Korbyn
MajorGeneral on the retired list had spent his whole life in
Petersburg in the service had borne the reputation in his youth of
being an accomplished dancer and officer of the line found himself
owing to poverty the adjutant of two or three illfavoured Generals
married the daughter of one of them receiving twentyfive thousand
rubles as her dowry acquired in its finest details the love of drills
and reviews toiled and toiled hard for his livelihood and at last at
the end of twenty years attained to the rank of General and received a
regiment It was time for him to rest and without delay to establish his
prosperity on a firm basis this was what he calculated on doing but he
managed the matter somewhat incautiously he hit upon a new method of
putting the coin of the realm into circulationthe method proved to be
a capital one but he did not get out in season a complaint was made
against him a more than unpleasant an ugly scandal ensued The General
managed to wriggle out of the scandal after a fashion but his career
was ruined he was advised to resign He hung about in Petersburg for a
couple of years longer in the hope that some snug little place would get
stranded on him but the place did not strand on him and his daughter
came out of the government school and his expenses increased every
day Repressing his wrath he decided to remove to Moscow for the sake
of economy hired a tiny lowroofed house on Old Stable Street with a
coat of arms a fathom tall on the roof and began to live the life of a
Moscow General on the retired list spending  rubles a year Moscow
is a hospitable town glad to welcome everybody who comes along and more
particularly Generals Pvel Petrvitchs heavy figure which yet was
not lacking in military mien speedily began to make its appearance in
the best drawingrooms of Moscow His bald nape with tufts of dyed hair
and the dirty ribbon of the order of St Anna on a neckcloth the hue of
the ravens wing began to be well known to all the easily bored and
pallid young men who morosely hovered around the gamblingtables while
dancing was in progress Pvel Petrvitch understood how to place
himself in society he talked little but by force of old habit through
his noseof course not with individuals belonging to the higher ranks
he played cards cautiously at home he ate sparingly but when visiting
he ate for six Concerning his wife there is hardly anything to say her
name was Kallipe Krlovna a tear oozed from her left eye by virtue
of which Kallipe Krlovna she was moreover of German extraction
regarded herself as a woman of sentiment she lived in constant fear of
something never seemed to have had quite enough to eat and wore tight
velvet gowns a turban and dull bracelets of hollow metal Varvra
Pvlovna the only daughter of Pvel Petrvitch and Kallipe
Krlovna had just passed her seventeenth birthday when she came out of
the    Institute where she had been considered if not the greatest
beauty certainly the cleverest girl and the best musician and where she
had received the chiffre she was not yet nineteen when Lavrtzky
beheld her for the first time



   In the Government Institutes for girls the chief prize is the
      Empresss initial in jewelsTranslator




                                   XIV


The legs of the Spartan gave way beneath him when Mikhalvitch conducted
him into the rather shabbily furnished drawingroom of the Korbyns and
presented him to the master and mistress of the house But the feeling of
timidity which had taken possession of him promptly disappeared in the
General the kindliness of nature innate in all Russians was greatly
increased by that special sort of courtesy which is peculiar to all
besmirched people the Generaless soon disappeared somehow as for
Varvra Pvlovna she was so calm and selfpossessedly amiable that
any one would immediately have felt himself at home in her presence
moreover from the whole of her enchanting person from her smiling eyes
from her innocentlysloping shoulders and faintlyrosy hands from her
light and at the same time rather languid gait from the very sound of
her voice which was low and sweetthere breathed forth an insinuating
charm as intangible as a delicate perfume a soft and as yet modest
intoxication something which it is difficult to express in words but
which touched and excitedand of course excited something which was
not timidity Lavrtzky turned the conversation on the theatre on the
performance of the preceding evening she immediately began herself to
speak of Motchloff and did not confine herself merely to exclamations
and sighs but uttered several just and femininelypenetrating remarks
concerning his acting Mikhalvitch alluded to music without any
affectation she seated herself at the piano and played with precision
several mazurkas by Chopin which had only just come into fashion The
dinnerhour arrived Lavrtzky made a motion to depart but they kept
him at table the General treated him to good claret for which the
Generals lackey had galloped in a cab to Deprs Late at night
Lavrtzky returned home and sat for a long time without undressing
his eyes covered with his hand in dumb enchantment It seemed to him
that only now had he come to understand why life was worth living all
his hypotheses his intentions all that nonsense and rubbish vanished
instantaneously his whole soul was merged in one sentiment in one
desire in the desire for happiness possession love the sweet love of
woman From that day forth he began to go often to the Korbyns Six
months later he declared himself to Varvra Pvlovna and offered her
his hand His proposal was accepted the General had long since almost
on the eve of his first visit inquired of Mikhalvitch how many serfs
he Lavrtzky had and Varvra Pvlovna also who during the whole
period of the young mans courtship and even at the moment of his
declaration had preserved her habitual tranquillity and clearness of
soulVarvra Pvlovna also was well aware that her lover was rich
and Kallipe Krlovna said to herself Meine Tochter macht eine
schne Partieand bought herself a new turban




                                   XV


So his proposal was accepted but on certain conditions In the first
place Lavrtzky must immediately leave the university who marries a
student and what a dreadful ideafor a landed proprietor rich and
twentysix years old to take lessons like a schoolboy In the second
place Varvra Pvlovna took upon herself the labour of ordering and
purchasing the trousseau even of choosing the bridegrooms gifts She
had a great deal of practical sense much taste much love for comfort
and a great knack for securing for herself that comfort This knack
particularly astonished Lavrtzky when immediately after the wedding
he and his wife set out in a commodious carriage which she had bought
for Lavrki How everything which surrounded him had been planned
foreseen provided for by Varvra Pvlovna What charming travelling
requisites what fascinating toiletboxes and coffeepots made their
appearance in divers snug nooks and how prettily Varvra Pvlovna
herself boiled the coffee in the mornings But Lavrtzky was not then in
a mood for observation he was in a beatific state he was intoxicating
himself with happiness he gave himself up to it like a child And he
was as innocent as a child that young Alcides Not in vain did witchery
exhale from the whole being of his young wife not in vain did she
promise to the senses the secret luxury of unknown delights she
fulfilled more than she had promised On arriving at Lavrki in the
very hottest part of the summer she found the house dirty and dark the
servants ridiculous and antiquated but she did not find it necessary
even to hint at this to her husband If she had been making preparations
to settle down at Lavrki she would have made over everything about it
beginning of course with the house but the idea of remaining in that
Godforsaken corner of the steppes never entered her mind for one moment
she lived in it as though camping out gently enduring all the
inconveniences and making amusing jests over them Mrfa Timofevna
came to see her nursling Varvra Pvlovna took a great liking for her
but she did not take a liking for Varvra Pvlovna Neither did the new
mistress of the house get on well with Glafra Petrvna she would have
left her in peace but old Korbyn wanted to feather his nest from his
soninlaws affairs it was no shame even for a General said he to
manage the estate of so near a relative It must be assumed that Pvel
Petrvitch would not have disdained to busy himself with the estate of
an entire stranger Varvra Pvlovna conducted her attack in a very
artful manner without thrusting herself forward and still to all
appearances wholly absorbed in the felicity of the honeymoon in quiet
country life in music and reading she little by little drove Glafra
Petrvna to such a state that one morning the latter rushed like a
madwoman into Lavrtzkys study and hurling her bunch of keys on the
table announced that it was beyond her power to occupy herself with the
housekeeping and that she did not wish to remain in the country Having
been properly prepared in advance Lavrtzky immediately consented to
her departureGlafra Petrvna had not expected this Very well
said she and her eyes grew darkI see that I am not wanted here I
know who it is that is driving me hencefrom my native nest But do thou
remember my words nephew thou shalt never be able to build thyself a
nest anywhere thou must wander all thy life That is my legacy to
theeThat very day she departed to her own little estate and a week
later General Korbyn arrived and with agreeable melancholy in his gaze
and movements took the management of the entire estate into his hands

In September Varvra Petrvna carried her husband off to Petersburg She
spent two winters in Petersburg they removed to Tzrskoe Sel for the
summer in a beautiful light elegantly furnished apartment they made
many acquaintances in middleclass and even in the higher circles of
society they went out and received a great deal and gave most charming
musical and dancing parties Varvra Pvlovna attracted guests as a flame
attracts moths Such a dissipated life did not altogether please Fedor
Ivnitch His wife advised him to enter the service owing to his fathers
old memories and his own conceptions he would not serve but to please
his wife he remained in Petersburg But he speedily divined that no one
prevented his isolating himself that it was not for nothing that he had
the quietest and most comfortable study in all Petersburg that his
solicitous wife was even ready to help him to isolate himselfand from
that time forth all went splendidly Once more he took up his own
education which in his opinion was unfinished once more he began to
read he even began to study the English language It was strange to see
his mighty broadshouldered figure eternally bent over his writingtable
his full hairy ruddy face half concealed by the pages of a dictionary or
an exercisebook Every morning he spent in work dined capitally Varvra
Pvlovna was an excellent housewife and in the evening he entered an
enchanting fragrant brilliant world all populated with young merry
facesand the central point of that world was also the zealous hostess
his wife She gladdened him with the birth of a son but the poor boy did
not live long he died in the spring and in the summer by the advice of
the physicians Lavrtzky took his wife abroad to the baths Diversion
was indispensable to her after such a bereavement and her health required
a warm climate They spent the summer and autumn in Germany and
Switzerland and in the winter as might have been expected they went to
Paris In Paris Varvra Pvlovna blossomed out like a rose and managed
to build a little nest for herself as promptly and as adroitly as in
Petersburg She found an extremely pretty apartment in one of the quiet
but fashionable Paris streets she made her husband such a dressinggown as
he had never owned before she hired a trim maid a capital cook a smart
footman she got an enchanting carriage a charming little piano A week
had not passed before she crossed a street wore her shawl opened her
parasol and put on her gloves in a style equal to that of the
purestblooded Parisienne And she soon provided herself with
acquaintances At first only Russians went to her house then Frenchmen
began to make their appearance very amiable courteous unmarried with
beautiful manners and euphonious family names they all talked fast and
much bowed with easy grace and screwed up their eyes in a pleasing way
all of them had white teeth which gleamed beneath rosy lipsand how they
did understand the art of smiling Every one of them brought his friends
and la belle Madame de Lavretzki soon became known from the Chausse
dAntin to the Rue de Lille In those days this took place in  that
tribe of feuilleton and chronicle writers which now swarm everywhere like
ants in an anthill which has been cut open had not multiplied but even
then a certain Mr Jules presented himself in Varvra Pvlovnas
salon a gentleman of insignificant appearance with a scandalous
reputation insolent and base like all duellists and beaten men This Mr
Jules was extremely repulsive to Varvra Pvlovna but she received him
because he scribbled for various journals and incessantly alluded to her
calling her now Mme de L    tzki now Mme de    cette
grande dame Russe si distingue qui demeure rue de P narrating to all
the world that is to say to a few hundred subscribers who cared nothing
whatever about Mme de L    tzki how that pretty and charming
lady was a real Frenchwoman in mind une vraie franaise par
lespritthere is no higher encomium for the Frenchwhat a remarkable
musician she was and how wonderfully she waltzed Varvra Pvlovna in
reality did waltz in such a manner as to draw all hearts after the hem of
her light fluttering gown  in a word he spread her fame throughout
the worldand assuredly that is agreeable say what you will Mlle Mars
had already left the stage and Mlle Rachel had not yet made her
appearance nevertheless Varvra Pvlovna diligently frequented the
theatres She went into ecstasies over Italian music and laughed at the
ruins of Odra yawned decorously at the Comdie Franaise and wept at
the acting of Mme Dorval in some ultraromantic melodrama or other but
chief of all Liszt played a couple of times at her house and was so nice
so simpleit was delightful In such pleasant sensations passed a winter
at the end of which Varvra Pvlovna was even presented at Court Fedor
Ivnitch on his side was not bored although life at times weighed
heavily on his shouldersheavily because it was empty He read the
newspapers he listened to lectures at the Sorbonne and the Collge de
France he kept track of the debates in parliament he undertook the
translation of a wellknown scientific work on irrigation I am not
wasting timehe said to himselfall this is useful but next winter I
must without fail return to Russia and set to work It is difficult to
say whether he was clearly conscious in what that work consisted and God
knows whether he would have succeeded in returning to Russia for the
winterin the meantime he went with his wife to BadenBaden An
unexpected event destroyed all his plans




                                   XVI


One day on entering Varvra Pvlovnas boudoir in her absence
Lavrtzky beheld on the floor a tiny carefullyfolded scrap of paper
He mechanically picked it up mechanically unfolded it and read the
following written in French

    Dear angel Betsy I cannot possibly bring myself
    to call thee Barbe or Varvra I waited in vain for
    thee at the corner of the Boulevard come tomorrow
    at halfpast one to our little apartment Thy good
    fatty ton gros bonhomme de mari generally buries
    himself in his books at that hour again we will sing
    the song of your poet Puskin de votre pote Pouskine
    which thou hast taught me Old husband menacing
    husbandA thousand kisses on thy hands and
    feet I await thee
                                                  Ernest

Lavrtzky did not on the instant understand what sort of thing it was
he had read he perused it a second timeand his head reeled the floor
swayed beneath his feet like the deck of a steamer when it is
pitchinghe cried out and sobbed and wept simultaneously

He lost his senses He had so blindly trusted his wife that the
possibility of deception of treachery had never presented itself to his
mind That Ernest that lover of his wifes was a fairhaired
goodlooking boy of three and twenty with a small snub nose and thin
moustache almost the most insignificant of all her admirers Several
minutes passed half an hour passed Lavrtzky still stood crushing the
fatal missive in his hand and staring senselessly at the floor through a
sort of dark whirlwind visions of pale faces flitted before him his
heart sank within him in anguish it seemed to him that he was falling
falling falling  and that there was no end to it The light familiar
rustle of a silken robe aroused him from his state of stupefaction
Varvra Pvlovna in bonnet and shawl had hastily returned from her
stroll Lavrtzky trembled all over and rushed out of the room he felt
that at that moment he was capable of tearing her to pieces of beating
her until she was half dead in peasant fashion of strangling her with
his hands The astonished Varvra Pvlovna tried to stop him he could
only whisper Betsyand fled from the house

Lavrtzky took a carriage and ordered the man to drive him out of town
The entire remainder of the day and the whole night long until the
morning he roamed about incessantly halting and wringing his hands now
he raged again it seemed rather ridiculous to him even rather amusing
In the morning he was chilled through and entered a wretched suburban
inn asked for a room and seated himself on a chair by the window A
convulsive yawning seized hold upon him He could hardly stand on his
feet his body was exhaustedbut he was conscious of no fatigueyet
fatigue claimed its rights he sat and stared and understood nothing he
did not understand what had happened to him why he found himself alone
with benumbed limbs with a bitterness in his mouth with a stone on his
breast in a bare strange room he did not understand what had made her
Vrya give herself to that Frenchman and how she had been able
knowing herself to be unfaithful to be as calm amiable and confiding
toward him as before I understand nothing whispered his parched lips
Who will guarantee me now that in Petersburg And he did not finish
the question and yawned again quivering and writhing all over The
bright and the dark memories tormented him equally it suddenly occurred
to him that a few days previously in his presence and in that of
Ernest she had seated herself at the piano and had sung Old husband
menacing husband He recalled the expression of her face the strange
glitter of her eyes and the flush on her cheeksand he rose from his
chair he wanted to go and to say to them You have made a mistake in
trifling with me my greatgrandfather used to hang the peasants up by
the ribs and my grandfather himself was a peasantand kill them both
Then all of a sudden it seemed to him that everything which was taking
place with him was a dream and not even a dream but merely some
nonsense or other that all he had to do was to shake himself to look
about him He did look about him and as the hawk buries his claws in
the bird he has captured anguish pierced more and more deeply into his
heart To crown all Lavrtzky was hoping at the end of a few months to
become a father The past the future his whole life was poisoned He
returned at last to Paris put up at a hotel and sent Varvra
Pvlovna the note of Mr Ernest with the following letter

  The accompanying document will explain everything to you I will
  say to you by the way that I did not recognise you you always
  such a precise person to drop such an important paper This
  phrase poor Lavrtzky had prepared and cherished for the space of
  several hours I can see you no more I assume that you also
  cannot wish to meet me I have assigned fifteen thousand francs a
  year to you I cannot give more Send your address to the office of
  the estate Do what you will live where you please I wish you
  happiness No answer is necessary

Lavrtzky wrote to his wife that no answer was necessary  but he
waited he thirsted for an answer an explanation of this incomprehensible
this incredible affair Varvra Pvlovna that very day sent him a long
letter in French It made an end of him his last doubts vanishedand he
felt ashamed that he had still cherished doubts Varvra Pvlovna did not
defend herself she merely wished to see him she entreated him not to
condemn her irrevocably The letter was cold and constrained although the
traces of tears were visible here and there Lavrtzky uttered a bitter
laugh and bade the messenger say that it was all very good Three days
later he had quitted Paris but he went not to Russia but to Italy He
himself did not know why he had chosen Italy in particular in reality it
made no difference to him whither he wentprovided it were not home He
sent instructions to his peasantsteward in regard to his wifes pension
ordered him at the same time to take all matters pertaining to the estate
instantly out of the hands of General Korbyn without awaiting the
surrender of the accounts and to make arrangements for the departure of
His Excellency from Lavrki he formed a vivid picture to himself of the
consternation the fruitless haughtiness of the ejected General and with
all his grief he felt a certain malicious satisfaction Then he invited
Glafra Petrvna in a letter also to return to Lavrki and sent her a
power of attorney Glafra Petrvna did not return to Lavrki and
herself published in the newspapers that she had destroyed the power of
attorney which was quite superfluous Hiding himself in a small Italian
town it was a long time still before Lavrtzky could force himself not to
watch his wife He learned from the newspapers that she had quitted Paris
as it was supposed for BadenBaden her name soon made its appearance in
an article written by that same Msieu Jules In this article a sort of
friendly condolence pierced through the customary playfulness Fedor
Ivnitchs soul was in a very ugly state when he read that article Later
on he learned that a daughter had been born to him at the end of a couple
of months he was informed by his peasantsteward that Varvra Pvlovna
had demanded the first third of her allowance Then more and more evil
reports began to arrive at last a tragicomic tale made the
roundscreating a sensationof the newspapers wherein his wife played an
unenviable part All was at an end Varvra Pvlovna had become a
celebrity

Lavrtzky ceased to follow her career but he was not able speedily to
conquer himself At times he was seized with such a longing for his
wife that it seemed to him he would give everythinghe would even if
necessary  forgive herif only he might again hear her caressing
voice again feel her hand in his hand But time went on and not in
vain He was not born to be a martyr his healthy nature asserted its
rights Much became clear to him the very blow which had assailed him
no longer seemed to him unforeseen he understood his wifeone
understands a person who is near to one when parted from him Again he
was able to occupy himself to work although with far less zeal than of
yore scepticism for which the way had been prepared by the experiences
of life by his education definitively took possession of his soul He
became extremely indifferent to everything Four years elapsed and he
felt himself strong enough to return to his native land to meet his own
people Without halting either in Petersburg or Moscow he arrived in the
town of O    where we took leave of him and whither we now beg the
indulgent reader to return with us




                                  XVII


On the morning following the day which we have described at nine
oclock Lavrtzky ascended the porch of the Kaltin house Liza
emerged to meet him in hat and gloves

Where are you going he asked her

To church Today is Sunday

And do you really care to go to the Liturgy

Liza said nothing but gazed at him in amazement

Pardon me pleasesaid LavrtzkyI  I did not mean to say
that I came to say goodbye to you I am going to my country place an
hour hence

It is not far from here is itinquired Liza

Twentyfive versts

Lynotchka made her appearance on the threshold of the door accompanied
by a maid

See that you do not forget ussaid Liza and descended the steps

And do not you forget me And see herehe addedyou are going to
church pray for me also by the way

Liza paused and turned toward him

Certainlyshe said looking him straight in the faceI will pray
for you Come along Lynotchka

Lavrtzky found Mrya Dmtrievna alone in the drawingroom An odour
of eau de cologne and mint emanated from her She had a headache
according to her own account and she had passed a restless night She
welcomed him with her customary languid amiability and gradually got to
talking

What an agreeable young man Vladmir Nikolitch is she inquiredis
he not

What Vladmir Nikolitch

Why Pnshin you knowthe one who was here yesterday evening He
took an immense liking to you I will tell you as a secret mon cher
cousin he is simply beside himself over my Liza What do you think of
that He comes of a good family he discharges his service splendidly he
is clever well and a Junior Gentleman of the Bedchamber and if it be
Gods will I on my side as a mother shall be very glad It is a
great responsibility of course up to the present time whether it be
for good or evil you see I am always everywhere entirely alone I
have reared my children I have taught them I have done everything 
and now I have ordered a governess from Mme Bolius

Mrya Dmtrievna launched out into a description of her toils her
efforts and her maternal feelings Lavrtzky listened to her in
silence and twirled his hat in his hands His cold heavy gaze
disconcerted the loquacious lady

And how do you like Lizashe asked

Lizavta Mikhalovna is an extremely beautiful girlreplied
Lavrtzky rose bowed and went to Mrfa Timofevna Mrya Dmtrievna
gazed after him with displeasure and said to herself What a dolt what a
peasant Well now I understand why his wife could not remain faithful to
him

Mrfa Timofevna was sitting in her own room surrounded by her suite
It consisted of five beings almost equally near to her heart a
fatjowled trained bullfinch which she loved because he had ceased to
whistle and draw water a tiny very timorous and peaceable dog Rska
an angry cat Matrs Sailor a blackvisaged nimble little girl of
nine with huge eyes and a sharp little nose who was named Schrotchka
and an elderly woman fifty years of age in a white cap and a light
brown bobtailed jacket over a dark gown by name Nastsya Krpovna
Ogrkoff Schrotchka was of the petty burgher class a full orphan
Mrfa Timofevna had taken charge of her out of pity as she had of
Rska she had picked up both the dog and the girl in the street both
were thin and hungry both were being drenched by the autumnal rain no
one had hunted up Rska and Schrotchkas uncle a drunken shoemaker
who had not enough to eat himself and who did not feed his niece though
he beat her over the head with his last gladly surrendered her to Mrfa
Timofevna With Nastsya Krpovna Mrfa Timofevna had made
acquaintance on a pilgrimage in a monastery she herself had gone up to
her in church Mrfa Timofevna liked her because to use her own
words she prayed tastily had herself begun the conversation and had
invited her to come to her for a cup of tea From that day forth she had
never parted with her Nastsya Krpovna was a woman of the merriest
and gentlest disposition a childless widow member of a povertystricken
family of the petty nobility she had a round grey head soft white
hands a soft face with large kindly features and a rather ridiculous
snub nose she fairly worshipped Mrfa Timofevna and the latter loved
her greatly although she jeered at her tender heart Nastsya Krpovna
felt a weakness for all young people and involuntarily blushed like a
girl at the most innocent jest Her entire capital consisted of twelve
hundred paper rubles she lived at the expense of Mrfa Timofevna but
on equal terms with her Mrfa Timofevna would not have tolerated
servility

Ah Fdya she began as soon as she caught sight of himlast
night thou didst not see my family admire it We are all assembled for
tea this is our second feastday tea Thou mayest pet all only
Schrotchka will not allow thee and the cat scratches Art thou going
away today

YesLavrtzky seated himself on a narrow little chairI have
already said farewell to Mrya Dmtrievna I have also seen Lizavta
Mikhalovna

Call her Liza my fatherwhy should she be Mikhalovna to thee And
sit still or thou wilt break Schrotchkas chair

She has gone to churchpursued Lavrtzky Is she pious

Yes Fdyavery More than thou and I Fdya

But are not you piousremarked Nastsya Krpovna in a whisper
And today you did not get to the early Liturgy but you will go to the
later one

Not a bit of itthou wilt go alone I am lazy my motherretorted
Mrfa TimofevnaI am pampering myself greatly with my teaShe
called Nastsya thou although she lived on equal terms with hershe
was not a Pstoff for nothing three Pstoffs are recorded with
distinction in the Book of Remembrance of Ivn Vaslievitch the
Terrible Mrfa Timofevna knew it

Tell me pleasebegan Lavrtzky againMrya Dmtrievna has just
been talking about that  whats his name  Pnshin What sort of a
person is he

What a chatterbox the Lord forgive hergrumbled Mrfa
TimofevnaI suppose she imparted to you as a secret what a fine
suitor has turned up She might do her whispering with her priests son
but no that is not enough for her But theres nothing in it as yet
and thank God for that but shes babbling already

Why thank Godasked Lavrtzky

Why because the young fellow does not please me and what is there to
rejoice about

He does not please you

Yes he cannot fascinate everybody Its enough that Nastsya Krpovna
here should be in love with him

The poor widow was thoroughly startled

What makes you say that Mrfa Timofevna You do not fear Godshe
exclaimed and a blush instantly suffused her face and neck

And he certainly knows the rogueMrfa Timofevna interrupted
herhe knows how to captivate her he presented her with a snuffbox
Fdya ask her to give thee a pinch of snuff thou wilt see what a
splendid snuffbox it is on the lid is depicted a hussar on horseback
Thou hadst better not defend thyself my mother

Nastsya Krpovna merely repelled the suggestion with a wave of her
hands

Wellinquired Lavrtzkyand is Liza not indifferent to him

Apparently she likes himhowever the Lord only knows Another mans
soul thou knowest is a dark forest much more the soul of a young girl
Now theres Schrotchkas soultry to dissect that Why has she been
hiding herself and yet does not go away ever since thou camest

Schrotchka snorted with suppressed laughter and ran out of the room
and Lavrtzky rose from his seat

Yeshe said slowlya maidens soul is not to be divined

He began to take leave

Well Shall we see thee again soonasked Mrfa Timofevna

Thats as it may happen aunty it is not far off

Yes but thou art going to Vaslievskoe Thou wilt not live at
Lavrkiwell that is thy affair only go and salute the tomb of thy
mother and the tomb of thy grandmother too by the bye Thou hast
acquired all sorts of learning yonder abroad and who knows perchance
they will feel it in their graves that thou hast come to them And dont
forget Fdya to have a requiem service celebrated for Glafra
Petrvna also heres a silver ruble for thee Take it take it I want
to pay for having a requiem service for her During her lifetime I did
not like her but theres no denying it the woman had plenty of
character She was a clever creature and she did not wrong thee either
And now go with Gods blessing or thou wilt grow weary of me

And Mrfa Timofevna embraced her nephew

And Liza shall not marry Pnshindont worry about that thats not
the sort of husband she deserves

Why I am not worrying in the least replied Lavrtzky and withdrew



   Ivan the Terrible left a long record of his distinguished victims
      for the repose of whose souls he ordered prayers to be said in
      perpetuity Book of Remembrance contains the names of persons who
      are to be prayed for at the general requiem services and so forth

                                  XVIII


Four hours later he was driving homeward His tarants rolled swiftly
along the soft country road There had been a drought for a fortnight a
thin milky cloud was diffused through the air and veiled the distant
forests it reeked with the odour of burning A multitude of small dark
cloudlets with indistinctly delineated edges were creeping across the
paleblue sky a fairly strong wind was whisking along in a dry
uninterrupted stream without dispelling the sultriness Leaning his head
against a cushion and folding his arms on his breast Lavrtzky gazed
at the strips of ploughed land in fanshape which flew past at the
willowtrees slowly flitting by at the stupid crows and daws gazing with
dull suspicion askance at the passing equipage at the long strips of
turf between the cultivated sections overgrown with artemisia wormwood
and wild tansy he gazed  and that fresh fertile nakedness and
wildness of the steppe that verdure those long hillocks the ravines
with stubby oak bushes the grey hamlets the flexible birchtreesthis
whole Russian picture which he had not seen for a long time wafted into
his soul sweet and at the same time painful sensations weighed on his
breast with a certain agreeable oppression His thoughts slowly roved
about their outlines were as indistinct and confused as the outlines of
those lofty cloudlets which also seemed to be roving He recalled his
childhood his mother he remembered how she died how they had carried
him to her and how she pressing his head to her bosom had begun to
sing feebly over him but had cast a glance at Glafra Petrvnaand
had relapsed into silence He recalled his father at first alert
dissatisfied with every one and with a brazen voicethen blind
tearful and with a dirty grey beard he recalled how one day at table
after drinking an extra glass of wine and spilling the sauce over his
napkin he had suddenly burst out laughing and had begun winking his
sightless eyes and flushing crimson to tell stories of his conquests he
recalled Varvra Pvlovnaand involuntarily screwed up his eyes as a
man does from momentary inward pain and shook his head Then his
thoughts came to a pause on Liza

Here he thought is a new being who is only just entering upon life
A splendid young girl what will become of her She is comely A pale
fresh face such serious eyes and lips and an honest and innocent gaze
It is a pity that she seems to be somewhat enthusiastic A splendid
figure and she walks so lightly and her voice is soft I greatly like
to see her pause suddenly listen attentively without a smile and then
meditate and toss back her hair Really it strikes me that Pnshin is
not worthy of her But what is there wrong about him She will traverse
the road which all traverse I had better take a nap And Lavrtzky
closed his eyes

He could not get to sleep but plunged into the dreamy stupor of the
road Images of the past as before arose in leisurely fashion floated
through his soul mingling and entangling themselves with other scenes
Lavrtzky God knows why began to think about Robert Peel  about
French history  about how he would win a battle if he were a general
he thought he heard shots and shrieks His head sank to one side he
opened his eyes The same fields the same views of the steppe the
polished shoes of the tracehorse flashed in turn through the billowing
dust the shirt of the postilion yellow with red gussets at the
armpits puffed out in the wind A pretty way to return to my native
landflashed through Lavrtzkys head and he shouted Faster
wrapped himself up in his cloak and leaned back harder against his
pillow The tarants gave a jolt Lavrtzky sat upright and opened his
eyes wide Before him on a hillock a tiny hamlet lay outspread a
little to the right a small ancient manorhouse was to be seen with
closed shutters and a crooked porch all over the spacious yard from the
very gates grew nettles green and thick as hemp there also stood a
small oaken storehouse still sound This was Vaslievskoe

The postilion turned up to the gate and brought the horses to a
standstill Lavrtzkys footman rose on the box and as though
preparing to spring down shouted Hey A hoarse dull barking rang
out but not even the dog showed himself the lackey again prepared to
leap down and again shouted Hey The decrepit barking was renewed
and a moment later a man ran out into the yard no one could tell
whencea man in a nankeen kaftan with a head as white as snow
shielding his eyes with his hand he stared at the tarants suddenly
slapped himself on both thighs at first danced about a little on one
spot then ran to open the gate The tarants drove into the yard the
wheels rustling against the nettles and halted in front of the porch
The whiteheaded man very nimble to all appearances was already
standing with his feet planted very wide apart and very crooked on the
last step and having unbuttoned the apron convulsively held up the
leather and aided the master to descend to the earth and then kissed his
hand

Goodday goodday brothersaid LavrtzkyI think thy name is
Antn Thou art still alive

The old man bowed in silence and ran to fetch the keys While he was
gone the postilion sat motionless bending sideways and gazing at the
locked door but Lavrtzkys lackey remained standing as he had sprung
down in a picturesque pose with one hand resting on the box The old
man brought the keys and quite unnecessarily writhing like a serpent
raising his elbows on high he unlocked the door stepped aside and
again bowed to his girdle

Here I am at home here I have got backsaid Lavrtzky to himself
as he entered the tiny anteroom while the shutters were opened one
after the other with a bang and a squeak and the daylight penetrated
into the deserted rooms




                                   XIX


The tiny house where Lavrtzky had arrived and where two years
previously Glafra Petrvna had breathed her last had been built in
the previous century out of sturdy pine lumber in appearance it was
decrepit but was capable of standing another fifty years or more
Lavrtzky made the round of all the rooms and to the great
discomfiture of the aged languid flies with white dust on their backs
who were sitting motionless under the lintels of the doors he ordered
all the windows to be opened no one had opened them since the death of
Glafra Petrvna Everything in the house remained as it had been the
small spindlelegged couches in the drawingroom covered with glossy
grey material worn through and flattened down vividly recalled the days
of Katherine II in the drawingroom also stood the mistresss
favourite chair with a tall straight back against which even in her
old age she had not leaned On the principal wall hung an ancient
portrait of Fedors greatgrandfather Andri Lavrtzky the dark
sallow face was barely discernible against the warped and blackened
background the small vicious eyes gazed surlily from beneath pendent
swollen lids the black hair devoid of powder rose in a brush over the
heavy deeplyseamed brow On the corner of the portrait hung a wreath of
dusty immortelles Glafra Petrvna herself was pleased to weave it
announced Antn In the bedchamber rose a narrow bed under a tester of
ancient striped material of very excellent quality a mountain of faded
pillows and a thin quilted coverlet lay on the bed and by the head of
the bed hung an image of the Presentation in the Temple of the AllHoly
Birthgiver of God the very same image to which the old spinster as she
lay dying alone and forgotten by every one had pressed for the last
time her lips which were already growing cold The toilettable of
inlaid wood with brass trimmings and a crooked mirror with tarnished
gilding stood by the window Alongside the bedroom was the room for the
holy pictures a tiny chamber with bare walls and a heavy shrine of
images in the corner on the floor lay a small threadbare rug spotted
with wax Glafra Petrvna had been wont to make her prostrations upon
it Antn went off with Lavrtzkys lackey to open the stable and
carriagehouse in his stead there presented herself an old woman
almost of the same age as he with a kerchief bound round her head down
to her very brows her head trembled and her eyes gazed dully but
expressed zeal and a longestablished habit of serving with assiduity
and at the same time a certain respectful commiseration She kissed
Lavrtzkys hand and paused at the door in anticipation of orders He
positively was unable to recall her name he could not even remember
whether he had ever seen her It turned out that her name was Apraxyya
forty years before that same Glafra Petrvna had banished her from
the manorhouse service and had ordered her to attend to the fowls
however she said littleas though she had outlived her mindand only
looked on cringingly In addition to these two old people and three
potbellied brats in long shirts Antns greatgrandchildren there
dwelt in the servicerooms of the manor a onearmed little old peasant
who was exempt from compulsory service he made a drumming noise like a
woodcock when he spoke and was not capable of doing anything Not much
more useful than he was the decrepit dog who had welcomed Lavrtzkys
homecoming with his bark it had already been fastened up for ten years
with a heavy chain bought by order of Glafra Petrvna and was barely
in a condition to move and drag its burden After inspecting the house
Lavrtzky went out into the park and was satisfied with it It was all
overgrown with tall grass burdock and gooseberry and raspberry bushes
but there was much shade in it there were many old lindentrees which
surprised the beholder by their huge size and the strange arrangement of
their branches they had been too closely planted and at some time or
othera hundred years beforehad been pollarded The park ended in a
small clear pond with a rim of tall reddish reeds The traces of human
life fade away very quickly Glafra Petrvnas farm had not succeeded
in running wild but it already seemed plunged in that tranquil dream
wherewith everything on earth doth dream where the restless infection of
people does not exist Fedor Ivnitch also strolled through the
village the women stared at him from the thresholds of their cottages
each with her cheek propped on one hand the peasant men saluted him from
afar the children ran away the dogs barked indifferently At last he
felt hungry but he did not expect his servants and cook until toward
evening the cart with provisions from Lavrki had not yet arrivedhe
was compelled to appeal to Antn Antn immediately arranged matters
he caught an old hen cut its throat and plucked it Apraxyya rubbed
and scrubbed it for a long time and washed it like linen before she
placed it in the stewpan when at last it was cooked Antn put on
the tablecloth and set the table placed in front of the plate a
blackened saltcellar of plated ware on three feet and a small faceted
carafe with a round glass stopper and a narrow neck then he announced to
Lavrtzky in a chanting voice that the meal was readyand took up
his post behind his chair having wound a napkin around his right fist
and disseminating some strong ancient odour which resembled the odour
of cypress wood Lavrtzky tasted the soup and came upon the hen its
skin was all covered with big pimples a thick tendon ran down each leg
its flesh had a flavour of charcoal and lye When he had finished his
dinner Lavrtzky said that he would like some tea if This very
moment sir I will serve it sirinterrupted the old manand he
kept his promise A pinch of tea was hunted up wrapped in a scrap of red
paper a small but very mettlesome and noisy samovr was searched out
also sugar in very tiny bits that seemed to have been melted around the
edges Lavrtzky drank his tea out of a large cup he remembered that
cup in his childhood playingcards were depicted on it only visitors
drank out of itand he now drank out of it like a visitor Toward
evening his servants arrived Lavrtzky did not wish to sleep in his
aunts bed he gave orders that a bed should be made up for him in the
diningroom Extinguishing the candle he stared about him for a long
time and meditated on cheerless thoughts he experienced the sensation
familiar to every man who chances to pass the night for the first time
in a place which has long been uninhabited it seemed to him that the
darkness which surrounded him on all sides could not accustom itself to
the new inhabitant that the very walls of the house were waxing
indignant At last he sighed drew the coverlet up over him and fell
asleep Antn remained afoot longer than the rest for a long time he
whispered with Apraxyya groaned in a low tone and crossed himself a
couple of times Neither of them expected that the master would settle
down among them at Vaslievskoe when near at hand he owned such a
magnificent estate with a capitallyorganised manorhouse they did not
even suspect that it was precisely that manorhouse which was repugnant
to Lavrtzky it evoked in him oppressive memories After having
whispered his fill Antn took his staff and beat upon the board at the
storehouse which had long been hanging silent and immediately lay
down for a nap in the yard without covering up his grey head with
anything The May night was tranquil and caressingand the old man
slumbered sweetly



   It is the duty of the nightwatchman to beat upon the board at
      regular intervals to show that he is vigilantTranslator




                                   XX


The next morning Lavrtzky rose quite early had a talk with the
overseer visited the threshingfloor ordered the chain to be removed
from the watchdog who only barked a little but did not even move away
from his kenneland on his return home sank into a sort of peaceful
torpor from which he did not emerge all day I have sunk down to the
very bottom of the river now he said to himself more than once He sat
by the window made no movement and seemed to be listening to the current
of tranquil life which surrounded him to the infrequent noises of the
country solitudes Yonder somewhere beyond the nettles some one began to
sing in the shrillest of voices a gnat seemed to be chiming in with the
voice Now it ceased but the gnat still squeaked on athwart the
energetic insistentlyplaintive buzzing of the flies resounded the
booming of a fat bumblebee which kept bumping its head against the
ceiling a cock on the road began to crow hoarsely prolonging the last
note a peasant cart rumbled past the gate toward the village creaked
Well suddenly quavered a womans voiceOkh thou my dear little
sweetheart said Antn to a little girl of two years whom he was
dandling in his arms Fetch some kvas repeats the same female
voiceand all at once a deathlike silence ensues nothing makes any
noise nothing stirs the breeze does not flutter a leaf the swallows
dart along near the ground one after the other without a cry and
sadness descends upon the soul from their silent flightHere I am sunk
down to the bottom of the river Lavrtzky says to himself againAnd
life is at all times tranquil leisurely here he thinkswhoever
enters its circle must become submissive here there is nothing to agitate
ones self about nothing to disturb here success awaits only him who
lays out his path without haste as the husbandman lays the furrow with
his plough And what strength there is all around what health there is
in this inactive calm Yonder now under the window a sturdy burdock is
making its way out from among the thick grass above it the lovage is
stretching forth its succulent stalk the Virginstears toss still
higher their rosy tendrils and yonder further away in the fields the
rye is gleaming and the oats are beginning to shoot up their stalks and
every leaf on every tree every blade of grass on its stalk spreads
itself out to its fullest extent My best years have been spent on the
love of a woman Lavrtzky pursued his meditationsmay the
irksomeness here sober me may it soothe me prepare me so that I may
understand how to do my work without haste and again he began to lend an
ear to the silence expecting nothingand at the same time as it were
incessantly expecting something the silence enfolds him on all sides the
sun glides quietly across the calm blue sky a cloud floats gently in its
wake it seems as though they know whither and why they are floating At
that same moment in other spots on earth life was seething bustling
roaring here the same life was flowing on inaudibly like water amid
marshgrass and until the very evening Lavrtzky could not tear himself
from the contemplation of that life fleeting flowing onward grief for
the past melted in his soul like snows of springtimeand strange to
saynever had the feeling of his native land been so deep and strong
within him



   This plant bears round seedpods of mottledgrey which are often
      used to make very pretty rosariesTranslator




                                   XXI


In the course of a fortnight Fedor Ivnitch brought Glafra
Petrvnas little house into order cleaned up the yard the garden
comfortable furniture was brought to him from Lavrki wine books
newspapers from the town horses made their appearance in the stables in
a word Fedor Ivnitch provided himself with everything that was
necessary and began to livenot exactly like a country squire nor yet
exactly like a recluse His days passed monotonously but he was not
bored although he saw no one he occupied himself diligently and
attentively with the farming operations he rode about the neighbourhood
on horseback he read He read but little however it was more agreeable
for him to listen to the tales of old Antn As a rule Lavrtzky would
seat himself with a pipe of tobacco and a cup of cold tea near the
window Antn would stand near the door with his hands clasped behind
him and begin his leisurely stories of olden timesof those fabulous
timeswhen the oats and barley were sold not by measures but by huge
sacks at two or three kopks the sack when in all directions even
close to the town stretched impenetrable forests untouched steppes
And now wailed the old man who was already over eighty years of
agethey have felled and ploughed up everything until there is no
place to drive through Antn also related many things concerning his
mistress Glafra Petrvna how sagacious and economical she had been
how a certain gentleman a youthful neighbour had attempted to gain her
goodwill had taken to calling frequentlyand how she had been
pleased for his benefit even to don her cap with rosepurple ribbons
and her yellow gown of trutru levantine but how later on having flown
into a rage with her neighbour on account of the unseemly question
What might your capital amount to madam she had given orders that he
should not be admitted and how she had then commanded that everything
down to the very smallest scrap should be given to Fedor Ivnitch
after her death And in fact Lavrtzky found all his aunts effects
intact not excepting the festival cap with the rosepurple ribbons and
the gown of yellow trutru levantine The ancient papers and curious
documents which Lavrtzky had counted upon proved not to exist with
the exception of one tattered little old book in which his grandfather
Pitr Andritch had jotted down nowCelebration in the city of
Saint Petersburg of the peace concluded with the Turkish Empire by his
Illustriousness Prince Alexnder Alexndrovitch Prozorvsky now a
recipe for a decoction for the chest with the comment This instruction
was given to Generaless Praskvya Fedorovna Saltykff by Fedor
Avksntievitch Archpriest of the Church of the Lifegiving Trinity
again some item of political news like the following In the Moscow
News it is announced that PremierMajor Mikhal Petrvitch
Koltcheff has died Was not he the son of Pitr Vaslievitch
Koltcheff Lavrtzky also found several ancient calendars and
dreambooks and the mystical works of Mr Ambdik many memories were
awakened in him by the longforgotten but familiar Symbols and Emblems
In Glafra Petrvnas toilettable Lavrtzky found a small packet
tied with black ribbon and sealed with black wax thrust into the
remotest recesses of the drawer In the packet face to face lay a
pastel portrait of his father in his youth with soft curls tumbling over
his brow with long languid eyes and mouth half openedand the almost
effaced portrait of a pale woman in a white gown with a white rose in
her handhis mother Glafra Petrvna had never permitted her own
portrait to be madeDear little father Fedor IvnitchAntn was
wont to say to Lavrtzkyalthough I did not then have my residence in
the manorhouse of the masters yet I remember your greatgrandfather
Andri Afansievitchthat I do I was eighteen years of age when he
died Once I met him in the gardenmy very hamstrings shook but he did
nothing only inquired my nameand sent me to his chamber for a
pockethandkerchief He was a real gentleman theres no gainsaying
thatand he recognised no superior over him For I must inform you
that your greatgrandfather had a wonderful amuleta monk from Mount
Athos gave him that amulet And that monk said to him I give thee this
for thine affability Boyrin wear itand fear not fate Well and of
course dear little father you know what sort of times those were what
the master took a notion to do that he did Once in a while some one
even one of the gentry would take it into his head to thwart him but no
sooner did he look at him than he would say Youre sailing in shoal
waterthat was his favourite expression And he lived your
greatgrandfather of blessed memory in a tiny wooden mansion but what
property he left behind him what silver and all sorts of suppliesall
the cellars were filled to the brim He was a master That little carafe
which you were pleased to praisebelonged to him he drank vdka from
it And then your grandfather Pitr Ivnitch built himself a stone
mansion but he acquired no property with him everything went at sixes
and sevens and he lived worse than his papa and got no pleasure for
himselfbut wasted all the money and there was none to pay for
requiems for his soul he left not even a silver spoon behind him so it
was lucky that Glafra Petrvna brought things into order

And is it trueLavrtzky interrupted himthat she was called an
illtempered old hag

Why surely some did call her thatreturned Antn in displeasure

                                                

WELL little fatherthe old man one day summoned the courage to
askand how about our young mistress where is she pleased to have her
residence

I have separated from my wifesaid Lavrtzky with an effortplease
do not inquire about her

I obey sirreplied the old man sadly

After the lapse of three weeks Lavrtzky rode into O    on
horseback to the Kaltins and passed the evening with them Lemm was
there Lavrtzky conceived a great liking for him Although thanks to
his father he did not play on any instrument yet he was passionately
fond of musicintelligent classical music Pnshin was not at the
Kaltins that evening The Governor had sent him off somewhere out of
town Liza played alone and with great precision Lemm grew animated
excited rolled a piece of paper into a baton and beat time Mrya
Dmtrievna laughed at first as she watched him and then went off to
bed as she said Beethoven was too agitating for her nerves At
midnight Lavrtzky escorted Lemm to his lodgings and sat with him
until three oclock in the morning Lemm talked a great deal his bent
shoulders straightened up his eyes opened widely and sparkled his very
hair stood upright above his brow It was such a very long time since any
one had taken an interest in him but Lavrtzky evidently did take an
interest and interrogated him solicitously and attentively This touched
the old man he ended by showing his visitor his music he even played
and sang to him with his ghost of a voice several selections from his
compositionsamong others the whole of Schillers ballad Fridolin
which he had set to music Lavrtzky lauded it made him repeat portions
of it and invited him to visit him for a few days Lemm who was
escorting him to the street immediately accepted and shook his hand
warmly but when he was left alone in the cool damp air of the day
which was just beginning to dawn he glanced around him screwed up his
eyes writhed and went softly to his tiny chamber like a guilty
creature Ich bin wohl nicht klug Im not in my right mindhe
muttered as he lay down on his hard short bed He tried to assert that
he was ill when a few days later Lavrtzky came for him in a calash
but Fedor Ivnitch went to him in his room and persuaded him The
circumstance which operated most powerfully of all on Lemm was that
Lavrtzky had ordered a piano to be sent to his countryhouse from the
town a piano for hisLemmsuse Together they went to the Kaltins
and spent the evening but not so agreeably as on the former occasion
Pnshin was there had a great deal to narrate about his journey and
very amusingly mimicked and illustrated in action the country squires he
had seen Lavrtzky laughed but Lemm did not emerge from his corner
maintained silence quietly quivered all over like a spider looked glum
and dull and grew animated only when Lavrtzky began to take his leave
Even when he was seated in the calash the old man continued to be shy
and to fidget but the quiet warm air the light breeze the delicate
shadows the perfume of the grass of the birch buds the peaceful gleam
of the starry moonless heaven the energetic hoofbeats and snorting of
the horses all the charms of the road of spring of nightdescended
into the heart of the poor German and he himself was the first to
address Lavrtzky




                                  XXII


He began to talk of music of Liza then again of music He seemed
somehow to utter his words more slowly when he spoke of Liza Lavrtzky
turned the conversation on his compositions and half in jest proposed
to write a libretto for him

Hm a librettorejoined Lemmno that is beyond me I have not
that animation that play of fancy which is indispensable for an opera
I have already lost my powers But if I could still do somethingI
would be satisfied with a romance of course I should like some good
words

He relapsed into silence and sat for a long time motionless with his
eyes raised heavenward

For example he said at lastsomething of this sort Ye stars O ye
pure stars

Lavrtzky turned his face slightly toward him and began to stare at him

Ye stars ye pure starsrepeated Lemm Ye gaze alike upon the
just and upon the guilty  but only the innocent of heartor
something of that sort  understand you that is to say nolove
you However I am not a poet  how should I be But something in that
style something lofty

Lemm pushed his hat back on the nape of his neck in the delicate gloom
of the light night his face seemed whiter and more youthful

And ye alsohe went on with a voice which gradually grew
quieterye know who loves who knows how to love for ye are pure
ye alone can comfort No thats not right yet I am not a
poethe saidbut something of that sort

I regret that I am not a poetremarked Lavrtzky

Empty visions retorted Lemm and huddled in the corner of the calash
He closed his eyes as though preparing to go to sleep

Several moments elapsed Lavrtzky listened Stars pure stars
lovethe old man was whispering

LoveLavrtzky repeated to himself became thoughtful and his soul
grew heavy within him

You have written some very beautiful music for Fridolin Christofr
Fedoritchhe said aloudand what think you did that Fridolin
after the Count had led him to his wife become her loverhey

That is what you thinkreturned Lemm because probably
experience He suddenly fell silent and turned away in confusion
Lavrtzky laughed in a constrained way turned away also and began to
stare along the road

The stars had already begun to pale and the sky was grey when the
calash rolled up to the porch of the little house at Vaslievskoe
Lavrtzky conducted his guest to the chamber which had been assigned to
him returned to his study and sat down by the window In the park a
nightingale was singing its last lay before the dawn Lavrtzky
remembered that a nightingale had been singing in the Kaltins garden
also he recalled too the tranquil movement of Lizas eyes when at the
first sounds of it they had turned toward the dark window He began to
think of her and his heart grew calm within him Pure little starhe
said to himself in a low tonepure starshe added with a smile
and calmly lay down to sleep

But Lemm sat for a long time on his bed with a book of musicpaper on
his knees It seemed as though a strange sweet melody were about to
visit him he was already burning and growing agitated he already felt
the lassitude and sweetness of its approach  but it did not come

I am not a poet and not a musicianhe whispered at last

And his weary head sank back heavily on the pillow




                                  XXIII


On the following morning host and guest drank tea in the garden under
an ancient lindentree

Maestrosaid Lavrtzky among other thingsyou will soon have to
compose a triumphal cantata

On what occasion

On the occasion of the marriage of Mr Pnshin to Liza Did you notice
how he was paying court to her last evening It seems as though
everything were going smoothly with them

That shall not be exclaimed Lemm

Why not

Because it is impossible Howeverhe added after a pauseeverything
is possible in this world Especially here with you in Russia

Let us leave Russia out of the question for the present but what evil
do you see in that marriage

All is evil all Lizavta Mikhalovna is an upright serious maiden
with exalted sentimentsbut he  he is a dilettante in one word

But surely she loves him

Lemm rose from the bench

No she does not love him that is to say she is very pure in heart
and does not know herself what love means Madam von Kaltin tells
her that he is a nice young man and she listens to Madam von Kaltin
because she is still a perfect child although she is nineteen years of
age she says her prayers in the morning she says her prayers in the
eveningand that is very praiseworthy but she does not love him She
can love only the fine but he is not fine that is his soul is not
fine

Lemm uttered this whole speech coherently and with fervour pacing back
and forth with short strides in front of the teatable and with his
eyes flitting over the ground

My dearest Maestroexclaimed Lavrtzky all at onceit strikes me
that you are in love with my cousin yourself

Lemm came to a sudden halt

Pleasehe began in an uncertain voicedo not jest thus with me I
am not a lunatic

Lavrtzky felt sorry for the old man he entreated his forgiveness
After tea Lemm played him his cantata and at dinner being instigated
thereto by Lavrtzky himself he again began to talk about Liza
Lavrtzky listened to him with attention and curiosity

What think you Christofr Fedoritchhe said at lasteverything
appears to be in order with us now the garden is in full bloom Shall
not we invite her here for the day together with her mother and my old
aunthey Would that be agreeable to you

Lemm bent his head over his plate

Invite herhe said almost inaudibly

And Pnshin need not be asked

He need notreplied the old man with a halfchildlike smile

Two days later Fedor Ivnitch set out for the town to the Kaltins




                                  XXIV


He found them all at home but he did not immediately announce to them
his intention he wished first to have a talk alone with Liza Chance
aided him they were left alone together in the drawingroom They fell
into conversation she had succeeded in getting used to himand in
general she was not shy of any one He listened to her looked her
straight in the face and mentally repeated Lemms words and agreed with
him It sometimes happens that two persons who are already acquainted
but not intimate suddenly and swiftly draw near to each other in the
course of a few minutesand the consciousness of this approach is
immediately reflected in their glances in their friendly quiet smiles
in their very movements Precisely this is what took place with
Lavrtzky and Liza So thats what he is like she thought gazing
caressingly at him so thats what thou art like he said to himself
also And therefore he was not greatly surprised when she not without a
slight hesitation however announced to him that she had long had it in
her heart to say something to him but had been afraid of annoying him

Have no fear speak outhe said and halted in front of her

Liza raised her clear eyes to his

You are so kindshe began and at the same time she said to
herselfyes he really is kind  you will pardon me but I ought
not to speak of this to you  but how could you  why did you
separate from your wife

Lavrtzky shuddered glanced at Liza and seated himself beside her

My child he beganplease do not touch that wound your hands are
tender but nevertheless I shall suffer pain

I knowwent on Liza as though she had not heard himshe is
culpable toward you I do not wish to defend her but how is it possible
to put asunder that which God has joined together

Our convictions on that point are too dissimilar Lizavta
Mikhalovnasaid Lavrtzky rather sharplywe shall not
understand each other

Liza turned pale her whole body quivered slightly but she did not hold
her peace

You ought to forgiveshe said softlyif you wish to be forgiven

ForgiveLavrtzky caught her upOught not you first to know for
whom you are pleading Forgive that woman take her back into my
househerthat empty heartless creature And who has told you that
she wishes to return to me Good heavens she is entirely satisfied with
her position But what is the use of talking about it Her name ought
not to be uttered by you You are too pure you are not even in a
position to understand what sort of a being she is

Why vilify hersaid Liza with an effort The trembling of her hands
became visible It was you yourself who abandoned her Fedor
Ivnitch

But I tell youretorted Lavrtzky with an involuntary outburst of
impatiencethat you do not know what sort of a creature she is

Then why did you marry herwhispered Liza and dropped her eyes

Lavrtzky sprang up hastily from his seat

Why did I marry I was young and inexperienced then I was deceived I
was carried away by a beautiful exterior I did not know women I did not
know anything God grant that you may make a happier marriage But
believe me it is impossible to vouch for anything

And I may be just as unhappysaid Liza her voice began to break
but in that case I must submit I do not know how to talk but if we
do not submit

Lavrtzky clenched his fists and stamped his foot

Be not angry forgive meejaculated Liza hastily

At that moment Mrya Dmtrievna entered Liza rose and started to
leave the room

StopLavrtzky unexpectedly called after her I have a great favour
to ask of your mother and of you make me a visit to celebrate my new
home You know I have set up a piano Lemm is staying with me the
lilacs are now in bloom you will get a breath of the country air and
can return the same daydo you accept

Liza glanced at her mother and Mrya Dmtrievna assumed an air of
suffering but Lavrtzky without giving her a chance to open her mouth
instantly kissed both her hands Mrya Dmtrievna who was always
susceptible to endearments and had not expected such amiability from
the dolt was touched to the soul and consented While she was
considering what day to appoint Lavrtzky approached Liza and still
greatly agitated furtively whispered to her Thank you you are a good
girl I am to blame And her pale face flushed crimson with a
cheerfulbashful smile her eyes also smiledup to that moment she
had been afraid that she had offended him

May Vladmir Nikolitch go with usasked Mrya Dmtrievna

Certainlyresponded Lavrtzkybut would it not be better if we
confined ourselves to our own family circle

Yes certainly but you see Mrya Dmtrievna began However as
you like she added

It was decided to take Lynotchka and Schrotchka Mrfa Timofevna
declined to make the journey

It is too hard for me my dearshe saidmy old bones ache and I
am sure there is no place at your house where I can spend the night and
I cannot sleep in a strange bed Let these young people do the
gallivanting

Lavrtzky did not succeed in being alone again with Liza but he looked
at her in such a way that she felt at ease and rather ashamed and
sorry for him On taking leave of her he pressed her hand warmly when
she was left alone she fell into thought




                                   XXV


When Lavrtzky reached home he was met on the threshold of the
drawingroom by a tall thin man in a threadbare blue coat with frowzy
grey sidewhiskers a long straight nose and small inflamed eyes This
was Mikhalvitch his former comrade at the university Lavrtzky did
not recognise him at first but embraced him warmly as soon as he
mentioned his name They had not seen each other since the Moscow days
There was a shower of exclamations of questions longsmothered memories
came forth into the light of day Hurriedly smoking pipe after pipe
drinking down tea in gulps and flourishing his long arms Mikhalvitch
narrated his adventures to Lavrtzky there was nothing very cheerful
about them he could not boast of success in his enterprisesbut he
laughed incessantly with a hoarse nervous laugh A month previously he
had obtained a situation in the private countinghouse of a wealthy
distiller about three hundred versts from the town of O    and
on learning of Lavrtzkys return from abroad he had turned aside from
his road in order to see his old friend Mikhalvitch talked as
abruptly as in his younger days was as noisy and effervescent as ever
Lavrtzky was about to allude to his circumstances but Mikhalvitch
interrupted him hastily muttering Ive heard brother Ive heard
about itwho could have anticipated itand immediately turned the
conversation into the region of general comments

I brotherhe saidmust leave thee tomorrow today thou must
excuse mewe will go to bed lateI positively must find out what are
thy opinions convictions what sort of a person thou hast become what
life has taught thee Mikhalvitch still retained the phraseology of
the s So far as I myself am concerned I have changed in many
respects brother the billows of life have fallen upon my breastwho
the dickens was it that said thatalthough in important essential
points I have not changed I believe as of yore in the good in the
truth but I not only believeI am now a believer yesI am a
believer a religious believer Hearken thou knowest that I write
verses there is no poetry in them but there is truth I will recite to
thee my last piece in it I have given expression to my most sincere
convictions ListenMikhalvitch began to recite a poem it was
rather long and wound up with the following lines

      To new feeling I have surrendered myself with all my heart
      I have become like a child in soul
      And I have burned all that I worshipped
      I have worshipped all that I burned

As he declaimed these last two lines Mikhalvitch was on the verge of
tears slight convulsive twitchings the signs of deep feelingflitted
across his broad lips his ugly face lighted up Lavrtzky listened and
listened to him the spirit of contradiction began to stir within him
the everready incessantlyseething enthusiasm of the Moscow student
irritated him A quarter of an hour had not elapsed before a dispute
flared up between them one of those interminable disputes of which only
Russians are capable After a separation of many years duration spent
in two widelydifferent spheres understanding clearly neither other
peoples thoughts nor their owncavilling at words and retorting with
mere words they argued about the most abstract subjectsand argued as
though it were a matter of life and death to both of them they shouted
and yelled so that all the people in the house took fright and poor
Lemm who from the moment of Mikhalvitchs arrival had locked himself
up in his room became bewildered and began in a confused way to be
afraid

But what art thou after this disillusionedshouted Mikhalvitch at
one oclock in the morning

Are there any such disillusioned peopleretorted Lavrtzkythey
are all poor and illand Ill pick thee up with one hand shall I

Well if not a disillusioned man then a sceptuik and that is still
worse Mikhalvitchs pronunciation still smacked of his native Little
Russia And what right hast thou to be a sceptic Thou hast had bad
luck in life granted that was no fault of thine thou wert born with a
passionate loving soul and thou wert forcibly kept away from women the
first woman that came in thy way was bound to deceive thee

And she did deceive meremarked Lavrtzky gloomily

Granted granted I was the instrument of fate therebut what nonsense
am I talkingtheres no fate about it its merely an old habit of
expressing myself inaccurately But what does that prove

It proves that they dislocated me in my childhood

But set thy joints to that end thou art a human being a man thou hast
no need to borrow energy But at any rate is it possible is it
permissible to erect a private fact so to speak into a general law
into an immutable law

Where is the ruleinterrupted LavrtzkyI do not admit

Yes it is thy rule thy rule Mikhalvitch interrupted him in his
turn

Thou art an egoist thats what thou arthe thundered an hour
laterthou hast desired thine own personal enjoyment thou hast
desired happiness in life thou hast desired to live for thyself
alone

What dost thou mean by personal enjoyment

And everything has deceived thee everything has crumbled away beneath
thy feet

What is personal enjoymentI ask thee

And it was bound to crumble For thou hast sought support where it was
not to be found for thou hast built thy house on a quicksand

Speak more plainly without metaphors because I do not understand
thee

Becauselaugh if it pleases theebecause there is no faith in thee
no warmth of heart mind merely a farthing mind thou art simply a
pitiful lagging Voltairianthats what thou art

WhoI am a Voltairian

Yes just the same sort as thy father was and dost not suspect it
thyself

After thatcried LavrtzkyI have a right to say that thou art a
fanatic

Alasreturned Mikhalvitch with contritionunhappily as yet I
have in no way earned so lofty an appellation

Now I have discovered what to call theeshouted this same
Mikhalvitch at three oclock in the morningthou art not a sceptic
not a disillusioned man not a Voltairianthou art a trifler and thou
art an evilminded trifler a conscious trifler not an ingenuous
trifler Ingenuous triflers lie around on the oven and do nothing
because they do not know how to do anything and they think of nothing
But thou art a thinking manand thou liest around thou mightest do
somethingand thou dost nothing thou liest with thy wellfed belly
upward and sayest It is proper to lie thus because everything that men
do is nonsense and twaddle which leads to nothing

But what makes thee think that I trifleinsisted Lavrtzkywhy
dost thou assume such thoughts on my part

And more than that all of you all the people of your sortpursued
the obstreperous Mikhalvitchare erudite triflers You know on what
foot the German limps you know what is bad about the English and the
Frenchand your knowledge comes to your assistance justifies your
shameful laziness your disgusting inactivity Some men will even pride
themselves and say What a clever fellow I amI lie around but the
others the fools bustle about YesAnd there are such gentlemen
among usI am not saying this with reference to thee howeverwho
pass their whole lives in a sort of stupor of tedium grow accustomed to
it sit in it like  like a mushroom in sour cream Mikhalvitch
caught himself up and burst out laughing at his own comparisonOh
that stupor of tedium is the ruin of the Russians The repulsive trifler
all his life long is getting ready to work

Come what art thou calling names forroared Lavrtzky in his
turnWork  act  Tell me rather what to do but dont call
names you Poltva Demosthenes

Just see what a freak he has taken Ill not tell thee that brother
every one must know that himself retorted Demosthenes ironicallyA
landed proprietor a noblemanand he doesnt know what to do Thou hast
no faith or thou wouldst know thou hast no faithand there is no
revelation

Give me a rest at any rate you devil give me a chance to look around
meentreated Lavrtzky

Not a minute not a second of respiteretorted Mikhalvitch with an
imperious gesture of the handNot one secondDeath does not wait
and life ought not to wait

And when where did men get the idea of becoming triflershe shouted
at four oclock in the morning but his voice had now begun to be rather
hoarse among us now in Russia when on every separate individual a
duty a great obligation is incumbent toward God toward the nation
toward himself We are sleeping but time is passing on we are
sleeping

Permit me to observe to theesaid Lavrtzkythat we are not
sleeping at all now but are rather preventing others from sleeping
We are cracking our throats like cocks Hark isnt that the third
cockcrow

This sally disconcerted and calmed down Mikhalvitch Farewell until
tomorrowhe said with a smileand thrust his pipe into his
tobaccopouch Farewell until tomorrow repeated Lavrtzky But the
friends conversed for an hour longer However their voices were no
longer raised and their speeches were quiet sad and kind

Mikhalvitch departed on the following day in spite of all Lavrtzkys
efforts to detain him Fedor Ivnitch did not succeed in persuading
him to remain but he talked with him to his hearts content It came
out that Mikhalvitch had not a penny in the world Already on the
preceding evening Lavrtzky with compassion had observed in him all
the signs and habits of confirmed poverty his boots were broken a
button was missing from the back of his coat his hands were guiltless of
gloves down was visible in his hair on his arrival it had not occurred
to him to ask for washing materials and at supper he ate like a shark
tearing the meat apart with his hands and cracking the bones noisily
with his strong black teeth It appeared also that the service had
been of no benefit to him that he had staked all his hopes on the
revenuefarmer who had engaged him simply with the object of having in
his countinghouse an educated man In spite of all this Mikhalvitch
was not dejected and lived on as a cynic an idealist a poet sincerely
rejoicing and grieving over the lot of mankind over his own
callingand troubled himself very little as to how he was to keep
himself from dying with hunger Mikhalvitch had not married but had
been in love times without number and wrote verses about all his
ladyloves with especial fervour did he sing the praises of one
mysterious panna with black and curling locks Rumours were in
circulation it is true to the effect that the panna in question was a
plain Jewess well known to many cavalry officers  but when you come
to think of itdoes that make any difference

Mikhalvitch did not get on well with Lemm his vociferous speeches his
harsh manners frightened the German who was not used to such things
An unfortunate wretch always scents another unfortunate wretch from afar
but rarely makes up to him in old ageand this is not in the least to
be wondered at he has nothing to share with himnot even hopes

Before his departure Mikhalvitch had another long talk with
Lavrtzky prophesied perdition to him if he did not come to a sense of
his errors entreated him to occupy himself seriously with the existence
of his peasants set himself up as an example saying that he had been
purified in the furnace of afflictionand immediately thereafter
several times mentioned himself as a happy man compared himself to the
birds of heaven the lilies of the field

A black lily at any rateremarked Lavrtzky

Eh brother dont put on any of your aristocratic airsretorted
Mikhalvitch goodnaturedlybut thank God rather that in thy veins
flows honest plebeian blood But I perceive that thou art now in need
of some pure unearthly being who shall wrest thee from this apathy of
thine

Thanks brothersaid LavrtzkyI have had enough of those
unearthly beings

Shut up cuinuikexclaimed Mikhalvitch

CynicLavrtzky corrected him

Just so cuinuikrepeated Mikhalvitch in no wise disconcerted

Even as he took his seat in the tarants to which his flat yellow
strangely light trunk was carried forth he continued to talk wrapped up
in some sort of a Spanish cloak with a rusty collar and lions paws in
place of clasps he still went on setting forth his views as to the fate
of Russia and waving his swarthy hand through the air as though he were
sowing the seeds of its future welfare At last the horses started
Bear in mind my last three wordshe shouted thrusting his whole body
out of the tarants and balancing himselfreligion progress
humanity Farewell His head with its cap pulled down to the very
eyes vanished Lavrtzky remained standing alone on the porch and
staring down the road until the tarants disappeared from his sight
But I think he probably is righthe said to himself as he reentered
the houseprobably I am a trifler Many of Mikhalvitchs words had
sunk indelibly into his soul although he had disputed and had not agreed
with him If only a man be kindly no one can repulse him

                                  XXVI


Two days later Mrya Dmtrievna arrived with all her young people at
Vaslievskoe in accordance with her promise The little girls
immediately ran out into the garden while Mrya Dmtrievna languidly
traversed the rooms and languidly praised everything Her visit to
Lavrtzky she regarded as a token of great condescension almost in the
light of a good deed She smiled affably when Antn and Apraxyya after
the ancient custom of houseserfs came to kiss her handand in an
enervated voice through her nose she asked them to give her some tea To
the great vexation of Antn who had donned white knitted gloves the
newlyarrived lady was served with tea not by him but by Lavrtzkys
hired valet who according to the assertion of the old man knew nothing
whatever about proper forms On the other hand Antn reasserted his
rights at dinner firm as a post he stood behind Mrya Dmtrievnas
chairand yielded his place to no one The longunprecedented arrival of
visitors at Vaslievskoe both agitated and rejoiced the old man it
pleased him to see that his master knew nice people However he was not
the only one who was excited on that day Lemm also was excited He put
on a short snuffcoloured frockcoat with a sharppointed collar bound
his neckerchief tightly and incessantly coughed and stepped aside with
an agreeable and courteous mien Lavrtzky noted with satisfaction that
the close relations between himself and Liza still continued no sooner
did she enter than she offered him her hand in friendly wise After
dinner Lemm drew forth from the back pocket of his coat into which he
had been constantly thrusting his hand a small roll of music and pursing
up his lips he silently laid it on the piano It was a romance which he
had composed on the preceding day to oldfashioned German words in which
the stars were alluded to Liza immediately seated herself at the piano
and began to decipher the romance Alas the music turned out to be
complicated and disagreeably strained it was obvious that the composer
had attempted to express some passionate profound sentiment but nothing
had come of it so the attempt remained merely an attempt Lavrtzky and
Liza both felt thisand Lemm understood it he said not a word put his
romance back in his pocket and in reply to Lizas proposal to play it
over again he merely said significantly with a shake of his head
Enoughfor the presentbent his shoulders shrank together and left
the room

Toward evening they all went fishing together The pond beyond the
garden contained a quantity of carp and loach They placed Mrya
Dmtrievna in an armchair near the bank in the shade spread a rug
under her feet and gave her the best hook Antn in the quality of an
old and expert fisherman offered his services He assiduously spitted
worms on the hook slapped them down with his hand spat on them and
even himself flung the line and hook bending forward with his whole
body That same day Mrya Dmtrievna expressed herself to Fedor
Ivnitch with regard to him in the following phrase in the French
language of girls institutes Il ny a plus maintenant de ces gens
comme a comme autrefois Lemm with the two little girls went
further away to the dam Lavrtzky placed himself beside Liza The fish
bit incessantly the carp which were caught were constantly flashing
their sides now gold now silver in the air the joyous exclamations of
the little girls were unceasing Mrya Dmtrievna herself gave vent to
a couple of shrill feminine shrieks Lavrtzky and Liza caught fewer
than the others this probably resulted from the fact that they paid
less attention than the rest to their fishing and allowed their floats
to drift close inshore The tall reddish reeds rustled softly around
them in front of them the motionless water gleamed softly and their
conversation was soft also Liza stood on a small raft Lavrtzky sat on
the inclined trunk of a willow Liza wore a white gown girt about the
waist with a broad ribbon also white in hue her straw hat was hanging
from one hand with the other she supported with some effort the
curved fishingrod Lavrtzky gazed at the pure rather severe profile
at her hair tucked behind her ears at her soft cheeks which were as
sunburned as those of a childand said to himself O how charmingly
thou standest on my pond Liza did not turn toward him but stared at
the waterand half smiled half screwed up her eyes The shadow of a
lindentree near at hand fell upon both of them

Do you knowbegan LavrtzkyI have been thinking a great deal
about my last conversation with you and have come to the conclusion
that you are extraordinarily kind

I did not mean it in that way at all  Liza beganand was overcome
with shame

You are kindrepeated Lavrtzky I am a rough man but I feel that
every one must love you Theres Lemm now for example he is simply in
love with you

Lizas brows quivered rather than contracted this always happened with
her when she heard something disagreeable

I felt very sorry for him todayLavrtzky resumedwith his
unsuccessful romance To be young and be able to do a thingthat can be
borne but to grow old and not have the poweris painful And the
offensive thing about it is that you are not conscious when your powers
begin to wane It is difficult for an old man to endure these shocks
Look out the fish are biting at your hook They sayadded
Lavrtzky after a brief pausethat Vladmir Nikolitch has written
a very pretty romance

Yesreplied Lizait is a trifle but it is not bad

And what is your opinionasked Lavrtzkyis he a good musician

It seems to me that he has great talent for music but up to the present
time he has not cultivated it as he should

Exactly And is he a nice man

Liza laughed and cast a quick glance at Fedor Ivnitch

What a strange questionshe exclaimed drawing up her hook and
flinging it far out again

Why is it strangeI am asking you about him as a man who has recently
come hither as your relative

As a relative

Yes I believe I am a sort of uncle to you

Vladmir Nikolitch has a kind heartsaid Lizahe is clever
mamma is very fond of him

And do you like him

He is a nice man why should not I like him

Ahsaid Lavrtzky and relapsed into silence A halfmournful
halfsneering expression flitted across his face His tenacious gaze
discomfited Liza but she continued to smile Well God grant them
happinesshe muttered at last as though to himself and turned away
his head

Liza blushed

You are mistaken Fedor Ivnitchshe saidthere is no cause for
your thinking But do not you like Vladmir Nikolitch

I do not

Why

It seems to me that he has no heart

The smile vanished from Lizas face

You have become accustomed to judge people harshlyshe said after a
long silence

I think not What right have I to judge others harshly when I myself
stand in need of indulgence Or have you forgotten that a lazy man is the
only one who does not laugh at me Wellhe addedand have you
kept your promise

What promise

Have you prayed for me

Yes I have prayed and I do pray for you every day But please do not
speak lightly of that

Lavrtzky began to assure Liza that such a thing had never entered his
head that he entertained a profound respect for all convictions then he
entered upon a discussion of religion its significance in the history of
mankind the significance of Christianity

One must be a Christiansaid Liza not without a certain
effortnot in order to understand heavenly things  yonder 
earthly things but because every man must die

Lavrtzky with involuntary surprise raised his eyes to Lizas and
encountered her glance

What a word you have utteredsaid he

The word is not mineshe replied

It is not yours But why do you speak of death

I do not know I often think about it

Often

Yes

One would not say so to look at you now you have such a merry bright
face you are smiling

Yes I am very merry nowreturned Liza ingenuously

Lavrtzky felt like seizing both her hands and clasping them tightly

Liza Lizacalled Mrya Dmtrievnacome hither look What a
carp I have caught

Immediately mamanreplied Liza and went to her but Lavrtzky
remained on his willowtree

I talk with her as though I were not a man whose life is finished he
said to himself As she departed Liza had hung her hat on a bough with
a strange almost tender sentiment Lavrtzky gazed at the hat at its
long rather crumpled ribbons Liza speedily returned to him and again
took up her stand on the raft

Why do you think that Vladmir Nikolitch has no heartshe
inquired a few moments later

I have already told you that I may be mistaken however time will
show

Liza became thoughtful Lavrtzky began to talk about his manner of life
at Vaslievskoe about Mikhalvitch about Antn he felt impelled to
talk to Liza to communicate to her everything that occurred to his soul
she was so charming she listened to him so attentively her infrequent
comments and replies seemed to him so simple and wise He even told her
so

Liza was amazed

Reallyshe saidwhy I have always thought that I like my maid
Nstya had no words of my own One day she said to her betrothed Thou
must find it tiresome with me thou always sayest such fine things to me
but I have no words of my own

And thank God for that thought Lavrtzky




                                  XXVII


In the meantime evening drew on and Mrya Dmtrievna expressed a
desire to return home The little girls were with difficulty torn away
from the pond and made ready Lavrtzky announced his intention to
escort his guests half way and ordered his horse to be saddled As he
seated Mrya Dmtrievna in the carriage he remembered Lemm but the
old man was nowhere to be found He had disappeared as soon as the
angling was over Antn slammed to the carriage door with a strength
remarkable for his years and grimly shouted Drive on coachman The
carriage rolled off On the back seat sat Mrya Dmtrievna and Liza on
the front seat the little girls and the maid The evening was warm and
still and the windows were lowered on both sides Lavrtzky rode at a
trot by Lizas side of the carriage with his hand resting on the
doorhe had dropped the reins on the neck of his steed which was
trotting smoothlyand from time to time exchanged a few words with the
young girl The sunset glow vanished night descended and the air grew
even warmer Mrya Dmtrievna soon fell into a doze the little girls
and the maid also dropped off to sleep The carriage rolled swiftly and
smoothly onward Liza leaned forward the moon which had just risen
shone on her face the fragrant night breeze blew on her cheeks and neck
She felt at ease Her hand lay on the door of the carriage alongside of
Lavrtzkys hand And he also felt at ease he was being borne along
through the tranquil nocturnal warmth never taking his eyes from the
kind young face listening to the youthful voice which was ringing even
in a whisper saying simple kindly things he did not even notice that
he had passed the halfway point He did not wish to awaken Mrya
Dmtrievna pressed Lizas hand lightly and saidWe are friends
now are we not She nodded he drew up his horse The carriage rolled
on gently swaying and lurching Lavrtzky proceeded homeward at a
footpace The witchery of the summer night took possession of him
everything around him seemed so unexpectedly strange and at the same
time so long so sweetly familiar far and nearand things were
visible at a long distance although the eye did not comprehend much of
what it beheldeverything was at rest young blossoming life made
itself felt in that very repose Lavrtzkys horse walked briskly
swaying regularly to right and left its huge black shadow kept pace
alongside there was something mysteriously pleasant in the tramp of its
hoofs something cheerful and wondrous in the resounding call of the
quail The stars were hidden in a sort of brilliant smoke the moon not
yet at the full shone with a steady gleam its light flooded the blue
sky in streams and fell like a stain of smoky gold upon the thin
cloudlets which floated past the crispness of the air called forth a
slight moisture in the eyes caressingly enveloped all the limbs poured
in an abundant flood into the breast Lavrtzky enjoyed himself and
rejoiced at his enjoyment Come life is still before us he
thoughtit has not been completely ruined yet by He did not
finish his sentence and say who or what had ruined it Then he began
to think of Liza that it was hardly likely that she loved Pnshin that
had he met her under different circumstancesGod knows what might have
come of it that he understood Lemm although she had no words of her
own Yes but that was not true she had words of her own Do not
speak lightly of that recurred to Lavrtzkys memory He rode for a
long time with drooping head then he straightened himself up and
slowly recited

               And I have burned all that I worshipped
               I have worshipped all that I burned

but immediately gave his horse a cut with the whip and rode at a gallop
all the rest of the way home

As he alighted from his horse he cast a last glance around him with an
involuntary grateful smile Night the speechless caressing night lay
upon the hills and in the valleys from afar from its fragrant depths
God knows whencewhether from heaven or earthemanated a soft quiet
warmth Lavrtzky wafted a last salutation to Liza and ran up the
steps

The following day passed rather languidly Rain fell from early morning
Lemm cast furtive glances from beneath his eyebrows and pursed up his
lips more and more tightly as though he had vowed to himself never to
open them again On lying down to sleep Lavrtzky had taken to bed with
him a whole pile of French newspapers which had already been lying on
his table for two weeks with their wrappers unbroken He set to work
idly to strip off the wrappers and glance through the columns of the
papers which however contained nothing new He was on the point of
throwing them asidewhen all of a sudden he sprang out of bed as
though he had been stung In the feuilleton of one of the papers Msieu
Jules already known to us imparted to his readers a sad bit of news
The charming bewitching native of Moscow he wrote one of the queens
of fashion the ornament of Parisian salons Madame de Lavretzki had
died almost instantaneouslyand this news unhappily only too true had
only just reached him M Jules He washe continuedhe might say
a friend of the deceased

Lavrtzky dressed himself went out into the garden and until morning
dawned he paced back and forth in one and the same alley




                                 XXVIII


On the following morning at tea Lemm requested Lavrtzky to furnish him
with horses that he might return to town It is time that I should set
about my workthat is to say my lessons remarked the old manbut
here I am only wasting time in vain Lavrtzky did not immediately reply
to him he seemed preoccupied Very wellhe said at lastI will
accompany you myselfWithout any aid from the servants grunting and
fuming Lemm packed his small trunk and tore up and burned several sheets
of musicpaper The horses were brought round As he emerged from his
study Lavrtzky thrust into his pocket the newspaper of the day before
During the entire journey Lemm and Lavrtzky had very little to say to
each other each of them was engrossed with his own thoughts and each was
delighted that the other did not disturb him And they parted rather
coldlywhich by the way frequently happens between friends in Russia
Lavrtzky drove the old man to his tiny house the latter alighted got
out his trunk and without offering his hand to his friend he held his
trunk in front of his chest with both hands without even looking at
himhe said in Russian Goodbye sirGoodbyerepeated
Lavrtzky and ordered his coachman to drive him to his own lodgings He
had hired a lodging in the town of O    in case he might require
it After writing several letters and dining in haste Lavrtzky took
his way to the Kaltins In their drawingroom he found no one but
Pnshin who informed him that Mrya Dmtrievna would be down directly
and immediately entered into conversation with him with the most cordial
amiability Up to that day Pnshin had treated Lavrtzky not exactly
in a patronizing way yet condescendingly but Liza in telling Pnshin
about her jaunt of the day before had expressed herself to the effect
that Lavrtzky was a very fine and clever man that was enough the very
fine man must be captivated Pnshin began with compliments to
Lavrtzky with descriptions of the raptures with which according to his
statement Mrya Dmtrievnas whole family had expressed themselves
about Vaslievskoe and then according to his wont passing adroitly to
himself he began to talk about his own occupations his views of life of
the world of the government servicehe said a couple of words about the
future of Russia about the proper way of keeping the governors in hand
thereupon merrily jeered at himself and added that among other things
he had been commissioned in Petersburgde populariser lide du
cadastre He talked for quite a long time with careless selfconfidence
solving all difficulties and juggling with the most weighty
administrative and political questions as a sleightofhand performer
juggles with his balls The expressions This is what I would do if I
were the government You as a clever man will immediately agree with
mewere never absent from his tongue Lavrtzky listened coldly to
Pnshins idle chatter he did not like this handsome clever and
unconstrainedly elegant man with his brilliant smile courteous voice
and searching eyes Pnshin speedily divined with the swift
comprehension of other peoples sentiments which was peculiar to him that
he was not affording his interlocutor any particular pleasure and made
his escape under a plausible pretext deciding in his own mind that
Lavrtzky might be a very fine man but that he was not sympathetic was
aigri and en somme rather ridiculousMrya Dmtrievna made
her appearance accompanied by Gedenovsky then Mrfa Timofevna
entered with Liza after them followed the other members of the household
then came that lover of music Mme Byelentzyn a small thin lady with
an almost childish fatigued and handsome little face in a rustling black
gown with a motleyhued fan and heavy gold bracelets her husband also
came a rosycheeked plump man with huge feet and hands with white
eyelashes and an impassive smile on his thick lips in company his wife
never spoke to him but at home in moments of tenderness she was wont to
call him her little pig Pnshin returned the rooms became very full
of people and very noisy Such a throng of people was not to Lavrtzkys
liking Mme Byelentzyn particularly enraged him by constantly staring
at him through her lorgnette He would have withdrawn at once had it not
been for Liza he wished to say two words to her in private but for a
long time he was not able to seize a convenient moment and contented
himself with watching her in secret joy never had her face seemed to him
more noble and charming She appeared to great advantage from the
proximity of Mme Byelentzyn The latter was incessantly fidgeting about
on her chair shrugging her narrow little shoulders laughing in an
enervated way and screwing up her eyes then suddenly opening them very
wide Liza sat quietly her gaze was direct and she did not laugh at all
The hostess sat down to play cards with Mrfa Timofevna Mme
Byelentzyn and Gedenovsky who played very slowly was constantly
making mistakes blinking his eyes and mopping his face with his
handkerchief Pnshin assumed a melancholy mien expressed himself with
brevity with great significance and mournfulnessfor all the world like
an artist who has not had his saybut despite the entreaties of Mme
Byelentzyn who was having a violent flirtation with him he would not
consent to sing his romance Lavrtzky embarrassed him Fedor Ivnitch
also said little the peculiar expression of his face had startled Liza
as soon as he entered the room she immediately felt that he had something
to communicate to her but without herself knowing why she was afraid to
interrogate him At last as she passed into the hall to pour tea she
involuntarily turned her head in his direction He immediately followed
her

What is the matter with youshe said as she placed the teapot on the
samovr

Have you noticed it

You are not the same today as I have seen you heretofore

Lavrtzky bent over the table

I wantedhe beganto tell you a certain piece of news but now it
is not possibleHowever read what is marked with pencil in this
feuilletonhe added giving her the copy of the newspaper which he had
brought with himI beg that you will keep this secret I will call on
you tomorrow morning

Liza was surprised Pnshin made his appearance on the threshold of
the door she put the newspaper in her pocket

Have you read Obermann Lizavta MikhalovnaPnshin asked her
meditatively

Liza gave him a superficial answer left the hall and went upstairs
Lavrtzky returned to the drawingroom and approached the cardtable
Mrfa Timofevna with her capribbons untied and red in the face
began to complain to him about her partner Gedenovsky who according
to her did not know how to lead

Evidentlyshe saidplaying cards is quite a different thing from
inventing fibs

Her partner continued to blink and mop his face Liza entered the
drawingroom and seated herself in a corner Lavrtzky looked at her
she looked at himand something like dread fell upon them both He read
surprise and a sort of secret reproach in her face Long as he might to
talk to her he could not do it to remain in the same room with her a
guest among strangers was painful to him he decided to go away As he
took leave of her he managed to repeat that he would come on the morrow
and he added that he trusted in her friendship

Comeshe replied with the same amazement on her face

Pnshin brightened up after Lavrtzkys departure he began to give
advice to Gedenovsky banteringly paid court to Mme Byelentzyn and
at last sang his romance But he talked with Liza and gazed at her as
before significantly and rather sadly

And again Lavrtzky did not sleep all night long He did not feel sad
he was not excited he had grown altogether calm but he could not sleep
He did not even recall the past he simply gazed at his life his heart
beat strongly and evenly the hours flew past but he did not even think
of sleeping At times only did the thought come to the surface in his
mind But that is not true it is all nonsenseand he paused lowered
his head and began again to gaze at his life

                                  XXIX


Mrya Dmtrievna did not receive Lavrtzky with any excess of
cordiality when he presented himself on the following day Well you
are making yourself pretty free of the houseshe said to herself
Personally he did not greatly please her and in addition Pnshin
under whose influence she was had sung his praises in a very sly and
careless manner on the preceding evening As she did not look upon him in
the light of a guest and did not consider it necessary to trouble
herself about a relative almost a member of the family half an hour had
not elapsed before he was strolling down an alley in the garden with
Liza Lynotchka and Schrotchka were frolicking a short distance away
among the flowerbeds

Liza was composed as usual but paler than usual She took from her
pocket and handed to Lavrtzky the sheet of newspaper folded small

This is dreadfulsaid she

Lavrtzky made no reply

But perhaps it is not yet trueadded Liza

That is why I asked you not to mention it to any one

Liza walked on a little way

Tell meshe beganyou are not grieved Not in the least

I do not know myself what my feelings arereplied Lavrtzky

But assuredly you used to love her

Yes I did

Very much

Very much

And you are not grieved by her death

It is not now that she has died to me

What you say is sinful Do not be angry with me You call me your
friend a friend may say anything To tell the truth I feel
terrified Your face was so malign yesterday Do you remember how
you were complaining of her not long agoand perhaps already at that
very time she was no longer alive This is terrible It is exactly as
though it had been sent to you as a chastisement

Lavrtzky laughed bitterly

Do you think so At all events I am free now

Liza gave a slight start

Stop do not talk like that Of what use to you is your freedom You
must not think about that now but about forgiveness

I forgave her long agointerrupted Lavrtzky with a wave of the
hand

No not thatreturned Liza and blushed You did not understand me
rightly You must take means to obtain forgiveness

Who is there to forgive me

WhoGod Who else but God can forgive us

Lavrtzky caught her hand

Akh Lizavta Mikhalovna believe mehe exclaimedI have been
sufficiently punished as it is I have already atoned for everything
believe me

You cannot know thatsaid Liza in a low voice You have
forgottennot very long agowhen you were talking to meyou were
not willing to forgive her

The two walked silently down the alley

And how about your daughterLiza suddenly inquired and halted

Lavrtzky started

Oh do not worry yourself I have already despatched letters to all the
proper places The future of my daughter as you call  as you say 
is assured Do not disquiet yourself

Liza smiled sadly

But you are rightwent on Lavrtzkywhat can I do with my
freedom Of what use is it to me

When did you receive that newspapersaid Liza making no reply to his
question

The day after your visit

And is it possible  is it possible that you did not even weep

No I was stunned but where were the tears to come from Weep over the
pastbut you see it is entirely extirpated in my case Her
behaviour itself did not destroy my happiness but merely proved to me
that it had never existed What was there to cry about But who
knowsperhaps I should have been more grieved if I had received this
news two weeks earlier

Two weeksreturned Liza But what has happened in those two weeks

Lavrtzky made no answer and Liza suddenly blushed more furiously than
before

Yes yes you have guessed itinterposed Lavrtzkyin the course
of those two weeks I have learned what a pure womans soul is like and
my past has retreated still further from me

Liza became confused and softly walked toward the flowergarden to
Lynotchka and Schrotchka

And I am glad that I have shown you this newspapersaid Lavrtzky
as he followed herI have already contracted the habit of concealing
nothing from you and I hope that you will repay me with the same
confidence

Do you think sosaid Liza and stopped short In that case I ought
to  but no That is impossible

What is it Speak speak

Really it seems to me that I ought not However added Liza and
turned to Lavrtzky with a smilewhat is halffrankness worthDo
you know I received a letter today

From Pnshin

Yes from him How did you know

He asks your hand

Yesuttered Liza and looked seriously in Lavrtzkys eyes

Lavrtzky in his turn gazed seriously at Liza

Well and what reply have you made to himhe said at last

I do not know what reply to makereplied Liza and dropped her
clasped hands

What Surely you like him

Yes he pleases me he seems to be a nice man

You said the same thing to me in those very same words three days ago
What I want to know is whether you love him with that strong passionate
feeling which we are accustomed to call love

As you understand itno

You are not in love with him

No But is that necessary

Of course it is

Mamma likes himpursued Lizahe is amiable I have nothing against
him

Still you are wavering

Yes  and perhapsyour words may be the cause of it Do you remember
what you said day before yesterday But that weakness

Oh my childsuddenly exclaimed Lavrtzkyand his voice
trembleddo not argue artfully do not designate as weakness the cry
of your heart which does not wish to surrender itself without love Do
not take upon yourself that terrible responsibility toward a man whom you
do not love and to whom you do not wish to belong

I am listeningI am taking nothing upon myself  Liza was
beginning

Listen to your heart it alone will tell you the truthLavrtzky
interrupted her Experience reasoningall that is stuff and
nonsense Do not deprive yourself of the best the only happiness on
earth

Is it you Fedor Ivnitch who are speaking thus You yourself
married for loveand were you happy

Lavrtzky wrung his hands

Akh do not talk to me of that You cannot even understand all that a
young untried absurdly educated lad can mistake for love Yes and
in short why calumniate ones self I just told you that I had not
known happiness  no I was happy

It seems to me Fedor Ivnitchsaid Liza lowering her voice when
she did not agree with her interlocutor she always lowered her voice
and at the same time she became greatly agitatedhappiness on earth
does not depend upon us

It does it does depend upon us believe me he seized both her hands
Liza turned pale and gazed at him almost in terror but with
attentionif only we have not ruined our own lives For some people
a lovemarriage may prove unhappy but not for you with your calm
temperament with your clear soul I entreat you do not marry without
love from a sense of duty of renunciation or anything else That
also is want of faith that is calculationand even worse Believe
meI have a right to speak thus I have paid dearly for that right And
if your God

At that moment Lavrtzky noticed that Lynotchka and Schrotchka were
standing beside Liza and staring at him with dumb amazement He released
Lizas hands said hastily Pray pardon meand walked toward the
house

I have only one request to make of youhe said returning to
Lizado not decide instantly wait think over what I have said to
you Even if you have not believed me if you have made up your mind to a
marriage of reasoneven in that case you ought not to marry Mr
Pnshin he cannot be your husband Promise me will you not not to
be in a hurry

Liza tried to answer Lavrtzky but did not utter a wordnot because
she had made up her mind to be in a hurry but because her heart was
beating too violently and a sensation resembling fear had stopped her
breath




                                   XXX


As he was leaving the Kaltins house Lavrtzky encountered Pnshin
they saluted each other coldly Lavrtzky went home to his apartment
and locked himself in He experienced a sensation such as he had in all
probability never experienced before Had he remained long in that state
of peaceful numbness had he long continued to feel as he had
expressed it at the bottom of the river What had altered his
position what had brought him out to the surface the most ordinary
inevitable though always unexpected of eventsdeath Yes but he did
not think so much about the death of his wife about his freedom
aswhat sort of answer would Liza give to Pnshin He was conscious
that in the course of the last three days he had come to look upon her
with different eyes he recalled how on returning home and thinking
about her in the silence of the night he had said to himself If
That if wherein he had alluded to the past to the impossible had
come to pass although not in the way he had anticipatedbut this was
little in itself She will obey her mother he thought she will marry
Pnshin but even if she refuses himis it not all the same to me As
he passed in front of the mirror he cast a cursory glance at his face
and shrugged his shoulders

The day sped swiftly by in these reflections evening arrived Lavrtzky
wended his way to the Kaltins He walked briskly but approached their
house with lingering steps In front of the steps stood Pnshins
drozhky Comethought LavrtzkyI will not be an egoist and
entered the house Inside he met no one and all was still in the
drawingroom he opened the door and beheld Mrya Dmtrievna playing
picquet with Pnshin Pnshin bowed to him in silence and the mistress
of the house uttered a little screamHow unexpectedand frowned
slightly Lavrtzky took a seat by her side and began to look over her
cards

Do you know how to play picquetshe asked him with a certain
dissembled vexation and immediately announced that she discarded

Pnshin reckoned up ninety and politely and calmly began to gather up
the tricks with a severe and dignified expression on his countenance
That is the way in which diplomats should play probably that is the way
in which he was wont to play in Petersburg with some powerful dignitary
whom he desired to impress with a favourable opinion as to his solidity
and maturity One hundred and one one hundred and two hearts one
hundred and threerang out his measured tone and Lavrtzky could not
understand what note resounded in it reproach or selfconceit

Is Mrfa Timofevna to be seenhe asked observing that Pnshin
still with great dignity was beginning to shuffle the cards Not a trace
of the artist was as yet to be observed in him

Yes I think so She is in her own apartments upstairsreplied
Mrya Dmtrievnayou had better inquire

Lavrtzky went upstairs and found Mrfa Timofevna at cards also
she was playing duratchk fools with Nastsya Krpovna Rska
barked at him but both the old ladies welcomed him cordially and Mrfa
Timofevna in particular seemed to be in high spirits

Ah Fdya Pray come inshe saidsit down my dear little father
We shall be through our game directly Wouldst thou like some preserves
Schrotchka get him a jar of strawberries Thou dost not want it Well
then sit as thou art but as for smokingthou must not I cannot bear
thy tobacco and moreover it makes Matrs sneeze

Lavrtzky made haste to assert that he did not care to smoke

Hast thou been downstairswent on the old womanwhom didst thou
see there Is Pnshin still on hand as usual And didst thou see Liza
No She intended to come hither Yes there she is speak of an
angel

Liza entered the room and on perceiving Lavrtzky she blushed

I have run in to see you for a minute Mrfa Timofevna she
began

Why for a minutereturned the old woman What makes all you young
girls such restless creatures Thou seest that I have a visitor chatter
to him entertain him

Liza seated herself on the edge of a chair raised her eyes to
Lavrtzkyand felt that it was impossible not to give him to
understand how her interview with Pnshin had ended But how was that to
be done She felt both ashamed and awkward She had not been acquainted
with him long with that man who both went rarely to church and bore with
so much indifference the death of his wifeand here she was already
imparting her secrets to him He took an interest in her it is true
she herself trusted him and felt attracted to him but nevertheless
she felt ashamed as though a stranger had entered her pure virgin
chamber

Mrfa Timofevna came to her assistance

If thou wilt not entertain himshe began who will entertain him
poor fellow I am too old for him he is too clever for me and for
Nastsya Krpovna he is too old you must give her nothing but very
young men

How can I entertain Fedor Ivnitchsaid LizaIf he likes I
will play something for him on the pianoshe added irresolutely

Very good indeed thats my clever girlreplied Mrfa
TimofevnaGo downstairs my dear people when you are through come
back for I have been left the fool and I feel insulted and want to
win back

Liza rose Lavrtzky followed her As they were descending the
staircase Liza halted

They tell the truthshe beganwhen they say that the hearts of men
are full of contradictions Your example ought to frighten me to render
me distrustful of marriage for love but I

You have refused himinterrupted Lavrtzky

No but I have not accepted him I told him everything everything that
I felt and asked him to wait Are you satisfiedshe added with a
swift smileand lightly touching the railing with her hand she ran
down the stairs

What shall I play for youshe asked as she raised the lid of the
piano

Whatever you likereplied Lavrtzky and seated himself in such a
position that he could watch her

Liza began to play and for a long time never took her eyes from her
fingers At last she glanced at Lavrtzky and stopped short so
wonderful and strange did his face appear to her

What is the matter with youshe asked

Nothinghe repliedall is very well with me I am glad for you I
am glad to look at yougo on

It seems to mesaid Liza a few moments laterthat if he really
loved me he would not have written that letter he ought to have felt
that I could not answer him now

That is of no importancesaid Lavrtzkythe important point is
that you do not love him

Stopwhat sort of a conversation is this I keep having visions of
your dead wife and you are terrible to me

My Lizta plays charmingly does she not ValdemarMrya
Dmtrievna was saying to Pnshin at the same moment

Yesreplied Pnshinvery charmingly

Mrya Dmtrievna gazed tenderly at her young partner but the latter
assumed a still more important and careworn aspect and announced
fourteen kings




                                  XXXI


Lavrtzky was not a young man he could not long deceive himself as to
the sentiments with which Liza had inspired him he became definitively
convinced on that day that he had fallen in love with her This
conviction brought no great joy to him Is it possible he thought
that at the age of five and thirty I have nothing better to do than to
put my soul again into the hands of a woman But Liza is not like that
one she would not require from me shameful sacrifices she would not
draw me away from my occupations she herself would encourage me to
honourable severe toil and we would advance together toward a fine
goal Yes he wound up his meditationsall that is good but the bad
thing is that she will not in the least wish to marry me It was not for
nothing that she told me that I am terrible to her On the other hand
she does not love that Pnshin either A poor consolation

Lavrtzky rode out to Vaslievskoe but he did not remain four
daysit seemed so irksome to him there He was tortured also by
expectancy the information imparted by Mr Jules required
confirmation and he had received no letters He returned to the town
and sat out the evening at the Kaltins It was easy for him to see
that Mrya Dmtrievna had risen in revolt against him but he succeeded
in appeasing her somewhat by losing fifteen rubles to her at
picquetand he spent about half an hour alone with Liza in spite of
the fact that her mother no longer ago than the day before had advised
her not to be too familiar with a man qui a un si grand ridicule He
found a change in her she seemed somehow to have become more
thoughtful she upbraided him for his absence and asked himwould he
not go to church on the following morning the next day was Sunday

Goshe said to him before he had succeeded in replyingwe will
pray together for the repose of her soulThen she added that she
did not know what she ought to doshe did not know whether she had the
right to make Pnshin wait any longer for her decision

Whyasked Lavrtzky

Becausesaid she I am already beginning to suspect what that
decision will be

She declared that her head ached and went off to her own room upstairs
irresolutely offering Lavrtzky the tips of her fingers

The next day Lavrtzky went to the morning service Liza was already in
the church when he arrived She observed him although she did not turn
toward him She prayed devoutly her eyes sparkled softly her head bent
and rose softly He felt that she was praying for him alsoand a
wonderful emotion filled his soul He felt happy and somewhat
consciencestricken The decorouslystanding congregation the familiar
faces the melodious chanting the odour of the incense the long
slanting rays of light from the windows the very gloom of the walls and
vaulted roofall spoke to his ear He had not been in a church for a
long time he had not appealed to God for a long time and even now he
did not utter any words of prayerhe did not even pray without words
but for a moment at least if not in body certainly with all his mind
he prostrated himself and bowed humbly to the very earth He recalled
how in his childhood he had prayed in church on every occasion until he
became conscious of some ones cool touch on his brow this he had
been accustomed to say to himself at that time is my guardianangel
accepting me laying upon me the seal of the chosen He cast a glance at
Liza Thou hast brought me hither he thoughtdo thou also touch
me touch my soul She continued to pray in the same calm manner as
before her face seemed to him joyful and he was profoundly moved once
more he entreated for that other soulpeace for his ownpardon

They met in the porch she greeted him with cheerful and amiable dignity
The sun brilliantly illuminated the young grass in the churchyard and
the motleyhued gowns and kerchiefs of the women the bells of the
neighbouring churches were booming aloft the sparrows were chirping in
the hedgerows Lavrtzky stood with head uncovered and smiled a light
breeze lifted his hair and the tips of the ribbons on Lizas hat He put
Liza into her carriage distributed all his small change to the poor and
softly wended his way homeward




                                  XXXII


Difficult days arrived for Fedor Ivnitch He found himself in a
constant fever Every morning he went to the postoffice with excitement
broke the seals of his letters and newspapersand nowhere did he find
anything which might have confirmed or refuted the fateful rumour
Sometimes he became repulsive even to himself Why am I thus
waitinghe said to himself like a crow for blood for the sure news
of my wifes death He went to the Kaltins every day but even there
he was no more at his ease the mistress of the house openly sulked at
him received him with condescension Pnshin treated him with
exaggerated courtesy Lemm had become misanthropic and hardly even bowed
to himand chief of all Liza seemed to avoid him But when she
chanced to be left alone with him in place of her previous trustfulness
confusion manifested itself in her she did not know what to say to him
and he himself felt agitation In the course of a few days Liza had
become quite different from herself as he had previously known her in
her movements her voice in her very laugh a secret trepidation was
perceptible an unevenness which had not heretofore existed Mrya
Dmtrievna like the genuine egoist she was suspected nothing but
Mrfa Timofevna began to watch her favourite Lavrtzky more than
once reproached himself with having shown to Liza the copy of the
newspaper which he had received he could not fail to recognise the fact
that in his spiritual condition there was an element which was perturbing
to pure feeling He also assumed that the change in Liza had been brought
about by her conflict with herself by her doubts what answer should she
give to Pnshin One day she brought him a book one of Walter Scotts
novels which she herself had asked of him

Have you read this bookhe asked

No I do not feel in a mood for books nowshe replied and turned to
go

Wait a minute I have not been alone with you for a long time You seem
to be afraid of me

Yes

Why so pray

I do not know

Lavrtzky said nothing for a while

Tell mehe beganyou have not yet made up your mind

What do you mean by thatshe said without raising her eyes

You understand me

Liza suddenly flushed up

Ask me no questions about anythingshe ejaculated with vivacityI
know nothing I do not even know myself And she immediately beat a
retreat

On the following day Lavrtzky arrived at the Kaltins after dinner
and found all preparations made to have the AllNight Vigil service held
there In one corner of the diningroom on a square table covered with
a clean cloth small holy pictures in gold settings with tiny dull
brilliants in their halos were already placed leaning against the wall
An old manservant in a grey frockcoat and slippers walked the whole
length of the room in a deliberate manner and without making any noise
with his heels and placed two wax tapers in slender candlesticks in
front of the holy images crossed himself made a reverence and softly
withdrew The unlighted drawingroom was deserted Lavrtzky walked down
the diningroom and inquiredwas it not some ones Nameday He was
answered in a whisper that it was not but that the Vigil service had
been ordered at the desire of Lizavta Mikhalovna and Mrfa
Timofevna that the intention had been to bring thither the
wonderworking ikna but it had gone to a sick person thirty versts
distant There soon arrived also in company with the chanters the
priest a man no longer young with a small bald spot who coughed loudly
in the anteroom the ladies all immediately trooped in single file from
the boudoir and approached to receive his blessing Lavrtzky saluted
him in silence and he returned the salute in silence The priest stood
still for a short time then cleared his throat again and asked in a low
tone with a bass voice

Do you command me to proceed

Proceed btiushkareplied Mrya Dmtrievna

He began to vest himself the chanter obsequiously asked for a live coal
the incense began to diffuse its fragrance The maids and lackeys emerged
from the anteroom and halted in a dense throng close to the door Rska
who never came downstairs suddenly made his appearance in the
diningroom they began to drive him out and he became confused turned
around and sat down a footman picked him up and carried him away The
Vigil service began Lavrtzky pressed himself into a corner his
sensations were strange almost melancholy he himself was not able
clearly to make out what he felt Mrya Dmtrievna stood in front of
them all before an armchair she crossed herself with enervated
carelessness in regular lordly fashionnow glancing around her again
suddenly casting her eyes upward she was bored Mrfa Timofevna
seemed troubled Nastsya Krpovna kept prostrating herself and rising
with a sort of modest soft rustle Liza took up her stand and never
stirred from her place never moved from the concentrated expression of
her countenance it was possible to divine that she was praying
assiduously and fervently When she kissed the cross at the end of the
service she also kissed the priests large red hand Mrya Dmtrievna
invited him to drink tea he took off his stole assumed a rather secular
air and passed into the drawingroom with the ladies A not over
animated conversation began The priest drank four cups of tea
incessantly mopping his bald spot with his handkerchief and narrated
among other things that merchant Avshnikoff had contributed seven
hundred rubles to gild the cupola of the church and he also imparted a
sure cure for freckles Lavrtzky tried to seat himself beside Liza but
she maintained a severe almost harsh demeanour and never once glanced
at him she appeared to be deliberately refraining from noticing him a
certain cold dignified rapture had descended upon her For some reason
or other Lavrtzky felt inclined to smile uninterruptedly and say
something amusing but there was confusion in his heart and he went away
at last secretly perplexed He felt that there was something in Liza
into which he could not penetrate

On another occasion Lavrtzky as he sat in the drawingroom and
listened to the insinuating but heavy chatter of Gedenovsky suddenly
turned round without himself knowing why he did so and caught a deep
attentive questioning gaze in Lizas eyes It was riveted on him
that puzzling gaze afterward Lavrtzky thought about it all night
long He had not fallen in love in boyish fashion it did not suit him to
sigh and languish neither did Liza arouse that sort of sentiment but
love has its sufferings at every ageand he underwent them to the full



   This service consisting generally of Vespers and Matins can be
       read in private houses and even by laymen whereas the Liturgy
       or Mass must be celebrated at a duly consecrated altar by a duly
       ordained priestTranslator




                                 XXXIII


One day according to his custom Lavrtzky was sitting at the
Kaltins A fatiguinglyhot day had been followed by so fine an
evening that Mrya Dmtrievna despite her aversion to the fresh air
had ordered all the windows and doors into the garden to be opened and
had announced that she would not play cards that it was a sin to play
cards in such weather and one must enjoy nature Pnshin was the only
visitor Tuned up by the evening and unwilling to sing before
Lavrtzky yet conscious of an influx of artistic emotions he turned to
poetry he recited well but with too much selfconsciousness and with
unnecessary subtleties several of Lrmontoffs poems at that time
Pshkin had not yet become fashionable againand all at once as
though ashamed of his expansiveness he began apropos of the familiar
Thought to upbraid and reprove the present generation in that
connection not missing the opportunity to set forth how he would turn
everything around in his own way if the power were in his hands
Russia said hehas lagged behind Europe she must catch up with it
People assert that we are youngthat is nonsense and moreover that we
possess no inventive genius X  himself admits that we have not even
invented a mousetrap Consequently we are compelled willynilly to
borrow from others We are illsays LrmontoffI agree with him
but we are ill because we have only half converted ourselves into
Europeans that is where we have made our mistake and that is what we
must be cured of Le cadastrethought LavrtzkyThe best
heads among ushe went onles meilleurs tteshave long since
become convinced of this all nations are essentially alike only
introduce good institutions and theres an end of the matter One may
even conform to the existing national life that is our business the
business of men  he came near saying of statesmen who are in
the service but in case of need be not uneasy the institutions will
transform that same existence Mrya Dmtrievna with emotion backed
up Pnshin What a clever man this isshe thoughttalking in my
house Liza said nothing as she leaned against a windowframe
Lavrtzky also maintained silence Mrfa Timofevna who was playing
cards in the corner with her friend muttered something to herself
Pnshin strode up and down the room and talked eloquently but with a
secret spite he seemed to be scolding not the whole race but certain
individuals of his acquaintance In the Kaltins garden in a large
lilacbush dwelt a nightingale whose first evening notes rang forth in
the intervals of this eloquent harangue the first stars lighted up in
the rosy sky above the motionless crests of the lindens Lavrtzky
rose and began to reply to Pnshin an argument ensued Lavrtzky
defended the youth and independence of Russia he surrendered himself
his generation as sacrificebut upheld the new men their convictions
and their desires Pnshin retorted in a sharp and irritating way
declared that clever men must reform everything and went so far at
last that forgetting his rank of Junior Gentleman of the Imperial
Bedchamber and his official career he called Lavrtzky a laggard
conservative he even hintedin a very remote way it is trueat his
false position in society Lavrtzky did not get angry did not raise
his voice he remembered that Mikhalvitch also had called him a
laggardonly a Voltairianand calmly vanquished Pnshin on every
point He demonstrated to him the impossibility of leaps and supercilious
reforms unjustified either by a knowledge of the native land or actual
faith in an ideal even a negative ideal he cited as an example his
own education and demanded first of all a recognition of national
truth and submission to itthat submission without which even boldness
against falsehood is impossible he did not evade in conclusion the
reproachmerited in his opinionof frivolous waste of time and
strength

All that is very fineexclaimed the enraged Pnshin at lastHere
you have returned to Russiawhat do you intend to do

Till the soilreplied Lavrtzkyand try to till it as well as
possible

That is very praiseworthy theres no disputing thatrejoined
Pnshinand I have been told that you have already had great success
in that direction but you must admit that not every one is fitted for
that sort of occupation

Une nature potiquebegan Mrya Dmtrievnaof course cannot
till the soil  et puis you are called Vladmir Nikolitch to do
everything en grand

This was too much even for Pnshin he stopped short and the
conversation stopped short also He tried to turn it on the beauty of the
starry sky on Schuberts musicbut for some reason it would not run
smoothly he ended by suggesting to Mrya Dmtrievna that he should
play picquet with herWhat on such an eveningshe replied feebly
but she ordered the cards to be brought

Pnshin with a crackling noise tore open the fresh pack while Liza
and Lavrtzky as though in pursuance of an agreement both rose and
placed themselves beside Mrfa Timofevna They both suddenly felt so
very much at ease that they were even afraid to be left alone
togetherand at the same time both felt that the embarrassment which
they had experienced during the last few days had vanished never more to
return The old woman stealthily patted Lavrtzky on the cheek slyly
screwed up her eyes and shook her head several times remarking in a
whisper Thou hast got the best of the clever fellow thanks
Everything in the room became still the only sound was the faint
crackling of the wax candles and now and then the tapping of hands on
the table and an exclamation or the reckoning of the spotsand the
song mighty resonant to the verge of daring of the nightingale poured
in a broad stream through the window in company with the dewy coolness




                                  XXXIV


Liza had not uttered a single word during the course of the dispute
between Lavrtzky and Pnshin but had attentively followed it and had
been entirely on Lavrtzkys side Politics possessed very little
interest for her but the selfconfident tone of the fashionable official
he had never hitherto so completely expressed himself had repelled
her his scorn of Russia had wounded her It had never entered Lizas
head that she was a patriot but she was at her ease with Russian
people the Russian turn of mind gladdened her without any affectation
for hours at a time she chatted with the overseer of her mothers
estate when he came to town and talked with him as with an equal
without any lordly condescension Lavrtzky felt all this he would not
have undertaken to reply to Pnshin alone he had been talking for Liza
only They said nothing to each other even their eyes met but rarely
but both understood that they had come very close together that evening
understood that they loved and did not love the same things On only one
point did they differ but Liza secretly hoped to bring him to God They
sat beside Mrfa Timofevna and appeared to be watching her play and
they really were watching itbut in the meanwhile their hearts had
waxed great in their bosoms and nothing escaped them for them the
nightingale was singing the stars were shining and the trees were
softly whispering lulled both by slumber and by the softness of the
summer and by the warmth Lavrtzky surrendered himself wholly to the
billow which was bearing him onwardand rejoiced but no word can
express that which took place in the young girls pure soul it was a
secret to herself so let it remain for all others No one knows no one
has seen and no one ever will see how that which is called into life
and blossom pours forth and matures grain in the bosom of the earth

The clock struck ten Mrfa Timofevna went off to her rooms upstairs
with Nastsya Krpovna Lavrtzky and Liza strolled through the room
halted in front of the open door to the garden gazed into the dark
distance then at each otherand smiled they would have liked it
appeared to take each other by the hand and talk their fill They
returned to Mrya Dmtrievna and Pnshin whose picquet had become
protracted The last king came to an end at length and the hostess
rose groaning and sighing from the cushiongarnished armchair
Pnshin took his hat kissed Mrya Dmtrievnas hand remarked that
nothing now prevented other happy mortals from going to bed or enjoying
the night but that he must sit over stupid papers until the morning
dawned bowed coldly to Liza he had not expected that in reply to his
offer of marriage she would ask him to waitand therefore he was
sulking at herand went away Lavrtzky followed him At the gate they
parted Pnshin aroused his coachman by poking him with the tip of his
cane in the neck seated himself in his drozhky and drove off
Lavrtzky did not feel like going home he walked out beyond the town
into the fields The night was tranquil and bright although there was no
moon Lavrtzky roamed about on the dewy grass for a long time he came
by accident upon a narrow path he walked along it It led him to a long
fence to a wicketgate he tried without himself knowing why to push
it open it creaked softly and opened as though it had been awaiting
the pressure of his hand Lavrtzky found himself in a garden advanced
a few paces along an avenue of lindens and suddenly stopped short in
amazement he recognised the garden of the Kaltins

He immediately stepped into a black blot of shadow which was cast by a
thick hazelbush and stood for a long time motionless wondering and
shrugging his shoulders

This has not happened for nothing he thought

Everything was silent round about not a sound was borne to him from the
direction of the house He cautiously advanced Lo at the turn in the
avenue the whole house suddenly gazed at him with its dark front only
in two of the upper windows were lights twinkling in Lizas room a
candle was burning behind a white shade and in Mrfa Timofevnas
bedroom a shrinelamp was glowing with a red gleam in front of the holy
pictures reflecting itself in an even halo in the golden settings
downstairs the door leading out on the balcony yawned broadly as it
stood wide open Lavrtzky seated himself on a wooden bench propped his
head on his hand and began to gaze at the door and the window Midnight
struck in the town in the house the small clocks shrilly rang out
twelve the watchman beat with a riffle of taps on the board Lavrtzky
thought of nothing expected nothing it was pleasant to him to feel
himself near Liza to sit in her garden on the bench where she also had
sat more than once The light disappeared in Lizas room

Good night my dear girl whispered Lavrtzky as he continued to sit
motionless and without taking his eyes from the darkened window

Suddenly a light appeared in one of the windows of the lower storey
passed to a second a third Some one was walking through the rooms
with a candle Can it be Liza Impossible Lavrtzky half rose to
his feet A familiar figure flitted past and Liza made her appearance in
the drawingroom In a white gown with her hair hanging loosely on her
shoulders she softly approached a table bent over it set down the
candle and searched for something then turning her face toward the
garden she approached the open door and all white light graceful
paused on the threshold A quiver ran through Lavrtzkys limbs

Lizaburst from his lips in barely audible tones

She started and began to stare into the darkness

Lizarepeated Lavrtzky more loudly and emerged from the shadow of
the avenue

Liza in alarm stretched forth her head and staggered backward He
called her for the third time and held out his arms toward her She left
the door and advanced into the garden

Is it youshe saidAre you here

It is I  I  listen to mewhispered Lavrtzky and grasping
her hand he led her to the bench

She followed him without resistance her pale face her impassive eyes
all her movements were expressive of unutterable amazement Lavrtzky
seated her on the bench and himself took up his stand in front of her

I had no thought of coming hitherhe beganI came hither by
chance I  I  I love youhe said with involuntary terror

Liza slowly glanced at him apparently she had only that moment
comprehended where she was and that she was with him She tried to rise
but could not and covered her face with her hands

Lizasaid LavrtzkyLizahe repeated and bowed down at her
feet

Her shoulders began to quiver slightly the fingers of her pale hands
were pressed more tightly to her face

What is the matter with youLavrtzky uttered and caught the sound
of soft sobbing His heart turned cold He understood the meaning of
those tears Can it be that you love mehe whispered and touched her
knee

Rise he heard her voicerise Fedor Ivnitch What is this that
you and I are doing

He rose and seated himself by her side on the bench She was no longer
weeping but was gazing attentively at him with her wet eyes

I am frightened what are we doingshe repeated

I love youhe said againI am ready to give the whole of my life
to you

Again she shuddered as though something had stung her and raised her
gaze heavenward

All this is in Gods powershe said

But do you love me Liza Shall we be happy

She dropped her eyes he softly drew her to him and her head sank upon
his shoulder He turned her head a little to one side and touched her
pale lips

                                                

Half an hour later Lavrtzky was standing before the wicket He found
it locked and was obliged to leap across the fence He returned to the
town and walked through the sleeping streets A sensation of great of
unexpected happiness filled his soul all doubts had died within him
Vanish past dark spectre he thought she loves me she will be
mine All at once it seemed to him that in the air over his head
wondrous triumphant sounds rang out the sounds rolled on still more
magnificently in a chanting mighty flood they streamed onand in
them so it seemed all his happiness was speaking and singing He
glanced around him the sounds were floating from two upper windows of a
tiny house

Lemmcried Lavrtzky and ran to the houseLemm Lemmhe
repeated loudly

The sounds died away and the figure of the old man in his dressinggown
with breast bare and hair dishevelled made its appearance at the
window

Ahahe said with dignityis that you

Christofr Fedoritch what splendid music For Gods sake let me
in

The old man without uttering a word with a majestic movement of the arm
flung the doorkey out of the window into the street Lavrtzky briskly
ran upstairs entered the room and was on the point of rushing at Lemm
but the latter imperiously motioned him to a chair he said abruptly in
Russian Sit down and listen seated himself at the piano gazed
proudly and sternly about him and began to play It was long since
Lavrtzky had heard anything of the sort a sweet passionate melody
which gripped the heart from its very first notes it was all beaming and
languishing with inspiration with happiness with beauty it swelled and
melted away it touched everything which exists on earth of precious
mysterious holy it breathed forth deathless sadness and floated away
to die in heaven Lavrtzky straightened himself up and stood there
cold and pale with rapture Those sounds fairly sank into his soul which
had only just been shaken with the bliss of love they themselves were
flaming with love Repeat ithe whispered as soon as the last chord
resounded The old man cast upon him an eagle glance struck his breast
with his hand and saying deliberately in his native languageI made
that for I am a great musicianhe again played his wonderful
composition There was no candle in the room the light of the rising
moon fell aslant through the window the sensitive air trembled
resonantly the pale little room seemed a sanctuary and the head of the
old man rose high and inspired in the silvery semidarkness Lavrtzky
approached and embraced him At first Lemm did not respond to his
embrace he even repulsed it with his elbow for a long time without
moving a single limb he continued to gaze forth as before sternly
almost roughly and only bellowed a couple of times Aha At last his
transfigured face grew calm relaxed and in reply to Lavrtzkys warm
congratulations he first smiled a little then fell to weeping feebly
sobbing like a child

This is marvelloushe saidthat precisely you should now have
come but I knowI know all

You know allejaculated Lavrtzky in confusion

You have heard mereturned Lemmhave not you understood that I
know all

Lavrtzky could not get to sleep until the morning all night long he
sat on his bed And Liza did not sleep she prayed




                                  XXXV


The reader knows how Lavrtzky had grown up and developed let us say a
few words about Lizas bringing up She was ten years old when her father
died but he had paid little heed to her Overwhelmed with business
constantly absorbed in increasing his property splenetic harsh
impatient he furnished money unsparingly for teachers tutors clothing
and the other wants of the children but he could not endure as he
expressed it to dandle the squalling bratsand he had no time to
dandle them he worked toiled over his business slept little
occasionally played cards worked again he compared himself to a horse
harnessed to a threshingmachine My life has rushed by fast he said
on his deathbed with a proud smile on his parched lips Mrya
Dmtrievna in reality troubled herself about Liza hardly more than did
the father although she had boasted to Lavrtzky that she alone had
reared her children she had dressed Liza like a doll in the presence of
visitors had patted her on the head and called her to her face a
clever child and a darlingand that was all any regular care wearied
the lazy gentlewoman During her fathers lifetime Liza had been in the
hands of a governess Mlle Moreau from Paris and after his death she
had passed into the charge of Mrfa Timofevna The reader is
acquainted with Mrfa Timofevna but Mlle Moreau was a tiny wrinkled
creature with birdlike ways and a tiny birdlike mind In her youth she
had led a very dissipated life and in her riper years she had but two
passions leftfor dainties and for cards When she was gorged was not
playing cards and not chattering her face instantly assumed an almost
deathlike expression she would sit and gaze and breathe and it was
evident that no thought was passing through her head It was not even
possible to call her goodnatured there are also birds which are not
goodnatured Whether it was in consequence of her frivolouslyspent
youth or of the Paris air which she had breathed since her
childhoodshe harboured within her a certain cheap general scepticism
which is usually expressed by the words tout a cest des btises
She talked an irregular but purely Parisian jargon did not gossip was
not capriciousand what more could be desired in a governess On Liza
she had little influence all the more powerful upon her was the
influence of her nurse Agfya Vlsievna

The lot of this woman was remarkable She sprang from a peasant family
at the age of sixteen they married her to a peasant but there was a
sharp distinction between her and her sisterpeasant women For twenty
years her father had been the village elder had accumulated a good deal
of money and had petted her She was a wonderful beauty the most
dashinglyelegant peasant maid in all the country round about clever a
good talker daring Her master Dmtry Pstoff the father of Mrya
Dmtrievna a modest quiet man caught sight of her one day at the
threshing talked with her and fell passionately in love with her

Soon afterward she became a widow Pstoff although he was a married
man took her into his house and clothed her in the style of a
houseservant Agfya immediately accommodated herself to her new
position exactly as though she had never lived in any other way Her
skin became white she grew plump her arms under their muslin sleeves
became like fine wheat flour like those of a cook the samovr stood
constantly on her table she would wear nothing but velvet and silk she
slept on a featherbed of down This blissful life lasted for the space
of five years but Dmtry Pstoff died his widow a goodnatured
gentlewoman desirous of sparing her husbands memory was not willing to
behave dishonourably toward her rival the more so as Agfya had never
forgotten herself before her but she married her to the cowherd and
sent her out of her sight Three years passed Once on a hot summer day
the lady of the manor went to her dairy Agfya treated her to such
splendid cold cream bore herself so modestly and was so neat in person
and so cheerful and satisfied with everything that her mistress
announced to her her pardon and permitted her to come to the
manorhouse and six months later she had become so attached to her
that she promoted her to the post of housekeeper and entrusted the
entire management to her Again Agfya came into power again she grew
plump and whiteskinned her mistress had complete confidence in her In
this manner five more years elapsed Again misfortune fell upon Agfya
Her husband whom she had had raised to the post of footman took to
drink began to disappear from the house and wound up by stealing six of
the familys silver spoons and hiding themuntil a convenient
opportunityin his wifes chest This was discovered He was again
degraded to the rank of cowherd and a sentence of disgrace was
pronounced upon Agfya she was not banished from the house but she was
reduced from the place of housekeeper to that of seamstress and ordered
to wear a kerchief on her head instead of a cap To the amazement of
all Agfya accepted the blow which had overtaken her with humble
submission She was then over thirty years of age all her children had
died and her husband did not long survive The time had arrived for her
to come to a sense of her position she did so She became very taciturn
and devout never missed a single Matins service nor a single Liturgy
and gave away all her fine clothes Fifteen years she spent quietly
peacefully with dignity quarrelling with no one yielding to every one
If any one spoke rudely to hershe merely bowed and returned thanks
for the lesson Her mistress had forgiven her long since had removed the
ban from her and had given her a cap from her own head but she herself
refused to remove her kerchief and always went about in a darkhued
gown and after the death of her mistress she became still more quiet
and humble A Russian easily conceives fear and affection but it is
difficult to win his respect it is not soon given nor to every one
Every one in the house respected Agfya no one even recalled her former
sins as though they had been buried in the earth along with the old
master

When Kaltin became the husband of Mrya Dmtrievna he wished to
entrust the housekeeping to Agfya but she declined because of the
temptation he roared at her she made him a lowly reverence and left
the room The clever Kaltin understood people and he also understood
Agfya and did not forget her On removing his residence to the town
he appointed her with her own consent as nurse to Liza who had just
entered her fifth year

At first Liza was frightened by the serious and stern face of her new
nurse but she speedily became accustomed to her and conceived a strong
affection for her She herself was a serious child her features recalled
the clearcut regular face of Kaltin only she had not her fathers
eyes hers beamed with a tranquil attention and kindness which are rare
in children She did not like to play with dolls her laughter was
neither loud nor long she bore herself with decorum She was not often
thoughtful and was never so without cause after remaining silent for a
time she almost always ended by turning to some one of her elders with
a question which showed that her brain was working over a new impression
She very early ceased to lisp and already in her fourth year she spoke
with perfect distinctness She was afraid of her father her feeling
toward her mother was undefinedshe did not fear her neither did she
fondle her but she did not fondle Agfya either although she loved
only her alone Agfya and she were never separated It was strange to
see them together Agfya all in black with a dark kerchief on her
head with a face thin and transparent as wax yet still beautiful and
expressive would sit upright engaged in knitting a stocking at her
feet in a little armchair sat Liza also toiling over some sort of
work or with her bright eyes uplifted gravely listening to what
Agfya was relating to her and Agfya did not tell her fairystories
in a measured even voice she would narrate the life of the Mostpure
Virgin the lives of the hermits the saints of God of the holy martyrs
she would tell Liza how the holy men lived in the deserts how they
worked out their salvation endured hunger and wantand fearing not
kings confessed Christ how the birds of heaven brought them food and
the wild beasts obeyed them how on those spots where their blood fell
flowers sprang upYellow violetsone day asked Liza who was very
fond of flowers Agfya talked gravely and meekly to Liza as though
she felt that it was not for her to utter such lofty and sacred words
Liza listened to herand the image of the Omnipresent Omniscient God
penetrated into her soul with a certain sweet power filled her with
pure devout awe and Christ became for her a person close to her almost
a relative and Agfya taught her to pray Sometimes she woke Liza
early at daybreak hastily dressed her and surreptitiously took her to
Matins Liza followed her on tiptoe hardly breathing the chill and
semiobscurity of the dawn the freshness and emptiness of the streets
the very mysteriousness of these unexpected absences the cautious return
to the house to bedall this mingling of the forbidden the strange
the holy agitated the little girl penetrated into the very depths of
her being Agfya never condemned anybody and did not scold Liza for
her pranks When she was displeased over anything she simply held her
peace and Liza understood that silence with the swift perspicacity of a
child she also understood very well when Agfya was displeased with
other peoplewith Mrya Dmtrievna herself or with Kaltin Agfya
took care of Liza for a little more than three years she was replaced by
Mlle Moreau but the frivolous Frenchwoman with her harsh manners and
her exclamation tout a cest des btisescould not erase from
Lizas heart her beloved nurse the seeds which had been sown had struck
down roots too deep Moreover Agfya although she had ceased to have
charge of Liza remained in the house and often saw her nursling who
confided in her as before

But Agfya could not get along with Mrfa Timofevna when the latter
came to live in the Kaltin house The stern dignity of the former
peasant woman did not please the impatient and selfwilled old woman
Agfya begged permission to go on a pilgrimage and did not return Dark
rumours circulated to the effect that she had withdrawn to a convent of
Old Ritualists But the traces left by her in Lizas soul were not
effaced As before the latter went to the Liturgy as to a festival
prayed with delight with a certain repressed and bashful enthusiasm
which secretly amazed Mrya Dmtrievna not a little although she put
no constraint upon Liza but merely endeavoured to moderate her zeal and
did not permit her to make an excessive number of prostrations that was
not ladylike manners she said Liza studied wellthat is to say
assiduously God had not endowed her with particularly brilliant
capacities with a great mind she acquired nothing without labour She
played well on the piano but Lemm alone knew what it cost her She read
little she had no words of her own but she had thoughts of her own
and she went her own way It was not for nothing that she resembled her
father he also had not been wont to ask others what he should do Thus
she grew upquietly at leisure thus she attained her nineteenth year
She was very pretty without herself being aware of the fact An
unconscious rather awkward grace revealed itself in her every movement
her voice rang with the silvery sound of unaffected youth the slightest
sensation of pleasure evoked a winning smile on her lips imparted a deep
gleam and a certain mysterious caress to her sparkling eyes Thoroughly
imbued with the sense of duty with the fear of wounding any one
whatsoever with a kind and gentle heart she loved every one in general
and no one in particular God alone she loved with rapture timidly
tenderly Lavrtzky was the first to break in upon her tranquil inner
life

Such was Liza




                                  XXXVI


At twelve oclock on the following day Lavrtzky set out for the
Kaltins On the way thither he met Pnshin who galloped past him on
horseback with his hat pulled down to his very eyebrows At the
Kaltins Lavrtzky was not admittedfor the first time since he had
known them Mrya Dmtrievna was lying downso the lackey
announced they had a headache Neither Mrfa Timofevna nor
Lizavta Mikhalovna was at home Lavrtzky strolled along the garden
in anxious hope of meeting Liza but saw no one He returned a couple of
hours later and received the same answer in connection with which the
lackey bestowed a sidelong glance upon him It seemed to Lavrtzky
impolite to intrude himself upon them for a third time that dayand he
decided to drive out to Vaslievskoe where without reference to this
he had business to attend to On the way he constructed various plans
each more beautiful than the other but in his aunts hamlet sadness
fell upon him he entered into conversation with Antn the old man as
though expressly had nothing but cheerless thoughts in his mind He
narrated to Lavrtzky how Glafra Petrvna before her death had
bitten her own handand after a short pause he added Every man
masterdear little father is given to devouring himself It was
already late when Lavrtzky set out on the return journey The sounds of
the preceding day took possession of him the image of Liza arose in his
soul in all its gentle transparency he melted at the thought that she
loved himand drove up to his little townhouse in a composed and happy
frame of mind

The first thing which struck him on entering the anteroom was the scent
of patchouli which was very repulsive to him several tall trunks and
coffers were standing there The face of the valet who ran forth to
receive him seemed to him strange Without accounting to himself for his
impressions he crossed the threshold of the drawingroom From the
couch there rose to greet him a lady in a black gown with flounces and
raising a batiste handkerchief to her pale face she advanced several
paces bent her carefullydressed headand fell at his feet Then
only did he recognise her the lady washis wife

It took his breath away He leaned against the wall

Theodore do not drive me awayshe said in French and her voice cut
his heart like a knife

He glanced at her without comprehending yet he immediately noticed that
she had grown pale and thin

Theodoreshe went on from time to time raising her eyes and
cautiously wringing her wondrouslybeautiful fingers with rosy polished
nailsTheodore I am to blame toward you deeply to blameI will say
more I am a criminal but do you listen to me repentance tortures me I
have become a burden to myself I could not longer endure my position
how many times have I meditated returning to you but I feared your
wrathI have decided to break every connection with the past  puis
jai t si maladeI have been so illshe added and passed her
hand across her brow and her cheekI have taken advantage of the
rumour of my death which had got into circulation I have abandoned
everything without halting day and night I have hastened hither I have
hesitated for a long time to present myself before you my
judgeparatre devant vous mon jugebut at last I made up my
mind remembering your invariable kindness to come to you I learned
your address in Moscow Believe me she continued softly rising from
the floor and seating herself on the very edge of an armchairI have
often meditated death and I would have summoned up sufficient courage to
take my lifeakh life is now an intolerable burden to mebut the
thought of my daughter of my dotchka held me back she is here she
is asleep in the adjoining room poor child She is wearyyou shall see
her she at least is not guilty toward youand I am so unhappy so
unhappyexclaimed Mme Lavrtzky and burst into tears

Lavrtzky came to himself at last he separated himself from the wall
and moved toward the door

You are going awaysaid his wife in despairoh this is
cruelWithout saying one word to me without even one reproach This
scorn is killing me this is terrible

Lavrtzky stopped short

What is it that you wish to hear from mehe uttered in a toneless
voice

Nothing nothingshe caught him up with vivacityI know that I
have no right to demand anythingI am not a fool believe meI do not
hope I do not dare to hope for your forgivenessI only venture to
entreat you that you will give me directions what I am to do where I am
to liveI will fulfil your command whatever it may be like a slave

I have no commands to give youreturned Lavrtzky in the same
voiceyou know that everything is at an end between us  and now
more than everYou may live where you see fitand if your allowance
is insufficient

Akh do not utter such dreadful wordsVarvra Pvlovna interrupted
himspare me if only  if only for the sake of that angel And
as she said these words Varvra Pvlovna flew headlong into the next
room and immediately returned with a tiny very elegantly dressed little
girl in her arms Heavy ruddygold curls fell over her pretty rosy
little face over her large black sleepy eyes she smiled and blinked
at the light and clung with her chubby hand to her mothers neck

Ada vois cest ton presaid Varvra Pvlovna pushing the
curls aside from her eyes and giving her a hearty kissprie le avec
moi

Cest a papalisped the little girl brokenly

Oui mon enfant nest ce pas que tu laimes

But this was too much for Lavrtzky

In what melodrama is it that there is precisely such a scenehe
muttered and left the room

Varvra Pvlovna stood for a while rooted to the spot slightly
shrugged her shoulders carried the little girl into the other room
undressed her and put her to bed Then she got a book sat down near the
lamp waited for about an hour and at last lay down on the bed
herself

Eh bien madameinquired her maid a Frenchwoman whom she had
brought from Paris as she removed her corsets

Eh bien Justineshe repliedhe has aged greatly but it strikes
me that he is as goodnatured as everGive me my gloves for the night
prepare my highnecked grey gown for tomorrow and do not forget the
mutton chops for Ada Really it will be difficult to obtain them
here but we must make the effort

 la guerre comme  la guerreresponded Justine and put out the
light




                                 XXXVII


For more than two hours Lavrtzky roamed about the streets of the town
The night which he had spent in the suburbs of Paris recurred to his
mind His heart swelled to bursting within him and in his head which
was empty and as it were stunned the same set of thoughts kept
swirlingdark wrathful evil thoughts She is alive she is here he
whispered with constantly augmenting amazement He felt that he had lost
Liza Bile choked him this blow had struck him too suddenly How could
he so lightly have believed the absurd gossip of a feuilleton a scrap of
paper Well and if I had not believed it what difference would that
have made I should not have known that Liza loves me she herself would
not have known it He could not banish from himself the form the voice
the glances of his wife  and he cursed himself cursed everything in
the world

Worn out he arrived toward morning at Lemms For a long time he could
produce no effect with his knocking at last the old mans head in a
nightcap made its appearance in the window sour wrinkled no longer
bearing the slightest resemblance to that inspiredlymorose head which
four and twenty hours previously had gazed on Lavrtzky from the full
height of its artistic majesty

What do you wantinquired LemmI cannot play every night I have
taken a decoctionBut evidently Lavrtzkys face was very strange
the old man made a shield for his eyes out of his hands stared at his
nocturnal visitor and admitted him

Lavrtzky entered the room and sank down on a chair the old man halted
in front of him with the skirts of his motleyhued old dressinggown
tucked up writhing and mumbling with his lips

My wife has arrivedsaid Lavrtzky raising his head and suddenly
breaking into an involuntary laugh

Lemms face expressed surprise but he did not even smile and only
wrapped himself more closely in his dressinggown

You see you do not knowwent on LavrtzkyI imagined  I read
in a newspaper that she was no longer alive

Oo you read that a short time agoasked Lemm

Yes

Oorepeated the old man and elevated his eyebrowsAnd she has
arrived

Yes She is now at my house but I  I am an unhappy man

And again he broke into a laugh

You are an unhappy manrepeated Lemm slowly

Christofr Fedoritchbegan Lavrtzkywill you undertake to
deliver a note

Hm May I inquire to whom

To Liza

Ahyes yes I understand Very well But when must the note be
delivered

Tomorrow as early as possible

Hm I can send Katrina my cook No I will go myself

And will you bring me the answer

Yes I will

Lemm sighed

Yes my poor young friend you really arean unhappy man

Lavrtzky wrote a couple of words to Liza he informed her of his wifes
arrival begged her to appoint a meetingand flung himself on the
narrow divan face to the wall and the old man lay down on the bed and
tossed about for a long time coughing and taking sips of his decoction

Morning came they both rose With strange eyes they gazed at each other
Lavrtzky wanted to kill himself at that moment The cook Katrina
brought them some bad coffee The clock struck eight Lemm put on his
hat and saying that he had a lesson to give at the Kaltins at nine
but that he would find a decent pretext set out Lavrtzky again flung
himself on the little couch and again from the depths of his soul a
sorrowful laugh welled up He thought of how his wife had driven him out
of his house he pictured to himself Lizas position closed his eyes
and threw his hands behind his head At last Lemm returned and brought
him a scrap of paper on which Liza had scrawled with pencil the
following words We cannot see each other today perhapstomorrow
evening Farewell Lavrtzky quietly and abstractedly thanked Lemm and
went to his own house

He found his wife at breakfast Ada all curls in a white frock with
blue ribbons was eating a mutton chop Varvra Pvlovna immediately
rose as soon as Lavrtzky entered the room and approached him with
humility depicted on her face He requested her to follow him to his
study locked the door behind him and began to stride to and fro she
sat down laid one hand modestly on the other and began to watch him
with her still beautiful although slightly painted eyes

For a long time Lavrtzky did not speak he felt that he could not
control himself he perceived clearly that Varvra Pvlovna was not in
the least afraid of him but was assuming the air of being on the very
verge of falling into a swoon

Listen madamhe began at last breathing heavily at times grinding
his teeththere is no necessity for our dissembling with each other I
do not believe in your repentance and even if it were genuine it is
impossible for me to become reconciled to you to live with you again

Varvra Pvlovna compressed her lips and narrowed her eyes This is
disgustshe thoughtof course I am no longer even a woman to him

It is impossiblerepeated Lavrtzky and buttoned up his coat to the
throatI do not know why you have taken it into your head to come
hither probably you have no money left

Alas you are insulting mewhispered Varvra Pvlovna

However that may beyou are unhappily my wife nevertheless I
cannot turn you out  and this is what I have to propose to you You
may set out this very day if you like for Lavrki and live there
the house is good as you know you will receive all that is necessary
in addition to your allowance Do you agree

Varvra Pvlovna raised her embroidered handkerchief to her eyes

I have already told youshe said her lips twitching nervouslythat
I shall agree to anything whatever you may see fit to do with me on this
occasion nothing is left for me to do except to ask you will you permit
me at least to thank you for your magnanimity

No gratitude I beg of you it is better sohastily returned
LavrtzkyAccordinglyhe went on approaching the doorI may
count upon

Tomorrow I shall be at Lavrkisaid Varvra Pvlovna respectfully
rising from her seatBut Fedor Ivnitch she no longer called him
Theodore

What do you want

I know that I have as yet in no way earned my forgiveness may I hope
at least in time

Ekh Varvra PvlovnaLavrtzky interrupted heryou are a
clever woman and as I am not a fool I know that that is quite
unnecessary for you And I forgave you long ago but there was always a
gulf between us

I shall know how to submitreplied Varvra Pvlovna and bowed her
head I have not forgotten my fault I should not be surprised to learn
that you were even delighted at the news of my deathshe added gently
pointing slightly with her hand at the copy of the newspaper which lay on
the table forgotten by Lavrtzky

Fedor Ivnitch shuddered the feuilleton was marked with a pencil
Varvra Pvlovna gazed at him with still greater humility She was very
pretty at that moment Her grey Paris gown gracefully clothed her willowy
form which was almost that of a girl of seventeen her slender delicate
neck encircled with a white collar her bosom which rose and fell evenly
her arms devoid of bracelets and ringsher whole figure from her
shining hair to the tip of her barely revealed little boot was so
elegant

Lavrtzky swept an angry glance over her came near exclaiming Brava
came near smiting her in the temple with his fistand left the room An
hour later he had already set out for Vaslievskoe and two hours
later Varvra Pvlovna gave orders that the best carriage in town
should be engaged donned a simple straw hat with a black veil and a
modest mantle entrusted Ada to Justine and set out for the Kaltins
from the inquiries instituted by her servant she had learned that her
husband was in the habit of going to them every day




                                 XXXVIII


The day of the arrival of Lavrtzkys wife in town of O    a
cheerless day for him was also a painful day for Liza She had not
succeeded in going downstairs and bidding her mother good morning
before the trampling of a horses hoofs resounded under the window and
with secret terror she beheld Pnshin riding into the yard He has
presented himself thus early for a definitive explanationshe
thoughtand she was not mistaken after spending a while in the
drawingroom he suggested that she should go with him into the garden
and demanded her decision as to his fate Liza summoned up her courage
and informed him that she could not be his wife He listened to her to
the end as he stood with his side toward her and his hat pulled down on
his brows courteously but in an altered tone he asked her was that
her last word and had he in any way given her cause for such a change
in her ideas then he pressed his hand to his eyes sighed briefly and
abruptly and removed his hand from his face

I have not wished to follow the beaten pathhe said in a dull
voiceI have wished to find my companion after the inclination of the
heart but evidently that was not destined to be Farewell dreamHe
bowed profoundly to Liza and returned to the house

She hoped that he would immediately take his departure but he went into
Mrya Dmtrievnas boudoir and sat with her for about an hour As he
went away he said to Liza Votre mre vous appelle adieu  jamais
 mounted his horse and set off from the very porch at full gallop
Liza went in to Mrya Dmtrievna and found her in tears Pnshin had
communicated to her his misfortune

Why hast thou killed me Why hast thou killed mein this wise did the
mortified widow begin her complaintsWhom else didst thou want What
is not he a suitable husband for thee A Junior Gentleman of the
Emperors Bedchamber not interessant He might marry any Maid of
Honour he chose in Petersburg And II had been hoping so And hast thou
changed long toward him What has sent this cloud drifting hitherit did
not come of itself Can it be that ninny A pretty counsellor thou hast
found

And he my dear onepursued Mrya Dmtrievnahow respectful how
attentive even in his own grief He has promised not to abandon me Akh
I shall not survive this Akh I have got a deadly headache Send
Palsha to me Thou wilt be the death of me if thou dost not change thy
minddost thou hear And calling her an ingrate a couple of times
Mrya Dmtrievna sent Liza away

She went to her own room But before she had time to recover her breath
from her explanation with Pnshin and her mother another thunderstorm
broke over her and this time from a quarter whence she had least
expected it Mrfa Timofevna entered her room and immediately slammed
the door behind her The old womans face was pale her cap was awry her
eyes were flashing her hands and lips were trembling Liza was amazed
never before had she seen her sensible and reasonable aunt in such a
state

Very fine madambegan Mrfa Timofevna in a tremulous and broken
whisper very fine indeed From whom hast thou learned this my
mother Give me water I cannot speak

Calm yourself aunty what is the matter with yousaid Liza giving
her a glass of waterWhy you yourself did not favour Mr Pnshin

Mrfa Timofevna set down the glass

I cannot drink I shall knock out my last remaining teeth What dost
thou mean by Panshn What has Panshn to do with it Do thou tell me
rather who taught thee to appoint rendezvous by nighthey my mother

Liza turned pale

Please do not think of excusing thyselfcontinued Mrfa
TimofevnaSchrotchka herself saw all and told me I have
forbidden her to chatter but she does not lie

I have made no excuses auntysaid Liza in a barely audible voice

Ah ah Now see here my mother didst thou appoint a meeting with him
with that old sinner that quiet man

No

Then how did it come about

I went downstairs to the drawingroom for a book he was in the
garden and called me

And thou wentest Very fine And thou lovest him dost thou not

Gracious heavens she loves himMrfa Timofevna tore off her
capShe loves a married man Hey she loves

He told me that his wife was dead

Mrfa Timofevna crossed herselfThe kingdom of heaven be

Mrfa Timofevna departed but Liza sat down in the corner and began to
cry She felt bitter in soul she had not deserved such humiliation Her
love had not announced its presence by cheerfulness this was the second
time she had wept since the night before That new unexpected feeling
had barely come to life in her heart when she had had to pay so heavily
for it when strange hands had roughly touched her private secret She
felt ashamed and pained and bitter but there was neither doubt nor
terror in herand Lavrtzky became all the dearer to her She had
hesitated as long as she did not understand herself but after that
meetingshe could hesitate no longer she knew that she lovedand had
fallen in love honourably not jestingly she had become strongly
attached for her whole life she felt that force could not break that
bond




                                  XXXIX


Mrya Dmtrievna was greatly perturbed when the arrival of Varvra
Pvlovna was announced to her she did not even know whether to receive
her she was afraid of offending Fedor Ivnitch At last curiosity
carried the day What of itshe said to herselfwhy she is a
relative alsoand seating herself in her armchair she said to the
lackey Ask her in Several minutes elapsed the door opened Varvra
Pvlovna approached Mrya Dmtrievna swiftly with barely audible
footsteps and without giving her a chance to rise from her chair
almost went down on her knees before her

Thank you auntyshe began in a touched and gentle voice in Russian
thank you I had not hoped for such condescension on your part you are
as kind as an angel

As she uttered these words Varvra Pvlovna unexpectedly took
possession of one of Mrya Dmtrievnas hands and pressing it lightly
in her palelilac gloves obsequiously raised it to her full rosy lips
Mrya Dmtrievna completely lost her head on beholding such a
beautiful charminglydressed woman almost on her knees at her feet she
did not know what to do she did not wish to withdraw her hand she
wished to give her a seat and to say something amiable to her she ended
by rising and kissing Varvra Pvlovna on her smooth fragrant brow
Varvra Pvlovna was perfectly dumfounded by this kiss

Good morningbon joursaid Mrya Dmtrievnaof course I had
no idea  however of course I am delighted to see you You
understand my dearit is not for me to sit in judgment between wife
and husband

My husband is wholly in the rightVarvra Pvlovna interrupted
herI alone am to blame

That is a very praiseworthy sentimentreturned Mrya
Dmtrievnavery Have you been here long Have you seen him But sit
down pray

I arrived yesterdayreplied Varvra Pvlovna meekly seating
herself on a chair I have seen Fedor Ivnitch I have talked with
him

Ah Well and how does he take it

I was afraid that my sudden arrival would arouse his wrathwent on
Varvra Pvlovnabut he did not deprive me of his presence

That is to say he did not Yes yes I understandejaculated
Mrya DmtrievnaHe is only rather rough in appearance but his
heart is soft

Fedor Ivnitch has not forgiven me he would not listen to me But
he was so kind as to appoint Lavrki for my place of residence

Ah A very fine estate

I set out thither tomorrow in compliance with his will but I
considered it my duty to call on you first

I am very very grateful to you my dear One must never forget ones
relatives And do you know I am astonished that you speak Russian so
well Cest tonnant

Varvra Pvlovna sighed

I have spent too much time abroad Mrya Dmtrievna I know that but
my heart has always been Russian and I have not forgotten my native
land

Exactly so exactly so that is the best of all Fedor Ivnitch
however did not in the least expect you Yes believe my experience
la patrie avant tout Akh please show mewhat a charming mantle that
is you have on

Do you like itVarvra Pvlovna promptly dropped it from her
shouldersIt is a very simple thing from Madame Baudran

That is instantly perceptible From Madame Baudran How charming and
what taste I am convinced that you have brought with you a mass of the
most entrancing things I should like to look them over

My entire toilette is at your service my dearest aunt If you will
permit I can give your maid some points I have a maidservant from
Parisa wonderful seamstress

You are very kind my dear But really I am ashamed

Ashamed  repeated Varvra Pvlovna reproachfullyIf you wish
to make me happycommand me as though I belonged to you

Mrya Dmtrievna thawed

Vous tes charmante she saidBut why do not you take off your
bonnet your gloves

What You permitasked Varvra Pvlovna clasping her hands as
though with emotion

Of course for you will dine with us I hope I  I will introduce you
to my daughterMrya Dmtrievna became slightly confused Well
here goesshe said to herselfShe is not quite well today

Oh ma tante how kind you areexclaimed Varvra Pvlovna and
raised her handkerchief to her eyes

A page announced the arrival of Gedenovsky The old chatterbox entered
made his bows and smiled Mrya Dmtrievna presented him to her
visitor He came near being discomfited at first but Varvra Pvlovna
treated him with such coquettish respect that his ears began to burn
and fibs scandals amiable remarks trickled out of his mouth like honey
Varvra Pvlovna listened to him with a repressed smile and became
rather talkative herself She modestly talked about Paris about her
travels about Baden twice she made Mrya Dmtrievna laugh and on
each occasion she heaved another little sigh as though she were mentally
reproaching herself for her illtimed mirth she asked permission to
bring Ada removing her gloves she showed with her smooth hands washed
with soap  la guimauve how and where flounces ruches lace and
knots of ribbon were worn she promised to bring a phial of the new
English perfume Victorias Essence and rejoiced like a child when
Mrya Dmtrievna consented to accept it as a gift she wept at the
remembrance of the feeling she had experienced when for the first time
she had heard the Russian bellsso profoundly did they stagger my very
heartshe said

At that moment Liza entered

From the morning from the very moment when chilled with terror she had
perused Lavrtzkys note Liza had been preparing herself to meet his
wife she had a presentiment that she should see her by way of
punishment to her own criminal hopes as she called them She had made up
her mind not to shun her The sudden crisis in her fate had shaken her to
the very foundations in the course of about two hours her face had grown
haggard but she did not shed a tear It serves me rightshe said to
herself with difficulty and agitation suppressing in her soul certain
bitter spiteful impulses which alarmed even herselfCome I must go
downshe thought as soon as she heard of Mme Lavrtzkys arrival
and she went For a long time she stood outside the door of the
drawingroom before she could bring herself to open it with the
thought I am to blame toward hershe crossed the threshold and
forced herself to look at her forced herself to smile Varvra
Pvlovna advanced to meet her as soon as she saw her and made a slight
but nevertheless respectful inclination before herAllow me to
introduce myselfshe began in an insinuating voiceyour maman is
so indulgent toward me that I hope you will also be  kind The
expression on Varvra Pvlovnas face as she uttered this last word
her sly smile her cold and at the same time soft glance the movement of
her arms and shoulders her very gown her whole being aroused in Liza
such a feeling of repulsion that she could make her no answer and with
an effort she offered her hand This young lady despises methought
Varvra Pvlovna as she warmly pressed Lizas cold fingers and
turning to Mrya Dmtrievna she said in an undertone Mais elle est
dlicieuse Liza flushed faintly insult was audible to her in this
exclamation but she made up her mind not to trust her impressions and
seated herself by the window at her embroideryframe Even there
Varvra Pvlovna did not leave her in peace she went up to her began
to praise her taste her art Lizas heart beat violently and
painfully she could hardly control herself she could hardly sit still
on her chair It seemed to her that Varvra Pvlovna knew everything
and secretly triumphing was jeering at her Fortunately for her
Gedenovsky entered into conversation with Varvra Pvlovna and
distracted her attention Liza bent over her embroideryframe and
stealthily watched her He loved that womanshe said to herself
But she immediately banished from her head the thought of Lavrtzky she
was afraid of losing control over herself she felt that her head was
softly whirling Mrya Dmtrievna began to talk about music

I have heard my dearshe beganthat you are a wonderful
performer

It is a long time since I have playedreplied Varvra Pvlovna as
she seated herself in a leisurely manner at the piano and ran her
fingers in a dashing way over the keysWould you like to have me
play

Pray do

Varvra Pvlovna played a brilliant and difficult tude of Herz in a
masterly style She had a great deal of strength and execution

A sylphexclaimed Gedenovsky

Remarkableassented Mrya DmtrievnaWell Varvra Pvlovna I
must confessshe said calling her for the first time by her
nameyou have amazed me you might even give concerts We have an old
musician here a German an eccentric fellow very learned he gives Liza
lessons he will simply go out of his mind over you

Lizavta Mikhalovna is also a musicianinquired Varvra
Pvlovna turning her head slightly in her direction

Yes she plays quite well and loves music but what does that signify
in comparison with you But there is a young man here you ought to make
his acquaintance He isan artist in soul and composes very prettily
He is the only one who can fully appreciate you

A young mansaid Varvra PvlovnaWho is he Some poor fellow

Good gracioushes our chief cavalier and not among us onlyet 
Ptersbourg A Junior Gentleman of the Bedchamber received in the best
society You certainly must have heard of himPnshin Vladmir
Nikolitch He is here on a government commission  a future Minister
upon my word

And an artist

An artist in soul and such a charming fellow You shall see him He has
been at my house very frequently of late I have invited him for this
evening I hope that he will comeadded Mrya Dmtrievna with a
gentle sigh and a sidelong bitter smile

Liza understood the significance of that smile but she cared nothing for
it

And is he youngrepeated Varvra Pvlovna lightly modulating from
one key to another

He is eight and twentyand of the most happy personal appearance Un
jeune homme accompli upon my word

A model young man one may sayremarked Gedenovsky

Varvra Pvlovna suddenly began to play a noisy Strauss waltz which
started with such a mighty and rapid trill as made even Gedenovsky
start in the very middle of the waltz she abruptly changed into a
mournful motif and wound up with the aria from Lucia Fra poco
She had reflected that merry music was not compatible with her situation
The aria from Lucia with emphasis on the sentimental notes greatly
affected Mrya Dmtrievna

What soulshe said in a low tone to Gedenovsky

A sylphrepeated Gedenovsky and rolled his eyes heavenward

Dinnertime arrived Mrfa Timofevna came downstairs when the soup
was already standing on the table She treated Varvra Pvlovna very
coolly replying with halfwords to her amiabilities and not looking at
her Varvra Pvlovna herself speedily comprehended that she could do
nothing with the old woman and ceased to address her on the other hand
Mrya Dmtrievna became more affectionate than ever with her guest her
aunts discourtesy enraged her However Varvra Pvlovna was not the
only person at whom Mrfa Timofevna refused to look she never cast a
glance at Liza either although her eyes fairly flashed She sat like a
stone image all sallow pale with tightly compressed lipsand ate
nothing Liza seemed to be composed and as a matter of fact all had
become more tranquil in her soul a strange insensibility the
insensibility of the man condemned to death had come upon her At dinner
Varvra Pvlovna talked little she seemed to have become timid once
more and spread over her face an expression of modest melancholy
Gedenovsky alone enlivened the conversation with his tales although he
kept casting cowardly glances at Mrfa Timofevna and a cough and
tickling in the throat seized upon him every time that he undertook to
lie in her presencebut she did not hinder him she did not interrupt
him After dinner it appeared that Varvra Pvlovna was extremely fond
of preference this pleased Mrya Dmtrievna to such a degree that she
even became greatly affected and thought to herselfBut what a fool
Fedor Ivnitch must be he was not able to appreciate such a woman

She sat down to play cards with her and Gedenovsky while Mrfa
Timofevna led Liza off to her own rooms upstairs saying that she
looked ill that her head must be aching

Yes she has a frightful headachesaid Mrya Dmtrievna turning to
Varvra Pvlovna and rolling up her eyesI myself have such
sickheadaches Liza entered her aunts room and dropped on a chair
exhausted Mrfa Timofevna gazed at her for a long time in silence
knelt down softly in front of herand began in the same speechless
manner to kiss her hands in turn Liza leaned forward blushed and
fell to weeping but did not raise Mrfa Timofevna did not withdraw
her hands she felt that she had not the right to withdraw them had not
the right to prevent the old woman showing her contrition her sympathy
asking her pardon for what had taken place on the day before and Mrfa
Timofevna could not have done with kissing those poor pale helpless
handsand silent tears streamed from her eyes and from Lizas eyes and
the cat Matrs purred in the wide armchair beside the ball of yarn and
the stocking the elongated flame of the shrinelamp quivered gently and
flickered in front of the holy picturein the adjoining room behind
the door stood Nastsya Krpovna and also stealthily wiped her eyes
with a checked handkerchief rolled up into a ball




                                   XL


And in the meantime downstairs in the drawingroom preference was in
progress Mrya Dmtrievna won and was in high spirits A footman
entered and announced the arrival of Pnshin

Mrya Dmtrievna dropped her cards and fidgeted about in her chair
Varvra Pvlovna looked at her with a halfsmile then directed her gaze
to the door Pnshin made his appearance in a black frockcoat with a
tall English collar buttoned up to the throat It was painful for me to
obey but you see I have come That was what his freshlyshaved
unsmiling face expressed

Goodness Woldemarexclaimed Mrya Dmtrievnayou always used
to enter without being announced

Pnshin replied to Mrya Dmtrievna merely with a look bowed
courteously to her but did not kiss her hand She introduced him to
Varvra Pvlovna he retreated a pace bowed to her with equal
courtesy but with a shade of elegance and deference and seated himself
at the cardtable The game of preference soon came to an end Pnshin
inquired after Lizavta Mikhalovna learned that she did not feel
quite well and expressed his regrets then he entered into conversation
with Varvra Pvlovna weighing and chiselling clearly every word in
diplomatic fashion respectfully listening to her replies to the very
end But the importance of his diplomatic tone had no effect on Varvra
Pvlovna did not communicate itself to her Quite the contrary she
gazed into his face with merry attention talked in a freeandeasy way
and her delicate nostrils quivered slightly as though with suppressed
laughter Mrya Dmtrievna began to extol her talent Pnshin inclined
his head as politely as his collar permitted declared that he was
convinced of it in advanceand turned the conversation almost on
Metternich himself Varvra Pvlovna narrowed her velvety eyes and
saying in a low tone Why you also are an artist yourself un
confrreadded in a still lower tone Venezand nodded her
head in the direction of the piano That one carelessly dropped word
Venezinstantaneously as though by magic altered Pnshins
entire aspect His careworn mien vanished he smiled became animated
unbuttoned his coat and repeating What sort of an artist am I alas
But you I hear are a genuine artistwended his way in company with
Varvra Pvlovna to the piano

Make him sing his romanceWhen the moon floatsexclaimed Mrya
Dmtrievna

Do you singsaid Varvra Pvlovna illuminating him with a bright
swift glanceSit down

Pnshin began to decline

Sit downshe repeated insistently tapping the back of the chair

He sat down coughed pulled open his collar and sang his romance

Charmantsaid Varvra Pvlovnayou sing beautifully vous
avez du stylesing it again

She walked round the piano and took up her stand directly opposite
Pnshin He sang his romance again imparting a melodramatic quiver to
his voice Varvra Pvlovna gazed intently at him with her elbows
propped on the piano and her white hands on a level with her lips
Pnshin finished

Charmant charmante idesaid she with the calm confidence of an
expertTell me have you written anything for the female voice for a
mezzosoprano

I hardly write anythingreplied Pnshinyou see I only do this
sort of thing in the intervals between business affairs  but do you
sing

Yes

Oh do sing something for ussaid Mrya Dmtrievna

Varvra Pvlovna pushed back her hair from her flushed cheeks with her
hand and shook her head

Our voices ought to go well togethershe said turning to
Pnshinlet us sing a duet Do you know Son geloso or La ci
darem or Mira la bianca luna

I used to sing Mira la bianca lunareplied Pnshinbut I have
forgotten it long ago

Never mind we will try it over in an undertone Let me come

Varvra Pvlovna sat down at the piano Pnshin stood beside her They
sang the duet in an undertone Varvra Pvlovna correcting him several
times then they sang it aloud then they repeated it twice Mira la
bianca luuuna Varvra Pvlovnas voice had lost its freshness
but she managed it very adroitly Pnshin was timid at first and sang
rather out of tune but later on he warmed up and if he did not sing
faultlessly at least he wriggled his shoulders swayed his whole body and
elevated his hand now and then like a genuine singer Varvra Pvlovna
played two or three little things of Thalbergs and coquettishly recited
a French ariette Mrya Dmtrievna no longer knew how to express her
delight several times she was on the point of sending for Liza
Gedenovsky also found no words and merely rocked his headbut all of
a sudden he yawned and barely succeeded in concealing his mouth with his
hand This yawn did not escape Varvra Pvlovna she suddenly turned her
back to the piano said Assez de musique comme a let us chatand
folded her hands Oui assez de musiquemerrily repeated
Pnshinand struck up a conversation with herdaring light in the
French language Exactly as in the best Parisian salonthought Mrya
Dmtrievna as she listened to their evasive and nimble speeches Pnshin
felt perfectly contented his eyes sparkled he smiled at first he passed
his hand over his face contracted his brows and sighed spasmodically when
he chanced to meet the glances of Mrya Dmtrievna but later on he
entirely forgot her and surrendered himself completely to the enjoyment of
the halffashionable halfartistic chatter Varvra Pvlovna showed
herself to be a great philosopher she had an answer ready for everything
she did not hesitate over anything she doubted nothing it could be seen
that she had talked much and often with clever persons of various sorts
All her thoughts all her feelings circled about Paris Pnshin turned
the conversation on literature it appeared that she as well as he read
only French books Georges Sand excited her indignation Balzac she
admired although he fatigued her in Sue and Scribe she discerned great
experts of the heart she adored Dumas and Fval in her soul she
preferred Paul de Kock to the whole of them but of course she did not
even mention his name To tell the truth literature did not interest her
greatly Varvra Pvlovna very artfully avoided everything which could
even distantly recall her position there was not a hint about love in her
remarks on the contrary they were rather distinguished by severity toward
the impulses of passion by disenchantment by meekness Pnshin retorted
she disagreed with him  but strange to sayat the very time when
words of condemnation often harsh were issuing from her lips the sound
of those words caressed and enervated and her eyes said  precisely what
those lovely eyes said it would be difficult to state but their speech
was not severe not clear yet sweet Pnshin endeavoured to understand
their mysterious significance endeavoured to talk with his own eyes but
he was conscious that he was not at all successful he recognised the fact
that Varvra Pvlovna in her quality of a genuine foreign lioness stood
above him and therefore he was not in full control of himself Varvra
Pvlovna had a habit while talking of lightly touching the sleeve of her
interlocutor these momentary touches greatly agitated Vladmir
Nikolitch Varvra Pvlovna possessed the art of getting on easily with
every one two hours had not elapsed before it seemed to Pnshin that he
had known her always and Liza that same Liza whom he loved
nevertheless to whom he had offered his hand on the preceding
dayvanished as in a mist Tea was served the conversation became still
more unconstrained Mrya Dmtrievna rang for her page and ordered him
to tell Liza to come downstairs if her head felt better Pnshin on
hearing Lizas name set to talking about selfsacrifice about who was the
more capable of sacrificeman or woman Mrya Dmtrievna immediately
became agitated began to assert that woman is the more capable declared
that she would prove it in two words got entangled and wound up by a
decidedly infelicitous comparison Varvra Pvlovna picked up a
musicbook halfconcealed herself with it and leaning over in the
direction of Pnshin nibbling at a biscuit with a calm smile on her lips
and in her glance she remarked in an undertone Elle na pas invent
la poudre la bonne dame Pnshin was somewhat alarmed and amazed at
Varvra Pvlovnas audacity but he did not understand how much scorn for
him himself was concealed in that unexpected sally and forgetting the
affection and the devotion of Mrya Dmtrievna forgetting the dinners
wherewith she had fed him the money which she had lent himhe with the
same little smile the same tone replied unlucky wight Je crois
bienand not even Je crois bien butJe crois ben

Varvra Pvlovna cast a friendly glance at him and rose Liza had
entered in vain had Mrfa Timofevna sought to hold her back she had
made up her mind to endure the trial to the end Varvra Pvlovna
advanced to meet her in company with Pnshin on whose face the former
diplomatic expression had again made its appearance

How is your healthhe asked Liza

I feel better now thank youshe replied

We have been having a little music here it is a pity that you did not
hear Varvra Pvlovna She sings superbly un artiste consomme

Come here ma chrierang out Mrya Dmtrievnas voice

Varvra Pvlovna instantly with the submissiveness of a little child
went up to her and seated herself on a small tabouret at her feet
Mrya Dmtrievna had called her for the purpose of leaving her daughter
alone with Pnshin if only for a moment she still secretly cherished
the hope that the girl would come to her senses Moreover a thought had
occurred to her to which she desired to give immediate expression

Do you knowshe whispered to Varvra PvlovnaI want to make an
effort to reconcile you with your husband I do not guarantee success
but I will try You know that he has great respect for me

Varvra Pvlovna slowly raised her eyes to Mrya Dmtrievna and
clasped her hands prettily

You would be my saviour ma tanteshe said in a mournful
voiceI do not know how to thank you for all your affection but I am
too guilty toward Fedor Ivnitch he cannot forgive me

But is it possible that you  really  began Mrya Dmtrievna
with curiosity

Do not ask meVarvra Pvlovna interrupted her and dropped her
eyesI was young giddy However I do not wish to defend myself

Well nevertheless why not make the effort Do not despairreturned
Mrya Dmtrievna and was on the point of patting her on the shoulder
but glanced at her faceand grew timid She is a modest modest
creatureshe thoughtand exactly like a young girl still

Are you illPnshin was saying meanwhile to Liza

Yes I am not very well

I understand youhe said after a rather prolonged silenceYes I
understand you

How so

I understand yousignificantly repeated Pnshin who simply did not
know what to say

Liza became confused and then said to herself So be it Pnshin
assumed a mysterious air and fell silent gazing severely to one side

But the clock has struck eleven I thinkremarked Mrya Dmtrievna

The guests understood the hint and began to take their leave Varvra
Pvlovna was made to promise that she would come to dinner on the
morrow and bring Ada Gedenovsky who had almost fallen asleep as he
sat in one corner offered to escort her home Pnshin solemnly saluted
every one and at the steps as he put Varvra Pvlovna into her
carriage he pressed her hand and shouted after her Au revoir
Gedenovsky seated himself by her side all the way home she amused
herself by placing the tip of her foot on his foot as though by
accident he became confused and paid her compliments she giggled and
made eyes at him when the light from a streetlantern fell on the
carriage The waltz which she had herself played rang in her head and
excited her wherever she happened to find herself all she had to do was
to imagine to herself lights a ballroom the swift whirling to the
sounds of musicand her soul went fairly aflame her eyes darkened
strangely a smile hovered over her lips something gracefullybacchic
was disseminated all over her body On arriving at home Varvra
Pvlovna sprang lightly from the carriageonly fashionable lionesses
know how to spring out in that wayturned to Gedenovsky and suddenly
burst into a ringing laugh straight in his face

A charming personthought the State Councillor as he wended his way
homeward to his lodgings where his servant was awaiting him with a
bottle of eau de Cologneit is well that I am a staid man  only
what was she laughing at

Mrfa Timofevna sat all night long by Lizas pillow




                                   XLI


Lavrtzky spent a day and a half at Vaslievskoe and during nearly the
whole of that time he wandered about the neighbourhood He could not
remain long in one place anguish gnawed him he experienced all the
torture of incessant impetuous and impotent impulses He recalled the
feeling which had taken possession of his soul on the day following his
arrival in the country he recalled his intentions at that time and
waxed very angry with himself What could have torn him away from that
which he recognised as his duty the sole task of his future The thirst
for happinessonce more the thirst for happinessObviously
Mikhalvitch is right he thought Thou hast wished once more to taste
of happiness in lifehe said to himselfthou hast forgotten what a
luxury what an unmerited mercy it is when it has visited a man even
once It was not complete thou wilt say But put forth thy claims to
complete genuine happiness Look about thee who of those around thee is
blissful who enjoys himself Yonder a peasant is driving to the
reaping perchance he is satisfied with his lot What of that
Wouldst thou change with him Remember thy mother how insignificantly
small were her demands and what lot fell to her share Thou hast
evidently only been bragging before Pnshin when thou saidst to him
that thou hadst come to Russia in order to till the earth thou hast come
in order to run after the girls in thine old age The news of thy freedom
came and thou didst discard everything thou didst forget everything
thou didst run like a little boy after a butterfly Lizas image
uninterruptedly presented itself before his thoughts with an effort he
drove it away as he did also another importunate image other
imperturbablycrafty beautiful and detested features Old Antn
noticed that his master was not himself after heaving several sighs
outside the door and several more on the threshold he made up his mind
to approach him and advised him to drink something warm Lavrtzky
shouted at him ordered him to leave the room but afterward begged his
pardon but this caused Antn to grow still more disconsolate
Lavrtzky could not sit in the drawingroom he felt as though his
greatgrandfather Andri were gazing scornfully from the canvas at his
puny descendantEkh look out for thyself thou art sailing in shoal
water his lips pursed up on one side seemed to be saying Can it
behe thoughtthat I shall not be able to conquer myselfthat I
shall give in to thisnonsense The severelywounded in war always
call their wounds nonsense If a man could not deceive himselfhe
could not live on the earth Am I really a miserable little boy Well
yes I have beheld close by I have almost held in my hand the
possibility of happiness for my whole lifeit has suddenly vanished and
in a lottery if you turn the wheel just a little further a poor man
might become a rich one If it was not to be it was not to beand
thats the end of the matter Ill set to work with clenched teeth and
I will command myself to hold my tongue luckily it is not the first
time I have had to take myself in hand And why did I run away why am I
sitting here with my head thrust into a bush like an ostrich To be
afraid to look catastrophe in the faceis nonsenseAntnhe called
loudlyorder the tarants to be harnessed up immediately Yeshe
meditated once moreI must command myself to hold my tongue I must
keep a tight rein on myself

With such arguments did Lavrtzky strive to alleviate his grief but it
was great and powerful and even Apraxyya who had outlived not so much
her mind as every feeling even Apraxyya shook her head and
sorrowfully followed him with her eyes when he seated himself in the
tarants in order to drive to the town The horses galloped off he sat
motionless and upright and stared impassively ahead along the road




                                  XLII


Liza had written to Lavrtzky on the day before that he was to come to
their house in the evening but he first went up to his own quarters He
did not find either his wife or his daughter at home from the servants he
learned that she had gone with her to the Kaltins This news both
startled and enraged him Evidently Varvra Pvlovna is determined not
to give me a chance to livehe thought with the excitement of wrath in
his heart He began to stride to and fro incessantly thrusting aside with
his feet and hands the childs toys the books and the feminine
appurtenances which came in his way he summoned Justine and ordered her
to remove all that rubbishOui monsieursaid she with a
grimace and began to put the room in order gracefully bending and
giving Lavrtzky to understand by every movement that she regarded him
as an unlicked bear With hatred he watched her worn but still piquant
sneering Parisian face her white cuffs her silken apron and light cap
He sent her away at last and after long wavering Varvra Pvlovna
still did not return he made up his mind to betake himself to the
Kaltinsnot to Mrya Dmtrievnanot on any account would he
have entered her drawingroom that drawingroom where his wife was but
to Mrfa Timofevna he remembered that a rear staircase from the maids
entrance led straight to her rooms This is what Lavrtzky did Chance
favoured him in the yard he met Schrotchka she conducted him to Mrfa
Timofevna He found her contrary to her wont alone she was sitting in
a corner with hair uncovered bowed over with her hands clasped in her
lap On perceiving Lavrtzky the old woman was greatly alarmed rose
briskly to her feet and began to walk hither and yon in the room as
though in search of her cap

Ah here thou art here thou artshe began avoiding his gaze and
bustling aboutwell how do you do Come what now What is to be done
Where wert thou yesterday Well she has comewell yes Well we must
just  somehow or other

Lavrtzky dropped into a chair

Come sit down sit downwent on the old womanThou hast come
straight upstairs Well yes of course What thou art come to look at
me Thanks

The old woman was silent for a while Lavrtzky did not know what to say
to her but she understood him

Liza  yes Liza was here just nowwent on Mrfa Timofevna
tying and untying the cords of her reticule She is not quite well
Schrotchka where art thou Come hither my mother why canst thou not
sit still And I have a headache It must be from thatfrom the
singing and from the music

From what singing aunty

Why of course they keep singingwhat do you call itduets And
always in Italian tchitchi and tchatcha regular magpies They
begin to drag the notes out and its just like tugging at your soul
Pnshin and that wife of yours And all that has come about so quickly
already they are on the footing of relatives they do not stand on
ceremony However I will say this much even a dog seeks a refuge no
harm will come to her so long as people dont turn her out

Nevertheless I must confess that I did not expect thisreplied
Lavrtzkyit must have required great boldness

No my dear soul that is not boldness it is calculation The Lord be
with herI want nothing to do with her They tell me that thou art
sending her to Lavrkiis it true

Yes I am placing that estate at the disposal of Varvra Pvlovna

Has she asked for money

good look at thee Art thou well

Lizavta Mikhalovnathat is to say no ask her  shes downstairs

Yes maam

Well yes then ask her Where did she put my book She knows

I obey maam

Again the old woman began to bustle about and to open the drawers of her
commode Lavrtzky sat motionless on his chair

Suddenly light footsteps became audible on the stairsand Liza entered
Lavrtzky rose to his feet and bowed Liza halted by the door

Liza Lzotchkasaid Mrfa Timofevna hastilywhere is my book

What book aunty

Why my book good heavens However I did not call thee Well it

garden alone stay with her Respect the old womanSchrotchka left
the roomWhy where is my cap Really now where has it got to

Pray let me look for itsaid Liza

Sit down sit down my own legs havent given out yet I must have left
it yonder in my bedroom

And casting a sidelong glance at Lavrtzky Mrfa Timofevna left the
room She was on the point of leaving the door open but suddenly turned
round toward it and shut it

Liza leaned against the back of her chair and gently lifted her hands to
her face Lavrtzky remained standing as he was

This is how we were to meet againhe said at last

Liza took her hands from her face

Yesshe said dullywe were promptly punished

Punishedsaid Lavrtzky But what were you punished for

Liza raised her eyes to him They expressed neither grief nor anxiety
they looked smaller and dimmer Her face was pale her slightly parted
lips had also grown pale

Lavrtzkys heart shuddered with pity and with love

You wrote to me All is at an endhe whisperedYes all is at an
endbefore it has begun

We must forget all thatsaid LizaI am glad that you came I
wanted to write to you but it is better thus Only we must make use as
promptly as possible of these minutes It remains for both of us to do
our duty You Fedor Ivnitch ought to become reconciled to your
wife

Liza

I implore you to do it in that way alone can we expiate  everything
which has taken place Think it overand you will not refuse me

Liza for Gods sakeyou are demanding the impossible I am ready to
do everything you command but become reconciled to her now I agree
to everything I have forgotten everything but I cannot force my heart
to Have mercy this is cruel

I do not require from you  what you think do not live with her if
you cannot but become reconciledreplied Liza and again raised her
hand to her eyesRemember your little daughter do this for me

Very wellsaid Lavrtzky through his teethI will do it let us
assume that thereby I am fulfilling my duty Well and youin what does
your duty consist

I know what it is

Lavrtzky suddenly started

Surely you are not preparing to marry Pnshinhe asked

Liza smiled almost imperceptibly

Oh noshe said

Akh Liza Lizacried Lavrtzkyhow happy we might have been

Again Liza glanced at him

Now you see yourself Fedor Ivnitch that happiness does not depend
upon us but upon God

Yes because you

The door of the adjoining room opened swiftly and Mrfa Timofevna
entered with her cap in her hand

I have found it at lastshe said taking up her stand between
Lavrtzky and LizaI had mislaid it myself Thats what it is to be
old alack However youth is no better Well and art thou going to
Lavrki thyself with thy wifeshe added addressing Fedor
Ivnitch

With her to LavrkiI do not knowhe said after a pause

Thou art not going downstairs

Not today

Well very good as it pleases thee but I think thou shouldst go
downstairs Liza Akh gracious goodnessand I have forgotten to give
the bullfinch his food Just wait Ill be back directly

And Mrfa Timofevna ran out of the room without putting on her cap

Lavrtzky went quickly up to Liza

Lizahe began in a beseeching voicewe are parting forever my
heart is breakinggive me your hand in farewell

Liza raised her head Her weary almost extinct gaze rested on him

Noshe said and drew back the hand which she had already put
forwardno Lavrtzkyshe called him thus for the first timeI
will not give you my hand To what end Go away I entreat you You know
that I love youshe added with an effortbut no  no

And she raised her handkerchief to her eyes

The door creaked The handkerchief slipped off Lizas knees
Lavrtzky caught it before it fell to the floor hastily thrust it into
his side pocket and turning round his eyes met those of Mrfa
Timofevna

Lzotchka I think thy mother is calling theeremarked the old
woman

Liza immediately rose and left the room

Mrfa Timofevna sat down again in her corner Lavrtzky began to take
leave of her

Fdyashe suddenly said

What aunty

Art thou an honourable man

What

I ask thee art thou an honourable man

I hope so

Hm But give me thy word of honour that thou art an honourable man

CertainlyBut why

I know why Yes and thou also my benefactor if thou wilt think it over
wellfor thou art not stupidwilt understand thyself why I ask this of
thee And now farewell my dear Thanks for thy visit and remember the
word that has been spoken Fdya and kiss me Okh my soul it is hard
for thee I know but then life is not easy for any one That is why I
used to envy the flies here I thought is something that finds life
good but once in the night I heard a fly grieving in the claws of a
spiderno I thought a thundercloud hangs over them also What is to be
done Fdya but remember thy word neverthelessGo

Lavrtzky emerged from the back entrance and was already approaching
the gate  when a lackey overtook him

Mrya Dmtrievna ordered me to ask you to be so good as to come to
herhe announced to Lavrtzky

Say to her my good fellow that I cannot at present  began Fedor
Ivnitch

She ordered me to entreat you urgentlywent on the lackeyshe
ordered me to say that she is at home

But have the visitors goneasked Lavrtzky

Yes sirreturned the lackey and grinned

Lavrtzky shrugged his shoulders and followed him




                                  XLIII


Mrya Dmtrievna was sitting alone in her boudoir in a sofachair
and sniffing eau de Cologne a glass of orangeflower water was standing
beside her on a small table She was excited and seemed to be timorous

Lavrtzky entered

You wished to see mehe said saluting her coldly

Yesreturned Mrya Dmtrievna and drank a little of the water I
heard that you went straight upstairs to aunty I gave orders that you
should be requested to come to me I must have a talk with you Sit down
if you pleaseMrya Dmtrievna took breathYou knowshe went
onthat your wife has arrived

That fact is known to mesaid Lavrtzky

Well yesthat is I meant to say she came to me and I received her
that is what I wish to have an explanation about with you now Fedor
Ivnitch I thank God have won universal respect I may say and I
would not do anything improper for all the world Although I foresaw that
it would be disagreeable to you still I could not make up my mind to
refuse her Fedor Ivnitch she is my relativethrough you put
yourself in my placewhat right had I to turn her out of my houseYou
agree with me

There is no necessity for your agitating yourself Mrya
Dmtrievnareturned Lavrtzky you have behaved very well indeed I
am not in the least angry I have not the slightest intention of
depriving Varvra Pvlovna of the right to see her acquaintances I
only refrained from entering your apartments today because I wished to
avoid meeting herthat was all

Akh how delighted I am to hear that from you Fedor
Ivnitchexclaimed Mrya Dmtrievnahowever I always expected
this from your noble sentiments But that I should feel agitated is not
wonderful I am a woman and a mother And your wife  of course I
cannot judge between her and youI told her so myself but she is such
an amiable lady that she cannot cause anything but pleasure

Lavrtzky laughed and played with his hat

And this is what I wished to say to you Fedor Ivnitchwent on
Mrya Dmtrievna moving a little nearer to himif you had only seen
how modestly how respectfully she behavesReally it is touching But
if you had heard how she speaks of you I am wholly culpable with regard
to him she says I did not know how to appreciate him she says he
is an angel she says not a man Truly she did say that an angel
She is so penitent I never beheld such penitence I give you my
word

Well Mrya Dmtrievnasaid Lavrtzkypermit me to ask you a
question I am told that Varvra Pvlovna has been singing for you did
she sing during her repentanceor how

Akh arent you ashamed to talk like that She sang and played merely
with the object of giving me pleasure because I begged almost commanded
her to do so I perceive that she is distressedso distressed I wonder
how I can divert her And I had heard that she had such a fine
talentUpon my word Fedor Ivnitch she is a completely crushed
overwhelmed womanask Sergyi Petrvitch if she is not tout 
faitwhat have you to say to that

Lavrtzky simply shrugged his shoulders

And then what a little angel that Ada of your is what a darlingHow
pretty she is how clever how well she talks French and she understands
Russianshe called me tytenka aunty And do you know as for being
shy like nearly all children of her agethere is no shyness about her
She is awfully like you Fedor Ivnitch Her eyes her brows  well
shes you all over again your perfect image I am not very fond of such
small children I must confess but I have simply lost my heart to your
little daughter

Mrya Dmtrievnaexclaimed Lavrtzky suddenlyallow me to ask
you why you are pleased to say all this to me

Whyagain Mrya Dmtrievna sniffed at her eau de Cologne and sipped
her waterI say it Fedor Ivnitch because  you see I am a
relative I take the closest interest in you I know that you have the
very kindest of hearts Hearken to me mon cousinI am a woman of
experience and I am not talking at random forgive forgive your
wifeMrya Dmtrievnas eyes suddenly filled with tearsReflect
youth inexperience  well perhaps a bad exampleshe had not the sort
of a mother who might have put her on the right road Forgive her Fedor
Ivnitch she has been sufficiently punished

Tears trickled down Mrya Dmtrievnas cheeks she did not wipe them
away she loved to weep Lavrtzky sat as on hot coals My Godhe
thoughtwhat sort of torture what sort of a day has fallen to my
lot

You do not answerbegan Mrya Dmtrievna againwhat am I to
understand by thatis it possible that you can be so cruel No I will
not believe that I feel that my words have convinced you Fedor
Ivnitch God will reward you for your kindness of heart and you will
now receive your wife from my hands

Lavrtzky involuntarily rose from his chair Mrya Dmtrievna also
rose and stepping briskly behind a screen led forth Varvra Pvlovna
Pale halffainting with eyes cast down she seemed to have renounced
every thought every impulse of her ownto have placed herself wholly in
the hands of Mrya Dmtrievna

Lavrtzky retreated a pace

You were herehe exclaimed

Do not blame hersaid Mrya Dmtrievna hastilyshe did not wish
to remain on any account whatever but I ordered her to stay and placed
her there behind the screen She assured me that it would only make you
more angry but I would not listen to her I know you better than she
does Receive your wife from my hands go Vrya be not afraid fall at
your husbands feet she tugged at her handand my blessing on
you

Wait Mrya DmtrievnaLavrtzky interrupted her in a dull but
quivering voiceyou are probably fond of sentimental scenes
Lavrtzky was not mistaken Mrya Dmtrievna had retained from her
boardingschool days a passion for a certain theatricalness they amuse
you but others suffer from them However I will not discuss the matter
with you in this scene you are not the principal actor What do you
want of me madamhe added addressing his wife Have not I done for
you all that I could Do not retort that you have not plotted this
meeting I shall not believe youand you know that I cannot believe
you What then do you want You are cleveryou never do anything
without an object You must understand that I am not capable of living
with you as I used to live not because I am angry with you but because
I have become a different man I told you that on the day after your
return and you yourself at that moment acquiesced with me in your own
soul But you wish to reinstate yourself in public opinion it is not
enough for you to live in my house you want to live under one roof with
meis not that the truth

I want you to forgive mesaid Varvra Pvlovna without raising her
eyes

She wants you to forgive herrepeated Mrya Dmtrievna

And not for my own sake but for Adaswhispered Varvra Pvlovna

Not for her sake but for Adasrepeated Mrya Dmtrievna

Very good You wish thatejaculated Lavrtzky with an effort As
you like I agree to that

Varvra Pvlovna cast a swift glance at him and Mrya Dmtrievna
cried outWell God be praisedand again tugged at Varvra
Pvlovnas hand Now receive from me

Wait I tell youLavrtzky interrupted her I consent to live with
you Varvra Pvlovnahe continuedThat is to say I will take
you to Lavrki and I will live with you as long as my strength holds
out and then I shall go awayand return now and then You see I do
not wish to deceive you but do not demand anything more You yourself
would smile were I to comply with the desire of your respected relative
and press you to my heart and assure you that  there had been no
past that the felled tree could burst into blossom once more But I
perceive that I must submit You will not understand that word  it
matters not I repeat I will live with you  or no I cannot promise
that  I will join you I will regard you again as my wife

But give her your hand on that at leastsaid Mrya Dmtrievna
whose tears were long since dried up

Up to the present moment I have not deceived Varvra
Pvlovnareturned Lavrtzkyshe will believe me as it is I will
take her to Lavrkiand recollect Varvra Pvlovna our compact
will be regarded as broken just as soon as you leave that place And now
permit me to withdraw

He bowed to both ladies and hastily quitted the room

You are not taking her with youcalled Mrya Dmtrievna after
him Let him aloneVarvra Pvlovna whispered to her and
immediately threw her arms round her began to utter thanks to kiss her
hands and to call her her saviour

Mrya Dmtrievna accepted her caresses with condescension but in her
secret soul she was pleased neither with Lavrtzky nor with Varvra
Pvlovna nor with the whole scene which she had planned There had
turned out to be very little sentimentality Varvra Pvlovna in her
opinion should have flung herself at her husbands feet

How was it that you did not understand meshe commentedwhy I
told you fall at his feet

It was better thus dear aunty do not disturb yourselfeverything is
all rightinsisted Varvra Pvlovna

Well and he is as cold as iceremarked Mrya Dmtrievna Even if
you did not weep why I fairly overflowed before him He means to shut
you up in Lavrki The ideaand you cannot even come to see me All
men are unfeelingshe said in conclusion and shook her head
significantly

On the other hand women know how to value kindness and
magnanimitysaid Varvra Pvlovna and softly dropping on her knees
before Mrya Dmtrievna she embraced the latters corpulent form with
her arms and pressed her face against her That face wore a quiet smile
but Mrya Dmtrievnas tears were flowing again

And Lavrtzky went home locked himself up in his valets room flung
himself on the divan and lay there until the morning




                                  XLIV


The next day was Sunday The chiming of the bells for the early Liturgy
did not awaken Lavrtzkyhe had not closed an eye all night longbut it
did remind him of another Sunday when at the wish of Liza he had gone
to church He hastily rose a certain secret voice told him that he would
see her there again today He noiselessly quitted the house ordered
Varvra Pvlovna to be informed that he would return to dinner and with
great strides wended his way thither whither the monotonouslymournful
chiming summoned him He arrived early there was hardly any one in the
church a chanter in the choir was reading the Hours his voice
occasionally broken by a cough boomed on in measured cadence now rising
now falling Lavrtzky took up his stand not far from the entrance The
prayerfully inclined arrived one by one paused crossed themselves bowed
on all sides their footsteps resounded in the emptiness and silence
distinctly reechoing from the arches overhead A decrepit little old
woman in an ancient hooded cloak knelt down beside Lavrtzky and began
to pray assiduously her yellow toothless wrinkled face expressed
intense emotion her red eyes gazed fixedly upward at the holy picture on
the ikonostsis her bony hand kept incessantly emerging from under her
cloak and slowly but vigorously made a great sweeping sign of the cross
A peasant with a thick beard and a surly face tousled and dishevelled
entered the church went down at once on both knees and immediately set
to crossing himself hastily flinging back his head and shaking it after
every prostration Such bitter woe was depicted on his countenance and in
all his movements that Lavrtzky made up his mind to approach and ask
him what was the matter The peasant started back timidly and roughly and
looked at him My son is deadhe said in hasty accentsand again
began to prostrate himself to the floor What can take the place for
them of the consolation of the churchLavrtzky thoughtand tried
to pray himself but his heart had grown heavy and hard and his thoughts
were far away He was still expecting Lizabut Liza did not come The
church began to fill with people still she did not come The Liturgy
began the deacon had already read the Gospel the bell had pealed for the
hymn Worthy Lavrtzky moved a littleand suddenly caught sight of
Liza She had arrived before him but he had not descried her crowded
into the space between the wall and the choir she neither glanced around
nor moved Lavrtzky did not take his eyes from her until the very end of
the Liturgy he was bidding her farewell The congregation began to
disperse but she still stood on she seemed to be awaiting Lavrtzkys
departure At last she crossed herself for the last time and went away
without looking round she had only a maid with her Lavrtzky followed
her out of the church and overtook her in the street she was walking
very rapidly with her head bowed and her veil lowered over her face

Good morning Lizavta Mikhalovnasaid he loudly with forced
easemay I accompany you

She said nothing he walked along by her side

Are you satisfied with mehe asked her lowering his voiceYou
have heard what took place last night

Yes yesshe said in a whisperyou did well

And she walked on faster than ever

You are satisfied

Liza only nodded her head

Fedor Ivnitchshe began in a composed but weak voiceI have
wanted to ask you do not come to our house again go away as speedily as
possible we can see each other later onsometime a year hence But
now do this for me comply with my request for Gods sake

I am ready to obey you in all things Lizavta Mikhalovna but is it
possible that we are to part thus will you not say a single word to me

Fedor Ivnitch here you are now walking by my side But you are
already far away from me And not you alone but also

Finish I entreat youexclaimed Lavrtzkywhat is it that you
mean to say

You will hear perhaps  but whatever happens forget  no do not
forget meremember me

I forget you

Enough farewell Do not follow me

Liza Lavrtzky was beginning

Farewell farewellshe repeated dropped her veil still lower and
advanced almost at a run

Lavrtzky gazed after her and dropping his head went back down the
street He hit upon Lemm who was also walking along with his hat pulled
down on his nose and staring at the ground under his feet

They stared at each other in silence

Well what have you to saysaid Lavrtzky at last

What have I to sayreturned Lemm surlilyI have nothing to say
Everything is dead and we are dead Alles ist todt und wir sind todt
You are going to the right I think

Yes

Then I go to the left Goodbye

On the following morning Fedor Ivnitch and his wife set out for
Lavrki She drove in front in the carriage with Ada and Justine he
came behind in his tarants The pretty little girl never quitted the
carriagewindow during the whole journey she was surprised at
everything at the peasants the peasant women the wells the
shaftarches the carriagebells at the multitude of jackdaws Justine
shared her surprise Varvra Pvlovna laughed at their comments and
exclamations She was in high spirits before their departure from the
town of O    she had had an explanation with her husband

I understand your positionshe had said to himand he from the
expression of her clever eyes was able to conclude that she did fully
understand his positionbut you must do me the justice at least to
say that I am easy to live with I shall not obtrude myself upon you
embarrass you I wanted to assure Adas future I need nothing further

Yes and you have attained your objectsaid Fedor Ivnitch

My sole idea now is to shut myself up in the wilds I shall forever
remember your good deed in my prayers

Faugh enough of thathe interrupted her

And I shall know how to respect your independence and your
reposeshe completed her phrase which she had prepared in advance

Lavrtzky had made her a low bow Varvra Pvlovna understood that her
husband in his soul was grateful to her

On the second day toward the evening they reached Lavrki a week
later Lavrtzky set off for Moscow leaving his wife five thousand
rubles for her expensesand the day after Lavrtzkys departure
Pnshin whom Varvra Pvlovna had begged not to forget her in her
isolation made his appearance She gave him the warmest sort of a
welcome and until late into the night the lofty rooms of the house and
the very garden rang with the sounds of music singing and merry French
speeches Pnshin visited Varvra Pvlovna for three days when he
took leave of her and warmly pressed her beautiful hands he promised to
return very soonand he kept his promise



   That isthey figuratively begged the pardon of all whom they
       might have offended before entering on the Church service
       The officiating priest does the sameTranslator

   Worthy and right is it to bow down to the Father and to the
       Son and to the Holy Spirit to the Trinity consubstantial and
       indivisibleat a very solemn point and quite late in the
       LiturgyTranslator




                                   XLV


Liza had a separate little room on the second story of her mothers
house small clean bright with a white bed pots of flowers in the
corners and in front of the holy pictures with a tiny writingtable a
case of books and a crucifix on the wall This little chamber was called
the nursery Liza had been born in it On returning to it from church
where she had seen Lavrtzky she put everything in order even more
carefully than usual wiped the dust off everything looked over and tied
up with ribbons her notebooks and the letters of her friends locked all
the drawers watered the plants and touched every flower with her hand
She did all this without haste without noise with a certain touched and
tranquil solicitude on her face She halted at last in the middle of
the room slowly looked around her and stepping up to the table over
which hung the crucifix she knelt down laid her head on her clasped
hands and remained motionless

Mrfa Timofevna entered and found her in this position Liza did not
notice her entrance The old woman went outside the door on tiptoe and
gave vent to several loud coughs Liza rose quickly to her feet and
wiped her eyes in which glittered clear tears which had not fallen

I see that thou hast been arranging thy little cell againsaid Mrfa
Timofevna and bent low over a pot containing a young rosebushwhat
a splendid perfume it has

Liza gazed thoughtfully at her aunt

What a word you have utteredshe whispered

What sort of a word what wordinterposed the old woman
vivaciouslywhat dost thou meanThis is dreadfulshe said
suddenly tearing off her cap and seating herself on Lizas bedthis
is beyond my strength today is the fourth day that I seem to be seething
in a kettle I can no longer pretend that I notice nothingI cannot see
thee growing pale withering away weepingI cannot I cannot

Why what is the matter with you auntysaid LizaI am all
right

All rightexclaimed Mrfa Timofevnatell that to others but
not to me All right But who was it that was on her knees just now
whose eyelashes are still wet with tears All right Why look at
thyself what hast thou done to thy face what has become of thine
eyesAll right As though I did not know all

It will pass off aunty give me time

It will pass off but when O Lord God my Master is it possible that
thou didst love him so why he is an old man Lzotchka Well I do not
dispute that he is a good man he does not bite but what does that
signify we are all good people the world is large there will always be
plenty of that sort

I tell you that it will all pass off it is all over already

Listen Lzotchka to what I have to say to theesaid Mrfa
Timofevna suddenly making Liza sit down beside her on the bed and
adjusting now her hair now her kerchiefIt only seems to you while
it is fresh that your grief is beyond remedy Ekh my darling for death
alone there is no remedy Only say to thyself I wont give inso there
now and afterward thou wilt be amazed thyselfhow soon how well it
will pass off Only have patience

Auntyreplied Lizait is already past all is over already

Pastoverforsooth Why even thy little nose has grown pointed and
thou sayest It is overit is over

Yes it is over aunty if you will only help mecried Liza with
sudden animation and threw herself on Mrfa Timofevnas neckDear
aunty be my friend help me do not be angry understand me

Why what is this what is this my mother Dont frighten me please I
shall scream in another minute dont look at me like that tell me
quickly what thou meanest

I  I want  Liza hid her face in Mrfa Timofevnas bosom I
want to enter a conventshe said in a dull tone

The old woman fairly leaped on the bed

Cross thyself my mother Lzotchka come to thy senses God be with
thee what dost thou meanshe stammered at last lie down my
darling sleep a little this comes from lack of sleep my dear

Liza raised her head her cheeks were burning

No auntyshe articulated do not speak like that I have made up my
mind I have prayed I have asked counsel of God all is ended my life
with you is ended Such a lesson is not in vain and it is not the first
time I have thought of this Happiness was not suited to me even when I
cherished hopes of happiness my heart was always heavy I know
everything my own sins and the sins of others and how papa acquired his
wealth I know everything All that must be atoned for by prayeratoned
for by prayer I am sorry for all of youI am sorry for mamma for
Lynotchka but there is no help for it I feel that I cannot live here
I have already taken leave of everything I have made my reverence to
everything in the house for the last time something is calling me hence
I am weary I want to shut myself up forever Do not hold me back do not
dissuade me help me or I will go away alone

Mrfa Timofevna listened in terror to her niece

She is ill she is ravingshe thoughtI must send for a doctor
but for which Gedenovsky was praising some one the other day hes
always lyingbut perhaps he told the truth that time But when she
became convinced that Liza was not ill and was not raving when to all
her objections Liza steadfastly made one and the same reply Mrfa
Timofevna became seriously frightened and grievedBut thou dost not
know my darlingshe began to try to prevail upon herwhat sort of
a life they lead in convents Why my own one they will feed thee with
green hempoil they will put on thee coarse awfully coarse linen they
will make thee go about cold thou canst not endure all that Lzotchka
All that is the traces of Agfya in thee it was she who led thee
astray Why she began by living her life living a gay life do thou
live thy life also Let me at least die in peace and then do what thou
wilt And who ever heard of any one going into a convent all on account
of such a goats beardthe Lord forgive meon account of a man Come
if thy heart is so heavy go away on a journey pray to a saint have a
prayerservice said but dont put the black cowl on thy head my dear
little father my dear little mother

And Mrfa Timofevna began to weep bitterly

Liza comforted her wiped away her tears but remained inflexible In her
despair Mrfa Timofevna tried to resort to threats she would tell
Lizas mother everything but even that was of no avail Only as a
concession to the old womans urgent entreaties did Liza consent to
defer the fulfilment of her intention for six months in return Mrfa
Timofevna was compelled to give her her word that she would help her
and obtain the permission of Mrya Dmtrievna if at the end of six
months she had not changed her mind

                                                

With the advent of the first cold weather Varvra Pvlovna despite
her promise to shut herself up in the depths of the country after
providing herself with money removed to Petersburg where she hired a
modest but pretty apartment which had been found for her by Pnshin
who had quitted the Government of O    before her During the
latter part of his sojourn in O    he had completely fallen out of
favour with Mrya Dmtrievna he had suddenly ceased to call upon her
and hardly ever quitted Lavrki Varvra Pvlovna had enslaved him
precisely thatenslaved him no other word will express her unlimited
irrevocable irresponsible power over him

Lavrtzky passed the winter in Moscow but in the spring of the
following year the news reached him that Liza had entered the B   
convent in one of the most remote corners of Russia

EPILOGUE

Eight years have passed Spring has come again But first let us say a
few words about the fate of Mikhalvitch Pnshin Mme Lavrtzkyand
take our leave of them Mikhalvitch after long peregrinations has
finally hit upon his real vocation he has obtained the post of head
inspector in a government institution He is very well satisfied with his
lot and his pupils adore him although they mimic him Pnshin has
advanced greatly in rank and already has a directorship in view he walks
with his back somewhat bent it must be the cross of the Order of
Vladmir which has been conferred upon him that drags him forward The
official in him has decidedly carried the day over the artist his still
youthful face has turned quite yellow his hair has grown thin and he no
longer sings or draws but secretly occupies himself with literature he
has written a little comedy in the nature of a proverband as every
one who writes nowadays shows up some one or something he has shown up
in it a coquette and he reads it surreptitiously to two or three ladies
who are favourably disposed toward him But he has not married although
many fine opportunities of so doing have presented themselves for this
Varvra Pvlovna is responsible As for her she lives uninterruptedly
in Paris as of yore Fedor Ivnitch has given her a bill of exchange
on himself and bought himself free from herfrom the possibility of a
second unexpected invasion She has grown old and fat but it is still
pretty and elegant Every person has his own ideal Varvra Pvlovna has
found hersin the dramatic productions of Dumas fils She assiduously
frequents the theatre where consumptive and sentimental ladies of the
frail class are put on the stage to be Mme Doche seems to her the very
apex of human felicity one day she declared that she desired no better
lot for her daughter It is to be hoped that fate will deliver
Mademoiselle Ada from such felicity from a rosy plump child she has
turned into a weakchested palefaced young girl her nerves are already
deranged The number of Varvra Pvlovnas admirers has decreased but
they have not transferred their allegiance she will in all probability
retain several of them to the end of her life The most ardent of them of
late has been a certain ZakurdloSkubrnikoff one of the retired
dandies of the Guards a man of eight and thirty of remarkably robust
build The Frenchmen who frequent Mme Lavrtzkys salon call him le
gros taureau de lUkrane Varvra Pvlovna never invites him to her
fashionable evening gatherings but he enjoys her favour in the fullest
measure

So  eight years have passed Again the sky is breathing forth the
beaming happiness of spring again it is smiling upon the earth and upon
men again beneath its caress everything has burst into blossom into
love and song The town of O    has undergone very little change in
the course of those eight years but Mrya Dmtrievnas house seems to
have grown young its recently painted walls shine as in welcome and the
panes of the open windows are crimsoning and glittering in the rays of the
setting sun Through these windows out upon the street are wafted the
sounds of ringing young voices of incessant laughter the whole house
seems bubbling with life and overflowing the brim with merriment The
mistress of the house herself has long since gone to her grave Mrya
Dmtrievna died two years after Lizas profession as a nun and Mrfa
Timofevna did not long survive her niece they rest side by side in the
town cemetery Nastsya Krpovna also is dead the faithful old woman
went every week for the space of several years to pray over the ashes
of her friend Her time came and her bones also were laid in the damp
earth But Mrya Dmtrievnas house has not passed into the hands of
strangers has not left her family the nest has not been destroyed
Lynotchka who has become a stately beautiful young girl and her
betrothed a fairhaired officer of hussars Mrya Dmtrievnas son who
has just been married in Petersburg and has come with his young wife to
spend the spring in O    his wifes sister an Institutegirl of
sixteen with brilliantly scarlet cheeks and clear eyes Schrotchka who
has also grown up and become prettythese are the young folks who are
making the walls of the Kaltin house reecho with laughter and chatter
Everything about it has been changed everything has been brought into
accord with the new inhabitants Beardless young houseservants who grin
and jest have taken the places of the former sedate old servitors where
overgrown Rska was wont to stroll two setters are chasing madly about
and leaping over the divans the stable has been filled with cleanlimbed
amblers highspirited shafthorses fiery tracehorses with braided
manes and ridinghorses from the Don the hours for breakfast dinner
and supper have become mixed up and confused according to the expression
of the neighbours an unprecedented state of affairs has been
established

On the evening of which we are speaking the inhabitants of the Kaltin
house the oldest of them Lynotchkas betrothed was only four and
twenty were engaged in a far from complicated but judging from their
vigorous laughter a very amusing game they were running through the
rooms and catching each other the dogs also were running and barking
and the canaries which hung in cages in front of the windows vied with
each other in singing at the tops of their voices increasing the uproar
of ringing volleys of noise with their furious chirping While this
deafening diversion was at its very height a mudstained tarants drove
up to the gate and a man of fortyfive clad in travelling garb
descended from it and stopped short in amazement He stood motionless
for some time swept an attentive glance over the house passed through
the gate into the yard and slowly ascended the steps There was no one
in the anteroom to receive him but the door of the hall flew wide
open through it all flushed bounced Schrotchka and instantly in
pursuit of her with ringing laughter rushed the whole youthful band
She came to a sudden halt and fell silent at the sight of the stranger
but the clear eyes fastened upon him were as caressing as ever the fresh
faces did not cease to smile Mrya Dmtrievnas son stepped up to the
visitor and courteously asked him what he wished

I am Lavrtzkysaid the visitor

A vigorous shout rang out in responseand not because all these young
people were so extremely delighted at the arrival of the distant almost
forgotten relative but simply because they were ready to make an uproar
and rejoice on every convenient opportunity They immediately surrounded
Lavrtzky Lynotchka in the quality of an old acquaintance was the
first to introduce herself and to assure him that in another moment
she certainly would have recognised him and then she presented all the
rest of the company calling each one of them including her betrothed
by his pet name The whole throng moved through the diningroom to the
drawingroom The hangings in both rooms were different but the
furniture remained the same Lavrtzky recognised the piano even the
same embroideryframe was standing in the window in the same
positionand almost with the same unfinished bit of embroidery as eight
years previously They made him sit down in a comfortable easychair all
seated themselves decorously around him Questions exclamations stories
showered down without cessation

But it is a long time since we have seen youremarked Lynotchka
ingenuouslyand we have not seen Varvra Pvlovna either

I should think sointerposed her brother hurriedly I carried thee
off to Petersburg but Fedor Ivnitch lived in the country all the
time

Yes and mamma has died since you know

And Mrfa Timofevnasaid Schrotchka

And Nastsya Krpovnarejoined LynotchkaAnd Msieu Lemm

What And is Lemm dead alsoasked Lavrtzky

Yesreplied young Kaltinhe went away from here to Odessathey
say that some one decoyed him thither and there he died

You do not knowwhether he left any music behind him

I dont knowit is hardly probable

All fell silent and exchanged glances A cloud of sadness had descended
upon all the young faces

And Matrska is alivesuddenly remarked Lynotchka

And Gedenovsky is aliveadded her brother

At the name of Gedenovsky a vigorous peal of laughter rang out in
unison

Yes he is alive and lies just as he always didwent on Mrya
Dmtrievnas sonand just imagine that naughty child there and he
pointed at his wifes sister the Institutegirl put pepper in his
snuffbox yesterday

How he did sneeze exclaimed Lynotehkaand again a peal of
irrepressible laughter rang out

We received news of Liza recentlysaid young Kaltinand again
everything grew still round aboutthings are well with herher
health is now improving somewhat

Is she still in the same conventasked Lavrtzky not without an
effort

Yes still in the same place

Does she write to you

No never the news reaches us through other peopleA sudden
profound silence ensued The angel of silence has flown past all said
to themselves

Would not you like to go into the gardenKaltin turned to
Lavrtzkyit is very pretty now although we have rather neglected
it

Lavrtzky went out into the garden and the first thing that struck his
eyes was the bench on which he had once spent with Liza a few happy
moments never to be repeated it had grown black and crooked but he
recognised it and his soul was seized by that feeling which has no peer
in sweetness and in sorrowthe feeling of living grief for vanished
youth for happiness which it once possessed In company with the young
people he strolled through the alleys the lindentrees had not grown
much older and taller during the last eight years but their shade had
become more dense on the other hand all the shrubs had sprung upward
the raspberrybushes had waxed strong the hazel copse had become
entirely impenetrable and everywhere there was an odour of thickets
forest grass and lilacs

What a good place this would be to play at pussinthecornersuddenly
cried Lynotchka as they entered a small verdant glade hemmed in by
lindensby the way there are five of us

And hast thou forgotten Fedor Ivnitchher brother observed to
her Or art thou not reckoning in thyself

Lynotchka blushed faintly

But is it possible that Fedor Ivnitch at his age canshe
began

Please playinterposed Lavrtzky hastilypay no heed to me It
will be all the more agreeable to me if I know that I am not embarrassing
you And there is no need for you to bother about me we old fellows have
occupations of which you as yet know nothing and which no diversion
can replace memories

The young people listened to Lavrtzky with courteous and almost mocking
respectexactly as though their teacher were reading them a
lessonand suddenly all of them flew away from him and ran over the
glade four of them took up their stand near the trees one stood in the
centreand the fun began

But Lavrtzky returned to the house went into the diningroom
approached the piano and touched one of the keys a faint but pure
sound rang out and secretly trembled in his heart with that note began
that inspired melody wherewith long ago on that same blissful night
Lemm the dead Lemm had led him to such raptures Then Lavrtzky passed
into the drawingroom and did not emerge from it for a long time in
that room where he had so often seen Liza her image rose up before him
more vividly than ever it seemed to him that he felt around him the
traces of her presence but his grief for her was exhausting and not
light there was in it none of the tranquillity which death inspires
Liza was still living somewhere dully far away he thought of her as
among the living but did not recognise the young girl whom he had once
loved in that pale spectre swathed in the conventual garment surrounded
by smoky clouds of incense Lavrtzky would not have recognised himself
had he been able to contemplate himself as he mentally contemplated Liza
In the course of those eight years the crisis had at last been effected
in his life that crisis which many do not experience but without which
it is not possible to remain an honourable man to the end he had really
ceased to think of his own happiness of selfish aims He had calmed
down andwhy should the truth be concealedhe had aged not alone in
face and body he had aged in soul to preserve the heart youthful to old
age as some say is difficult and almost absurd he may feel content
who has not lost faith in good steadfastness of will desire for
activity Lavrtzky had a right to feel satisfied he had become a
really fine agriculturist he had really learned to till the soil and he
had toiled not for himself alone in so far as he had been able he had
freed from care and established on a firm foundation the existence of his
serfs

Lavrtzky emerged from the house into the garden he seated himself on
the familiar benchand in that dear spot in the face of the house
where he had on the last occasion stretched out his hands in vain to
the fatal cup in which seethes and sparkles the wine of delighthe a
solitary homeless wandererto the sounds of the merry cries of the
younger generation which had already superseded himtook a survey of
his life His heart was sad but not heavy and not very sorrowful he had
nothing which he had need to regret or be ashamed of Play on make
merry grow on young forceshe thought and there was no bitterness
in his meditationslife lies before you and it will be easier for you
to live you will not be compelled as we have been to seek your road
to struggle to fall and to rise to your feet again amid the gloom we
have given ourselves great trouble that we might remain wholeand how
many of us have failed in thatbut you must do deeds workand the
blessing of old fellows like me be upon you But all that remains for me
after today after these emotions is to make my final reverence to you
and although with sadness yet without envy without any dark feelings
to say in view of the end in view of God who is awaiting me Long live
solitary old age Burn thyself out useless life

Lavrtzky rose softly and softly went away no one noticed him no one
detained him the merry cries resounded more loudly than ever in the
garden behind the green dense wall of lofty lindens He seated himself
in his tarants and ordered the coachman to drive home and not to
press the horses hard

                                                

And the end perchance some dissatisfied reader will say And what
became of Lavrtzky of Liza But what can one say about people who are
still alive but who have already departed from the earthly arenawhy
revert to them They say that Lavrtzky paid a visit to that distant
convent where Liza had hidden herselfand saw her In going from one
choir to the other she passed close to himpassed with the even
hurriedlysubmissive gait of a nunand did not cast a glance at him
only the lashes of the eye which was turned toward him trembled almost
imperceptibly and her haggard face was bowed a little lower than
usualand the fingers of her clasped hands interlaced with her rosary
were pressed more tightly to one another What did they both thinkwhat
did they both feel Who knows Who shall say There are moments in life
there are feelings  we can only indicate themand pass by
