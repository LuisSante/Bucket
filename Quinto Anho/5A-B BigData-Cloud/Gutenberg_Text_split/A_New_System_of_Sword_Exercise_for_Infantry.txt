A NEW SWORD EXERCISE FOR INFANTRY




INTRODUCTORY REMARKS


Before proceeding to develop my New Sword Exercise for Infantry I
would offer a few remarks upon the changes proposed in these pages
Whilst the last half century has witnessed an immense improvement in
the projectile weapons of the civilized world the theory and practice
of the sabre or cutting arm have remained in statu quo ante indeed
if there has been any change it is for the worse The two systems
authorized in the British army are completely behind their time First
and senior is the Infantry Sword Exercise with plates Revised
Edition AdjutantGenerals Office Horse Guards London Printed under
the superintendence of HM Stationery Office  The second is
the Instructions for the Sword c without plates for the use of
Cavalry AdjutantGenerals Office Horse Guards June 

The latter can be despatched very briefly Despite the late date
it is as obsolete as the older system it is in fact only the
Infantry Exercise with the addition of pursuing practice and
post practicethe latter upon a sort of modern Quintain not made
to revolve So far so good The practised swordsman has little to
learn when mounted except the few modifications which he can teach
himself His real study is on foot But some of the remarks appear not
to have been written by a practical hand For instance we read p
 In delivering a forward thrust very little force is necessary
when the horse is in quick motion as the extension of the arm with
a good direction of the point will be fully sufficient Fully
sufficientI should think so The recruit must be carefully and
sedulously taught when meeting the enemy even at a trot or canter
to use no force whatever otherwise his sword will bury itself to the
hilt and the swordsman will either be dragged from his horse or will
be compelled to drop his weaponif he can Upon this point I may quote
my own System of Bayonet Exercise p 

The instructor must spare no pains in preventing the soldier from
using force especially with the left or guiding arm as too much
exertion generally causes the thrust to miss A trifling bodystab
with the bayonet I may add with the sword is sufficient to disable
a man and many a promising young soldier has lost his life by
burying his weapon so deep in the enemys breast that it could not
be withdrawn quickly enough to be used against a second assailant
To prevent this happening the point must be delivered smartly with
but little exertion of force more like a dart than a thrust and
instantly afterwards the bayonet must be as smartly withdrawn In
fact the thrust should consist of two movements executed as nearly
simultaneously as possible and it requires long habit as the natural
man especially the Englishman is apt to push home and to dwell upon
his slouching push

The Infantry Sword Exercise is nought but a snare and a delusion
Except in pagination it is the same as the Revised Edition of
the only difference or revision that I can detect is the omission
of a short sentence in p  of the older issue it even retains
the General Order of Lord Hill rd April  Thus Revision
is confined to the plates In  the figures wear the milkpail
shako widening at the top the frock coat and the scales the last
edition dated April  dons the tall modern chimneypot the
tightly buttoned tunic with stiff collar and like its predecessor the
sash and the scabbard It is no wonder that the figures display an
exceeding gne the stiffness of pokers as the phrase is here we
might with profit borrow from the French or Italian artist

I am opposed to almost every page of this unhappy brochure
especially to the Seven Cuts and Guards of the target to the shape
of the targetI never yet saw a man absolutely circular to the grip
of the sword to the position in guard to the Guards or Parades
especially the inside engaging guard Carte to the Lunge to the
angle of the feet and to the system of loose practice

The Cuts will be noticed in a future page Of the grip I may remark
that the one essential the position of the thumb both in attacks and
parries is as a rule neglected by the Sword Exercise As early
as  Mller made his point dappui a grasp of the handle with
the four fingers the thumb being stretched along the back in order
to direct the edge and to avoid the possibility of striking with
the flat The only exception to this universal law is when doing
the Moulinet movements which will be explained farther on Some
professors both with broadsword and smallsword would stretch the
index when pointing along the right of the handle I have objected to
this practice in the rapier and the foil except when done to change
position for relief it serves merely to fatigue the wrist But the
proper use of the thumb le pouce allong sur le dos de la poigne
which is troublesome at first and which demands some study especially
from those who have acquired bad habits is the base of all superior
counterpoint

The position on guard is a debated point Many indeed I may say
most of the moderns follow the rule of all the older swordsmen
namely reposing twothirds of the bodyweight as in p  of the
Exercise which however is an exaggeration upon the left leg The
reasons usually given are that in this position the person is not so
much exposed moreover that the centre of gravity being thrown back
adds spring and impetus to the Lunge We may remember how Cordelois
 made a step towards change in his fencingschools at Paris
My objection to the old style is that the farther you are from your
opponent the longer and slower will be your attack moreover I have
ever found in personal practice that it is easier and more convenient
to sit on guard with the weight equally distributed on both haunches
and legs In fact that the backward position is not natural any pair
of thighs can ascertain for itself after trying it for five minutes
whilst the muscles of the right or forward limb are relaxed as much
as possible those of the left are tight strung so as to do double
work and threaten cramp This single objection is serious enough to
counterbalance any other claims to superiority

What to avoid

Again there is no excuse for the guards in the Exercise The
Hanging guard p  in the older issue p  is the worst that
can be imagineda painful spectacle a lesson of what to avoid The
head ignobly cowers and the eyes look up in a forced and wearying
position when the former should be held upright and the glance should
be naturally fixed upon the opponents eye and bladepoint the body
is bent so as to lose our national advantage of height and strength
and the right forearm in such a position is and ever must be clean
uncovered Let the recruit however strong may be his haunches stand
a few minutes in this Hanging guard and he will soon feel by his
fatigue how strange awkward and strained it is The Carte or inside
Engaging Guard pp   again endangers the forearm The
Tierce or outside Engaging Guard pp   holds the hand too low
and unduly shortens the arm thus offering an undesirable amount of
exposure it is in fact not a Guard but a bad parry in low Tierce
Worse still is the Lunge pp   here the body is placed bolt
upright instead of being easily bent without exaggeration to
the fore prolonging as every man instinctively would do at his
first attempt the line of the left leg The former position is not
only fatiguing and against the grain also shortens the reach and
carefully places the opponent safely out of measure Many swordsmen
still contend for the stiffly upright position in Lunge I am
disposed to consider it a mere survival of the classical and artificial
French school of arms which aimed at opposing nature as sedulously
as the Italian who always leans to the fore attempted to follow her
dictates Moreover their arguments are founded upon the abuse not
the use of the inclined pose which the body naturally assumes In
teaching the recruit it is well to see that he does not fall into the
dangerous habit of throwing the chest forward poitriner to meet his
opponents point but the truth of muscular motion must be consulted

Finally I would note the mistake of loose practice with the
singlestick instead of the sabre it probably arose from a mistaken
economy in saving swords and paddings Singlestick is a different
weapon a cane or light cudgel with a baskethilt covering the back
of the hand like the imperfect guard of the Highland Claymore it
is straight not curved and as the rod has no edges so in practice
every blow equally represents a cut Singlestick has merits of its
own but its practice is fatal to excellence with the broadsword and
even the Exercise seems to recognize the fact for the guinds
figures are armed with officers Regulation swords

Illustration Inside GuardCarte

Weight all thrown back

Both Sword Exercises carefully avoid naming Tierce and Carte
preferring right and left of the Sword or outside and inside
as if such mysteries were too high or too deep for our national
intelligence I would again quote a few lines from my System of
Bayonet Exercise Introductory Remarks pp  

But why it may be asked should the English soldier be deterred by
difficulties which every French voltigeur can master We admire the
intelligence of our neighbours in military matters we remark that they
are born soldiers and that their men learn as much in four months
as ours do in six Is not this however partly our own fault In my
humble opinion we mistake the cause of their quickness attributing
to nature the effect of art When our system of drill is thoroughly
efficient when the Manual and Platoon is much simplified when a
salle darmes is established in every corps and when the bayonet
exercise becomes a recognized branch of instruction then I believe
we shall find our soldiers equal in intelligence to any others These
words were written in  in  I add When we enlist the right
kind of recruit either by improving his condition and his prospects
not his pay or better far better by securing a superior man through
the conscription of modern Europe We Britons are no longer physically
divided from the total orb nor can we afford to remain morally
insulated and isolated The logical effect of union with the outer
world will be to make us do as the world does and all our exceptional
institutions such as the system of volunteer recruiting must sooner
or later go by the board

Illustration Outside GuardTierce

A Parry not a Guard

Nor is the most modern French Treatise pp  Manuel de
Gymnastique et dEscrime officially published by the Ministre de la
Marine et des Colonies Paris Dumaine  Escrime au Sabre
much superior to our home growth The position of the left hand pp
  is bad throughout it must slip during the Lunge and make the
play loose The retreat of the left leg Fig  p  is carried to
an extreme of caution The body is always perpendicular in the Lunge
whereas the same volume shows Fig  p  the trunk naturally
inclining forwards The Cuts are not double nor continuous as they
should be The Hanging Guards pp    are deplorable
On the other hand the Manuel p  places the thumb along not
around the handle the moulinets the enlevs and the briss
presently to be explained are good stuff and moreover they are
applied to the Cuts p  Finally nothing can be better than
the advice p  Aprs avoir touch retirer vivement le sabre
en arrire en lui imprimant une direction oblique dans le sens du
tranchant de manire  scier

Of the points or thrusts with broadsword nothing will here be said
they belong to another order of things and they should be studied
in the fencing school But the soldier must be taught that if his
adversary attempt a thrust the broadsword is easily disarmed When the
opponent comes to the position of pointing that is extends his blade
a sharp glissade along its length will make the grip fly out of his
grasp Another way of embarrassing the attack is to cut right and left
at the hand the wrist or the forearm when the adversary begins to
present point

General Lamoricire was a firm believer as we all are in the
thrust and the French Sword Exercise for Cavalry p  Rglement
Provisoire sur les Exercises de la Cavalerie officially published at
the Ministre de la Guerre Paris Dumaine  justly remarks
Les coups de pointe doivent toujours tre employs de prfrence
comme exigeant moins de force et ayant un rsultat plus prompt plus
certain et plus dcisif The reason of its confessed superiority
to the Cut is as old as the axiom a straight line is the shortest
way between two points The Thrust describes a diameter the Cut a
segment of a circle and with equal velocity the Cut will traverse a
distance occupying some twothirds more of time than the Thrust The
French tactician therefore proposed to abolish the use of the edge
for cavalry thus traversing the instinct of the manatarms who
especially on horseback loves to slash at his enemy and who runs
far less risk of entangling his blade But he of course advocated
a straight and tapering sword with no edge to speak of indeed the
cuirassiers latte is still a kind of rapier but it is rendered
useless by prodigious length and by the weight of the handle The
modern Italian School of Sabre uses especially in single combat all
the dgagements of the salle darmes this is thoroughly illogical
the weapon is chosen because it is supposed to be less fatal than foil
or rapier and yet it is so used as to become even more deadly I
need hardly say that the weight and shape of the broadsword together
with the positions of guard render pointing with it awkward in the
extreme

I have now finished with the ungrateful task of criticizing and I
proceed to propose a system which it is hoped will be as severely
criticized by others It is only candid to state that its pretensions
are high that it contains two distinct novelties the Manchette System
and the Reverse or Backcut and finally that it aspires to be the
first Treatise in which the broadsword is scientifically taken in hand

PREPARATORY INSTRUCTION WITHOUT THE SWORD


  Preliminary

Nothing will here be said concerning the goose step of the sword
the Balance Motions and the Extension Motions of the official
Infantry Sword Exercise They are essentially a part of Squad and
Settingup Drill and as such they have been treated in several good
manuals especially by SerjeantMajor S Bertram Brown A Practical
Guide to Squad and Settingup Drill in accordance with the Principles
laid down in Part I Field Exercise of the Army Adapted for the use
of Recruits Rifle Volunteers Militia Police Force Schools and
Families Illustrated with sixtyeight figures representing each Stick
and Club Exercise Extension Motions and Sword Exercise Positions
London Allen and Co  nd Edition Considered in a wider
sense they belong to the Branch of Science so thoroughly developed in
A Military System of Gymnastic Exercises for the Use of Instructors
AdjutantGenerals Office Horse Guards  Physical Education
Clarendon Press Series Oxford  and in Training in Theory and
Practice London Macmillan  by Archibald MacLaren whose
excellent code for the army and whose influence with successive war
ministers as some one truly said have aided largely in introducing
that admirable training which is transforming the stiff slowmoving
grenadier of past times into the vigorous rapid and enduring soldier
of the present day

Squad drill is not likely to make a good swordsman yet economy of
time renders it a necessity It must be practised first without
then with weapons after which those who show unusual capabilities
should be taken individually in hand by the master The latest French
system Manuel etc divides the four lessons into two degrees 
Preparatory Movements moulinets and simple attacks and parries 
Compound attacks and parries

The formation of the squad is in the usual line with open order at
arms length from the right or left The men are then taught the three
positions as follows

Illustration

  First Position      Second Position     Third Position

  In two movements    In two movements    In two movements



  First Position in Two Motions

OnePlace the hands smartly behind the back the left grasping the
right arm just above the elbow and the right similarly supporting the
left elbow

TwoMake a halfface right by pivoting smartly on both heels
which must be kept close together the feet at right angles the left
pointing to the front the face looking towards the opponent or the
righthand man and the weight of the body balanced equally upon both
haunches and legs


Second Position in Two Motions Guard

OneBend the knees gradually till they are perpendicular to the
instep keeping the head and body erect and both feet firm on the
ground The instructor must be careful that the knees do not incline
inwardsa general fault

TwoAdvance the right foot smartly about  inches in front of and
in line with the right heel and rest the whole weight of the body upon
both haunches and legs

In the second position that of Guard for the feet care must be taken
that the left foot remains firm on the ground without shuffling or
turning inwards or outwards Many swordsmen find a better balance when
the right heel is on a line with the hollow of the left foot


Third Position in Two Motions from Guard to Lunge

OneAdvance the body slightly forward and bring the right
shoulder and knee perpendicular to the point of the right foot

TwoAdvance the right foot smartly about  inches or double
the distance of No  Second Position Guard taking care that the
foot does not overhang the instep extend the left leg with a spring
the left foot remaining true and firm and the left knee perfectly
straight let the shoulders expand and the body be profiled and
slightly inclined forwards or towards the opponent

This is the position of the legs in the Lunge and the greatest care
must be taken to prevent the recruit learning it in a careless
shuffling way Above all things he must accustom himself to separate
the action into its two composing parts otherwise the lower limbs will
often take precedence of the upper shoulder arm and hand and the
Lunge become worse than useless When recovering guard the contrary is
the case the left knee must be bent before the right foot is moved
and the latter should exert a slight pressure on the ground at the
same time the body must be drawn backwards not jerked upwards

These measures of Guard  inches and of Lunge  inches are
best fitted for averagesized men in exceptional cases they must
be shortened or lengthened according to the stature and stride of
the recruit The rule for guard is the measure of two footlengths
the Lunge doubles that span and the least vigorous men require the
greatest distances

These movements must be learned first in slow and afterwards in quick
and in doublequick time the same may be said of all practice with
and without the sword Squad attention and Stand at Ease need
hardly be explained The recruits muscles soon become fatigued by the
unusual and monotonous exercise causing them to remain too long in one
position the easiest way to relieve them is to change front making
the left leg stand on guard and lunge as a lefthanded fencer would
do This double practice is as useful and recommendable in fencing and
broadsword play as in bayonet exercise it gives additional balance
to the body it equalizes the muscular strength of both sides and it
makes the soldier feel that if his right arm be disabled he can still
depend upon his left

The word Steady must not be used as a command it should be a caution
given at the completion of any part of a practice with the view of
correcting faults


  Attacking Advancing and Retiring

Single AttackRaise the right foot well off the ground and beat
smartly with the whole sole the greatest force being upon the ball of
the foot and the least upon the heel

Double AttackThe same movement made twice The instructor
should carefully avoid the directions of the Infantry Sword
Exercisefirst with the heel then with the flat of the foot
Nothing jars the leg more than this use of the heel it is a bad habit
to use it for anything but pivoting

AdvanceSmartly advance the right foot about six inches and bring
up the left as nearly as possible to the same distance The soles must
just clear the ground and the toes be kept on a straight line with
the knee and never turned inside or outside Neglect of the latter
precaution leads to a loose unsteady and slovenly style which easily
learnt is hardly to be unlearnt

Single AttackAs before

RetireMove the left foot lightly to the rear about six inches
and let the right foot follow it Recruits are uncommonly apt to
step short and this can be remedied only by making them retire for
considerable distances The weight and balance of the body must be
equally distributed on both haunches and legs not resting upon the
left which can serve only to give cramp

Double AttackAs before

FrontResume the position of Attention




SECTION II

PREPARATORY INSTRUCTION WITH THE SWORD


  Explanation and Use of the Target

The Target prefixed to these pages explains itself The shape is
oblong the frame measuring  feet by  and the figure  feet  inches
by  foot As the latter represents the opponent the centre should
be about  feet from the ground the height of the recruits breast
Perpendicular to the foot of the figure in each Target a horizontal
line is drawn forming for the feet the legs the body and the arms
the directing line of the scientific schools At a distance of 
feet the recruit is placed in the position of Attention with his
left heel on the line so that at the command First Position his
right foot may cover it

The parallelogram shows the direction and the numbering of the Cuts
concerning which further details will presently be given They should
be regulated according to the lines described upon the Target nor
should the recruit be practised in any other mode until he has gained
the proper direction of the blade

Nothing need be added to the directions of the Infantry Sword
Exercise pp    as regards the movements subject to the
following words of command much on the other hand with great
advantage might be taken away and the result would be the increased
efficiency that results from simplicity

Draw Swords should be much abridged after the modern French School

At the order Stand on Guard the recruit having assumed the Second
Position No  falls on Guard the pommel of the sword fronts his
right breast the point is directed at his opponents right eye his
right arm is extended with an easy bend at the elbow the wrist is
inclined with the knuckles slightly turned upwards to his own right
so as to cover him in case of a straight thrust and the left hand is
placed upon the left flank just below the ribs with the fingers to the
front and the thumb to the rear

The several guards parries are learned by holding the sword opposite
to and in the inclination of the dotted lines which have swordhilts
attached to them the recruit is thus taught from the Target the angle
of the blade and the position of the wrist

The Target directs the recruit how to make the Cuts and to form the
Guards but not exactly where this must depend upon how the opponent
acts during the attack and the defence Cuts      and  odd
numbers are all from Carte which the Infantry Sword Exercise calls
Inside The corresponding even numbers      and  are
from Tierce or Outside The same nomenclature applies to the Guards
or parries

When the recruit thoroughly understands the use of the Target he need
no longer be practised in front of it but the instructor sword in
hand should consider it a sure guide and reference for correctly
forming the Guards and for giving a suitable direction to the edge when
making the Cuts


  The Moulinet

This rotation movement should be learnt before the recruit proceeds to
the Cut

There is nothing better for breaking as the French say the
recruits wrist than this sweep of the sword and the style of a
swordsman may always be known by his Moulinet We will divide it into
three kinds viz  horizontal  diagonal and  vertical the
latter again may be either a ascending or b descending but as the
second diagonal is a mere modification of the first and the third it
will be sufficient to notice only two these are

st The horizontal movement or Moulinet proper circling the sword
round the head The grip is held as lightly as possible chiefly with
the thumb and the first finger resting the pommel upon the palm and
carrying the nails upwards The blade should be moved as horizontally
as it can be with the back just clearing the swordsmans crown it
should describe not a true circle but an oval with a long diameter
in the directing line to the centre of the Target through the heels or
ankles of the recruit Finally the point should be lanced or thrown
out as it were towards the opponents face Evidently it may be done
in two ways first from right to left which I will call the Tierce
Moulinet Moulinet  gauche this is by far the easiest and the
more habitual corresponding with Tierce Counter opposition or
describing with the blade a circle round the adversarys blade in the
fencing school The reverse movement Carte Moulinet Moulinet 
droite from left to right requires like the Counter of Carte much
more practice

In these directions right and left apply to the right and left of the
swordsmans wrist

nd In France the term Moulinet is mostly applied to these two
rotations of the sword round the head but we will extend it to all
circlings of the point The vertical form is also made from the hand
in Tierce Outside Guard the blade is brought sharply round with the
back towards the breast and left shoulder and returns to its original
position we will call this the Inside Moulinet having reference to
the performer not the adversary The Outside Moulinet is when from
Tierce or Outside Guard the blade passes along the right shoulder it
is simply the former done in the outer line

Illustration Horizontal Moulinet

Again the Inside Moulinet which ends with the Cut from above
downwards the French enlev may be inverted so as to cut from
downwards upwards the bris The same may be done with the Outside
Moulinet when the wrist must be turned upwards and the Cut given
in the ascending line This difficult movement should be practised
in order to ensure a flexible wrist but it exposes the whole arm In
the four latter Cuts the one invariable rule is to circle the point
as vertically as possible The French Manuel pp   gives
 the enlev cutting from above downwards and it may be either
 gauche Tierce Moulinet or  droite Carte Moulinet  the
Moulinet proper and  the bris cutting from downwards upwards
thus reversing the enlev and this also may be done  gauche
Tierce Moulinet or  droite Carte Moulinet

Illustration Vertical Moulinet

The Moulinet should be practised first without then with the sword
and on foot before attempting it on horseback In the earlier stage
the recruit must turn the hand with the arm nearly extended in the
horizontal and vertical movements without stiffness and displacement
of the elbow In the second he may if no Target be procurable work
before a cross chalked on the wall so as to secure horizontality and
verticality Finally the soldier will combine the two Tierce and
Carte by passing rapidly from one to the other

Whilst practising the Moulinet the recruit must be taught the two
main divisions of the swordblade Fencers have introduced an immense
complication into this simple matter and some have proposed eight
parts for broadsword it is sufficient to divide the length The
Feeble or weak half is that contained between the point and the
centre this the proper part for the Cut or attack is ground to a
thinner edge and consequently is more liable to an injury from another
sword if the Cut be not very true The Fort or strong half is from
the centre to the hilt and upon this we must rely for defence

A few hours practice and a few pressings upon the different parts
of the blade under the surveillance of the instructor will teach the
recruit the high importance of this lesson He will learn that in
opposing the adversarys sword the strength of the defence decreases
from the hilt upwards in proportion as the Cut is received towards the
point and that vice vers it increases from the point downwards
to the hand The strongest man cannot force in the opponents Guard
if the Cut or Thrust be received upon the part near the handle With
a true Guard the ordinary fencing foil can turn off the thrust of a
musket and bayonet weighing  lbs The practised swordsman always
attempts when attacking to gain with his Fort the Feeble of the
opponents weapon in which case the superior leverage will often
beat down the parry and this manuvre should be carefully practised
by men of superior muscular strength The Cuts must as a rule be
delivered within eight inches of the point and at the centre of
percussion so that the sword may clear itself and the arm escape
a jar

The two virtues of the Cut are its trueness and its velocity Unless
true it will become a blow with the flat that would shiver to pieces
any brittle Eastern blade Assuming the vis viva or force of a moving
body to be its weight multiplied by the square of the velocity let us
suppose a strong man cutting with a sword weighing  lbs to which he
can give a velocity which we will call  or      a weaker man
who applies double the velocity to a  lb sword will thus produce a
momentum of  doubling the force of the blow But let the stronger man
take the lighter sword evidently he will obtain a higher velocity
which we will assume at  in this case the effect will be  Thus the
power of the Cut is enormously increased by increased velocity but
much less by increased weight in the moving body


  The Cuts

The Target prefixed to the Infantry Sword Exercise gives Seven
Cuts an insufficient number The German systems add an eighth blow
perpendicularly upwards when the whole of the swordsmans arm from
wrist to shoulder would be completely at the opponents mercy

The French Manuel has only seven viz the Coup de Tte  the
Coup de Banderole  the Coup de Figure  droite  the Coup de
Figure  gauche  the Coup de Flanc  the Coup de Ventre and
 the Coup de Manchette

Illustration German System

The subjoined diagram shows the Twelve Cuts which serve to loosen
the rigid arm of the recruit

Illustration The Twelve Cuts shown by the thick strokes the dotted
lines denoting the course of the blade in Moulinet or rather in

  Cut                         Cut  Groin and Thigh Cuts


The figure represents the opponent the thick lines show the direction
of the edge when cutting and the dotted continuations denote the
course of the blade when describing the several Moulinets

The Cuts should be continuous the regular succession always beginning
from Carte or the Inside that is from the rear of the left shoulder
As in the Moulinet the less the arm is bent and the swordhand is
moved from the line of direction to the front the greater is the
value of the movement The recruit who must walk before he runs
should deliver the whole dozen in continuous sweep without pause but
at first very slowly till by the proper and timely use of the wrist
the Cuts lead into one another The more advanced swordsman whose
pliability of strength is free from contractions and other vicious
habits should practise the series of twelve with increased rapidity
till the blade whistles through the air All the Cuts should be given
strong with the edge leading well forwards and with the arm extended
to its utmost in the delivery

The following are the Twelve Cuts

I and II These Cuts are made after falling into Tierce or Outside
Guard from above downwards at the opponents head In No I the
point beginning as usual from the left shoulder Carte describes
a full circle Inside Moulinet the bris  gauche of the French
Manuel the hand moving as little as possible so as to cover the
body the knuckles turned up and the blade passing close to the breast
it finishes by delivering a vertical Cut with the Feeble close to
the point at the right half of the adversarys crown No II which
follows without interruption reverses the process the knuckles are
turned down and the blade sweeps past the right shoulder bris 
droite ending with the left half of the opponents head The latter
Cut is by far the more difficult to make without moving the hand but
it is good practice for breaking the wrist

III and IV The horizontal facecuts also beginning from the left
Carte an invariable rule and ending with the right that is at
the adversarys left cheek The reason of this practice is to make the
movement habitual to the recruit cutting from left to right always
causes less exposure of the inner wrist than cutting from right to left

V and VI The slanting shouldercuts also from above downwards
Nos  and  or rather  and  of the Infantry Sword Exercise
pp   and the Coups de Banderole of the Manuel describing
two diagonal Moulinets first from left to right and then from right
to left The sword again makes a double Moulinet with the edge
downwards and descends first upon the opponents right and then upon
his left shoulder

VII and VIII The horizontal breastcuts parallel with the facecuts
and like them delivered with the blade as horizontal as possible

IX and X The horizontal stomachcuts parallel with and lower than
the breastcuts

XI and XII The slanting groin or thighcuts diagonally from
downwards upwards in fact the reverse of the shouldercuts Nos 
and  of the Exercise and the briss of the Manuel In these
diagonal Moulinets the elbow must not be bent the hand should deviate
as little as possible from the directing line under pain of dangerous
exposure and the two movements should follow each other without a
break

Whenever the recruit fails to carry the edge well forward in making the
attack he should be practised slowly and repeatedly in combining the
opposites as Headcut No  and Thighcut No  Headcut No 
and Thighcut No  and so forth The instructor must see that the
edge leads on to the respective lines of the Target the point being
darted out at the end of each cut

The Cuts will be practised first in No  Second Position Guard
and afterwards in No  Third Position Lunge

  The Engaging Guards or Engagements

As the Infantry Sword Exercise has a deficiency of Cuts so it has a
superfluity of Engaging Guards I have already expressed my opinion
concerning the Guard p  of  popularly called the Hanging
Guard Even with the best position the head erect and the eyes
looking straight and not upwards it is utterly faulty it displaces
the arm and the sword and as no serious attack can be made directly
from it it necessitates a movement entailing a considerable amount of
exposure It is now chiefly confined to students duels with the German
Schlger wherein slitting the opposing nose which can be done with a
mere jerk upwards is the swordsmans highest aim and ambition

The Engaging Guards are thus reduced to the two following

Tierce or outside Guard defending the outer lines arm shoulder
back and flank The recruit having assumed the Second Position No
 brings the pommel of his sword to the centre of his right breast
opposes the point to the adversarys right eye extends his right arm
with an easy bend of the elbow inclines the wrist with the knuckles
upwards to his own right so as to cover himself in case of a straight
thrust and places his left hand upon his left flank with the fingers
to the front and the thumb to the rear In Tierce of course the edge of
the sword is to the right or outside

Illustration Engaging Guard in Tierce Outside

Carte or Inside Guard This movement defends the inner lines chest
and stomach the knuckles are turned down the opposition is made to
the left and the edge is carried in the same direction

Illustration Engaging Guard in Carte Inside

When engaging in guard joining weapons the swords should meet each
other about eight inches from the points If the distance is diminished
the opponents are out of measure or distance if increased they
are within measure The recruit must be taught slightly to press upon
the opponents blade but not to rest upon it by this opposition
his hand and wrist will be more ready to follow the weapon during the
attack Thus also the Engaging Guards Tierce and Carte outside
and inside afford protection preparatory to the movements for offence
and defence The eye must be fixed upon the eye and the hand or the
bladepoint of the opponent not upon the eye only

Guard may be partly defensive when the bust is advanced and the point
approaches the opponent or it may be purely protective when its sole
object is the parry

The righthanded recruit must be taught always to attempt Engaging
in Tierce with his opponents blade in the outer line sur les
armes The reason is simply that in the reverse position dans les
armes the forearm from the elbow to the wrist is comparatively
unguarded whereas Tierce facilitates the defence of the low lines
i e those below the wrist Tierce therefore has invariably the
advantage with the sabre as Carte carries off the palm with the
smallsword the foil and the rapier But the righthanded man
engaging in Tierce puts his lefthanded opponent in Carte and the
latter if a skilful sworder will manuvre by withdrawing his blade
by coups or degagements over the point and by other feints to regain
the ground of vantage The best treatment of this case is to make a
timecut in Seconde inner Moulinet or bris  gauche at the
adversarys knuckles a movement which will presently be explained


  The Guards or Parries

The Infantry Sword Exercise proposes Seven Guards a number which can
hardly be reduced for practice on the drillground or in the schools
the Manuel contains the same number including one for the Point
But of the seven no less than five are Hanging Guards and Nos  and
 serve only to defend the inside and the outside of the advanced leg
This limb requires no assistance of the kind an able swordsman never
exposes his head and shoulders by cutting so low and if he does the
leg can be smartly withdrawn parade retrograde or en chappant
rendering the attack not only useless but dangerous to the assailant
Even in fencing low thrusts that is at the body below the wrist
are never made for fear of the Time being taken until the upper
line has been closed by a feint In our Singlestick practice the first
thought seems to be to attack the advanced legwhich may be well
enough for Singlestick

Illustration Lunge and Cut in Carte Inside

The following are the full number of guards or parries in which the
edge must invariably be used they are evidently dividable into two
 Head with face Guards and  Body Guards

I Prime p  so called because it is the first position of
defence after drawing the blade that which the unpractised man would
naturally assume to defend his head It is the th Guard of the
Infantry Sword Exercise In practice the point is more inclined to
the horizontal line than when the blade is unsheathed the edge is
carried somewhat inside or to the left the arm is shortened and so
raised that the eyes look under it but the head remains upright The
recruit must be careful not to bend the body not to draw in
the chest and neck and not to bring the left shoulder a little
forward The defect of Prime is its being a Hanging guard rendering
the riposte or reply difficult and modern practice prefers High
Tierce

II Seconde th Guard so termed because following Prime the arm
is extended the edge is carried to the outside or to the right in
practice the hilt is lowered and the point threatening the opponents
loins is depressed to the half of a right angle This position must
be learned for the sake of feinting as a parade it is not much used
because it defends only the hip and leg and a good swordsman will
never expose himself to exceeding danger by making low cuts Modern
practice prefers low Tierce

III Tierce nd Guard has been described p  under Standing
on Guard and Engaging Guards it defends the outer lines arm
shoulder and back

IV High Tierce is a headguard the hand is raised to above the
shoulder to the maximum level of the swordsmans right eye and the
blade is carried at an angle of  with the edge up and the point to
the left

V Low Tierce is a flankguard the arm is shortened the hand is
depressed six inches the opposition is to the outside and the point
is held vertically or almost vertically as the attack demands

VI Carte st Guard has been described p  under Engaging
Guards as defending the inner lines chest and stomach For the
purposes of parrying the arm is withdrawn till the elbow almost
touching the belt forms an equilateral triangle with the hilt and the
left side

VII High Carte is a headguard like high Tierce the hand is raised to
the left of the left eye and the blade crossing the face at an angle
of  carries the edge up and the point to the right

VIII Low Carte is a stomach guard As in Low Tierce the arm is
shortened the hand is depressed six inches the opposition is to the
inside and the point is held vertically or almost vertically as the
attack demands

In practice the advanced swordsman will confine himself to Tierce
and Carte with their natural modifications He will consult his own
feelings about the headguard abolishing Prime in favour of High
Tierce or High Carte and he will prefer Low Tierce or withdrawing
the leg rassemblement to using Seconde Of these movements the
simplest are always the best When parrying the swordarm must
invariably be drawn for defence nearer the body and the grip should be
sensibly tightened to receive the cut No strength is necessary when
making the parries I cannot accept the Sforzi or guardforcings of
the neoItalian broadsword school dry blows upon the blade which
intended to disarm are essentially dangerous

The Guards or Parries will be practised like the Cuts first in the
Second Position Guard and afterwards in the Third Position
Lunge




SECTION III

THE MANCHETTE OR FOREARM PLAY


  Preliminary

The recruit is now sufficiently advanced to begin the system of
Manchette which as it is the most valuable part of sworddrill has
been practised the least and should be practised the most A swordsman
thoroughly trained in this section does not allow the opponent to
deliver a cut It is certain that hand and wrist shortarm and
elbow are capable of as many different attacks and defences as the
whole body these are the parts most prominent most exposed and
consequently most readily made the point de mire Yet this true and
simple secret of the broadsword has been universally neglected or
rather not worked out in England we content ourselves with the parades
technically called retrogrades that is withdrawing the limb from
the assault by shortening the arm and sometimes by retiring the
right foot either near to or up to or behind the left heel even this
evasion which cannot expect to pass for a Guard is not described nor
figured in the official Infantry Sword Exercise In France and
even in Italy where most subjects are exhaustively treated Manchette
is dismissed with a few careless words The Manuel gives to the Coup
de Manchette only these few lines Excuter un enlev vertical
Moulinet from above downwards en arrire  droite et arrter le
sabre visvis le milieu du Corps le tranchant en dessus le poule
lgrement  droite diriger lenlev de manire  empcher en arrtant
lavant bras lexcution dun coup de tte Capitano Settimo del
Frate p  Istruzione sul Maneggio e Scherma della Sciabola in
one of the latest works on swordsmanship contents himself with the
following desultory observations

Manchett sic can attack the forearm either above or below
according as the opponent gives an opening

Manchett is generally used against an adversary whose guard is
defective By merely extending the arm with a turn of the wrist this
attack may readily succeed should the opponent neglect to provide
against it

One of the most dangerous guards against Manchett is Tierce the
surest is High Seconde which indeed is also the best parry adapted to
this system of attack

The first member of the last paragraph is sensible the second is
thoroughly fallacious As has been stated the righthanded man must
always engage in Tierce and as will presently appear Tierce is the
safest indeed the only safe guard against Manchette cuts Another
Italian writer of our day describes and figures the Position of the
weaponed arm to escape the armcut Colpo di braccio with the
elbowjoint left clean open The Infantry Sword Exercise limits
itself p  to these few lines If opposed to the Small Sword
sic meaning straight sword or rapier have recourse to Cuts Three
No  of this system and Four No  directing them at the arm
by which means there is every probability of the cuts taking effect
as it must always come within range of the edge before the point can
be sufficiently advanced to reach your body if the above cuts are
quickly given and continued they will also be found advantageous in
advancing against the Small Sword as they constitute an attack and
form a defence at the same moment but should the opponent be the most
skilful and quickest sic in his movements then it is best to
retire whilst giving them cautiously preserving the proper distance
so that each cut may just reach the fore part of his arm The French
content themselves with single oppositions of Tierce and Carte But why
multiply instances of ignorancethey would fill many a useless page

Finally I meditated upon the comparative humanity of Manchette of
disabling the opponent by an armcut rather than laying open his flank
or his head During single rencontres in the field especially at the
end of Indian battles it is so often necessary to put hors de combat
some unfortunate whose pluck or sense of honour induces him to prolong
the hopeless attack

These considerations led me to reflect seriously for a number of years
upon the Jeu de Manchette the Colpi all avambraccio or forearm
play which has been so much neglected by masterswordsmen At last an
unlookedfor opportunity a short study in the Salle darmes of Herr
Balthasar Reich of Trieste enabled me to reduce it to a system and
present it to the public

I should premise however that the following observations are intended
for professional men It is therefore necessary only to name and
number the Direct Cuts the Guards and the Feints the Reverse Cuts
and the Time Cuts of Manchette as in most cases the simplest mention
will suffice The proficient will at once perceive that I offer a
mere outline of the system whose many details must be learned by long
practice It is enough to give first principles the minuti could not
even be noticed without stretching description to a wearisome length

There is no objection I have said to teaching squads of recruits all
the simpler preparatory matter the Three Positions the Moulinet
the Engaging Guard and the Guards or Parries At a certain stage of
progress however especially when beginning Manchette the quick and
intelligent soldier who is likely to qualify himself as a master must
be instructed singly


  The Direct Cuts in Manchette

The following are the direct attacks in Manchette simple and
compound all are done from the Engaging Guard the Lunge being here
inadmissible

I Carte de ManchetteExtend the swordarm to the full length and
deliver the cut with a flip as it were at the opponents forearm
between the elbow and the wrist This can be done with the back of the
blade Reverse Cut under circumstances presently to be described No
I is useful if the adversary unwisely engages you in Carte otherwise
from Tierce it must be avoided as he easily parries by withdrawing
the arm and replies with a Tierce Cut

II Carte de Manchette and Cut TierceThis movement is No I
followed by a close rotation of the point Tierce Moulinet if
however the circle be too small it will not clear the swordguard

III Double Carte de Manchette and Cut CarteNo III is to be done
when the opponent as he generally will after an attack of No II
successively parries Carte and Tierce It is simply the double of No
I and thus the Tierce Moulinet cuts of course inside the arm

IV Double Carte de Manchette and Cut TierceUseful when the
adversary parries Carte Tierce and Carte it is the double of No II
and thus cuts outside the arm

No II guards the arm and is therefore unexceptionable Nos III and
IV are dangerous because like No I when opposed to an agile hand
they may lay the wrist open to a Time Cut

The two first and all four against a slow unready swordsman may be
varied by combinations with coups or passing the blade sharply over
the adversarys point For instance if the adversary come too wildly
to the Tierce parade of your double Carte and Tierce No III a
coup will reach his arm in Carte

A golden rule which cannot be repeated too often is that all the
ManchetteCuts in Tierce outside either from above or from below
must be as nearly vertical as possible whilst all the Cuts in Carte
inside should be as horizontal as they can be made The reason is
simply that these positions cover the arm and render the attack less
dangerous


  The Guards Parries and Feints in Manchette

The Guards of the Target will be found sufficient for parrying all
attacks in Manchette The soldier however should especially practise
the retrograde parades that is withdrawing the right forearm with and
without the right leg

Feinting with the broadsword is necessarily more simple than with
the foil being generally confined to Coups and Secondes The
neoItalian school of sabre uses I have said the fencing movements
but it is at best a bastard style If the opponent attempts to
degage that is to pass his point under your blade from Tierce to
Carte or vice vers retire by withdrawing the right heel to the
left and cut at the arm which his movement has exposed

The Coup the reverse of the degagement passes the point over not
under the opposing blade this legitimate feint used in every school
may be effected in four several ways

I One From the usual engagement in Tierce pass the blade over the
opposite point just clearing it and cut inside The two movements
raising and dropping the point should be as rapid as possible

II One Two a double Coup with the cut in Tierce

III One Two Three as with the foil against a nervous opponent
the cut should be made at the face with a dart and a jerk the Italian
Slancio against a slow player the cut may be Carte de Manchette

IV One Two Three Four like the former but cutting in Tierce to
be attempted only with the most unready of opponents

The two latter may be combined with a breast inside or shoulder
outside Moulinet between the penultimate and the last cut
movement but these long feints are radically vicious because they lay
the swordsman open to Time Cuts They are however useful as will
appear in making the Reverse Cuts

Perhaps the Secondefeints are better than the Coups

I One the simple Seconde CutMake a little more opposition in
Tierce sweep the blade past and along the breast inside Moulinet
or the bris  gauche and lowering the hand a little cut upwards
with a jerk and a flip The nearer the swordsmans own body his blade
circles the better because the cut will be more in the vertical line
if it be much out of the perpendicular the opponent can take a time
in Carte The Moulinet serves also to embarrass the adversary and to
add strength to the cut This simple and most valuable movement must
not be confounded with the oldfashioned Seconde cut at the leg the
latter is objected to as I have said by swordsmen the parry is too
easy and the ripost far too dangerous

II Feint SecondeFrom Tierce make a short and sharp movement to
Seconde with the knuckles turned upwards the opponent will probably
come to the Secondeparry thereby exposing the forearm You then cut
Tierce perpendicularly as usual from above downwards the enlev
either without or with a breast Moulinet

III Feint Seconde Feint Tierce and Cut Carte with two short sharp
movements and deliver the horizontal cut in Carte

IV Feint Seconde feint Tierce and Cut Seconde from downwards
upwards always with a breast Moulinet

At times the two first feinting movements in Nos III and IV may
be done more emphatically this of course makes the movement slower
but it is a variety which embarrasses an adversary accustomed only to
short quick action


  The Reverse or Back Cuts in Manchette

As the Manchette system has been strangely neglected so the Reverse or
Back Cut may be pronounced unknown to the majority of the profession
the latter instead of utilizing the false edge of the blade still
lose time and incur great danger by turning hand and wrist in using
the true edge especially when Cutting within the Sword More
extraordinary still although almost all the civilized world prefers
what is technically called the flatbacked and spearpointed sabre
yet no one seems to think of employing or even of sharpening one of
the most important parts of the weapon

The Regulation blade with the false edge that is to say the blade
sharpened from the point to the Centre of Percussion about onethird
of the length was introduced into England about  and the first
specimens were made by the late Henry Wilkinson acting with the
late Henry Angelo then Superintendent of Sword Exercise This
backedge of the blade should be ground to the sharpness of a razor
When practising the Reverse Cuts Revers or Rovescio the handle
is held loosely with the thumb and the two first fingers and the wrist
and forearm should bring the blade up with a jerk the grip being
at the same time sharply tightened Practice will soon enable the
swordsman to deliver a strong drawing cut equal to the Thrustcut of
the socalled Damascus blades This valuable movement has the immense
merit of not uncovering the swordsman and what makes the sabre so rude
a weapon is that every movement of attack in the old systems lays
the body open by raising hand and point when a blow is to be given
With the Reverse Cut no such dangerous process is necessary the point
is still directed at the opponent whilst the cut is being delivered
Finally it is always unexpected by the opponent who has not practised
it and although it rarely begins an assault except against the
inexperienced nor should it be done alone as a rule it may either
follow or conclude every attack feint or time

I The HalfFeint Revers de dessous Rovescio di sotto or
Revers von unten is done thusWhen in Tierce extend the arm as if
intending to cut Tierce the opponent makes an opposition of Tierce
drop the point and cut sharply upwards with the false edge at his
fingers wrist or forearm drawing the blade towards you and keeping
the point opposite the adversarys breast This movement is one of the
neatest known and it is sure to succeed with one who does not expect
it The first part of the feint or dropping the point may lead to a
cut with the true edge but this movement which is still practised
in the schools involves delay by turning the hand Again it may be
combined with the inside breast or outside shoulder Moulinet

II Feint Seconde and Cut upwardsThis movement may be varied by
feinting Tierce and cutting upwards

III OnetwothreeThis is not the succession of simple Coups
the dangerous movement before described No  Coup shifts the hand
from Tierce to Carte with the nails up No  turns the nails down
still remaining in Carte and No  delivers the Reverse Cut of course
in Carte where it is least expected

When the point is passed well under and within the swordarm it is very
difficult to parry the horizontal Reverse Cut in Carte The true edge
may be used but again it wastes time by turning the hand

IV The Pass properly called en passantFrom Tierce make a
feintmovement in Seconde and when the adversary attempts to parry
it by lowering the point turn the knuckles up in old Tierce sweep
the blade over his swordarm and as close as possible to your right
leg from left to right with the arm well raised and returning from
right to left with a similar sweep but with the blade held higher
cut in Carte with the false edge and close to the point inside his
wrist Unskilfully attempted this feint is equally dangerous to both
but it will do yeomans service in the hands of a practised swordsman
The true edge may be used but that involves a change of position and
the delay of turning the hand with the knuckles downwards Some make
a double sweep and after the second movement cut outside or in
Tiercethe exposure is too great unless confronted by an unusually
phlegmatic temperament


  The Time Cuts in Manchette

The Time Cut is the flower of the Manchette system as the Manchette
is of the broadsword and it is perhaps the part least capable of
being taught in books When well mastered it never allows the opponent
to raise his arm without imminent risk and even if it fail the
intention once recognized tends greatly to cramp and embarrass the
adversarys play The natural man cuts as if he were using a stick or
a club and the preliminary movement lays open the whole of his body
indeed exposure I have said is the main danger of every attack with
the sabre however closely and skilfully conducted A cut through the
muscles of the forearm either inside or outside causes the sword
instantly to be relaxed and dropped the man in fact is hamstrung in
the upper works

I Carte de ManchetteWhen the opponent from Tierce makes a Coup
or any attack in Carte stop further movement by a Carte de Manchette
a horizontal Cut in Carte The same may be done with the false edge in
which case the blade should be advanced as far as is possible and this
is to be preferred because it loses less time

II Parade Retrograde and Cut TierceWhen the opponent from Tierce
attempts a Manchette in Carte withdraw the arm parade retrograde
and deliver the vertical Cut in Tierce downwards at his extended arm
both movements being combined in one It is not necessary even with
the tallest man to withdraw the right leg the Cut will amply suffice
This Tierce Cut serves to defend from all attacks when the Guard does
not cover the adversary and it has lopped off many a careless arm If
slowly done it becomes a mere parade and ripost

III The Reverse Cutupwards Revers en montant Rovescio
montante Ger Revers montantYou feint in Seconde the opponent
comes to its parry and replies in Tierce you withdraw the arm leaving
the heels as they were and cut upwards with the false edge tightening
the grasp of thumb and forefingers as much as possible This movement
is especially useful it is one of the best of Time Cuts when the
adversary indulges in long and complicated feints and false attacks It
may be done with the true edge but the latter is less safe

IV The Time Pass which is merely The Pass turned into a Time
Cut When the opponent attempts a Manchette or any movement in
Seconde and expects you to reply by a time Cut in Tierce with the
true edge turn the knuckles up in old Tierce sweep the blade over
his swordarm as close as possible to your right leg from left to
right with the arm well raised and returning from right to left with
a similar sweep but with the blade held higher cut in Carte with the
false edge and close to the point inside his wrist The true edge may
be used but again it wastes time The double sweep possible as in
The Pass but it causes too much exposure

This Time Pass may also be done with the hand held high in Prime or
rather demicircle with the nails turned up the arm outstretched
and the point lowered In this case the leg must be shifted till the
fore heel touches the rear heel so as to give additional height to the
hand This is not a Reverse or Back Cut as you use the true edge it is
in fact one of the old movements called Cutting within the Sword

CONCLUSION

I will end this system of Manchette with the words of old Achille
Marozzo written some three centuries and a half ago I would that ye
swear upon your swordhilts never to use this knowledge against me
your master But in lieu of insisting that my readers never teach it
without obtaining formal permission I only hope that they will favour
me by spreading it far and wide




APPENDIX


In p  allusion has been made to an improved form of sabre handle
it was first attempted by the Capitano Settimo del Frate in the work
before alluded to The gallant officers Plates show that in the
Italian cavalrysword the upper portion of the handle is at least
horizontal whereas in ours it droops backwards and downwards giving
the grip additional facility for slipping out of the swordsmans grasp
The authors remarks being even more applicable to the English
military sabre I give them at full length

The equilibrium of the sabre and the facility of firmly grasping the
handle are the two prime requisites for a good weapon

When properly balanced and easily held the sword calls for less
exertion of strength and the quickness and true direction of the Cuts
are greatly facilitated In direct proportion to the economy of force
we find the swordsman enabled to continue his exertion

However well made and scientifically poised be the blade it is
subject to several variations of equilibrium according to the position
in which it is held

The nearer the centre of gravity approaches the hilt the lighter and
the better balanced will be the weapon and vice vers Therefore

It should be our principal object to effect this improvement without
changing the proper centre of percussion and the other requisites for
offence and defence

The following Plates fully explain the authors meaning

I would further modify his Fig  so as to give more fulcrum to the
hand The thumbplate should be made weighty and the guard light
otherwise the blade will be overbalanced that is heavier on one
side than on the other It need hardly be said that the grip before
going into battle should be whipped round with thin whipcord or better
still with webcloth

 The question is considered at great length in my forthcoming volume
entitled The Sword here it is sufficient simply to state results

 When every regiment shall have its salle darmes the fencer
will modify his own fencing thrusts to suit the clumsier weapon I
do not however see any reason why the three Points of the Infantry
Sword Exercise should not be delivered in the posizione media of the
Italian school with the thumb upwards and extended along the back
of the swordhandle nor why as in the French Manuel they should
not be reduced to a single Coup de Pointe p  which is thus

 As Mr John Latham justly says The Shape of Swordblades
Journal of the Royal United Service Institution vol viThe
proper shape for a thrusting sword is preeminently straight The
Claymore for instance moving in a direct line cuts a hole exactly
the size of the blade the Regulation sword slightly curved widens
it to about double and the bent scimitar and the Talwr to five or
six times thus meeting with five or six times the resistance to its
penetration Mr Latham is again quoted in another part of this System

 My only objections to this volume are the two following

a The author will throw the whole weight of the body on the
left leg Fig  p  Yet in his Introductory Remarks p
 he sensibly says To the haunches as to the common centre of
motion of the human figure are ultimately referred all the movements
performed in military tactics and swordsmanship as just poise is
important to the correct exertion of action whatever it may be it is
necessary that poise or balance be studied understood and tried in
all positions It is clear that bodily action cannot possess compass
power and ease unless the movement be made justly and correctly upon
the haunches as on a central pivot If the movement have not compass
power and ease force and endurance will not be found in the Military
act

b In the Lunge our author not only keeps the body perfectly
erect he even inclines it backwards whilst he allows both feet to
abandon the perpendicular in the most slovenly way see Fig  p
 and Figs  and  p  The same is the case with the official
Infantry Sword Exercise

 My old friend and instructor set out upon a thoroughly scientific
principle and the able way in which he has worked out his system will
entitle him to the gratitude of the posteri Having established
the fact that in all our popular athletic as opposed to gymnastic
exercises our walking and running cricket and football fives
tennis and racquets and especially rowingwhich has advanced as
an art but has declined as an exercisewe circumscribe the line of
muscular operation by giving the greatest share of the work to the
lower limbs and by developing one half to the injury of the other he
resolved to cultivate the whole by a wider and more varied range of
training hence he supplemented Recreative exercise by Educational
exercise and hence his systematized national gymnasia which taken
up by HRH the Duke of Cambridge and by the late Sidney Herbert have
been introduced into the military stations of the Cardwell system into
Oxford and Cambridge and into all our public schools with one base
exceptionEton

Mr MacLaren in his System of Fencing c p  sensibly
advocates resting the weight of the body equally upon both legs
He also lowers the right hand in the Lunge p  and ibid he
throws the trunk forward perhaps with a little exaggeration

 The Infantry Sword Exercise see the figures over the Target
representing the Preparatory Positions Second Position in 
Motions makes No  turn the left knee out instead of carrying it
square to the front the same may be remarked in Balance Motions No


 The Moulinet Ital Molinetto is even on horseback a favourite
movement with French sabrers See Rglement Provisoire c Tome I
Titres I et II It is divided into

  gauche Moulinet  temps  mouvements The directions are
 la dernire partie du commandement qui est MOULINET tendre le
bras droit en avant de toute sa longueur le poignet en tierce et 
hauteur des yeux

Baisser la lame en arrire du coude gauche pour dcrire un circle
darrire en avant  et se remettre en garde

  droite Moulinet  temps  mouvements  la dernire partie
du commandement qui est MOULINET tendre le bras droit en avant de
toute sa longueur le poignet en quarte et  hauteur des yeux

Baisser la lame en arrire du coude droit pour dcrire un circle
darrire en avant  et se remettre en garde

  gauche et  droite Moulinet  temps  mouvements  la
dernire partie du commandement qui est MOULINET excuter le premier
mouvement de  gauche Moulinet

Excuter alternativement et sans sarrter sur aucun mouvement le
Moulinet  gauche et le Moulinet  droite

   gauche et  droite  MOULINET

  droite et  gauche Moulinet  temps  mouvements  la
dernire partie du commandement qui est MOULINET excuter le premier
mouvement de  droite Moulinet

Excuter alternativement et sans sarrter sur aucun mouvement le
Moulinet  droite et le Moulinet  gauche

   droite et  gauche  MOULINET

 En arrire Moulinet  temps  mouvements  la dernire partie
du commandement qui est MOULINET lever le bras en arrire  droite
de toute sa longueur la pointe du sabre en lair le tranchant 
droite le pouce allong sur le dos de la poigne le corps lgrement
tourn  droite

Dcrire un circle en arrire de gauche  droite le poignet loign du
corps le plus possible et se remettre en garde

  En arrire  MOULINET

Les cavaliers excutant bien les Moulinets on leur en fait faire
plusieurs de suite en faisant prcder cet exercice de lindication
les Moulinets continueront jusqau commandement EN GARDE

Les Moulinets ayant pour objet dassouplir les articulations du
bras et du poignet il faut que les cavaliers y soient exercs comme
prparation aux autres mouvements on commence et on finit donc chaque
leon par des Moulinets excuts  un degr de vitesse proportionn aux
progrs des cavaliers

 In the Regulation sword the centre of percussion is about
onethird from the point here there is no vibration and consequently
the Cut exercises its whole force The centre of gravity is in the
third nearest the hilt and the balance of the sword results from the
relative positions of the two centres In light swords these points
may be farther apart than in heavy blades they should be closer in
straight than in curved swords and nearer in thrusting than in cutting
weapons

 The following are the five principal ways of cutting

 The Chopping or Downright Cut from the shoulder and forearm This
appears to be the instinctive method preserved by Europe most men who
take up a sword for the first time use it in this way

 The Sliding Cut common throughout the East In this movement the
elbow and wrist are held stiff and the blow is given from the strong
muscles of the back and shoulder nearly ten times larger than the
muscles of the arm while the whole force and weight of the body
are thrown in Hence the people of India use small hilts with mere
crutchguards which confine the hand and prevent the play of the
wrist the larger grip required for the Chopping Cut only lessens the
cutting force The terrible effect of these cuts is well known

 The Thrust Cut with the curved Damascus blade a combination of
point and edge the latter being obliquely thrust forward and along the
body aimed at This movement is a favourite on horseback when speed
supplies the necessary force which can hardly be applied on foot It
must be parried like a Point

 The Whip Cut in which the arm and elbow are kept almost motionless
and the blow is delivered from the wrist This is the principal Cut
allowed in my system it is capable of sufficient effect upon the
opponent whilst it does not uncover the swordsman who uses it

 The Drawing or Reverse Cut which will be explained in the following
pages it is the reverse of the Thrust Cut

 This fact is well known to the Manuel which says Des deux
engagements celui de droite par la position de la main a le plus
dapplication It therefore makes all the Cuts and Parries begin from
Tierce This elementary rule is not recognized by the Infantry Sword
Exercise p  your defence is always more effective in the left
Carte than in the right Tierce Such I assert is the case with
the foil and rapier certainly not with the sabre or broadsword On
horseback the left is of course the weak side

 Used in this sense the smallsword is the triangular weapon the
rapier is the flat or rather the biconvex blade

 In p  of the Infantry Sword Exercise we read of a circular
motion of the blade termed the Parry but the latter word must not be
limited to this sense

 The only allusion to it is the shifting of the leg in p 

 See the Infantry Sword Exercise p 

 In France the false edge is hardly known such blades are called
 deux tranchants it is the Italian schiena or chine mezzofilo
or falso opposed to vero taglio and the German rckschneide or
kurzeschneide thus distinguished from the langeschneide

 See his Appendix entitled Modificazione all impugnatura e
guardia delle Sciabola di cavalleria per facilitarne lequilibrio ed
avantaggiare la fermezza della mano sull impugnatura

 A notable instance of this is the old Highland Claymore

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone  For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included  Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility
