     The aliens wooed Earth with gifts love patience and
      peace
     Who could resist them After all no one shoots Santa
      Claus

                                   




     The rifle lay comfortably in his hands a gleaming precision
     instrument that exuded a faint odor of gun oil and powder
     solvent It was a perfect specimen of the gunsmiths art a
     semiautomatic rifle with a telescopic sighta precisely
     engineered tool that could hurl death with pinpoint accuracy
     for better than half a mile

Daniel Matson eyed the weapon with bleak gray eyes the eyes of a
hunter framed in the passionless face of an executioner His blunt
hands were steady as they lifted the gun and tried a dry shot at an
imaginary target He nodded to himself He was ready Carefully he
laid the rifle down on the mattress which covered the floor of his
firing point and looked out through the hole in the brickwork to the
narrow canyon of the street below

The crowd had thickened It had been gathering since early morning
and the growing press of spectators had now become solid walls of
people lining the street packed tightly together on the sidewalks
Yet despite the fact that there were virtually no police the crowd
did not overflow into the streets nor was there any of the pushing
crowding impatience that once attended an assemblage of this sort
Instead there was a placid tolerance a spirit of friendly good will
an ingenuous complaisance that grated on Matsons nerves like the
screeching rasp of a file drawn across the edge of thin metal He
shivered uncontrollably It was hard to be a free man in a world of
slaves

It was a measure of the Aztlans triumph that only a bare halfdozen
police copters patrolled the empty skies above the parade route The
aliens had done thishad conquered the world without firing a shot or
speaking a word in anger They had wooed Earth with understanding
patience and superlative guileand Earth had fallen into their hands
like a lovesick virgin There never had been any real opposition and
what there was had been completely ineffective Most of those who had
opposed the aliens were out of circulation imprisoned in correctional
institutions undergoing rehabilitation Rehabilitation a six bit
word for dehumanizing When those poor devils finished their treatment
with Aztlan brainwashing techniques they would be just like these
sheep below with the difference that they would never be able to be
anything else But these other stupid fools crowding the sidewalks
waiting to hail their destructionthese were the ones who must be
saved Theynot the martyrs of the underground were the important
part of humanity

A police copter windmilled slowly down the avenue toward his hiding
place the rotating vanes and insect body of the craft starkly
outlined against the jagged backdrop of the citys skyline He laughed
soundlessly as the susurrating flutter of the rotor blades beat
overhead and died whispering in the distance down the long canyon of
the street His position had been chosen with care and was invisible
from air and ground alike He had selected it months ago and had
taken considerable pains to conceal its true purpose But after today
concealment wouldnt matter If things went as he hoped the place
might someday become a shrine The idea amused him

Strange he mused how events conspire to change a mans career Seven
years ago he had been a respected and important member of that far
different sort of crowd which had welcomed the visitors from space
That was a human crowdhalf afraid wholly curious jostling noisy
pushinga teeming swarm that clustered in a thick disorderly ring
around the silver disc that lay in the center of the International
Airport overlooking Puget Sound Thenhe could have predicted his
career And none of the predictions would have been truefor none
included a man with a rifle waiting in a blind for the game to
approach within range

The Aztlan ship had landed early that July morning dropping silently
through the overcast covering International Airport It settled gently
to rest precisely in the center of the junction of the three main
runways of the field effectively tying up the transcontinental and
transoceanic traffic Fully five hundred feet in diameter the giant
ship squatted massively on the runway junction cracking and buckling
the thick concrete runways under its enormous weight

By noon after the first skepticism had died and the unbelievable TV
pictures had been flashed to their waiting audience the crowd began
to gather All through that hot July morning they came increasing by
the minute as farther outlying districts poured their curious into the
Airport By early afternoon literally hundreds of millions of eyes
were watching the great ship over a worldwide network of television
stations which cancelled their regular programs to give their viewers
an uninterrupted view of the enigmatic craft

By midmorning the sun had burned off the overcast and was shining
with brassy brilliance upon the squads of sweating soldiers from Fort
Lewis and more sweating squads of blueclad police from the
metropolitan area of SeattleTacoma The police and soldiery quickly
formed a ring around the ship and cleared a narrow lane around the
periphery and this they maintained despite the increasing pressure of
the crowd

The hours passed and nothing happened The faint creaking and snapping
sounds as the seamless hull of the vessel warmed its spacechilled
metal in the warmth of the summer sun were lost in the growing
impatience of the crowd They wanted something to happen Shouts and
catcalls filled the air as more nervous individuals clamored to
relieve the tension Off to one side a small group began to clap their
hands rhythmically The little claque gained recruits and within
moments the air was riven by the thunder of thousands of palms meeting
in unison Frightened the crowd might be but greater than fear was
the desire to see what sort of creatures were inside

Matson stood in the cleared area surrounding the ship a position of
privilege he shared with a few city and state officials and the high
brass from McChord Field Fort Lewis and Bremerton Navy Yard He was
one of the bright young men who had chosen Government Service as a
career and who in these days of scienceconsciousness had risen
rapidly through ability and merit promotions to become the Director of
the Office of Scientific Research while still in his early thirties A
dedicated man trained in the bitter school of ideological survival
he understood what the alien science could mean to this world Their
knowledge would secure peace in whatever terms the possessors cared to
name and Matson intended to make sure that his nation was the one
which possessed that knowledge

He stood beside a tall scholarly looking man named Roger Thornton who
was his friend and incidentally the Commissioner of Police for the
Twin City metropolitan area To a casual eye their positions should
be reversed for the lean ascetic Thornton looked far more like the
accepted idea of a scientist than burly thick shouldered square
faced Matson whose every movement shouted Cop

Matson glanced quizzically at the taller man Well Roger I wonder
how long those birds inside are going to keep us waiting before we get
a look at them

Youd be surprised if they really were birds wouldnt you Thornton
asked with a faint smile But seriously I hope it isnt too much
longer This mob is giving the boys a bad time He looked anxiously
at the strained line of police and soldiery I guess I should have
ordered out the night shift and reserves instead of just the riot
squad From the looks of things theyll be needed if this crowd gets
any more unruly

Matson chuckled Youre an alarmist he said mildly As far as I
can see theyre doing all right Im not worried about themor the
crowd for that matter The thing thats bothering me is my feet Ive
been standing on em for six hours and theyre killing me

Mine too Thornton sighed Tell you what Ill do When this is all
over Ill split a bucket of hot water and a pint of arnica with you

Its a deal Matson said

As he spoke a deep musical hum came from inside the ship and a
section of the rim beside him separated along invisible lines of
juncture swinging downward to form a broad ramp leading upward to a
square orifice in the rim of the ship A bright shadowless light that
seemed to come from the metal walls of the opening framed the shape of
the star traveller who stood there rigidly erect looking over the
heads of the section of the crowd before him

A concerted gasp of awe and admiration rose from the crowda gasp
that was echoed throughout the entire ring that surrounded the ship
There must be other openings like this one Matson thought dully as he
stared at the being from space Behind him an Army tank rumbled
noisily on its treads as it drove through the crowd toward the ship
the long gun in its turret lifting like an alert finger to point at
the figure of the alien

The stranger didnt move from his unnaturally stiff position His
oddly luminous eyes never wavered from their fixed stare at a point
far beyond the outermost fringes of the crowd Seven feet tall
obviously masculine he differed from mankind only in minor details
His long slender hands lacked the little finger and his waist was
abnormally small Other than that he was human in external
appearance A wide sleeved tunic of metallic fabric covered his upper
body gathered in at his narrow waist by a broad metal belt studded
with tiny bosses The tunic ended halfway between hip and knee
revealing powerfully muscled legs encased in silvery hose Bright
yellow hair hung to his shoulders clipped short in a square bang
across his forehead His face was long clean featured and
extraordinarily calmalmost godlike in its repose Matson stared
fascinated He had the curious impression that the visitor had
stepped bodily out of the Middle Ages His dress and haircut were
almost identical with that of a medieval courtier

The starman raised his handhis strangely luminous steel gray eyes
scanned the crowdand into Matsons mind came a wave of peaceful
calm a warm feeling of goodwill and brotherhood an indescribable
feeling of soothing relaxation With an odd sense of shock Matson
realized that he was not the only one to experience this As far back
as the farthest hangerson near the airport gates the tenseness of the
waiting crowd relaxed The effect was amazing Troops lowered their
weapons with shamefaced smiles on their faces Police relaxed their
sweating vigilance The crowd stirred moving backward to give its
members room The emotioncharged atmosphere vanished as though it had
never been And a cold chill played icy fingers up the spine of Daniel
Matson He had felt the full impact of the aliens projection and he
was more frightened than he had ever been in his life

                                   

They had been cleverdamnably clever That initial greeting with its
disarming undertones of empathy and innocence had accomplished its
purpose It had emasculated Mankinds natural suspicion of strangers
And their subsequent actionsso beautifully timedso careful to
avoid the slightest hint of evil had completed what their
magnificently staged appearance had begun

The feeling of trust had persisted It lasted through quarantine
clearance the public receptions and the private meetings with
scientists and the heads of government It had persisted unabated
through the entire two months they remained in the Twin City area The
aliens remained as they had been in the beginningcompletely
unspoiled by the interest shown in them They remained simple
unaffected and friendly displaying an ingenuous innocence that
demanded a corresponding faith in return

Most of their time was spent at the University of Washington where at
their own request they were studied by curious scholars and in return
were given courses in human history and behavior They were quite
frank about their reasons for following such a course of
actionaccording to their spokesman Ixtl they wanted to learn human
ways in order to make a better impression when they visited the rest
of Mankind Matson read that blurb in an official press release and
laughed cynically Better impression hah They couldnt have done any
better if they had an entire corps of public relations specialists
assisting them They struck exactly the right noteand how could they
improve on perfection

From the beginning they left their great ship open and unguarded while
they commuted back and forth from the airport to the campus And
naturally the government quickly rectified the second error and took
instant advantage of the first A guard was posted around the ship to
keep it clear of the unofficially curious while the officially
curious combed the vessels interior with a fine tooth comb Teams of
scientists and technicians under Matsons direction swarmed through
the ship searching with the most advanced methods of human science
for the secrets of the aliens

They quickly discovered that while the star travellers might be
trusting they were not exactly fools There was nothing about the
impenetrably shielded mechanisms that gave the slightest clue as to
their purpose or to the principles upon which they operatednor were
there any visible controls The ship was as blankly uncommunicative as
a brick wall

Matson was annoyed He had expected more than this and his
frustration drove him to watch the aliens closely He followed them
sat in on their sessions with the scholars at the University watched
them at their frequent public appearances and came to know them well
enough to recognize the microscopic differences that made them
individuals To the casual eye they were as alike as peas in a pod
but Matson could separate Farn from Quicha and Laz from Acanaand
Ixtlwell he would have stood out from the others in any
circumstances But Matson never intruded He was content to sit in the
background and observe

And what he saw bothered him They gave him no reason for their
appearance on Earth and whenever the question came up Ixtl parried it
adroitly They were obviously not explorers for they displayed a
startling familiarity with Earths geography and ecology They were
possibly ambassadors although they behaved like no ambassadors he had
ever seen They might be traders although what they would trade only
God and the aliens knewand neither party was in a talking mood
Mysteries bothered Matson He didnt like them But they could keep
their mystery if he could only have the technical knowledge that was
concealed beneath their beautifully shaped skulls

At that he had to admit that their appearance had come at precisely
the right time No one better than he knew how close Mankind had been
to the final war when the last two major antagonists on Earth were
girding their human and industrial power for a final showdown But the
aliens had become a diversion The impending war was forgotten while
men waited to see what was coming next It was obvious that the
starmen had a reason for being here and until they chose to reveal
it humanity would forget its deadly problems in anticipation of the
answer to this delightful puzzle that had come to them from outer
space Matson was thankful for the breathing space all too well aware
that it might be the last that Mankind might have but the enigma of
the aliens still bothered him


He was walking down the main corridor of the Physics Building on the
University campus wondering as he constantly did about how he could
extract some useful knowledge from the aliens when a quiet voice
speaking accentless English sounded behind him

What precisely do you wish to know Dr Matson the voice said

Matson whirled to face the questioner and looked into the face of
Ixtl The alien was smiling apparently pleased at having startled
him What gave you the idea that I wanted to know anything he
asked

You did Ixtl said We all have been conscious of your thoughts for
many days Forgive me for intruding but I must Your speculations
radiate on such a broad band that we cannot help being aware of them
It has been quite difficult for us to study your customs and history
with this high level background noise We are aware of your interest
but your thoughts are so confused that we have never found questions
we could answer If you would be more specific we would be happy to
give you the information which you seek

Oh yeah Matson thought

Of course It would be to our advantage to have your disturbing
speculations satisfied and your fears set at rest We could accomplish
more in a calmer environment It is too bad that you do not receive as
strongly as you transmit If you did direct mental contact would
convince you that our reasons for satisfying you are good But you
need not fear us Earthman We intend you no harm Indeed we plan to
help you once we learn enough to formulate a proper program

I do not fear you Matson saidknowing that he lied

Perhaps not consciously Ixtl said graciously but nevertheless
fear is in you It is too badand besides he continued with a faint
smile it is very uncomfortable Your glandular emotions are quite
primitive and very disturbing

Ill try to keep them under control Matson said dryly

Physical control is not enough With you there would have to be
mental control as well Unfortunately you radiate much more strongly
than your fellow men and we are unable to shut you out without
exerting considerable effort that could better be employed elsewhere
The alien eyed Matson speculatively There you go again he said
Now youre angry

Matson tried to force his mind to utter blankness and the alien
smiled at him It does some goodbut not much he said Conscious
control is never perfect

Well then what can I do

Go away Your range fortunately is short

Matson looked at the alien Not yet he said coldly Im still
looking for something

Our technology Ixtl nodded I know However I can assure you it
will be of no help to you You simply do not have the necessary
background Our science is based upon a completely different
philosophy from yours

To Matson the terms were contradictory

Not as much as you think Ixtl continued imperturbably As you will
find out I was speaking quite precisely He paused and eyed Matson
thoughtfully It seems as though the only way to remove your
disturbing presence is to show you that our technology is of no help
to you I will make a bargain with you We shall show you our
machines and in return you will stop harassing us We will do all in
our power to make you understand but whether you do or do not you
will promise to leave and allow us to continue our studies in peace
Is that agreeable

Matson swallowed the lump in his throat Here it washanded to him on
a silver platterand suddenly he wasnt sure that he wanted it

It is he said After all it was all he could expect

They met that night at the spaceship The aliens tall calm and cool
Matson stocky heavyset and sweating The contrast was infernally
sharp Matson thought It was as if a primitive savage were meeting a
group of nuclear physicists at Los Alamos For some unknown reason he
felt ashamed that he had forced these people to his wishes But the
aliens were pleasant about it They took the imposition in their usual
friendly way

Now Ixtl said Exactly what do you want to seeto know

First of all what is the principle of your space drive

There are two the alien said The drive that moves this ship in
normal space time is derived from Lurgils Fourth Order equations
concerning the release of subatomic energy in a restricted space time
continuum Now dont protest I know you know nothing of Lurgil nor
of Fourth Order equations And while I can show you the mathematics
Im afraid they will be of little help You see our Fourth Order is
based upon a process which you would call Psychomathematics and that
is something I am sure you have not yet achieved

Matson shook his head I never heard of it he admitted

The second drive operates in warped space time Ixtl continued
hyperspace in your language and its theory is much more difficult
than that of our normal drive although its application is quite
simple merely involving apposition of congruent surfaces of hyper and
normal space at stress points in the ether where high gravitational
fields balance Navigation in hyperspace is done by electronic
computersomewhat more advanced models than yours However I cant
give you the basis behind the hyperspace drive Ixtl smiled
depreciatingly You see I dont know them myself Only a few of the
most advanced minds of Aztlan can understand We merely operate the
machines

Matson shrugged He had expected something like this Now they would
stall him off about the machines after handing him a fast line of
doubletalk

As I said Ixtl went on there is no basis for understanding
Still if it will satisfy you we will show you our machinesand the
mathematics that created them although I doubt that you will learn
anything more from them than you have from our explanation

I could try Matson said grimly

Very well Ixtl replied

He led the way into the center of the ship where the seamless housings
stood the housings that had baffled some of the better minds of
Earth Matson watched while the star men proceeded to be helpful The
housings fell apart at invisible lines of juncture revealing
mechanisms of baffling simplicity and some things that didnt look
like machines at all The aliens stripped the strange devices and Ixtl
attempted to explain They had antigravity forcefields faster than
light drive and advanced design computers that could be packed in a
suitcase There were weird devices whose components seemed to run out
of sight at crazily impossible angles other things that rotated
frictionlessly suspended in fields of pure force and still others
which his mind could not envisage even after his eyes had seen them
All about him lay the evidence of a science so advanced and alien that
his brain shrank from the sight refusing to believe such things
existed And their math was worse It began where Einstein left off
and went off at an incomprehensible tangent that involved psychology
and ESP Matson was lost after the first five seconds

Stunned uncomprehending and deflated he left the ship An impression
that he was standing with his toe barely inside the door of knowledge
became a conscious certainty as he walked slowly to his car The wry
thought crossed his mind that if the aliens were trying to convince
him of his abysmal ignorance they had succeeded far beyond their
fondest dreams


They certainly had Matson thought grimly as he selected five
cartridges from the box lying beside him In fact they had succeeded
too well They had turned his deflation into antagonism his ignorance
into distrust Like a savage he suspected what he could not
understand But unlike the true primitive the emotional distrust
didnt interfere with his ability to reason or to draw logical
inferences from the data which he accumulated In attempting to
convince Ixtl had oversold his case

                                   

It was shortly after he had returned to Washington that the aliens
gave the waiting world the reasons for their appearance on Earth They
were they said members of a very ancient highly evolved culture
called Aztlan And the Aztlans long past the need for conquest and
expansion had turned their mighty science to the help of other less
fortunate races in the galaxy The aliens were in a sense
missionariesone of hundreds of teams travelling the star lanes to
bring the benefits of Aztlan culture to less favored worlds They
were they unblushingly admitted altruistsinterested only in
helping others

It was pure corn Matson reflected cynically but the world lapped it
up and howled for more After decades of cold war lukewarm war and
sporadic outbreaks of violence that were inevitably building to
atomic destruction men were willing to try anything that would ease
the continual burden of strain and worry To Mankind the Aztlans
words were as refreshing as a cool breeze of hope in a desert of
despair

And the world got what it wanted


Quite suddenly the aliens left the Northwest and accompanied by
protective squads of FBI and Secret Service began to cross the nation
Taking widely separated paths they visited cities towns and farms
exhibiting the greatest curiosity about the workings of human
civilization And in turn they were examined by hordes of hopeful
humans Everywhere they went they spread their message of good will
and hope backed by the incredibly convincing power of their telepathic
minds Behind them they left peace and hopeful calm before them
anticipation mounted It rose to a crescendo in New York where the
paths of the star men met

The Aztlans invaded the United Nations They spoke to the General
Assembly and the Security Council were interviewed by the secretariat
and reporters from a hundred foreign lands They told their story with
such conviction that even the Communist bloc failed to raise an
objection which was as amazing to the majority of the delegates as
the fact of the star men themselves Altruism it seemed had no
conflict with dialectic materialism The aliens offered a watereddown
variety of their technology to the peoples of Earth with no strings
attached and the governments of Earth accepted with open hands much
as a small boy accepts a cookie from his mother It was impossible for
men to resist the lure of something for nothing particularly when it
was offered by such people as the Aztlans After all Matson reflected
bitterly nobody shoots Santa Claus

From every nation in the world came invitations to the aliens to visit
their lands The star men cheerfully accepted They moved across
Europe Asia and Africavisited South America Central America the
Middle East and Oceania No country escaped them They absorbed
languages learned customs and spread good will Everywhere they went
relaxation followed in their footsteps and throughout the world arose
a realization of the essential brotherhood of man

It took nearly three years of continual travelling before the aliens
again assembled at UN headquarters to begin the second part of their
promised planto give their science to Earth And men waited with
calm expectation for the dawn of Golden Age


Matsons lips twisted Fools Blind stupid fools Selling their
birthright for a mess of pottage He shifted the rifle across his
knees and began filling the magazine with cartridges He felt an empty
loneliness as he closed the action over the filled magazine and turned
the safety to on There was no comforting knowledge of support and
sympathy to sustain him in what he was about to do There was no real
hope that there ever would be His was a voice crying in the
wilderness a voice that was ignoredas it had been when he visited
the President of the United States

                                   

Matson entered the White House presented his appointment card and
was ushered past iceeyed Secret Service men into the presidential
office It was as close as he had ever been to the Chief Executive
and he stared with polite curiosity across the width of desk which
separated them

I wanted to see you about the Aztlan business the President began
without preamble You were there when their ship landed and you are
also one of the few men in the country who has seen them alone In
addition your office will probably be handling the bulk of our
requests in regard to the offer they made yesterday in the UN Youre
in a favorable spot The President smiled and shrugged I wanted to
talk with you sooner but business and routine play the devil with
ones desires in this office

Now tell me he continued your impression of these people

Theyre an enigma Matson said flatly To tell the truth I cant
figure them out He ran his fingers through his hair with a worried
gesture Im supposed to be a pretty fair physicist and Ive had
quite a bit of training in the social sciences but both the
mechanisms and the psychology of these Aztlans are beyond my
comprehension All I can say for sure is that theyre as far beyond us
as we are beyond the cavemen In fact we have so little in common
that I cant think of a single reason why they would want to stay
here and the fact that they do only adds to my confusion

But you must have learned something the President said

Oh weve managed to collect data Matson replied But theres a lot
of difference between data and knowledge

I can appreciate that but Id still like to know what you think
Your opinion could have some weight

Matson doubted it His opinions were contrary to those of the
majority Still the Chief asked for itand he might possibly have an
open mind It was a chance worth taking

Well Sir I suppose youve heard of the socalled wild talents
some of our own people occasionally possess

The President nodded

It is my belief Matson continued that the Aztlans possess these
to a far greater degree than we do and that their science is based
upon them They have something which they call psychomathematics
which by definition is the mathematics of the mind and this seems to
be the basis of their physical science I saw their machines and I
must confess that their purpose baffled me until I realized that they
must be mechanisms for amplifying their own natural equipment We know
little or nothing about psi phenomena so it is no wonder I couldnt
figure them out As a matter of fact weve always treated psi as
something that shouldnt be mentioned in polite scientific
conversation

The President grinned I always thought you boys had your blind
spots

We dobut when were confronted with a fact we try to find out
something about itthat is if the fact hits us hard enough often
enough

Well youve been hit hard and often the President chuckled What
did you find out

Facts Matson said grimly just facts Things that could be
determined by observation and measurement We know that the aliens are
telepathic We also know that they have a form of ESPor perhaps a
recognition of danger would be a better termand we know its range is
somewhat over a third of a mile We know that theyre telekinetic The
lack of visible controls in their ship would tell us that even if we
hadnt seen them move small objects at a distance We know that they
have eidetic memories and that they can reason on an extremely high
level Other than that we know nothing We dont even know their
physical structure Weve tried Xray but theyre radioopaque Weve
tried using some human sensitives from the Rhine Institute but
theyre unable to get anywhere They just turn empathic in the aliens
presence and when we get them back they do nothing but babble about
the beauty of the Aztlan soul

Considering the difficulties you havent done too badly the
President said I take it then that youre convinced that they are
an advanced life form But do you think theyre sincere in their
attitude toward us

Oh theyre sincere enough Matson said The only trouble is that
we dont know just what theyre sincere about You see sir we are in
the position of a savage to whom a trader brings the luxuries of
civilization To the savage the trader may represent purest altruism
giving away such valuable things as glass beads and machine made cloth
for useless pieces of yellow rock and the skins of some native pest
The savage hasnt the slightest inkling that hes being exploited By
the time he realizes hes been had and the yellow rock is gold and
the skins are mink he has become so dependent upon the goods for
which the trader has whetted his appetite that he inevitably becomes
an economic slave

Of course you can argue that the cloth and beads are far more
valuable to the savage than the gold or mink But in the last
analysis value is determined by the higher culture and by that
standard the savage gets taken And ultimately civilization moves in
and the superior culture of the traders race determines how the
savage will act

Still the savage has a basis for his acts He is giving something
for somethingmaking a trade But were not even in that position
The aliens apparently want nothing from us They have asked for
nothing except our good will and that isnt a tradable item

But theyre altruists the President protested

Sir do you think that theyre insane Matson asked curiously Do
they appear like fanatics to you

But we cant apply our standards to them You yourself have said that
their civilization is more advanced than ours

Whose standards can we apply Matson asked If not ours then
whose The only standards that we can possibly apply are our own and
in the entire history of human experience there has never been a
single culture that has had a basis of pure altruism Such a culture
could not possibly exist It would be overrun and gobbled up by its
practical neighbors before it drew its first breath

We must assume that the culture from which these aliens come has had
a practical basis in its evolutionary history It could not have risen
full blown and altruistic like Minerva from the brain of Jove And if
the culture had a practical basis in the past it logically follows
that it has a practical basis in the present Such a survival trait as
practicality would probably never be lost no matter how far the Aztlan
race has evolved Therefore we must concede that they are practical
peoplepeople who do not give away something for nothing But the
question still remainswhat do they want

Whatever it is I dont think it is anything from which we will
profit No matter how good it looks I am convinced that cooperation
with these aliens will not ultimately be to our advantage Despite the
reports of every investigative agency in this government I cannot
believe that any such thing as pure altruism exists in a sane mind
And whatever I may believe about the Aztlans I do not think theyre
insane

The President sighed You are a suspicious man Matson and perhaps
you are right but it doesnt matter what you believeor what I
believe for that matter This government has decided to accept the
help the Aztlans are so graciously offering And until the reverse is
proven we must accept the fact that the star men are altruists and
work with them on that basis You will organize your office along
those lines and extract every gram of information that you can Even
you must admit that they have knowledge that will improve our American
way of life

Matson shook his head doggedly Im afraid Sir if you expect Aztlan
science to improve the American way of life you are going to be
disappointed It might promote an Aztlan way of life but the reverse
is hardly possible

Its not my decision the President said My hands are tied
Congress voted for the deal by acclamation early this morning I
couldnt veto it even if I wanted to

I cannot cooperate in what I believe is our destruction Matson said
in a flat voice

Then you have only one course the President said I will be forced
to accept your resignation He sighed wearily

Personally I think youre making a mistake Think it over before
you decide Youre a good man and Lord knows the government can use
good men There are far too many fools in politics He shrugged and
stood up The interview was over

Matson returned to his offices filled with cold frustration Even the
President believed he could do nothing and these shortsighted
politicians who could see nothing more than the immediate gainsthere
was a special hell reserved for them There were too many fools in
politics However he would do what he could His sense of duty was
stronger than his resentment He would stay on and try to cushion some
of the damage which the Aztlans would inevitably cause no matter how
innocent their motives And perhaps the President was rightperhaps
the alien science would bring more good than harm

                                   

For the next two years Matson watched the spread of Aztlan ideas
throughout the world He saw Aztlan devices bring health food and
shelter to millions in underprivileged countries and improve the lot
of those in more favored nations He watched tyrannies and
authoritarian governments fall under the passive resistance of their
peoples He saw militarism crumble to impotence as the Aztlan
influence spread through every facet of society first as a trickle
then as a steady stream and finally as a rushing torrent He saw
Mankind on the brink of a Golden Ageand he was unsatisfied

Reason said that the star men were exactly what they claimed to be
Their every action proved it Their consistency was perfect their
motives unimpeachable and the results of their efforts were
astounding Life on Earth was becoming pleasant for millions who never
knew the meaning of the word Living standards improved and
everywhere men were conscious of a feeling of warmth and brotherhood
There was no question that the aliens were doing exactly what they
promised

But reason also told him that the aliens were subtly and methodically
destroying everything that man had created turning him from an
individual into a satisfied puppet operated by Aztlan strings For man
is essentially lazyalways searching for the easier way Why should
he struggle to find an answer when the Aztlans had discovered it
millennia ago and were perfectly willing to share their knowledge Why
should he use inept human devices when those of the aliens performed
similar operations with infinitely more ease and efficiency Why
should he work when all he had to do was ask There was plan behind
their acts

But at that point reason dissolved into pure speculation Why were
they doing this Was it merely mistaken kindliness or was there a
deeper more subtle motive Matson didnt know and in that lack of
knowledge lay the hell in which he struggled


For two years he stayed on with the OSR watching humanity rush down
an unmarked road to an uncertain future Then he ran away He could
take no more of this blind dependence upon alien wisdom And with the
change in administration that had occurred in the fall elections he no
longer had the sense of personal loyalty to the President which had
kept him working at a job he despised He wanted no part of this brave
new world the aliens were creating He wanted to be alone Like a
hermit of ancient times who abandoned society to seek his soul Matson
fled to the desert country of the Southwestas far as possible from
the Aztlans and their works

The grimly beautiful land toughened his muscles blackened his skin
and brought him a measure of peace Humanity retreated to remoteness
except for Seth Winters a leathery oldtimer he had met on his first
trip into the desert The acquaintance had ripened to friendship Seth
furnished a knowledge of the desert country which Matson lacked and
Matsons money provided the occasional grubstake they needed For
weeks at a time they never saw another humanand Matson was
satisfied The world could go its own way He would go his

Running away was the smartest thing he could have done Others more
brave perhaps or perhaps less rationalhad tried to fight to form
an underground movement to oppose these altruists from space but they
were a tiny minority so divided in motives and purpose that they could
not act as a unit They were never more than a nuisance and without
popular support they never had a chance After the failure of a
complicated plot to assassinate the aliens they were quickly rounded
up and confined And the aliens continued their work


Matson shrugged It was funny how little things could mark mileposts
in a mans life If he had known of the underground he probably would
have joined it and suffered the same penalty for failure If he hadnt
fled if he hadnt met Seth Winters if he hadnt taken that last trip
into the desert if any one of a hundred little things had happened
differently he would not be here That last trip into the deserthe
remembered it as though it were yesterday


The yellow flare of a greasewood fire cast flickering spears of light
into the encircling darkness Above in the purplish black vault of
the moonless sky the stars shone down with icy splendor The air was
quiet the evening breeze had died and the stillness of the desert
night pressed softly upon the earth Far away muted by distance came
the ululating wail of a coyote

Seth Winters laid another stick of quickburning greasewood on the
fire and squinted across the smoke at Matson who was lying on his
back arms crossed behind his head eyeing the night sky with the
fascination of a dreamer

Its certainly peaceful out here Matson murmured as he rose to his
feet stretched and sat down again looking into the tiny fire

Taint nothin unusual Danl Not out here it aint Its been
plumb peaceful on this here desert nigh onto a million years An
whys it peaceful Mainly cuz there aint too many humans messin
around in it

Possibly youre right Seth

Shore Im right It jest aint nacheral fer a bunch of Homo saps to
get together without an argyment startin somewhere Taint the
nature of the critter to be peaceable An yknow thets the part of
this here sweetness an light between nations that bothers me Last
time I was in Prescott I set down an read six months of
newspapersan everythings jest too damn good to be true Seems like
everybodys gettin to love everybody else He shook his head The
hull worlds as stickysweet as molasses candy It jest aint
nacheral

The star men are keeping their word They said that they would bring
us peace Isnt that what theyre doing

Shucks Danlthat dont give em no call to make the world a blasted
honeypot with everybody bubblin over with brotherly love There
aint no real excitement left Even the Commies aint raisin hell
like they useta People are gettin more like a bunch of damn woolies
every day

Ill admit that Mankind had herd instincts Matson replied lazily
but Ive never thought of them as particularly sheeplike More like a
wolf pack Id say

Wal theres nothin wolflike about em right now Look Danl yuh
know what a wolf packs like Theyre smart tough and meanan the
old boss wolf is the smartest toughest and meanest critter in the
hull pack The others respect him cuz hes proved his ability to
lead But take a sheep flock nowthe bellwether is jest a nice gentle
old castrate thetll do jest whut the sheepherder wants Hes got no
originality Hes jest a noise thet the rest foller

Could be

It shore is Jes fr instance an speakin of bellwethers have yuh
ever heard of a character called Throckmorton Bixbee

Cant say I have He sounds like a nance

Whutever a nance ishes it But yuhre talkin about our next
President unless all the prophets are wrong Hes jest as bad as his
name Of all the gutless wonders Ive ever heard of that pilgrim takes
the prize He even looks like a rabbit

I can see where I had better catch up on some contemporary history
Matson said Ive been out in the sticks too long

If yuh know whats good fer yuh yuhll stay here The rest of the
countrys goin thell Brother Bixbees jest a sample About the only
thing thatd recommend him is that hes hot fer peacean hes got
those furriners blessing Seems like those freaks swing a lotta
weight nowadays an they aint shy about tellin folks who an what
they favor Theyve got bold as brass this past year

Matson nodded idlythen stiffenedturning a wide eyed stare on Seth
A blinding light exploded in his brain as the words sank in With
crystal clarity he knew the answer He laughed harshly

Winters stared at him with mild surprise Whats bit yuh Danl

But Matson was completely oblivious busily buttressing the flash of
inspiration Surethat was the only thing it could be Those aliens
were working on a programone that was grimly recognizable once his
attention was focussed on it There must have been considerable
pressure to make them move so fast that a shortlived human could see
what they were planningbut Matson had a good idea of what was
driving them an atomic war that could decimate the world would be all
the spur theyd need

They werent playing for penny ante stakes They didnt want to
exploit Mankind They didnt give a damn about Mankind To them
humanity was merely an unavoidable nuisancesomething to be pushed
aside to be made harmless and dependent and ultimately to be quietly
and bloodlessly eliminated Mans civilization held nothing that the
star men wanted but mans planetthat was a different story Truly
the aliens were right when they considered man a savage Like the
savage man didnt realize his most valuable possession was his land

The peaceful penetration was what had fooled him Mankind faced with
a similar situation and working from a position of overwhelming
strength would have reacted differently Humanity would have invaded
and conquered But the aliens had not even considered this obvious
step

Why

The answer was simple and logical They couldnt Even though their
technology was advanced enough to exterminate man with little or no
loss to themselves combat and slaughter must be repulsive to them It
had to be With their telepathic minds they would necessarily have a
pathologic horror of suffering They were so highly evolved that they
simply couldnt fightat least not with the weapons of humanity But
they could use the subtler weapon of altruism

And even more importantuncontrolled emotions were poison to them In
fact Ixtl had admitted it back in Seattle The primitive psi waves of
humanitys hates lusts fears and exultations must be unbearable
torture to a race long past such animal outbursts That wasmust
bewhy they were moving so fast For their own safety emotion had to
be damped out of the human race

Matson had a faint conception of what the aliens must have suffered
when they first surveyed that crowd at International Airport No
wonder they looked so strangely immobile at that first contact The
raw emotion must have nearly killed them He felt a reluctant stir of
admiration for their courage for the dedicated bravery needed to face
that crowd and establish a beachhead of tranquility Those first few
minutes must have had compressed in them the agonies of a lifetime

Matson grinned coldly The aliens were not invulnerable If Mankind
could be taught to fear and hate them and if that emotion could be
focussed they never again would try to take this world It would be
sheer suicide As long as Mankind kept its emotions it would be safe
from this sort of invasion But the problem was to teach Mankind to
fear and hate Shock would do it but how could that shock be applied

The thought led inevitably to the only possible conclusion The aliens
would have to be killed and in such a manner as to make humanity fear
retaliation from the stars Fear would unite men against a possible
invasion and fear would force men to reach for the stars to forestall
retribution

Matson grinned thinly Human nature couldnt have changed much these
past years Even with master psychologists like the Aztlans operating
upon it changes in emotional pattern would require generations He
sighed looked into the anxious face of Seth Winters and returned to
the reality of the desert night His course was set He knew what he
had to do

                                   

He laid the rifle across his knees and opened the little leather box
sewn to the side of the guncase With precise careful movements he
removed the silencer and fitted it to the threaded muzzle of the gun
The bulky blue excrescence changed the rifle from a thing of beauty
to one of murder He looked at it distastefully then shrugged and
stretched out on the mattress easing the ugly muzzle through the hole
in the brickwork It wouldnt be long now

He glanced upward through the window above him at the Weather Bureau
instruments atop a nearby building The metal cups of the anemometer
hung motionless against the metallic blue of the sky No wind stirred
in the deep canyons of the city streets as the sun climbed in blazing
splendor above the towering buildings He moved a trifle shifting the
muzzle of the gun until it bore upon the sidewalks The telescopic
sight picked out faces from the waiting crowd with a crystal clarity
Everywhere was the same sheeplike placidity He shuddered the sights
jumping crazily from one face to anotherwondering if he had
misjudged his race if he had really come too late if he had
underestimated the powers of the Aztlans

Far down the avenue an excited hum came to his ears and the watching
crowd stirred Faces lighted and Matson sighed He was not wrong
Emotion was only suppressed not vanished There was still time

The aliens were coming Coming to cap the climax of their pioneer
work to drive the first nail in humanitys coffin For the first time
in history mans dream of the brotherhood of man was close to reality

And he was about to destroy it The irony bit into Matsons soul and
for a moment he hesitated feeling the wave of tolerance and good will
rising from the street below Did he have the right to destroy mans
dream Did he dare tamper with the will of the world Had he the right
to play God

The parade came slowly down the happy street a kaleidoscope of color
and movement that approached and went past in successive waves and
masses This was a gala day this eve of world union The insigne of
the UN was everywhere The aliens had used the organization to further
their plans and it was now allpowerful A solid bank of UN flags led
the van of delegates smiling and swathed in formal dress sitting
erect in their black official cars draped with the flags of native
lands that would soon be furled forever if the aliens had their way

And behind them came the Aztlans


They rode together standing on a pure white float a bar of dazzling
white in a sea of color All equal their inhumanly beautiful faces
calm and remote the Aztlans rode through the joyful crowd There was
something inspiring about the sight and for a moment Matson felt a
wave of revulsion sweep through him

He sighed and thumbed the safety to off pulled the cocking lever
and slid the first cartridge into the breech He settled himself
drawing a breath of air into his lungs letting a little dribble out
through slack lips catching the remainder of the exhalation with
closed glottis The sights wavered and steadied upon the head of the
center alien framing the pale noble face with its aureole of golden
hair The luminous eyes were dull and introspective as the alien tried
to withdraw from the emotions of the crowd There was no awareness of
danger on the aliens face At  yards he was beyond their esper
range and he was further covered by the feelings of the crowd The
sights lowered to the broad chest and centered there as Matsons
spatulate fingers took up the slack in the trigger and squeezed softly
and steadily


A coruscating glow bathed the bodies of three of the aliens as their
tall forms jerked to the smashing impact of the bullets Their
metallic tunics melted and sloughed as inner fires ate away the
fragile garments that covered them Flexible synthetic skin cracked
and curled in the infernal heat revealing padding wirelike tendons
ropelike cords of flexible tubing and a metallic skeleton that melted
and dripped in white hot drops in the heat of atomic flame

Robots Matson gasped with sudden blinding realization I should
have known No wonder they seemed inhuman Their builders would never
dare expose themselves to the furies and conflicts of our emotionally
uncontrolled world

One of the aliens crouched on the float his fourfingered hands
pressed against a smoking hole in his metal tunic The smoke thickened
and a yellowish ichor poured out bursting into flame on contact with
the air The fifth alien Ixtl was untouched standing with hands
widestretched in a gesture that at once held command and appeal

Matson reloaded quickly but held his fire The swarming crowd
surrounding the alien was too thick for a clear shot and Matson with
sudden revulsion was unwilling to risk further murder in a cause
already won The tall silver figure of the alien winced and
shuddered his huge body shaking like a leaf in a storm His builders
had never designed him to withstand the barrage of focussed emotion
that was sweeping from the crowd Terror shock sympathy hate
loathing grief and disillusionmentthe incredible gamut of human
feelings wrenched and tore at the Aztlan shorting delicate circuits
ripping the poised balance of his being as the violent discordant
blasts lanced through him with destroying energy Ixtls classic
features twisted in a spasm of inconceivable agony a thin curl of
smoke drifted from his distorted tragic mask of a mouth as he
crumpled a pitiful deflated figure against the whiteness of the
float

The cries of fear and horror changed their note as the aliens true
nature dawned upon the crowd Pride of flesh recoiled as the swarming
humans realized the facts Revulsion at being led by machines swelled
into raw red rage The mob madness spread as an ominous growl began
rising from the streets

A panicky policeman triggered it firing his Aztlanbuilt shock tube
into the forefront of the mob A dozen men fell to be trampled by
their neighbors as a swarm of men and women poured over the struggling
officer and buried him from sight Like wildfire pentup emotions
blazed out in a flame of fury The parade vanished sucked into the
maelstrom and torn apart Fists flew flesh tore men and women
screamed in high bitter agony as the mob clawed and trampled in a
surging press of writhing forms that filled the street from one line
of buildings to the other

Halfmad with triumph drunk with victory shocked at the terrible
form that death had taken in coming to Ixtl Matson raised his
clenched hands to the sky and screamed in a raw inhuman voice a cry
in which all of mans violence and pride were blended The spasm
passed as quickly as it came and with its passing came exhaustion
The job was done The aliens were destroyed Tomorrow would bring
reaction and with it would come fear

Tomorrow or the next day man would hammer out a true world union
spurred by the thought of a retribution that would never come Yet all
that didnt matter The important thingthe only important thingwas
preserved Mankind would have to unite for survivalor so men would
thinkand he would never disillusion them For this was mans world
and men were again free to work out their own destiny for better or
for worse without interference and without help The golden dream
was over Man might fail but if he did he would fail on his own
terms And if he succeededMatson looked up grimly at the shining
sky

Slowly he rose to his feet and descended to the raging street below

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone  For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included  Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

     httpwwwgutenbergorg

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
