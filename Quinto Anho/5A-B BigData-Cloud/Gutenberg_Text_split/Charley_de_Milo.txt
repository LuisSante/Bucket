 CHARLEY
 de MILO

 By LARRY M HARRIS

 Illustrated by Emsh


 It isnt at all obviousat first thoughtthat
 having two perfectly good usable arms could be a
 real handicap to a man


    To be or not to bethat is the question
    Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms 
              Hamlet Act III Scene I


The rocket was on the way up but Professor Lightning didnt seem to
care Outside the cooktent Wrout flapped his arms and on that signal
Seaman started up the big electric band whooping it up with John Philip
Sousa for openers while all over the midway the lights snapped on big
whites and yellows reds greens purples and dusky violets framing in
a titillating dimness the front flap of the girlie tent The outside
talkers were busy outside the spectacle tents like Wicks Hell Drivers
Biggest Auto Show in Fifty Statesoutside the grind shows the eats
the rides Here and now for the fourth part of one single dollar bill
the most amazing   Terrifying and strange beings from the
farthest reaches of the Earth who will exhibit   Dances learned
at the Court of the Sultan Ayrab dances right here right on the
inside for only

And the crowd filing in laughed and chattered and shrieked on swooping
rides the Great Crane the Space Race the MerryGoRound and the
Horses threw down money to win a kewpie doll a Hawaiian lei a real
lifesize imitation scale model of Luna in three real dimensions 
living it up on the first show while the rocket climbed on and out and
bubbled excitement in the blood

The rocket was up the carnival was open But Professor Lightning didnt
seem to care He sat in the cooktent with his eyes hooded and hidden
under the unshaded glow of a hundredandfiftywatt Forever bulb while
Charley de Milo fidgeted his feet and listened and tried to cut the
old man off

Look professor he said nervously why dont we talk about it later
Table it till after the show He scratched the side of his head with
his left foot I got to go on in a couple of minutes he said I can
hear the talker going now I got to

Forget the show Professor Lightning said His voice was flatter and
harsher and his face more tense than Charley ever remembered seeing
it The show isnt important

Charley blinked trying to understand But Professor

Listen to me Professor Lightning said The world is at the beginning
of a new cultural revolution Since the Cold War melted and freedom of
inquiry and research began to live again on both sides of the old Iron
Curtain science has begun a new Renaissance The cultural interflow
has

Please professor Charley said miserably rubbing his toes together
There isnt much time before I got to go on And you ought to be
inside the Science tent too because any minute

If I am not in the tent Professor Lightning said calmly I will not
appear in the show It does not matter

But theyll fire you Charley said He grabbed for a cigarette with
his right foot and got it into his mouth Striking a match with his left
foot he lit the cigarette and blew out a long ragged plume of smoke
If youre not there on time he said in strained tones theyll fire
you And what about me

Professor Lightning gestured with both big hands It was the same
movement he used every night when he showed the crowd there were no
wires or batteries secreted on his person Charley halfexpected him to
grab hold of a couple of light bulbs and show them glowing in his fists
But the gesture was meant this time as an aid to relaxation Dont
worry Professor Lightning said in a grating sort of caricature of a
soothing tone If they fire me  well then they save me the trouble
of quitting And as for you my boy a carnival job should be the
furthest thing from your thoughts

Well it isnt Charley said sourly And if youll excuse me
professor I care how I get the money to eat even if you dont I got a
good job

You wont need your job Professor Lightning said if youll listen
to me

Charley made up his mind Much as he hated to be impolite there were
some things more important than social forms he decided He stood up
After the show professor he said with firmness and went out of the
cooktent heading at a rapid dogtrot for the big tent at the other side
of the midway As he reached it he could see Dave Lungs the outside
talker climb up on the front platform to begin his spiel

Marvels of the world Dave announced without preliminary Wonders of
the natural universe Surprises and startling sights for every member of
the family By the time he had got that far a crowd was beginning to
collect in front of the platform For the fourth part of a single
dollar bill Dave went on but Charley didnt have the time to listen
he was in the bally

He lifted the backflap of the tent with one foot and wriggled inside

As he made his way to the cluster of people near the front flap past
the booths and stands he felt an enormous sense of relief He had made
itwith all of fifty seconds to spare

Ned and Ed stood next to him Where you been Ed said in a nasal
whisper

I got held up Charley explained Professor Lightning he was talking
to me and

Later Ned said His voice was lower and throatier than Eds it was
the only way Charley could tell them apart but then he thought nobody
ever had to tell them apart They were like all Siamese twins always
together Were going on Ned said and he and his twin moved forward

Charley moved into place behind them and came out blinking in the glare
of the front platform

Siamese twins Dave was shouting A contemporary marvel of science
ladies and gentlemenand here we have 

Charley stepped forward as Ned and Ed stepped back into the shadows
again

 Charley de Milo Ladies and gentlemen the worldwide fame of this
brave and talented boy is stupendous His feats of skill will amaze you
Watch him thread a needle Watch him comb his hair And all for one thin
quarter ladies and gentlemen only the fourth part

The electronic band choked on Sousa coughed and began again with
Kabalevsky Charley watched the audience below staring up at him
hundreds of faces He heard their gasp as he flexed his shoulders and
turned He grinned down taking a second longer than usual and then
stepped back still grinning

Charley de Milo the Armless Wonder Dave said And many more sights
inside ladies and gentlemen sights to amaze you sights to chill your
very blood sights 

                                   

Onethirty and the last show over The rocket had come down for the
night all over the midway lights were blinking off and silence was
creeping like a stain over the ground Professor Lightning was sitting
on his bunk in the small tent he shared with Erma the Fish Girl Erma
was out drinking with Dave Lungs and some of the others and only the
professor and Charley de Milo were in the room Charley was sitting on
Ermas bunk looking resigned

Well if you still want to talk to me he said nows your chance
OK

I certainly want to talk to you Professor Lightning said firmly I
want to tell you of the most important moment of your life

Charley tried to think of something to say to this but there wasnt
anything He shifted on the bunk scratched at his nose with his left
foot and grinned spastically Sure he said at random And by the
way Im sorry about before professor But the show was going on
and

The show Professor Lightning said in tones of the utmost contempt
Forget about the shownow and tomorrow and forever

But

No words Professor Lightning said raising a hand delicately
Please Allow me to tell you of my invention

Charley sighed and lay back on the bed Invention professor he said
You mean sort of a machine

For some reason Professor Lightning looked irritated Its not a
machine he said flatly Then he sighed and his tone changed Charley
my boy he said do you remember what I was telling you before About
how the world has entered a new Age of Science How new inventions new
discoveries are coming along every day

Well sure Charley said The papers talk about it every once in a
while You know I see the papers or the Chicago American anyhow My
mother sends it to me She likes the columns

Why Professor Lightning went on as if he hadnt been listening at
all right here in Wrouts Carnival Shows we have things that just
didnt exist ten or fifteen years ago The electronic band The Forever
bulb

Thats right Charley put in And look at Joe Wicks Why he can do
tricks with all those new things they got on cars tricks nobody ever
did before or even thought about in the old days

And more fundamental discoveries the professor said Chadwicks Law
of Dimensionality Dvedkin and the Ontological Mean  oh I keep up
with the literature No matter whats happened to me I keep up with the
literature

Charley sighed very softly so as not to injure the professors
feelings But he did hope the old man wasnt going to start on all those
stories about his lost career again Charley kneweverybody in the
Wrout show didthat Professor Lightning had been a real professor once
at some college or other Biology or Biological Physics or something
elsehed taught classes about it and done research And then there
had been something about a girl a student the professor had got himself
involved with Though it was pretty hard to imagine the professor
whitehaired and thin the way he was now chasing after a girl

Hed been fired or something and hed drifted for a while and then got
himself an act and come with a Carnival Charley knew the whole story
He didnt want to hear it again

But the professor said Im as good as I ever wasbetter than I ever
was my boy Ive been keeping up doing experiments Ive been quiet
about it

Everybody Charley thought knew about Professor Lightning and his
experiments If they kept the old man happy kept him contented and
doing shows why not After all the old guy didnt drink or anything
really serious if he wanted to play around with test tubes and even
Bunsen burners people figured why let him

But Professor Lightning thought nobody knew Well he had been a real
professor once which is to say a square Some people never really
adjusted to carny lifewhere everybody knows everything

Charley figured maybe it was better to act surprised Really he said
Experiments

Professor Lightning looked pleased which satisfied Charley Ive been
on the track of something big he said He seemed to be talking more to
himself than to Charley Something new he said And at last  at
last my boy Ive found it Ill be famous Charley famousand so
will you

Thats nice Charley said politely Then he blinked But what do you
mean he added me

I want you to help me the professor said He leaned forward and in
the dim light of the tents single lamp his eyes glittered I want you
to come with me

Come with you Charley said and swallowed hard Hed never thought
the way some did that the old man was crazy But it did look as if hed
slipped a couple of cogs for sure and for real Where Charley said

Washington the professor said instantly New York London Paris
Rome The world Charley The world thats going to do us homage

Charley shifted a little in the bed Look professor he said Ive
got a job right here in the carny I couldnt leave here So suppose we
just

Your job the professor said Your jobs gone my boy Wait Let me
tell you what Ive discovered Let me tell you what has
happenedhappened to you my boy To you and to me

Charley sat upright slowly Well he said all right professor

Professor Lightning beamed and his eyes glittered brighter and
brighter Limb regeneration he said and his voice was as soft and
quiet as if hed been talking about the most beautiful woman in the
world Limb regeneration

                                   

Charley waited a long minute before he admitted to himself that he
didnt have the faintest idea what the professor was talking about
What he said at last

Professor Lightning shook his head slightly Charley he said softly
youre an Armless Wonder Thats right isnt it

Sure it is professor Charley said You know that I was born that
way Made a pretty good thing out of it too

Well Professor Lightning said you dont have to be one Can you
realize that

Charley nodded slowly Sure I dont he said Only its pretty good
money you know And theres no sense in sitting around back home and
feeling sorry for myself is there I mean this way I can make money
and have a job and

No Professor Lightning said emphatically

Charley blinked No he said

Professor Lightning shook his head meaningfully Charley my boy he
said I dont mean that you should go home and mope But think about
this suppose you had your arms Suppose you had two arms just like
everybody else

Why think about anything like that Charley said I mean I am what I
am Thats the way things are Right

Wrong Professor Lightning said I can give you arms Charley I can
make you normal Just like everybody else

Well Charley said After a few seconds he said Gee Then he said
Youre kidding me professor

Im perfectly serious Professor Lightning said

But

Let me show you Professor Lightning said He stood up and went to the
flap of the tent Come with me he said and Charley got up dumbly
and followed him out into the cool darkness outside

Later Charley couldnt remember all that Professor Lightning had showed
him or told him There were some strangelooking animals called
salamanders Professor Lightning had cut their tails off and theyd
grown new tails That he said happened in nature But he had gone a
step farther He had isolated the particular factor that made such
regrowth possible

Charley remembered something about a molecular lattice but it didnt
make any sense to him and was only a puzzle But the professor told him
all about the technique in a very earnest and scientific voice that was
convincing to listen to and showed him mice that hed cut the tails off
of and the mice had brandnew tails and even feet in one or two cases
There were a whole lot of small animals in cages all together in back
of the professors tent and Charley looked at all of them The
professor had a flashlight and everything was very clear and bright

When the demonstration was over Charley had no doubts at all It was
obvious to him that the professor could do just what he said he could
do grow limbs on things Charley scratched his head with his left foot
nervously

Thats why I came to you the professor said I need a human
beingjust to show the scientific world that my technique works on
human beings And Ive worked with you for a number of years now
Charley

Five Charley said Five since you came with Wrout

I like you the professor said I want to make you the first the
very first person to be helped by my technique

Charley shifted his feet You mean you want to give me arms he said

Thats right the professor said

No Charley said

                                   

Professor Lightning nodded Now then he said Well get right to
work on  Charley my boy what did you say

Charley licked his lips I said no he said

Professor Lightning waited a long minute You mean you dont believe
me he said at last You think Im some sort of a crackpot

Not at all Charley said politely I guess if you say you can do this
 well I see all the animals and everything and I guess you can do
it Thats OK

But youre doubtful Professor Lightning said

Charley shook his head No he said You can do it all right I
guess Im sure of that professor

Illustration

Then the professor said in a tenser voice you think it might be
dangerous You think you might be hurt or that things might not work
out right or

Gee Charley said I never thought of anything like that professor
I know you wouldnt want to hurt me

I certainly wouldnt Professor Lightning said I want to help you I
want to make you normal Like everybody else

Sure Charley said uncomfortably

Then youll do it Professor Lightning said I knew you would
Charley Its a great opportunity And I offered it to you because
you

Gee I know Charley said feeling more uncomfortable than ever And
dont think I dont appreciate it But look at it my way professor He
paused Suppose I had two armsjust like everybody else the way you
tell me What would happen to me

Happen Professor Lightning blinked Why Charley  why you could
do anything you liked Anything Youd have the same opportunities as
anybody else You could be  well my boy you could be anything

Could I Charley said Excuse me for talking about this professor
but Ive had a lot of time to think about it And its all sort of new
to you I mean you werent born the way I was and so you just dont
understand it

Professor Lightning said But my boy

No Charley said Let me explain this Because its important He
cleared his throat sat down on the ground and fumbled for a cigarette
He found one in his shirt pocket carried it to his lips with his right
foot and lit a match with his left When he was smoking easily he went
on

Professor do you know how old I am he said Im fortytwo years
old Maybe I dont look it but thats how old I am Now Ive spent all
my life learning to do one thing and I do a pretty good job of it
Anyhow good enough to get me a spot with Wrouts show and probably
with anybody else I wanted to work for

But your arms the professor said

Thats what I mean Charley said I dont have any arms I never had
any Maybe I miss em a littlebut everything I do is based on the
fact that I dont have em Now professor do you know what I am

Professor Lightning frowned What you are he said

Im an Armless Wonder Charley said Thats a pretty good thing to
be In a carny they look up to an Armless Wonderhes a freak a born
freak and thats as high as you can go in a carny I get a good
salaryI send enough to my mother and my sister in Chicago for them
to live on And I have what I need myself Ive got a job professor
and standing and respect He paused Now suppose I had arms Id
have to start from scratch all over again Id have to start from the
bottom up just learning the basic elements of any job I signed on for
Id be a fortytwoyearold man doing the work of an eighteenyearold
And not making much money And not having much standing or respect

Charley took the cigarette out of his mouth with his right foot held it
for a second and put it back

Id be normal he said Id be just like everybody else professor
And what do I want anything like that for

                                   

Professor Lightning tried everything but it wasnt any good Fame he
said and Charley pointed out calmly and reasonably that the kind of
fame hed get from being an experimental subject was just like being a
freak all over againexcept that it would wear off and then he
asked where would he be Professor Lightning talked about Mans Duty to
Science and Charley countered with Sciences Duty to Man Professor
Lightning tried friendship and argument and even forcebut nothing
worked Incredible as it seemed to the professor Charley was content to
remain a freak an Armless Wonder More he seemed to be proud and happy
about it

It was too bad that the professor didnt think of the one argument that
might have worked In the long run it wouldnt have made any
difference perhapsbut it would have cleared matters up right there
and then Because the one workable argument had a good chance of
succeeding

But then Professor Lightning really didnt understand carny He never
thought of the one good argument and after a while he gave up and went
away

Of course that was several days later Professor Lightning told Charley
that he was leaving for New York and Charley said What In the middle
of the season Then he told Wrout and Wrout screamed and ranted and
swore that Professor Lightning would never work in carny again Ill
have you blacklisted he roared

And Professor Lightning shrugged and smiled and went away to pack He
took all his notebooks and all the cages with little animals in them
and he didnt seem at all disturbed Ill find another subject he
told Charley when he left When they find out what Ive got in New
York theyll provide me with subjects by the hundred I did want to
help you 

Thanks Charley said honestly

 But thats the way things are I suppose Professor Lightning
said Maybe some day youll realize

Charley shook his head Im afraid not professor he said and
Professor Lightning shook Charleys foot and left and Charley went
back to work in the freak show and for a while he didnt even think
about Professor Lightning Then of course the news began to show up in
the Chicago American which Charley got two or three days late because
his mother sent it to him by mail

At first Charley didnt realize that Dr Edmund Charles Schinsake was
Professor Lightning but then the American ran his picture that was
the day Professor Lightning was awarded a medal by the AMA and Charley
felt pleased and happy for the old man It looked as it hed got what he
wanted

Charley of course didnt think much about the professors limb
regeneration he didnt need it he thought and he didnt want it and
that was that

And then one night he was dropped from the bally and he asked Dave
Lungs about it and Dave said Well we want the biggest draw we can
get out there before the show and put Erma the Fish Girl out in his
place And Charley started to wonder about that and after a few days
had gone by he found himself talking about it to Ed Baylis over in the
cooktent while they were having lunch

Baylis was a little man of sixty or so with a wrinkled face like a
walnut and a powerful set of lungs he was Wrouts outside talker for
the girlie show Because Im old he said grinning I dont have
trouble with the girls And if I got to take one off the bally or out of
the show theres no personal stuff that would make it tough see what I
mean

Thats what Im worried about Charley said

What Ed asked He speared a group of string beans with his fork and
conveyed them to his mouth Charley using his right foot did the same

The bally Charley said The way things are Dave took me off and
Im worrying about it

Maybe some kind of a change Ed said

Charley shook his head He said  he said he wanted the biggest draw
out there Now you know Im a big draw Ed I always have been

Sure Ed said He chewed another mouthful and swallowed Still
people want a change now and then Doesnt have to mean anything

Maybe not Charley said uncomfortably But he wasnt convinced

                                   

The season drew to a close and Charley went off to the Florida Keys
where he spent a month living with some friends before holing up with
his mother and sister for the winter He was offered a job in New York
at a yearround flea museum in Times Square but after some thought he
decided against it Hed never had to work winters and he wasnt going
to start

After all he was still doing well wasnt he He told himself
emphatically that he was He was an Armless Wonder a born freak the
top of the carny ladder with a good job wherever he cared to look for
one

He had to tell himself that quite a few times before he began to believe
it

Spring came and then summer and Charley kissed his mother and his
sister goodby and joined Wrouts Carnival Shows in Summit Idaho three
days before their opening He didnt notice much change from previous
years but it took an effort not to notice some things

Not like the new man whod taken Professor Lightnings placea tall
thin youngster who had an Electric Chair act Or like the periodic
quarrels between Ned and Ed it seemed theyd met a girl over the winter
season and disagreed about her Ed thought she was perfectly wonderful
Ned couldnt see her for beans

No things like that were a part of carny you got used to them as the
show rolled along year after year and paid no more attention to them
than a housewife pays to rather uninteresting backfence gossip

It was something else that had changed something important

His contract for instance It was made out for the same pay as hed
been getting but the option periods were shortened up suddenly
Charley was living from season to season with almost no assurance of
continuous steady work Old man Wrout had looked a little less than
happy when hed given Charley the contract hed almost seemed ashamed
and he hadnt really looked Charley in the eye once But when Charley
asked what was wrong he got no answer

Or none that meant anything Its just the way things are Wrout
muttered Dont make no difference kid

But it did make a difference Charley wasnt out in the bally any more
either he was backstage among the secondrate acts the tattooed man
and the fireeater and the rest while Erma and Ned and Ed and the
topliners took their bows out before the crowd pulling them in and
got the gasps and the applause

The crowds in front of his own platform inside during the show were
smaller too At first Charley thought that was due to the bally itself
but as the season began and wore on the crowds continued to shrink
beyond all expectation Counting as he worked combing his hair with one
foot drawing little sketches for the customers Take one home for only
one extra dime a treasured souvenir especially personalized for you by
Charley de Milocounting the house he discovered one evening that he
was the smallest draw in the tent The tattooed man did better than
Charley de Milo which was enough of a disgrace the rest were so far
ahead that Charley didnt even want to think about it

His first idea was that somebody was out to get him He could feel the
muscles of his shoulders and back bunching up when he tried thinking
what to do about the sabotage that had struck him but an Armless Wonder
has one very real disadvantage He can comb his own hair and brush his
own teeth he can feed himself andwith proper clothingdress himself
he can open doors and shut windows and turn the pages of books But he
cant engage in a freeforall fight not without long and careful
training in that style of battle known as savate or boxing with the
feet Charley had never learned savate he had never needed it

For the first time since he could remember he felt helpless He wasnt
normal he couldnt do what any normal man could do He wanted to find
the man who was sabotaging his show and beat him into a confession and
throw him off the lot

And he couldnt

The muscles of his back pulled and pulled at him He clenched his jaw
Then Dave Lungs came over to his platform and he forced himself to
relax sweating There were four or five people behind Dave ordinary
marks with soft soft faces and round eyes While Dave talked Charley
went through his act perhaps ten other marks were scattered in the
tent standing at other platforms watching other acts even without Dave
there to guide them and talk them up

And when he was through Dave sold exactly one of the sketches Charley
had done One An old man bought it a chubby little Santa Claus of a
man with eyes that twinkled and a belly that undoubtedly shook like a
jelly bowl when it was freed from its expensive orlon confines Dave
went off to the next platform where Erma stood and the marks followed
him and more drifted over Erma had ten customers Charley noticed and
he grabbed a handkerchief from the platform floor and wiped his damp
face with one foot

                                   

Somethings wrong he thought stupidly and he must have said it aloud
because at his feet a high thin old voice said What was that son
Did you say something

Nothing at all Charley mumbled and looked down The Santa Claus man
was staring up at him Shows over Charley said more curtly than he
meant He took a deep breath and set his feet more firmly on the
platform but it didnt do any good He was like a coiled spring
waiting for release

I dont expect any show Santa Claus said Really I dont But I did
want to talk to you for a few minutes if you dont mind

Im not in a talking mood Charley said Sorry He was ashamed of
the words as soon as he brought them out that was no way to treat any
stranger not even a mark But it was a long second before he could say
anything else Santa Claus stood watching him patiently holding
Charleys sketch by one corner in his left hand

Im sorry Charley said at last It  must be the heat Im kind of
on edge

Of course Santa Claus said I understand Really I do

There was a little silence Dave and the crowd trailed away from Erma
and headed for Senor Alcala the fireeater at the end of the row
Charley barely heard Daves spiel he licked his lips and said You
wanted to talk to me

Now Santa Claus said I dont want you to be ashamed of anything
Theres nothing personal in this really there isnt But I do want to
help if I can help anyone who needs help

I dont need help Charley said Im sorry He tried to keep his
voice gentle The old man obviously meant well there was no sense in
hurting him

Its your  infirmity Santa Claus said Boy have they been
keeping the news from you

News Charley said with a sudden sick feeling

In New York Santa Claus said Theres a doctor therea man who can
help people like you He has a new technique I was reading in the
papers just the other daythere was a man injured in a railroad
accident who lost one arm and one leg This doctor used him as his
first subject

He said hed find another one Charley put in without thinking

Another

It doesnt matter Charley said You were going to suggest that I go
and see this doctor Is that right

Well Santa Claus said seeming oddly embarrassed it cant hurt you
know And it might help Really it might And then  then you might
not have to  have to be the way you are and do what you do

Charley took a long breath Ill think about it he said in the very
politest tone he could manage

I only want to help Santa Claus said

Im sure you do Charley said And thanks

If theres anything I can do

Charley smiled down Thats all right he said Thanks But I guess
youd better join the restif you want to see the show at all

Santa Claus said Oh Of course He turned and found the group just
leaving Senor Alcalas platform and scurried off to catch up with them
Charley stared at his retreating back fighting to stay calm

That was the way marks were of course and there wasnt anything to be
done about it It was always the way you have to be and the things
you have to do It never seemed to enter their heads that pity was
unnecessary baggage where a born freak was concerned any more than it
had entered Professor Lightnings head A born freak Charley reflected
had a pretty good life of it all told why even marriage wasnt out of
the question Charley knew of some very happy ones

But the marks pitied you Charley thought And maybe it wasnt
especially smart to tell them anything different pity as much as
anything else keep them coming Pity and a kind of vicarious victory
When Charley threaded a needle he was telling all the marks It
doesnt matter what kind of accident happens to youyou can overcome
it You can go on and do anything Its all what you make
iteverything every bad turn life hands you can be made into something
better If I can do it you can do it

That was what the marks felt Charley thought It was wrongheaded it
was stupid and it could be a simple nuisancebut it brought in the
dough Why argue with it Why try to change it

Charley nearly grinned The crowd of marks moved on down the other side
of the tent and Charley watched them Ned and Ed drew the biggest
crowd an attentive almost rapt crew who could be suckered into buying
anything the Siamese twins wanted to sell them Dave milked them for all
they were worth and Charley nodded quietly to himself Dave was a good
carny man

He worked for the good of the show Ordid he

Dave had taken him off the bally Did Dave have some reason to hate him
Could Dave be out to get him

Charley couldnt think why but it was a lead the only one he had And
if Dave did turn out to be behind everything that was happening Charley
knew exactly what he was going to do

He couldnt beat Dave himself

But he had friends

                                   

After the show that night Charley went hunting for Ed Baylis Ed had
been around Wrouts a long time and if anything were going on Ed would
know about it Charley went down to the girlie tent and found Ed just
clearing up All over the midway the lights were going out and the
Mars Race game gave one final roar and came to a halt The last
customers were leaving

Ed looked up when he came over Charley didnt ease into the subject he
couldnt Somethings wrong he said at once Im off the bally and
the crowds are going down I dont like it Ed

Baylis shrugged Who would he said

Butsomethings wrong Charley said Ed you know whats happening
You get the word Let me in on it

I dont know anything about this Ed said at once But his face was
still his eyes shuttered in the darkness

Charley kept after him They went behind the girlie tent talking
softly Overhead a rocket burned by but neither man looked up

At last Ed sighed Just forget about it he said Just do your job
Thats all that matters You dont want to know anything else

Why dont I Charley said Sure I do And its no good telling me to
do my job The way things are running Ed Im not going to have a job
very long

Theres nothing you can do about it Ed said Believe me You dont
want to know because knowing wouldnt do you any good And you wouldnt
believe me if I told you

Try me Charley said Go ahead He scratched at one shin with the
other foot

Well Ed began and then stopped He shook his head Look Charley
let me tell this my way Something like this happened before A long
while backbefore the Cold War started let alone ended

Go ahead Charley said A drop of sweat ran slowly down his forehead
He tried to ignore it

Did I ever tell you I used to talk for a strongman act Ed said Not
a sideshow talker nothing like that this guy had an act of his own
full tent and flies Gondo his name was and I can still see those
flies Eighth Wonder of the World up on top red on blue and just
Gondo underneath pure white with red outlining Class but flashy if
you see what I mean You never saw the like kid

Charley shook his head OK he said But what does this have to do
with

Well Ed cut in that was years ago I was a youngster pretty well
just setting out And Gondo drew crowdsbig crowds Lifting a wagonload
of people on his backthat was one of his tricks I think Sandow
himself used to do it but he had nothing on Gondo the guy had style
Class And he was a draw I was working for J C Hobart Shows then and
there was nothing on the lot to top him

Ed paused rubbing at his chin reflectively

Then the crowds started to fall off he said Just like with you
Charley And nobody knew why Gondo was doing the same actno change
there So the change had to be some place else

Same with me Charley said

Sure Ed said The same with you Charley do you follow the
papers

I guess so Charley said One anyway My mother sends it to me from
Chicago She likes the

Sure Ed said Well did you ever hear about a Dr Schinsake Edmund
Charles Schinsake

Charley snorted in surprise Who do you think you are he said Santa
Claus

What

Nothing Charley said Its just  well nothing But sure I know
the guy And so do you He explained

Professor Lightning Ed said I never saw a picture But it doesnt
matterexcept maybe itll make the guy easier to see Because this is
it Charley I think you ought to go and see him

There was a little silence

You too Charley said You mean so I can stop being a poor poor
cripple and stop making lots of money Is that what youre talking
about

Listen Charley Ed said I

Just give up Charley cut in Thats what you want me to do Just
give up and go to the good old doctor and ask him to give me some arms
Is that what you wanted to tell me about this Gondo of yours How he
just gave up and got a nice little white cottage some place and got a
nice little lowpaying job and lived unhappily ever after because a
carny isnt a healthy welladjusted life Is that it Ed

Ed Ribbed at his chin No Charley he said No kid Not at all But
I think you ought to

Well I wont Charley said Look Ed I want you to get this
straight I dont care whos against me or what theyve got planned
Im not going to give up Im going to find out whats going on and Im
going to lick it Have you got it

Ed sighed Ive got it he said But Charley there are some things
you dont lick

Ill find out Charley said Believe me Ed Ill find out

                                   

But nobody else knew a thingor at least nobody was willing to talk
Ned and Ed offered any help they could givebut said nothing that
helped Erma was puzzled but ignorant Senor Alcala knew nothing and
no one else was any better off as far as Charley could discover

After a week Charley decided there was only one person for him to see
Ed Baylis had recommended him and so had the little Santa Claus
Professor Lightning didnt look like much of a lead but there was
nothing else left The audience was still dropping little by little
and Charley knew perfectly well that something had to be done and fast

Getting a leave of absence was even easier than hed expected it to be
and that was just one more proof of how far his standing with the show
had dropped People just didnt care he wasnt a draw any more

And his standing with the carny was all he had left He had caught
himself lately wondering if he would really be so badly off with two
arms like everybody else The idea frightened him but the way it kept
coming back frightened him even more

Leaving the carny lot of course he put on his sandals outside the
carnival he had to wear shoes They were laceless of course and made
to be kicked off easily Charley slipped into them and thought wryly of
the professor and his scientific Renaissance The shoes were a new
plastic lightweight and longlasting but the dyeing problem hadnt
quite been solved Instead of a quiet dull brown they were a garish
shade that almost approached olive drab

Illustration

Well he thought nothings perfect He shrugged into a harness and had
his single suitcase attached to it the harness and case were
lightweight too and Charley headed for the station walking easily

He climbed aboard the train and dropped his suitcase into the Automatic
Porter and then went to find a seat The only one available was next to
a middleaged man chewing a cigar in a sour silence Charley slipped
into his seat without a word and hoped the man would ignore him He had
a face like an overripe summer squash and his big hands clasped in his
lap were fat and white covered with tiny freckles Charley leaned back
and closed his eyes

A minute or so passed in silence

Then a voice said Heading for New York

Thats right Charley said tiredly He opened his eyes The
middleaged man was leaning toward him smelling of his cheap cigar

Likewise the man said His voice was hoarse and unpleasant I
thought you might be

Thats right Charley said Long trip He hoped desperately that the
man would leave him alone He wasnt on display now he wanted the time
to think to try and figure out what had been happening He had to have
some questions to ask Professor Lightning and that meant that he had to
have some sort of plan of action

Going to see that doctor the middleaged man said That right

Thats right Charley said Apparently Professor Lightning had become
a nineday wonder anyone going to New York was presumed to be going to
see him

Then Charley corrected himself Not anyone

Any cripple

Get the arms fixed right the middleaged man said

Thats right Charley said for the third time Maybe the man would
take the hint

But he had no such luck Thats a fine thing the doctor is doing he
said I mean helping all these people Dont have to be  well
look bud dont take me personally

I dont mind Charley said Im used to it

Sure the man said Hey by the way My names Roquefort Al
Roquefort

Charley de Milo Charley said

Glad to know you the man said So while were traveling companions
you might say  might as well get to be friendly

Sure Charley said tiredly He looked round the car A great many
people seemed to be heading East There were no other seats Charley
sighed and shrugged himself deeper into the upholstery

You know Roquefort said suddenly I cant help thinking

Oh Charley said fidgeting his feet

Thats right Roquefort said I mean all these people And Dr
Schinsake I remember once I went to a circus or a sideshow

Carnival probably Charley put in knowing exactly what was coming

Something like that Roquefort said Anyhow they had this sideshow
and there was a man there without any legs Did all kinds of tricksgot
along real good But I cant help thinking now he wouldnt have to get
along that way any more Because this doctor would fix him up

I guess so Charley said wearily

Sure Roquefort said Its a great thing what hes doing All these
freak shows  you understand its just a name for them

I understand Charley said Dont worry about it He shifted his
feet nervously Shoes always felt a little uncomfortable even
lightweight sandals he felt trapped in them Now if he had arms and
hands 

He choked the thought off before it got any further

All these shows Roquefort said why there isnt any need for them
any more I mean the people without legs or arms anyhow See Because
this doctor

I see Charley said

Why anybody works in a show like that I mean without arms or
legswhy hes just crazy thats all When he can get help I mean

Sure Charley said uneasily Sure hes just crazy

Roquefort chomped on his cigar and looked solemn and wellinformed
Charley shivered slightly and wondered why

Just crazy Was that what they thought he wondered Was that what
they were thinking when they looked up at him

He shivered again and slipped his shoes off quietly Immediately he
felt a little better

But not very much

                                   

New York was a madhouse worse than any carnival Charley had ever seen
He made his way harness and suitcase on his back through the station
crowds and out into the taxi ramp A line of the new cabs stood there
and Charley managed to grab one inches ahead of a woman with a small
crying child in tow He gestured to the driver with his head and the
door slid open He stepped inside released the catch that let his
suitcase thump to the floor and sat down with a sigh

Tough hey the cabbie said His glowing nameplate read David Peters
Wells He turned around showing a face that had little in common with
the official license photo under his name He was swarthy and short
with large yellowing teeth and tiny eyes Where to Mac he said

Charley licked his lips I really dont know he said

The cabbie blinked What

Im going to need some help Charley said I want to find a Dr
Schinsake but I dont know where he is If you can drive me to a
drugstore where we can look him up in a phone book

Dr Schinsake the driver said Thats the guy who grows things I
mean arms and legs Like that

Thats right Charley said

OK buddy the driver said Just hang on The cab started with a
cough and a roar and shot out of the terminal like a bazooka shell
Over the noise of travel the cabbie said Going to get yourself fixed
up No offense Mac

No offense Charley said Im just going to talk to him

Oh the cabbie said Sure There was silence for a second Then the
cabbie turned around The machine shot ahead down a wide avenue filled
with cars Charley took a deep breath and forgot to let it go You
know the cabbie said I seen something funny the other day

Really Charley said through clenched teeth

The cabbie turned back casually flicked the wheel to avoid an oncoming
truck and continued Funny yeah Went to the Flea Museum  you
know the sideshow here on Fortysecond

I know it Charley said Hed been offered winter work in the place
several times though hed never accepted Everyone in carny life knew
of the place

And anyhow I went down the other day and there was this guy  he
was like you Mac I mean no arms You dont mind me talking about it

Apparently everybody thought he was sensitive on the subject Charley
reflected tiredly I dont mind he said

Sure the cabbie said A red light showed ahead and the cab screeched
to a halt Anyhow there he was like a freak you know Hell Mac I
was mad I mean mad The guy wants me to pay money to see him he dont
want to go get cured Hes like lazy Mac Lazy Wants to sit around and
let me pay money I work hard for like some kind of a stuffed exhibit he
thinks he is The light changed the cab shuddered and moved on And
this doctor right here in the same city Now what do you think of
that

Charley shrugged I wouldnt know he said cautiously He took out a
cigarette with his left foot lit it with his right and slid both feet
back into his shoes Nearly there he asked

No offense Mac the cabbie said sounding obscurely troubled Were
there in a minute He turned and stared narrowly at Charley The cab
shot blindly on Say listen That with the cigarette You belong to
some kind of sideshow I mean no offense

No offense Charley said Thats right Im with a carnival

Well youre doing the right thing the cabbie said turning back to
the road again Amazingly there was no obstruction before them I
mean a guy has to be honest With this doctor around you cant be a
noarms guy any more its not fair Right

Charley licked his lips The cab stopped

Here we are the driver announced

Charley indicated his grouchbag still heavy with dollar bills hanging
round his neck With scrupulous care the driver extracted one bill
Keep the change Charley said And thanks for the conversation

He stepped out hooking the suitcase to his harness as he did so And
there in front of him was a small whitefaced stone building The cab
roared away behind him and Charley started across the sidewalk

Now in New York he had found out what he was going to ask Professor
Lightning And it was the one thing he hadnt thought possible

                                   

One flight of stairs led straight up from the doorway and Charley took
it slowly At the top was a great wooden door with a brass plate
screwed to it and on the brass plate a single name was incised Dr
E C Schinsake There was nothing else Charley slipped the shoe off
his right foot and rang the bell

A voice inside said Whos there Who is it please

Its me professor Charley called He slipped the sandal back on
Charley de Milo I came to see you

Charley There was a second of silence Charley de Milo Professor
Lightnings grating voice said From the show Footsteps came across a
room and the door swung open Professor Lightning stood inside just as
tall and whitehaired as ever and Charley blinked looking at him and
past him at the room

People didnt live in rooms like that he thought They were only for
the movies or maybe for millionaires but not for people real people
that Charley himself knew to talk to

The furniturea couch a few chairs and tables a phonographwas
glitteringly new and expensivelooking The walls were freshly painted
in soft bright colors and pictures hung on them strangelooking
pictures Charley couldnt make sense out of But they looked right
somehow in that room

On the floor there was a rug deeper and softerlooking than any Charley
had ever seen And away to the right two floorlength windows
sparkled hung with great drapes and shining in the daylight There were
flowers growing outside the sills just visible above the window frames
Charley gulped and took a breath

Come in Professor Lightning said Come in In the midst of the riot
of wealth the professor didnt seem to have changed at all He was
still wearing the same ratty robe hed worn in the carnival his hair
was still as uncombed It was only on second glance that Charley saw the
look in his eyes Professor Lightning was Dr Schinsake now the eyes
said that and were proud of it And the world agreed with Dr
Schinsake

Charley came into the bright room and stood quietly until Dr Schinsake
asked him to sit down

Well now my boy he said You havent given me a word since you
rang the bell and I would like to know why youre here Frankly youre
lucky to catch me in but we were up late last night working in the
labs Im afraid I overslept a little His eyes shone with the mention
of his laboratories It was a far cry from the back of the science tent
Charley supposed

But hed come for a definite purpose He licked his lips waited a
second and said Professor its about my arms What you said you
could do

Your arms The old man frowned Now Youve come to me  Charley
my boy tell me why Tell me why you have changed your mind now

Charley nodded I  I didnt start out here to ask you about my
arms he said But on the way I started putting things together
Professor why do people come to sideshows

The old man shrugged Entertainment he said

Sure but there are all kinds of entertainment Charley said Like
strong men There used to be a lot of strong men in carnivals but there
arent any more And now I know why Ed Baylis started to tell me but I
 well never mind

Charley the old man said What do strong men have to do with

Let me tell you professor Charley said People dont care about
strong men any more there are too many gadgets around Nobody has to be
a strong man nobody wants to watch one Theyre useless See

Everyone can be his own strong man the old man said

Right Charley said The chain hoistmachines like thatthey killed
off the whole act Years ago And youve killed off the Armless Wonders
and the Legless Wonders professor Youve done it all at once

Professor Lightning shook his head I dont see he began

Anybody can grow new arms Charley said So the man without
armshes not an object of pity any more Hes just some guy who
doesnt want to work Nobody wants to go and see him let him grow arms
if he doesnt want to be called a lazy bum See

There was a little silence

I see Professor Lightning said slowly Without pity without a
strong sense of identification there is no audience

For me there isnt Charley said Or for anybody like me

Professor Lightning nodded Well he said I hardly meant to 
well Charley you came for something else His face seemed to
lengthen And I must tell you  Charley I have been doing a lot of
work I am hardly a professional scientist I have been away too long

But

It is true Professor Lightning said sadly Never mind Ive had my
one discoveryhow much an accident no one may ever know But I
neglected to widen the scope of what I had done I generalized too
rapidly my boy He took a deep breath The method the technique is
very complex he said But imagine it this way a man comes to New
York He explores it Later when he goes home he is asked to draw a
map of itand he can do so because he has the experience He has the
memory of New York locked in his mind

Charley nodded What does that have to do with me he said

The cells  the cells of the body seem to have such a memory the
professor said It is the basis of my technique

Charley nodded OK he said I dont care how it works so long as
it It does work doesnt it

The professor shook his head Very slowly he said Not for you my
boy Not for you He paused You see you were born without arms In
such a case the cellular memory does not seem to existlike a man who
has never been to New York He cannot draw the map He has no memory to
begin with

The silence this time was a long one

At last Charley said But somebody could tell him I mean about New
York so he could draw the map

Perhaps the professor said We are working on it Some day

But not today Charley said Is that it

I  Im afraid so the professor said

Charley sat for a long time thinking He pictured the carnival and the
shrinking audiences Could he explain to them why he couldnt get arms
Would any audience stop to listen and digest the truth Charley thought
of the armless man in the Flea Museum and decided slowly that no
explanation would be good enough People didnt stop to make small
distinctions Not in a sideshow Not in a carnival

No

There was only one thing he could do he saw that clearly But it took
him a long time to find the right words At last he had them

Professor he said suppose I go right back to being a sideshow
exhibitbut with a limited audience

Professor Lightning looked puzzled What do you mean he said

Well Charley said carefully and with a sudden surprising feeling of
hope you dont happen to need a new guinea pig do you

considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States  US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks online payments and credit card
donations  To donate please visit httppglaforgdonate


Section   General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone  For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included  Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

     httpwwwgutenbergnet

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
