The following Essay first appeared in the Christian Remembrancer of
January  and it was reprinted in a volume of Essays and
Reviews published in 

It was written before the appearance in Germany and England of the
abundant recent literature on the subject With the exception of a few
trifling corrections it is republished without change

By the desire of Mr Macmillan a translation of the De Monarchia is
subjoined I am indebted for it to my son Mr FJ Church late
Scholar of New College It is made from the text of Wittes second
edition of the De Monarchia  The De Monarchia has been more
than once translated into Italian and German in earlier or later
times But I do not know that any English translation has yet
appeared It is analysed in the fifteenth chapter of Mr Bryces Holy
Roman Empire

Witte with much probability I think places the composition of the
work in the first part of Dantes life before his exile in 
while the pretensions and arguments of Boniface VIII  were
being discussed by Guelf and Ghibelline partisans but before they
were formally embodied in the famous Bull Unam Sanctam  The
character of the composition for the most part formal general and
scholastic sanguine in tone and with little personal allusion is in
strong contrast with the passionate and despairing language of
resentment and disappointment which marks his later writings As an
example of the political speculation of the time it should be
compared with the De Regimine Principum ascribed to Thomas
Aquinas The whole subject of the medival idea of the Empire is
admirably discussed in Mr Bryces book referred to above

Footnote  Dantes Divine Comedy the Inferno a literal Prose
Translation with the Text of the Original By JA CARLYLE MD
London  I have never quite forgiven myself for not having said
more of the unpretending but honest and most useful volume which stood
at the head of this essay when it first appeared as an article It was
placed there according to what was then a custom of article writers
as a peg to hang remarks upon which might or might not be criticisms
of the particular book so noticed It did not offer itself specially
to my use and my attention was busy with my own work But this was no
excuse for availing myself of a good book and not giving it the
notice which it deserved To an English student beginning Dante and
wishing to study him in a scholarly manner it is really more useful
than a verse translation can be and I have always greatly regretted
that the plan of translating the whole work was dropped for want of
the appreciation which the first instalment ought to have had



The Divina Commedia is one of the landmarks of history More than a
magnificent poem more than the beginning of a language and the
opening of a national literature more than the inspirer of art and
the glory of a great people it is one of those rare and solemn
monuments of the minds power which measure and test what it can
reach to which rise up ineffaceably and for ever as time goes on
marking out its advance by grander divisions than its centuries and
adopted as epochs by the consent of all who come after It stands with
the Iliad and Shaksperes Plays with the writings of Aristotle and
Plato with the Novum Organon and the Principia with Justinians
Code with the Parthenon and S Peters It is the first Christian
poem and it opens European literature as the Iliad did that of
Greece and Rome And like the Iliad it has never become out of
date it accompanies in undiminished freshness the literature which it
began

We approach the history of such works in which genius seems to have
pushed its achievements to a new limit with a kind of awe The
beginnings of all things their bursting out from nothing and gradual
evolution into substance and shape cast on the mind a solemn
influence They come too near the fount of being to be followed up
without our feeling the shadows which surround it We cannot but fear
cannot but feel ourselves cut off from this visible and familiar
worldas we enter into the cloud And as with the processes of
nature so it is with those offsprings of mans mind by which he has
added permanently one more great feature to the world and created a
new power which is to act on mankind to the end The mystery of the
inventive and creative faculty the subtle and incalculable
combinations by which it was led to its work and carried through it
are out of the reach of investigating thought Often the idea recurs
of the precariousness of the result by how little the world might
have lost one of its ornamentsby one sharp pang or one chance
meeting or any other among the countless accidents among which man
runs his course And then the solemn recollection supervenes that
powers were formed and life preserved and circumstances arranged
and actions controlled that thus it should be and the work which man
has brooded over and at last created is the fosterchild too of that
Wisdom which reaches from end to end strongly and sweetly disposing
all things

It does not abate these feelings that we can follow in some cases and
to a certain extent the progress of a work Indeed the sight of the
particular accidents among which it was developedwhich belong
perhaps to a heterogeneous and widely discordant order of things
which are out of proportion and out of harmony with it which do not
explain it which have as it may seem to us no natural right to be
connected with it to bear on its character or contribute to its
accomplishment to which we feel as it were ashamed to owe what we
can least spare yet on which its forming mind and purpose were
dependent and with which they had to conspireaffects the
imagination even more than cases where we see nothing We are tempted
less to musing and wonder by the Iliad a work without a history
cut off from its past the sole relic and vestige of its age
unexplained in its origin and perfection than by the Divina
Commedia destined for the highest ends and most universal sympathy
yet the reflection of a personal history and issuing seemingly from
its chance incidents

The Divina Commedia is singular among the great works with which it
ranks for its strong stamp of personal character and history In
general we associate little more than the namenot the lifeof a
great poet with his works personal interest belongs more usually to
greatness in its active than its creative forms But the whole idea
and purpose of the Commedia as well as its filling up and
colouring are determined by Dantes peculiar history The loftiest
perhaps in its aim and flight of all poems it is also the most
individual the writers own life is chronicled in it as well as the
issues and upshot of all things It is at once the mirror to all time
of the sins and perfections of men of the judgments and grace of God
and the record often the only one of the transient names and local
factions and obscure ambitions and forgotten crimes of the poets
own day and in that awful company to which he leads us in the most
unearthly of his scenes we never lose sight of himself And when this
peculiarity sends us to history it seems as if the poem which was to
hold such a place in Christian literature hung upon and grew out of
chance events rather than the deliberate design of its author
History indeed here as generally is but a feeble exponent of the
course of growth in a great mind and great ideas It shows us early a
bent and purposethe man conscious of power and intending to use
itand then the accidents among which he worked but how that current
of purpose threaded its way among them how it was thrown back
deflected deepened by them we cannot learn from history It
presents but a broken and mysterious picture A boy of quick and
enthusiastic temper grows up into youth in a dream of love The lady
of his mystic passion dies early He dreams of her still not as a
wonder of earth but as a Saint in Paradise and relieves his heart in
an autobiography a strange and perplexing work of fictionquaint and
subtle enough for a metaphysical conceit but on the other hand with
far too much of genuine and deep feeling It is a first essay he
closes it abruptly as if dissatisfied with his work but with the
resolution of raising at a future day a worthy monument to the memory
of her whom he has lost It is the promise and purpose of a great
work But a prosaic change seems to come over this halfideal
character The lover becomes the studentthe student of the th
centurystruggling painfully against difficulties eager and hot
after knowledge wasting eyesight and stinting sleep subtle
inquisitive activeminded and sanguine but omnivorous overflowing
with dialectical forms loose in premiss and ostentatiously rigid in
syllogism fettered by the refinements of halfawakened taste and the
mannerisms of the Provenals Boethius and Cicero and the mass of
mixed learning within his reach are accepted as the consolation of
his human griefs he is filled with the passion of universal
knowledge and the desire to communicate it Philosophy has become the
lady of his soulto write allegorical poems in her honour and to
comment on them with all the apparatus of his learning in prose his
mode of celebrating her Further he marries it is said not happily
The antiquaries too have disturbed romance by discovering that
Beatrice also was married some years before her death He appears as
time goes on as a burgher of Florence the father of a family a
politician an envoy a magistrate a partisan taking his full share
in the quarrels of the day At length we see him at once an exile
and the poet of the Commedia Beatrice reappearsshadowy melting
at times into symbol and figurebut far too living and real
addressed with too intense and natural feeling to be the mere
personification of anything The lady of the philosophical Canzoni
has vanished The students dream has been broken as the boys had
been and the earnestness of the man enlightened by sorrow
overleaping the students formalities and abstractions reverted in
sympathy to the earnestness of the boy and brooded once more on that
Saint in Paradise whose presence and memory had once been so
soothing and who now seemed a real link between him and that stable
country where the angels are in peace Round her image the
reflection of purity and truth and forbearing love was grouped that
confused scene of trouble and effort of failure and success which
the poet saw round him round her image it arranged itself in awful
orderand that image not a metaphysical abstraction but the living
memory freshened by sorrow and seen through the softening and
hallowing vista of years of Beatrice Portinarino figment of
imagination but Gods creature and servant A childish love
dissipated by study and business and revived in memory by heavy
sorrowa boyish resolution made in a moment of feeling interrupted
though it would be hazardous to say in Dantes case laid aside for
apparently more manly studies gave the idea and suggested the form of
the Sacred poem of earth and heaven

And the occasion of this startling unfolding of the poetic gift of
this passage of a soft and dreamy boy into the keenest boldest
sternest of poets the free and mighty leader of European song was
what is not ordinarily held to be a source of poetical inspirationthe
political life The boy had sensibility high aspirations and a
versatile and passionate nature the student added to this energy
various learning gifts of language and noble ideas on the capacities
and ends of man But it was the factions of Florence which made Dante
a great poet But for them he might have been a modern critic and
essayist born before his time and have held a high place among the
writers of fugitive verses in Italy a graceful but trifling and idle
tribe often casting a deep and beautiful thought into a mould of
expressive diction but oftener toying with a foolish and glittering
conceit and whose languid genius was exhausted by a sonnet He might
have thrown into the shade the Guidos and Cinos of his day to be
eclipsed by Petrarch But he learned in the bitter feuds of Italy not
to trifle they opened to his view and he had an eye to see the true
springs and abysses of this mortal lifemotives and passions stronger
than lovers sentiments evils beyond the consolations of Boethius and
Cicero and from that fiery trial which without searing his heart
annealed his strength and purpose he drew that great gift and power
by which he stands preeminent even among his high compeers the gift
of being real And the idea of the Commedia took shape and expanded
into its endless forms of terror and beauty not under the rooftree
of the literary citizen but when the exile had been driven out to the
highways of the world to study nature on the sea or by the river or
on the mountain track and to study men in the courts of Verona and
Ravenna and in the schools of Bologna and Parisperhaps of Oxford

The connexion of these feuds with Dantes poem has given to the middle
age history of Italy an interest of which it is not undeserving in
itself full as it is of curious exhibitions of character and
contrivance but to which politically it cannot lay claim amid the
social phenomena so far grander in scale and purpose and more
felicitous in issue of the other western nations It is remarkable
for keeping up an antique phase which in spite of modern
arrangements it has not yet lost It is a history of cities In
ancient history all that is most memorable and instructive gathers
round cities civilisation and empire were concentrated within walls
and it baffled the ancient mind to conceive how power should be
possessed and wielded by numbers larger than might be collected in a
single marketplace The Roman Empire indeed aimed at being one in its
administration and law but it was not a nation nor were its
provinces nations Yet everywhere but in Italy it prepared them for
becoming nations And while everywhere else parts were uniting and
union was becoming organisationand neither geographical remoteness
nor unwieldiness of numbers nor local interests and differences were
untractable obstacles to that spirit of fusion which was at once the
ambition of the few and the instinct of the many and cities even
where most powerful had become the centres of the attracting and
joining forces knots in the political networkwhile this was going
on more or less happily throughout the rest of Europe in Italy the
ancient classic idea lingered in its simplicity its narrowness and
jealousy wherever there was any political activity The history of
Southern Italy indeed is mainly a foreign one the history of modern
Rome merges in that of the Papacy but Northern Italy has a history of
its own and that is a history of separate and independent
citiespoints of reciprocal and indestructible repulsion and within
theatres of action where the blind tendencies and traditions of
classes and parties weighed little on the freedom of individual
character and citizens could watch and measure and study one another
with the minuteness of private life

Two cities were the centres of ancient history in its most interesting
time And two cities of modern Italy represent with entirely
undesigned but curiously exact coincidence the parts of Athens and
Rome Venice superficially so unlike is yet in many of its
accidental features and still more in its spirit the counterpart of
Rome in its obscure and mixed origin in its steady growth in its
quick sense of order and early settlement of its polity in its grand
and serious public spirit in its subordination of the individual to
the family and the family to the state in its combination of remote
dominion with the liberty of a solitary and sovereign city And though
the associations and the scale of the two were so differentthough
Rome had its hills and its legions and Venice its lagunes and
galleysthe long empire of Venice the heir of Carthage and
predecessor of England on the seas the great aristocratic republic of
 years is the only empire that has yet matched Rome in length and
steadiness of tenure Brennus and Hannibal were not resisted with
greater constancy than Doria and Louis XII and that great
aristocracy long so proud so highspirited so intelligent so
practical who combined the enterprise and wealth of merchants the
selfdevotion of soldiers and gravity of senators with the uniformity
and obedience of a religious order may compare without shame its
Giustiniani and Zenos and Morosini with Roman Fabii and Claudii
And Rome could not be more contrasted with Athens than Venice with
Italian and contemporary Florencestability with fitfulness
independence impregnable and secure with a shortlived and troubled
liberty empire meditated and achieved with a course of barren
intrigues and quarrels Florence gay capricious turbulent the city
of party the head and busy patroness of democracy in the cities round
herFlorence where popular government was inaugurated with its
utmost exclusiveness and most pompous ceremonial waging her little
summer wars against Ghibelline tyrants revolted democracies and her
own exiles and further so rich in intellectual gifts in variety of
individual character in poets artists wits historiansFlorence in
its brilliant days recalled the image of ancient Athens and did not
depart from its prototype in the beauty of its natural site in its
noble public buildings in the size and nature of its territory And
the course of its history is similar and the result of similar
causesa traditional spirit of freedom with its accesses of fitful
energy its periods of grand display and moments of glorious
achievement but producing nothing politically great or durable and
sinking at length into a resigned servitude It had its Peisistratid
more successful than those of Athens it had too its Harmodius and
Aristogeiton it had its great orator of liberty as potent and as
unfortunate as the antagonist of Philip And finally like Athens it
became content with the remembrance of its former glory with being
the fashionable and acknowledged seat of refinement and taste with
being a favoured dependency on the modern heir of the Csars But if
to Venice belongs a grander public history Florentine names and
works like Athenian will be living among men when the Brenta shall
have been left unchecked to turn the Lagunes into ploughland and when
Rome herself may no longer be the seat of the Popes

The year of Dantes birth was a memorable one in the annals of
Florence of Italy and of Christendom The year  was the year
of that great victory of Benevento where Charles of Anjou overthrew
Manfred of Naples and destroyed at one blow the power of the house of
Swabia From that time till the time of Charles V the emperors had
no footing in Italy Further that victory set up the French influence
in Italy which transient in itself produced such strange and
momentous consequences by the intimate connexion to which it led
between the French kings and the Popes The protection of France was
dearly bought by the captivity of Avignon the great western schism
and the consequent secularisation of the Papacy which lasted on
uninterrupted till the Council of Trent Nearly three centuries of
degradation and scandal unrelieved by one heroic effort among the
successors of Gregory VII connected the Reformation with the triumph
of Charles and the Pope at Benevento Finally by it the Guelf party
was restored for good in Florence the Guelf democracy which had been
trampled down by the Uberti and Manfreds chivalry at Monteaperti
once more raised its head and fortune which had long wavered between
the rival lilies finally turned against the white one till the name
of Ghibelline became a proscribed one in Florence as Jacobite was
once in Scotland or Papist in England or Royalist in France

Footnote  May  Pelli Benevento Feb   The
Florentine year began March 

The names of Guelf and Ghibelline were the inheritance of a contest
which in its original meaning had been long over The old struggle
between the priesthood and the empire was still kept up traditionally
but its ideas and interests were changed they were still great and
important ones but not those of Gregory VII It had passed over from
the mixed region of the spiritual and temporal into the purely
political The cause of the popes was that of the independence of
Italythe freedom and alliance of the great cities of the north and
the dependence of the centre and south on the Roman See To keep the
Emperor out of Italyto create a barrier of powerful cities against
him south of the Alpsto form behind themselves a compact territory
rich removed from the first burst of invasion and maintaining a
strong body of interested feudatories had now become the great object
of the popes It may have been a wise policy on their part for the
maintenance of their spiritual influence to attempt to connect their
own independence with the political freedom of the Italian
communities but certain it is that the ideas and the characters which
gave a religious interest and grandeur to the earlier part of the
contest appear but sparingly if at all in its later forms

The two parties did not care to keep in view principles which their
chiefs had lost sight of The Emperor and the Pope were both real
powers able to protect and assist and they divided between them
those who required protection and assistance Geographical position
the rivalry of neighbourhood family tradition private feuds and
above all private interest were the main causes which assigned
cities families and individuals to the Ghibelline or Guelf party
One party called themselves the Emperors liegemen and their
watchword was authority and law the other side were the liegemen of
Holy Church and their cry was liberty and the distinction as a broad
one is true But a democracy would become Ghibelline without scruple
if its neighbour town was Guelf and among the Guelf liegemen of the
Church and liberty the pride of blood and love of power were not a
whit inferior to that of their opponents Yet though the original
principle of the contest was lost and the political distinctions of
parties were often interfered with by interest or accident it is not
impossible to trace in the two factions differences of temper of
moral and political inclinations which though visible only on a large
scale and in the mass were quite sufficient to give meaning and
reality to their mutual opposition These differences had come down
greatly altered of course from the quarrel in which the parties took
their rise The Ghibellines as a body reflected the worldliness the
licence the irreligion the reckless selfishness the daring
insolence and at the same time the gaiety and pomp the princely
magnificence and generosity and largeness of mind of the house of
Swabia they were the men of the court and camp imperious and haughty
from ancient lineage or the Imperial cause yet not wanting in the
frankness and courtesy of nobility careless of public opinion and
public rights but not dead to the grandeur of public objects and
public services Among them were found or to them inclined all who
whether from a base or a lofty ambition desired to place their will
above lawthe lord of the feudal castle the robberknight of the
Apennine pass the magnificent but terrible tyrants of the cities the
pride and shame of Italy the Visconti and Scaligers That renowned
Ghibelline chief whom the poet finds in the fiery sepulchres of the
unbelievers with the great Ghibelline emperor and the princely
Ghibelline cardinalthe disdainful and bitter but lofty spirit of
Farinata degli Uberti the conqueror and then singly and at his own
risk the saviour of his country which had wronged him represents the
good as well as the bad side of his party

Fiorentini era Guelfo e nimico di tutti i loro nimici o Guelfi o
Ghibellini che fossonoG Vill vii  A Ghibelline by birth and
disposition yet from circumstances a close ally of the Guelfs of
Florence

The Guelfs on the other hand were the party of the middle classes
they rose out of and held to the people they were strong by their
compactness their organisation in cities their commercial relations
and interests their command of money Further they were professedly
the party of strictness and religion a profession which fettered them
as little as their opponents were fettered by the respect they claimed
for imperial law But though by personal unscrupulousness and
selfishness and in instances of public vengeance they sinned as
deeply as the Ghibellines they stood far more committed as a party to
a public meaning and purposeto improvement in law and the condition
of the poor to a protest against the insolence of the strong to the
encouragement of industry The genuine Guelf spirit was austere
frugal independent earnest religious fond of its home and Church
and of those celebrations which bound together Church and home but
withal very proud very intolerant in its higher form intolerant of
evil but intolerant always to whatever displeased it Yet there was a
grave and noble manliness about it which long kept it alive in
Florence It had not as yet turned itself against the practical
corruptions of the Church which was its ally but this also it was to
do when the popes had forsaken the cause of liberty and leagued
themselves with the brilliant tyranny of the Medici Then Savonarola
invoked and not in vain the stern old Guelf spirit of resistance of
domestic purity and severity and of domestic religion against
unbelief and licentiousness even in the Church and the Guelf
Piagnoni presented in a more simple and generous shape a
resemblance to our own Puritans as the Ghibellines often recall the
coarser and worse features of our own Cavaliers

In Florence these distinctions had become mere nominal ones confined
to the great families who carried on their private feuds under the old
party names when Frederick II once more gave them their meaning
Although the accursed Guelf and Ghibelline factions lasted amongst
the nobles of Florence and they often waged war among themselves out
of private grudges and took sides for the said factions and held one
with another and those who called themselves Guelfs desired the
establishment of the Pope and Holy Church and those who called
themselves Ghibellines favoured the Emperor and his adherents yet
withal the people and commonalty of Florence maintained itself in
unity to the wellbeing and honour and establishment of the
commonwealth But the appearance on the scene of an emperor of
such talent and bold designs revived the languid contest and gave to
party a cause and to individual passions and ambition an impulse and
pretext The division between Guelf and Ghibelline again became
serious involved all Florence armed house against house and
neighbourhood against neighbourhood issued in merciless and
vindictive warfare grew on into a hopeless and deadly breach and
finally lost to Florence without remedy or repair half her noble
houses and the love of the greatest of her sons The old badge of
their common country became to the two factions the sign of their
implacable hatred the white lily of Florence borne by the
Ghibellines was turned to red by the Guelfs and the flower of two
colours marked a civil strife as cruel and as fatal if on a smaller
scale as that of the English roses

It was waged with the peculiar characteristics of Italian civil war
There the city itself was the scene of battle A thirteenth century
city in Italy bore on its face the evidence that it was built and
arranged for such emergencies Its crowded and narrow streets were a
collection of rival castles whose tall towers rising thick and close
over its roofs or hanging perilously over its close courts attested
the emulous pride and the insecurity of Italian civic life There
within a separate precinct flanked and faced by jealous friends or
deadly enemies were clustered together the dwellings of the various
members of each great housetheir common home and the monument of
their magnificence and pride and capable of being as was so often
necessary their common refuge In these fortresses of the leading
families scattered about the city were the various points of onset
and recovery in civic battle in the streets barricades were raised
mangonels and crossbows were plied from the towers a series of
separate combats raged through the city till chance at length
connected the attacks of one side or some panic paralysed the
resistance of the other or a conflagration interposed itself between
the combatants burning out at once Guelf and Ghibelline and laying
half Florence in ashes Each party had their turn of victory each
when vanquished went into exile and carried on the war outside the
walls each had their opportunity of remodelling the orders and
framework of government and each did so relentlessly at the cost of
their opponents They excluded classes they proscribed families they
confiscated property they sacked and burned warehouses they levelled
the palaces and outraged the pride of their antagonists To destroy
was not enough without adding to it the keenest and newest refinement
of insult Two buildings in Florence were peculiarly dearamong their
cari luoghito the popular feeling and the Guelf party the
Baptistery of St John il mio bel S Giovanni to which all the
good people resorted on Sundays where they had all received
baptism where they had been married where families were solemnly
reconciled and a tall and beautiful tower close by it called the
Torre del Guardamorto where the bodies of the good people who of
old were all buried at S Giovanni rested on their way to the grave
The victorious Ghibellines when they levelled the Guelf towers
overthrew this one and endeavoured to make it crush in its fall the
sacred church which says the old chronicler was prevented by a
miracle The Guelfs when their day came built the walls of Florence
with the stones of Ghibelline palaces One great family stands out
preeminent in this fierce conflict as the victim and monument of
party war The head of the Ghibellines was the proud and powerful
house of the Uberti who shared with another great Ghibelline family
the Pazzi the valley of the upper Arno They lighted up the war in
the Emperors cause They supported its weight and guided it In time
of peace they were foremost and unrestrained in defiance of law and in
scorn of the peoplein war the peoples fiercest and most active
enemies Heavy sufferers in their property and by the sword and axe
yet untamed and incorrigible they led the van in that battle so long
remembered to their cost by the Guelfs the battle of Monteaperti

That the head of their house Farinata saved Florence from the
vengeance of his meaner associates was not enough to atone for the
unpardonable wrongs which they had done to the Guelfs and the
democracy When the red lily of the Guelfs finally supplanted the
white one as the arms of Florence and the badge of Guelph triumph
they were proscribed for ever like the Peisistratid and the
Tarquins In every amnesty their names were excepted The site on
which their houses had stood was never again to be built upon and
remains the Great Square of Florence the architect of the Palace of
the People was obliged to sacrifice its symmetry and to place it
awry that its walls might not encroach on the accursed ground
They had been says a writer contemporary with Dante speaking of
the time when he also became an exile they had been for more than
forty years outlaws from their country nor ever found mercy nor pity
remaining always abroad in great state nor ever abased their honour
seeing that they ever abode with kings and lords and to great things
applied themselves They were loved as they were hated When under
the protection of a cardinal one of them visited the city and the
chequered blue and gold blazon of their house was after an interval
of half a century again seen in the streets of Florence many
ancient Ghibelline men and women pressed to kiss the arms and
even the common people did him honour

But the fortunes of Florentine factions depended on other causes than
merely the address or vigour of their leaders From the year of
Dantes birth and Charless victory Florence as far as we shall have
to do with it became irrevocably Guelf Not that the whole commonalty
of Florence formally called itself Guelf or that the Guelf party was
coextensive with it but the city was controlled by Guelf councils
devoted to the objects of the great Guelf party and received in
return the support of that party in curbing the pride of the nobles
and maintaining democratic forms The Guelf party of Florence though
it was the life and soul of the republic and irresistible in its
disposal of the influence and arms of Florence and though it embraced
a large number of the most powerful families is always spoken of as
something distinct from and external to the governing powers and
the whole body of the people It was a body with a separate and
selfconstituted existencein the state and allied to it but an
independent element holding on to a large and comprehensive union
without the state Its organisation in Florence is one of the most
curious among the many curious combinations which meet us in Italian
history After the final expulsion of the Ghibellines the Guelf party
took form as an institution with definite powers and a local
existence It appears with as distinct a shape as the Jacobin Club or
the Orange Lodges side by side with the government It was a
corporate body with a common seal common property not only in funds
but landsofficers archives a common palace a great council a
secret committee and last of all a public accuser of the
Ghibellines of the confiscated Ghibelline estates onethird went to
the republic another third to compensate individual Guelfs the rest
was assigned to the Guelf party A pope Clement IV 
had granted them his own arms and their device a red eagle
clutching a serpent may be yet seen with the red lily and the
partycoloured banner of the commonalty on the battlements of the
Palazzo Vecchio

But the expulsion of the Ghibellines did but little to restore peace
The great Guelf families as old as many of the Ghibellines had as
little reverence as they for law or civic rights Below these the
acknowledged nobility of Florence were the leading families of the

A great battle won against Ghibelline Arezzo raised the renown and
the military spirit of the Guelf party for the fame of the battle was
very great the hosts contained the choicest chivalry of either side
armed and appointed with emulous splendour The fighting was hard
there was brilliant and conspicuous gallantry and the victory was
complete It sealed Guelf ascendancy The Ghibelline warriorbishop
of Arezzo fell with three of the Uberti and other Ghibelline chiefs
It was a day of trial Many that day who had been thought of great
prowess were found dastards and many who had never been spoken of
were held in high esteem It repaired the honour of Florence and the
citizens showed their feeling of its importance by mixing up the
marvellous with its story Its tidings came to Florenceso runs the
tale in Villani who declares what he heard and saw himselfat the
very hour in which it was won The Priors of the republic were resting
in their palace during the noonday heat suddenly the chamber door was
shaken and the cry heard Rise up the Aretini are defeated The
door was opened but there was no one their servants had seen no one
enter the palace and no one came from the army till the hour of
vespers on a long summers day In this battle the Guelf leaders had
won great glory The hero of the day was the proudest handsomest
craftiest most winning most ambitious most unscrupulous Guelf noble
in Florenceone of a family who inherited the spirit and recklessness
of the proscribed Uberti and did not refuse the popular epithet of
MalefamiCorso Donati He did not come back from the field of
Campaldino where he had won the battle by disobeying orders with any
increased disposition to yield to rivals or court the populace or
respect other mens rights Those rivals tooand they also had
fought gallantly in the post of honour at Campaldinowere such as he
hated from his soulrivals whom he despised and who yet were too
strong for him His blood was ancient they were upstarts he was a
soldier they were traders he was poor they the richest men in
Florence They had come to live close to the Donati they had bought
the palace of an old Ghibelline family they had enlarged adorned
and fortified it and kept great state there They had crossed him in
marriages bargains inheritances They had won popularity honour
influence and yet they were but men of business while he had a part
in all the political movements of the day He was the friend and
intimate of lords and noblemen with great connexions and famous
through all Italy they were the favourites of the common people for
their kindness and good nature they even showed consideration for
Ghibellines He was an accomplished man of the world keen and subtle
full of malicious thoughts mischievous and crafty they were
inexperienced in intrigue and had the reputation of being clumsy and
stupid He was the most graceful and engaging of courtiers they were
not even gentlemen Lastly in the debates of that excitable republic
he was the most eloquent speaker and they were tonguetied

There was a family writes Dino Compagni who called themselves the
Cerchi men of low estate but good merchants and very rich and they
dressed richly and maintained many servants and horses and made a
brave show and some of them bought the palace of the Conti Guidi
which was near the houses of the Pazzi and Donati who were more
ancient of blood but not so rich therefore seeing the Cerchi rise to
great dignity and that they had walled and enlarged the palace and
kept great state the Donati began to have a great hatred against
them Villani gives the same account of the feud It began in
that quarter of scandal the Sesta of Porta S Piero between the
Cerchi and Donati on the one side through jealousy on the other
through churlish rudeness Of the house of the Cerchi was head Messer
Vieri de Cerchi and he and those of his house were people of great
business and powerful and of great relationships and most wealthy
traders so that their company was one of the greatest in the world
men they were of soft life and who meant no harm boorish and
illmannered like people who had come in a short time to great state
and power The Donati were gentlemen and warriors and of no
excessive wealth They were neighbours in Florence and in the
country and by the conversation of their jealousy with the peevish
boorishness of the others arose the proud scorn that there was
between them The glories of Campaldino were not as oil on these
troubled waters The conquerors flouted each other all the more
fiercely in the streets on their return and illtreated the lower
people with less scruple No gathering for festive or serious purposes
could be held without tempting strife A marriage a funeral a ball
a gay procession of cavaliers and ladiesany meeting where one stood
while another sat where horse or man might jostle another where
pride might be nettled or temper shown was in danger of ending in
blood The lesser quarrels meanwhile ranged themselves under the
greater ones and these especially that between the Cerchi and
Donati took more and more a political character The Cerchi inclined
more and more to the trading classes and the lower people they threw
themselves on their popularity and began to hold aloof from the
meetings of the Parte Guelfa while this organised body became an
instrument in the hands of their opponents a club of the nobles
Corso Donati besides mischief of a more substantial kind turned his
ridicule on their solemn dulness and awkward speech and his friends
the jesters one Scampolino in particular carried his gibes and
nicknames all over Florence The Cerchi received all in sullen and
clogged indifference They were satisfied with repelling attacks and
nursed their hatred

Thus the city was divided and the attempts to check the factions only
exasperated them It was in vain that when at times the government
and the populace lost patience severe measures were taken It was in
vain that the reformer Gian della Bella carried for a time his harsh
orders of justice against the nobles and invested popular vengeance
with the solemnity of law and with the pomp and ceremony of a public
actthat when a noble had been convicted of killing a citizen the
great officer Standardbearer as he was called of justice
issued forth in state and procession with the banner of justice borne
before him with all his train and at the head of the armed citizens
to the house of the criminal and razed it to the ground An
eyewitness describes the effect of such chastisementI Dino
Compagni being Gonfalonier of Justice in  went to their houses
and to those of their relations and these I caused to be pulled down
according to the laws This beginning in the case of the other
Gonfaloniers came to an evil effect because if they demolished the
houses according to the laws the people said that they were cruel
and if they did not demolish them completely they said that they were
cowards and many distorted justice for fear of the people Gian
della Bella was overthrown with few regrets even on the part of the
people Equally vain was the attempt to keep the peace by separating
the leaders of the disturbances They were banished by a kind of
ostracism they departed in ostentatious meekness Corso Donato to
plot at Rome Vieri de Cerchi to return immediately to Florence
Anarchy had got too fast a hold on the city and it required a
stronger hand than that of the pope or the signory of the republic
to keep it down

Yet Florence prospered Every year it grew richer more intellectual
more refined more beautiful more gay With its anarchy there was no
stagnation Torn and divided as it was its energy did not slacken
its busy and creative spirit was not deadened its hopefulness not
abated The factions fierce and personal as they were did not hinder
that interest in political ideas that active and subtle study of the
questions of civil government that passion and ingenuity displayed in
political contrivance which now pervaded Northern Italy everywhere
marvellously patient and hopeful though far from being equally
successful In Venice at the close of the thirteenth century that
polity was finally settled and consolidated by which she was great as
long as cities could be imperial and which even in its decay survived
the monarchy of Louis XIV and existed within the memory of living
men In Florence the constructive spirit of law and order only
resisted but never triumphed Yet it was at this time resolute and
sanguine ready with experiment and change and not yet dispirited by
continual failure Political interest however and party contests
were not sufficient to absorb and employ the citizens of Florence
Their genial and versatile spirit so keen so inventive so elastic
which made them such hot and impetuous partisans kept them from being
only this The time was one of growth new knowledge new powers new
tastes were opening to mennew pursuits attracted them There was
commerce there was the school philosophy there was the science of
nature there was ancient learning there was the civil law there
were the arts there was poetry all rude as yet and unformed but
full of hopethe living parents of mightier offspring Frederick II
had once more opened Aristotle to the Latin world he had given an
impulse to the study of the great monuments of Roman legislation which
was responded to through Italy himself a poet his example and his
splendid court had made poetry fashionable In the end of the
thirteenth century a great stride was made at Florence While her
great poet was growing up to manhood as rapid a change went on in her
streets her social customs the wealth of her citizens their ideas
of magnificence and beauty their appreciation of literature It was
the age of growing commerce and travel Franciscan missionaries had
reached China and settled there in  Marco Polo returned to
Venice the first successful explorer of the East The merchants of
Florence lagged not their field of operation was Italy and the West
they had their correspondents in London Paris and Bruges they were
the bankers of popes and kings And their city shows to this day
the wealth and magnificence of the last years of the thirteenth
century The ancient buildings consecrated in the memory of the
Florentine people were repaired enlarged adorned with marble and
bronzeOr San Michele the Badia the Baptistery and new buildings
rose on a grander scale In  was begun the Mausoleum of the great
Florentine dead the Church of S Croce In the same year a few
months later Arnolfo laid the deep foundations which were afterwards
to bear up Brunelleschis dome and traced the plan of the magnificent
cathedral In  he began to raise a Townhall worthy of the
Republic and of being the habitation of its magistrates the frowning
mass of the Palazzo Vecchio In  the third circle of the walls

the riches the profuse munificence the brilliant festivities the
careless and joyous life which attracted foreigners to Florence as
the city of pleasure of companies of a thousand or more all clad in
white robes under a lord styled of Love passing their time in
sports and dances of ladies and knights going through the city with
trumpets and other instruments with joy and gladness and meeting
together in banquets evening and morning entertaining illustrious
strangers and honourably escorting them on horseback in their passage
through the city tempting by their liberality courtiers and wits
and minstrels and jesters to add to the amusements of Florence
Nor were these the boisterous triumphs of unrefined and coarse
merriment How variety of character was drawn out how its more
delicate elements were elicited and tempered how nicely it was
observed and how finely drawn let the racy and openeyed

Not perhaps in these troops of revellers but amid music and song and
in the pleasant places of social and private life belonging to the
Florence of arts and poetry not to the Florence of factions and
strife should we expect to find the friend of the sweet singer
Casella and of the reserved and bold speculator Guido Cavalcanti
the mystic poet of the Vita Nuova so sensitive and delicate
trembling at a gaze or a touch recording visions painting angels
composing Canzoni and commenting on them finally devoting himself to
the austere consolations of deep study To superadd to such a
character that of a democratic politician of the middle ages seems an
incongruous and harsh combination Yet it was a real one in this
instance The scholars life is in our idea of it far separated from
the practical and the political we have been taught by our experience
to disjoin enthusiasm in love in art in what is abstract or
imaginative from keen interest and successful interference in the
affairs and conflicts of life The practical man may sometimes be also
a dilettante but the dreamer or the thinker wisely or indolently
keeps out of the rough ways where real passions and characters meet
and jostle or if he ventures seldom gains honour there The
separation though a natural one grows wider as society becomes more
vast and manifold as its ends functions and pursuits are
disentangled while they multiply But in Dantes time and in an
Italian city it was not such a strange thing that the most refined
and tender interpreter of feeling the popular poet whose verses
touched all hearts and were in every mouth should be also at once
the ardent follower of all abstruse and difficult learning and a
prominent character among those who administered the State In that
narrow sphere of action in that period of dawning powers and
circumscribed knowledge it seemed no unreasonable hope or unwise
ambition to attempt the compassing of all science and to make it
subserve and illustrate the praise of active citizenship Dante
like other literary celebrities of the time was not less from the
custom of the day than from his own purpose a public man He took
his place among his fellowcitizens he went out to war with them he
fought it is said among the skirmishers at the great Guelf victory
of Campaldino to qualify himself for office in the democracy he
enrolled himself in one of the Guilds of the people and was
matriculated in the Art of the Apothecaries he served the State as
its agent abroad he went on important missions to the cities and
courts of Italyaccording to a Florentine tradition which enumerates
fourteen distinct embassies even to Hungary and France In the
memorable year of Jubilee  he was one of the Priors of the
Republic There is no shrinking from fellowship and cooperation and
conflict with the keen or bold men of the marketplace and
councilhall in that mind of exquisite and as drawn by itself
exaggerated sensibility The doings and characters of men the
workings of society the fortunes of Italy were watched and thought
of with as deep an interest as the courses of the stars and read in
the real spectacle of life with as profound emotion as in the
miraculous page of Virgil and no scholar ever read Virgil with such
feelingno astronomer ever watched the stars with more eager
inquisitiveness The whole man opens to the world around him all

In a fresco in the chapel of the old palace of the Podest at

contemporary Giotto It was discovered in  under the whitewash

facsimile by the Arundel Society The fresco was afterwards restored
or repainted with no happy success He is represented as he might have
been in the year of Campaldino  The countenance is youthful yet
manly more manly than it appears in the engravings of the picture
but it only suggests the strong deep features of the wellknown
traditional face He is drawn with much of the softness and
melancholy pensive sweetness and with something also of the quaint
stiffness of the Vita Nuovawith his flower and his book With him
is drawn his master Brunetto Latini and Corso Donati We do not
know what occasion led Giotto thus to associate him with the great
Baron Dante was indeed closely connected with the Donati The
dwelling of his family was near theirs in the Quarter of Scandal

affection than the companion of his light and wayward days remembered

speaks as if in prophecy of Corsos miserable death avoids the
mention of his name Its silence is so remarkable as to seem
significant But though history does not group together Corso and
Dante the picture represents the truththeir fortunes were linked
together They were actors in the same sceneat this distance of time
two of the most prominent though a scene very different from that

The outlines of this part of Dantes history are so well known that it
is not necessary to dwell on them and more than the outlines we know
not The family quarrels came to a head issued in parties and the
parties took names they borrowed them from two rival factions in a
neighbouring town Pistoia whose feud was imported into Florence and
the Guelfs became divided into the Black Guelfs who were led by the
Donati and the White Guelfs who sided with the Cerchi It still
professed to be but a family feud confined to the great houses but
they were too powerful and Florence too small for it not to affect the
whole Republic The middle classes and the artisans looked on and
for a time not without satisfaction at the strife of the great men
but it grew evident that one party must crush the other and become
dominant in Florence and of the two the Cerchi and their White
adherents were less formidable to the democracy than the unscrupulous
and overbearing Donati with their military renown and lordly tastes
proud not merely of being nobles but Guelf nobles always loyal
champions once the martyrs and now the hereditary assertors of the
great Guelf cause The Cerchi with less character and less zeal but
rich liberal and showy and with more of rough kindness and vulgar
goodnature for the common people were more popular in Guelf Florence
than the Parte Guelfa and of course the Ghibellines wished them
well Both the contemporary historians of Florence lead us to think
that they might have been the governors and guides of the Republicif
they had chosen and had known how and both though condemning the
two parties equally seemed to have thought that this would have been
the best result for the State But the accounts of both though they
are very different writers agree in their scorn of the leaders of the
White Guelfs They were upstarts purseproud vain and
coarseminded and they dared to aspire to an ambition which they were
too dull and too cowardly to pursue when the game was in their
hands They wished to rule but when they might they were afraid The
commons were on their side the moderate men the party of law the
lovers of republican government and for the most part the
magistrates but they shrank from their fortune more from cowardice
than from goodness because they exceedingly feared their
adversaries Boniface VIII had no prepossessions in Florence
except for energy and an open hand the side which was most popular he
would have accepted and backed but he would not lose he said the
men for the women Io non voglio perdere gli uomini per le
femminelle If the Black party furnished types for the grosser
or fiercer forms of wickedness in the poets Hell the White party
surely were the originals of that picture of stupid and cowardly
selfishness in the miserable crowd who moan and are buffeted in the
vestibule of the Pit mingled with the angels who dared neither to
rebel nor be faithful but were for themselves and whoever it may
be who is singled out in the setta dei cattivi for deeper and

Of his subsequent life history tells us little more than the general
character He acted for a time in concert with the expelled party
when they attempted to force their way back to Florence he gave them
up at last in scorn and despair but he never returned to Florence
And he found no new home for the rest of his days Nineteen years
from his exile to his death he was a wanderer The character is
stamped on his writings History tradition documents all scanty or
dim do but disclose him to us at different points appearing here and
there we are not told how or why One old record discovered by
antiquarian industry shows him in a village church near Florence
planning with the Cerchi and the White party an attack on the Black
Guelfs In another he appears in the Val di Magra making peace
between its small potentates in another as the inhabitant of a
certain street in Padua The traditions of some remote spots about
Italy still connect his name with a ruined tower a mountain glen a
cell in a convent In the recollections of the following generation
his solemn and melancholy form mingled reluctantly and for awhile in
the brilliant court of the Scaligers and scared the women as a
visitant of the other world as he passed by their doors in the
streets of Verona Rumour brings him to the Westwith probability to
Paris more doubtfully to Oxford But little certain can be made out
about the places where he was an honoured and admired but it may be
not always a welcome guest till we find him sheltered cherished
and then laid at last to rest by the Lords of Ravenna There he still
rests in a small solitary chapel built not by a Florentine but a
Venetian Florence that mother of little love asked for his bones
but rightly asked in vain His place of repose is better in those
remote and forsaken streets by the shore of the Adrian Sea hard by

Theodosius and the mosaics of Justinianthan among the assembled
dead of S Croce or amid the magnificence of S Maria del Fiore

life It is the work of a wanderer The very form in which it is cast
is that of a journey difficult toilsome perilous and full of

expression for this mortal life and viator meant man in his
state of trial as comprehensor meant man made perfect having
attained to his heavenly country It is more than merely this The

various journeys The permanent scenery of the Inferno and
Purgatorio very variously and distinctly marked is that of travel

Of these years then of disappointment and exile the Divina Commedia
was the labour and fruit A story in Boccaccios life of Dante told
with some detail implies indeed that it was begun and some progress
made in it while Dante was yet in Florencebegun in Latin and he
quotes three lines of itcontinued afterwards in Italian This is not
impossible indeed the germ and presage of it may be traced in the
Vita Nuova The idealised saint is there in all the grace of her
pure and noble humbleness the guide and safeguard of the poets
soul She is already in glory with Mary the queen of angels She
already beholds the face of the Everblessed And the envoye of the
Vita Nuova is the promise of the Commedia After this sonnet
in which he describes how beyond the widest sphere of heaven his love
had beheld a lady receiving honour and dazzling by her glory the
unaccustomed spiritAfter this sonnet there appeared to me a
marvellous vision in which I saw things which made me resolve not to
speak more of this blessed one until such time as I should be able to
indite more worthily of her And to attain to this I study to the
utmost of my power as she truly knows So that if it shall be the
pleasure of Him by whom all things live that my life continue for
some years I hope to say of her that which never hath been said of
any woman And afterwards may it please Him who is the Lord of
kindness that my soul may go to behold the glory of her lady that
is of that blessed Beatrice who gloriously gazes on the countenance
of Him qui est per omnia secula benedictus It would be
wantonly violating probability and the unity of a great life to
suppose that this purpose though transformed was ever forgotten or
laid aside The poet knew not indeed what he was promising what he
was pledging himself tothrough what years of toil and anguish he
would have to seek the light and the power he had asked in what form
his high venture should be realised But the Commedia is the work of
no light resolve and we need not be surprised at finding the resolve
and the purpose at the outset of the poets life We may freely accept
the key supplied by the words of the Vita Nuova The spell of
boyhood is never broken through the ups and downs of life His course
of thought advances alters deepens but is continuous From youth to
age from the first glimpse to the perfect work the same idea abides
with him even from the flower till the grape was ripe It may
assume various changesan image of beauty a figure of philosophy a
voice from the other world a type of heavenly wisdom and joybut
still it holds in selfimposed and willing thraldom that creative
and versatile and tenacious spirit It was the dream and hope of too
deep and strong a mind to fade and come to naughtto be other than
the seed of the achievement and crown of life But with all faith in
the star and the freedom of genius we may doubt whether the
prosperous citizen would have done that which was done by the man
without a home Beatrices glory might have been sung in grand though
barbarous Latin to the literati of the fourteenth century or a poem
of new beauty might have fixed the language and opened the literature
of modern Italy but it could hardly have been the Commedia That
belongs in its date and its greatness to the time when sorrow had
become the poets daily portion and the condition of his life

Footnote  Vita Nuova last paragraph See Purg  Parad
  

The Commedia is a novel and startling apparition in literature
Probably it has been felt by some who have approached it with the
reverence due to a work of such renown that the world has been
generous in placing it so high It seems so abnormal so lawless so
reckless of all ordinary proprieties and canons of feeling taste and
composition It is rough and abrupt obscure in phrase and allusion
doubly obscure in purpose It is a medley of all subjects usually kept
distinct scandal of the day and transcendental science politics and
confessions coarse satire and angelic joy private wrongs with the
mysteries of the faith local names and habitations of earth with
visions of hell and heaven It is hard to keep up with the
everchanging current of feeling to pass as the poet passes without
effort or scruple from tenderness to ridicule from hope to bitter
scorn or querulous complaint from highraised devotion to the
calmness of prosaic subtleties or grotesque detail Each separate
element and vein of thought has its precedent but not their
amalgamation Many had written visions of the unseen world but they
had not blended with them their personal fortunes S Augustine had
taught the soul to contemplate its own history and had traced its
progress from darkness to light but he had not interwoven with it
the history of Italy and the consummation of all earthly destinies
Satire was no new thing Juvenal had given it a moral some of the
Provenal poets a political turn S Jerome had kindled into it
fiercely and bitterly even while expounding the Prophets but here it
streams forth in all its violence within the precincts of the eternal
world and alternates with the hymns of the blessed Lucretius had
drawn forth the poetry of nature and its laws Virgil and Livy had
unfolded the poetry of the Roman empire S Augustine the still
grander poetry of the history of the City of God but none had yet
ventured to weave into one the three wonderful threads And yet the
scope of the Italian poet vast and comprehensive as the issue of all
things universal as the government which directs nature and
intelligence forbids him not to stoop to the lowest caitiff he has
ever despised the minutest fact in nature that has ever struck his
eye the merest personal association which hangs pleasantly in his
memory Writing for all time he scruples not to mix with all that is
august and permanent in history and prophecy incidents the most
transient and names the most obscure to waste an immortality of
shame or praise on those about whom his own generation were to inquire
in vain Scripture history runs into profane Pagan legends teach
their lesson side by side with Scripture scenes and miracles heroes
and poets of heathenism separated from their old classic world have
their place in the world of faith discourse with Christians of
Christian dogmas and even mingle with the Saints Virgil guides the
poet through his fear and his penitence to the gates of Paradise

Footnote  See Convito  

This feeling of harsh and extravagant incongruity of causeless and
unpardonable darkness is perhaps the first impression of many readers
of the Commedia But probably as they read on there will mingle
with this a sense of strange and unusual grandeur arising not alone
from the hardihood of the attempt and the mystery of the subject but
from the power and the character of the poet It will strike them that
words cut deeper than is their wont that from that wild uncongenial
imagery thoughts emerge of singular truth and beauty Their
dissatisfaction will be chequered even disturbedfor we can often
bring ourselves to sacrifice much for the sake of a clear and
consistent viewby the appearance amid much that repels them of
proofs undeniable and accumulating of genius as mighty as it is
strange Their perplexity and disappointment may grow into distinct
condemnation or it may pass into admiration and delight but no one
has ever come to the end of the Commedia without feeling that if it
has given him a new view and specimen of the wildness and
unaccountable waywardness of the human mind it has also added as few
other books have to his knowledge of its feelings its capabilities
and its grasp and suggested larger and more serious thoughts for
which he may be grateful concerning that unseen world of which he is
even here a member

Dante would not have thanked his admirers for becoming apologists
Those in whom the sense of imperfection and strangeness overpowers
sympathy for grandeur and enthusiasm for nobleness and joy in
beauty he certainly would have left to themselves But neither would
he teach any that he was leading them along a smooth and easy road
The Commedia will always be a hard and trying book nor did the
writer much care that it should be otherwise Much of this is no doubt
to be set down to its age much of its roughness and extravagance as
well as of its beautyits allegorical spirit its frame and scenery
The idea of a visionary voyage through the worlds of pain and bliss is
no invention of the poetit was one of the commonest and most
familiar medieval vehicles of censure or warning and those who love
to trace the growth and often strange fortunes of popular ideas or
whose taste leads them to disbelieve in genius and track the
parentage of great inventions to the foolish and obscure may find
abundant materials in the literature of legends But his own
agethe age which received the Commedia with mingled enthusiasm and
wonder and called it the Divine was as much perplexed as we are
though probably rather pleased thereby than offended That within a
century after its composition in the more famous cities and
universities of Italy Florence Venice Bologna and Pisa chairs
should have been founded and illustrious men engaged to lecture on
it is a strange homage to its power even in that time of quick
feeling but as strange and great a proof of its obscurity What is
dark and forbidding in it was scarcely more clear to the poets
contemporaries And he whose last object was amusement invites no
audience but a patient and confiding one

     WRIGHTS Dante

The character of the Commedia belongs much more in its excellence
and its imperfections to the poet himself and the nature of his
work than to his age That cannot screen his faults nor can it
arrogate to itself it must be content to share his glory His
leading idea and line of thought was much more novel then than it is
now and belongs much more to the modern than the medieval world The
Story of a Life the poetry of mans journey through the wilderness
to his true country is now in various and very different shapes as
hackneyed a form of imagination as an allegory an epic a legend of
chivalry were in former times Not of course that any time has been
without its poetical feelings and ideas on the subject and never were
they deeper and more diversified more touching and solemn than in
the ages that passed from S Augustine and S Gregory to S Thomas and
S Bonaventura But a philosophical poem where they were not merely
the colouring but the subject an epos of the soul placed for its
trial in a fearful and wonderful world with relations to time and
matter history and nature good and evil the beautiful the
intelligible and the mysterious sin and grace the infinite and the
eternaland having in the company and under the influences of other
intelligences to make its choice to struggle to succeed or fail to
gain the light or be lostthis was a new and unattempted theme It
has been often tried since in faith or doubt in egotism in sorrow
in murmuring in affectation sometimes in joyin various forms in
prose and verse completed or fragmentary in reality or fiction in
the direct or the shadowed story in the Pilgrims Progress in
Rousseaus Confessions in Wilhelm Meister and Faust in the
Excursion It is common enough now for the poet in the faith of
human sympathy and in the sense of the unexhausted vastness of his
mysterious subject to believe that his fellows will not see without
interest and profit glimpses of his own path and fortuneshear from
his lips the disclosure of his chief delights his warnings his
fearsfollow the manycoloured changes the impressions and workings
of a character at once the contrast and the counterpart to their own
But it was a new path then and he needed to be and was a bold man
who first opened ita path never trod without peril usually with
loss or failure

And certainly no great man ever made less secret to himself of his own
genius He is at no pains to rein in or to dissemble his consciousness
of power which he has measured without partiality and feels sure
will not fail him Fidandomi di me pi che di un altrois a
reason which he assigns without reserve We look with the distrust and
hesitation of modern days yet in spite of ourselves not without
admiration and regret at such frank hardihood It was more common
once than now When the world was young it was more natural and
allowableit was often seemly and noble Men knew not their
difficulties as we know themwe to whom time which has taught so
much wisdom has brought so many disappointmentswe who have seen how
often the powerful have fallen short and the noble gone astray and
the most admirable missed their perfection It is becoming in us to
distrust ourselvesto be shy if we cannot be modest it is but a
respectful tribute to human weakness and our brethrens failures But
there was a time when great men dared to claim their greatnessnot in
foolish selfcomplacency but in unembarrassed and majestic
simplicity in magnanimity and truth in the consciousness of a
serious and noble purpose and of strength to fulfil it Without
passion without elation as without shrinking the poet surveys his
superiority and his high position as something external to him he
has no doubts about it and affects none He would be a coward if he
shut his eyes to what he could do as much a trifler in displaying
reserve as ostentation Nothing is more striking in the Commedia
than the serene and unhesitating confidence with which he announces
himself the heir and reviver of the poetic power so long lost to the
worldthe heir and reviver of it in all its fulness He doubts not
of the judgment of posterity One has arisen who shall throw into the
shade all modern reputations who shall bequeath to Christendom the
glory of that name of Poet che pi dura e pi onora hitherto the
exclusive boast of heathenism and claim the rare honours of the
laurel

This sustained magnanimity and lofty selfreliance which never
betrays itself is one of the main elements in the grandeur of the
Commedia It is an imposing spectacle to see such fearlessness such
freedom and such success in an untried path amid unprepared
materials and rude instruments models scanty and only half
understood powers of language still doubtful and suspected the
deepest and strongest thought still confined to unbending forms and
the harshest phrase exact and extensive knowledge as yet far out of
reach with no help from time which familiarises all things and of
which manner elaboration judgment and taste are the gifts and
inheritanceto see the poet trusting to his eye which saw
everything and his searching and creative spirit venture
undauntedly into all regions of thought and feeling to draw thence a
picture of the government of the universe

But such greatness had to endure its price and its counterpoise Dante

of taste except among the great dead He hears them exhort him to
let the world talk onto stand like a tower unshaken by the

great names even of fableGeryon and the giants the Minotaur and
Centaurs and the heroes of Thebes and Troy But not the great and

wonderful histories are latent in the inconspicuous paths of life in
the fugitive incidents of the hour among the persons whose faces we
have seen The Church had from the first been witness to the deep
interest of individual life The rising taste for novels showed that
society at large was beginning to be alive to it And it is this
feelingthat behind the veil there may be grades of greatness but
nothing insignificantthat led Dante to refuse to restrict himself to
the characters of fame He will associate with them the living men who
have stood round him they are part of the same company with the
greatest That they have interested him touched him moved his
indignation or pity struck him as examples of great vicissitude or
of a perfect life have pleased him loved himthis is enough why
they should live in his poem as they have lived to him He chooses at

he thought worthy of renown must be content with its loss He tells

     all peace to her I long with all my heart to rest my weary
     soul and finish the time which is given me I have passed
     through almost all the regions to which this language
     reaches a wanderer almost a beggar displaying against my
     will the stroke of fortune which is ofttimes unjustly wont
     to be imputed to the person stricken Truly I have been a
     ship without a sail or helm carried to divers harbours and
     gulfs and shores by that parching wind which sad poverty
     breathes and I have seemed vile in the eyes of many who
     perchance from some fame had imagined of me in another
     form in the sight of whom not only did my presence become
     nought but every work of mine less prized both what had
     been and what was to be wroughtConvito Tr i c 

Thus proved and thus furnishedthus independent and confident
daring to trust his instinct and genius in what was entirely untried
and unusual he entered on his great poem to shadow forth under the
figure of his own conversion and purification not merely how a single
soul rises to its perfection but how this visible world in all its
phases of nature life and society is one with the invisible which
borders on it actuates accomplishes and explains it It is this
vast planto take into his scope not the soul only in its struggles
and triumph but all that the soul finds itself engaged with in its
course the accidents of the hour and of ages past the real persons
great and small apart from and without whom it cannot think or act
the material world its theatre and homeit is this which gives so
many various sides to the Commedia which makes it so novel and
strange It is not a mere personal history or a pouring forth of
feeling like the Vita Nuova though he is himself the mysterious
voyager and he opens without reserve his actual life and his heart
he speaks indeed in the first person yet he is but a character of
the drama and in great part of it with not more of distinct
personality than in that paraphrase of the penitential Psalms in
which he has preluded so much of the Commedia Yet the Commedia is
not a pure allegory it admits and makes use of the allegorical but
the laws of allegory are too narrow for it the real in it is too
impatient of the veil and breaks through in all its hardness and
detail into what is most shadowy History is indeed viewed not in its
ephemeral look but under the light of Gods final judgments in its
completion not in its provisional and fragmentary character viewed
therefore but in faithbut its issues which in this confused scene
we ordinarily contemplate in the gross the poet brings down to detail
and individuals he faces and grasps the tremendous thought that the
very men and women whom we see and speak to are now the real
representatives of sin and goodness the true actors in that scene
which is so familiar to us as a pictureunflinching and terrible
heart he endures to face it in its most harrowing forms But he wrote
not for sport nor to give poetic pleasure he wrote to warn the seed
of the Commedia was sown in tears and reaped in misery and the
consolations which it offers are awful as they are real

Thus though he throws into symbol and image what can only be
expressed by symbol and image we can as little forget in reading him
this real world in which we live as we can in one of Shaksperes
plays It is not merely that the poem is crowded with real personages
most of them having the single interest to us of being real But all
that is associated with mans history and existence is interwoven with
the main course of thoughtall that gives character to life all that
gives it form and feature even to quaintness all that occupies the
mind or employs the handspeculation science arts manufactures
monuments scenes customs proverbs ceremonies games punishments
attitudes of men habits of living creatures The wildest and most
unearthly imaginations the most abstruse thoughts take up into and
incorporate with themselves the forcible and familiar impressions of
our mother earth and do not refuse the company and aid even of the
homeliest

This is not mere poetic ornament peculiarly profusely or
extravagantly employed It is one of the ways in which his dominant
feeling expresses itselfspontaneous and instinctive in each several
instance of it but the kindling and effluence of deliberate thought
and attending on a clear purposethe feeling of the real and intimate
connexion between the objects of sight and faith It is not that he
sees in one the simple counterpart and reverse of the other or sets
himself to trace out universally their mutual correspondences he has
too strong a sense of the reality of this familiar life to reduce it
merely to a shadow and type of the unseen What he struggles to
express in countless ways with all the resources of his strange and
gigantic power is that this world and the next are both equally real
and both oneparts however different of one whole The world to
come we know but in a glass darkly man can only think and imagine
of it in images which he knows to be but broken and faint
reflections but this world we know not in outline and featureless
idea but by name and face and shape by place and person by the
colours and forms which crowd over its surface the men who people its
habitations the events which mark its moments Detail fills the sense
here and is the mark of reality And thus he seeks to keep alive the
feeling of what that world is which he connects with heaven and hell
not by abstractions not much by elaborate and highlyfinished
pictures but by names persons local features definite images
Widely and keenly has he ranged over and searched into the worldwith
a largeness of mind which disdained not to mark and treasure up along
with much unheeded beauty many a characteristic feature of nature
unnoticed because so common All his pursuits and interests contribute
to the impression which often instinctively it may be he strives to
produce of the manifold variety of our life As a man of society his
memory is full of its usages formalities graces follies
fashionsof expressive motions postures gestures looksof music
of handicrafts of the conversation of friends or associatesof all
that passes so transient yet so keenly pleasant or distasteful
between man and man As a traveller he recalls continually the names
and scenes of the worldas a man of speculation the secrets of
naturethe phenomena of light the theory of the planets motions
the idea and laws of physiology As a man of learning he is filled
with the thoughts and recollections of ancient fable and history as a
politician with the thoughts prognostications and hopes of the
history of the day as a moral philosopher he has watched himself his
external sensations and changes his inward passions his mental
powers his ideas his conscience he has far and wide noted
character discriminated motives classed good and evil deeds All
that the man of society of travel of science of learning the
politician the moralist could gather is used at will in the great
poetic structure but all converges to the purpose and is directed by
the intense feeling of the theologian who sees this wonderful and
familiar scene melting into and ending in another yet more wonderful
but which will one day be as familiarwho sees the difficult but sure
progress of the manifold remedies of the Divine government to their
predestined issue and over all God and His saints

So comprehensive in interest is the Commedia Any attempt to explain
it by narrowing that interest to politics philosophy the moral
life or theology itself must prove inadequate Theology strikes the
keynote but history natural and metaphysical science poetry and
art each in their turn join in the harmony independent yet
ministering to the whole If from the poem itself we could be for a
single moment in doubt of the reality and dominant place of religion
in it the plainspoken prose of the Convito would show how he
placed the Divine Science full of all peace and allowing no strife
of opinions and sophisms for the excellent certainty of its subject
which is God in single perfection above all other sciences which
are as Solomon speaks but queens or concubines or maidens but she
is the Dove and the perfect oneDove because without stain of
strifeperfect because perfectly she makes us behold the truth in
which our soul stills itself and is at rest But the same passage
shows likewise how he viewed all human knowledge and human interests
as holding their due place in the hierarchy of wisdom and among the
steps of mans perfection No account of the Commedia will prove
sufficient which does not keep in view first of all the high moral
purpose and deep spirit of faith with which it was written and then
the wide liberty of materials and means which the poet allowed himself
in working out his design

Footnote  Convito Tr  c  

Doubtless his writings have a political aspect The great Ghibelline
poet is one of Dantes received synonymes of his strong political
opinions and the importance he attached to them there can be no
doubt And he meant his poem to be the vehicle of them and the record
to all ages of the folly and selfishness with which he saw men
governed That he should take the deepest interest in the goings on of
his time is part of his greatness to suppose that he stopped at
them or that he subordinated to political objects or feelings all the
other elements of his poem is to shrink up that greatness into very
narrow limits Yet this has been done by men of mark and ability by
Italians by men who read the Commedia in their own mothertongue
It has been maintained as a satisfactory account of itmaintained
with great labour and pertinacious ingenuitythat Dante meant nothing
more by his poem than the conflicts and ideal triumph of a political
party The hundred cantos of that vision of the universe are but a
manifesto of the Ghibelline propaganda designed under the veil of
historic images and scenes to insinuate what it was dangerous to
announce and Beatrice in all her glory and sweetness is but a
specimen of the jargon cant and slang of Ghibelline freemasonry
When Italians write thus they degrade the greatest name of their
country to a depth of laborious imbecility to which the trifling of
schoolmen and academicians is as nothing It is to solve the enigma of
Dantes works by imagining for him a character in which it is hard to
say which predominates the pedant mountebank or infidel After that
we may read Voltaires sneers with patience and even enter with
gravity on the examination of Father Hardouins Historic Doubts The
fanaticism of an outraged liberalism produced by centuries of
injustice and despotism is but a poor excuse for such perverse
blindness

Footnote  In the Remains of Arthur Henry Hallam is a paper in
which he examines and disposes of this theory with a courteous and
forbearing irony which would have deepened probably into something
more on thinking over it a second time

Dante was not a Ghibelline though he longed for the interposition of
an Imperial power Historically he did not belong to the Ghibelline
party It is true that he forsook the Guelfs with whom he had been
brought up and that the White Guelfs with whom he was expelled from
Florence were at length merged and lost in the Ghibelline party
and he acted with them for a time But no words can be stronger
than those in which he disjoins himself from that evil and foolish
company and claims his independence

And it is not easy to conceive a Ghibelline partisan putting into the
mouth of Justinian the type of law and empire a general condemnation
of his party as heavy as that of their antagoniststhe crime of
having betrayed as the Guelfs had resisted the great symbol of
public right

       Omai puoi giudicar di que cotali
     Chio accusai di sopra e de lor falli
     Che son cagion di tutti i vostri mali
       Luno al pubblico segno i gigli gialli

Footnote  Ibid 

And though as the victim of the Guelfs of Florence he found refuge
among Ghibelline princes he had friends among Guelfs also His steps
and his tongue were free to the end And in character and feeling in
his austerity his sturdiness and roughness his intolerance of
corruption and pride his stronglymarked devotional temper he was
much less a Ghibelline than like one of those stern Guelfs who hailed
Savonarola

But he had a very decided and complete political theory which
certainly was not Guelf and as parties then were it was not much
more Ghibelline Most assuredly no set of men would have more
vigorously resisted the attempt to realise his theory would have
joined more heartily with all immediate opponentsGuelfs Black
White and Green or even Boniface VIIIto keep out such an emperor
as Dante imagined than the Ghibelline nobles and potentates

Dantes political views were a dream though a dream based on what had
been and an anticipation of what was in part at least to come It
was a dream in the middle ages in divided and republican Italy the
Italy of citiesof a real and national government based on justice
and law It was the dream of a real state He imagined that the
Roman empire had been one great state he persuaded himself that
Christendom might be such He was wrong in both instances but in this
case as in so many others he had already caught the spirit and ideas
of a fardistant future and the political organisation of modern
times so familiar to us that we cease to think of its exceeding
wonder is the practical confirmation though in a form very different
from what he imagined of the depth and farsightedness of those
expectations which are in outward form so chimericali miei non
falsi errori

He had studied the infinite disorders of the world in one of their
most unrestrained scenes the streets of an Italian republic Law was
powerless good men were powerless good intentions came to naught
neither social habits nor public power could resist when selfishness
chose to have its way The Church was indeed still the salt of the
nations but it had once dared and achieved more it had once been the
only power which ruled them And this it could do no longer If
strength and energy had been enough to make the Churchs influence
felt on government there was a Pope who could have done ita man who
was undoubtedly the most wondered at and admired of his age whom
friend or foe never characterised without adding the invariable
epithet of his greatness of soulthe magnanimus peccator
whose Roman grandeur in meeting his unworthy fate fascinated into
momentary sympathy even Dante But among the things which
Boniface VIII could not do even if he cared about it was the
maintaining peace and law in Italian towns And while this great
political power was failing its correlative and antagonist was
paralysed also Since the death of Frederic II says Dantes
contemporary the fame and recollections of the empire were wellnigh
extinguished Italy was left without governmentcome nave senza
nocchiero in gran tempestato the mercies of her tyrants

In this scene of violence and disorder with the Papacy gone astray
the empire debased and impotent the religious orders corrupted power
meaning lawlessness the welldisposed become weak and cowardly
religion neither guide nor check to society but only the consolation
of its victimsDante was bold and hopeful enough to believe in the
Divine appointment and in the possibility of law and governmentof
a state In his philosophy the institutions which provide for mans
peace and liberty in this life are part of Gods great order for
raising men to perfectionnot indispensable yet ordinary parts
having their important place though but for the present time and
though imperfect real instruments of His moral government He could
not believe it to be the intention of Providence that on the
introduction of higher hopes and the foundation of a higher society
civil society should collapse and be left to ruin as henceforth
useless or prejudicial in mans trial and training that the
significant intimations of nature that law and its results justice
peace and stability ought to be and might be realised among men had
lost their meaning and faded away before the announcement of a kingdom
not of this world And if the perfection of civil society had not been
superseded by the Church it had become clear if events were to be
read as signs that she was not intended to supply its political
offices and functions She had taught elevated solaced blessed not
only individual souls but society she had for a time even governed
it but though her other powers remained she could govern it no
longer Failure had made it certain that in his strong and quaint
language Virtus authorizandi regnum nostr mortalitatis est contra
naturam ecclesi ergo non est de numero virtutum suarum
Another and distinct organisation was required for this unless the
temporal order was no longer worthy the attention of Christians

Footnote  De Monarch lib iii p  Ed Fraticelli

This is the idea of the De Monarchia and though it holds but a
place in the great scheme of the Commedia it is prominent there
alsoan idea seen but in a fantastic shape encumbered and confused
with most grotesque imagery but the real idea of polity and law
which the experience of modern Europe has attained to

He found in clear outline in the Greek philosophy the theory of
merely human society and raising its end and purpose finem totius
human civilitatis to a height and dignity which Heathens could not
forecast he adopted it in its more abstract and ideal form He
imagined a single authority unselfish inflexible irresistible
which could make all smaller tyrannies to cease and enable every man
to live in peace and liberty so that he lived in justice It is
simply what each separate state of Christendom has by this time more
or less perfectly achieved The theoriser of the middle ages could
conceive of its accomplishment only in one form as grand as it was
impossiblea universal monarchy

But he did not start from an abstraction He believed that history
attested the existence of such a monarchy The prestige of the Roman
empire was then strong Europe still lingers on the idea and cannot
even yet bring itself to give up its part in that great monument of
human power But in the middle ages the Empire was still believed to
exist It was the last greatness which had been seen in the world and
the world would not believe that it was over Above all in Italy a
continuity of lineage of language of local names and in part of
civilisation and law forbad the thought that the great Roman people
had ceased to be Florentines and Venetians boasted that they were
Romans the legends which the Florentine ladies told to their maidens
at the loom were tales of their mother city Rome The Roman element
little understood but profoundly reverenced and dearly cherished was
dominant the conductor of civilisation and enfolding the inheritance
of all the wisdom experience feeling art of the past it elevated
even while it overawed oppressed and enslaved A deep belief in
Providence added to the intrinsic grandeur of the empire a sacred
character The flight of the eagle has been often told and often sung
but neither in Livy or Virgil Gibbon or Bossuet with intenser
sympathy or more kindred power than in those rushing and unflagging
verses in which the middleage poet hears the imperial legislator
relate the fated course of the sacred sign from the day when Pallas
died for it till it accomplished the vengeance of heaven in Juda
and afterwards under Charlemagne smote down the enemies of the
Church

Footnote  Parad c 

The following passage from the De Monarchia will show the poets
view of the Roman empire and its office in the world

     To the reasons above alleged a memorable experience brings
     confirmation I mean that state of mankind which the Son of
     God when He would for mans salvation take man upon Him
     either waited for or ordered when so He willed For if from
     the fall of our first parents which was the startingpoint
     of all our wanderings we retrace the various dispositions
     of men and their times we shall not find at any time
     except under the divine monarch Augustus when a perfect
     monarchy existed that the world was everywhere quiet And
     that then mankind was happy in the tranquillity of universal
     peace this all writers of history this famous poets this
     even the Scribe of the meekness of Christ has deigned to
     attest And lastly Paul has called that most blessed
     condition the fulness of time Truly time and the things
     of time were full for no mystery of our felicity then
     lacked its minister But how the world has gone on from the
     time when that seamless robe was first torn by the claws of
     covetousness we may read and would that we might not also
     see O race of men by how great storms and losses by how
     great shipwrecks hast thou of necessity been vexed since
     transformed into a beast of many heads thou hast been
     struggling different ways sick in understanding equally
     sick in heart The higher intellect with its invincible
     reasons thou reckest not of nor of the inferior with its
     eye of experience nor of affection with the sweetness of
     divine suasion when the trumpet of the Holy Ghost sounds to
     theeBehold how good is it and how pleasant brethren
     to dwell together in unityDe Monarch lib i p 

Yet this great Roman empire existed still unimpaired in namenot
unimposing even in what really remained of it Dante to supply a
want turned it into a theorya theory easy to smile at now but
which contained and was a beginning of unknown or unheeded truth What
he yearns after is the predominance of the principle of justice in
civil society That if it is still imperfect is no longer a dream in
our day but experience had never realised it to him and he takes
refuge in tentative and groping theory The divinations of the
greatest men have been vague and strange and none have been stranger
than those of the author of the De Monarchia The second book in
which he establishes the title of the Roman people to Universal
Empire is as startling a piece of medival argument as it would be
easy to find

     As when we cannot attain to look upon a cause we commonly
     wonder at a new effect so when we know the cause we look
     down with a certain derision on those who remain in wonder
     And I indeed wondered once how the Roman people had without
     any resistance been set over the world and looking at it
     superficially I thought that they had obtained this by no
     right but by mere force of arms But when I fixed deeply
     the eyes of my mind on it and by most effectual signs knew
     that Divine Providence had wrought this wonder departed
     and a certain scornful contempt came in its stead when I
     perceived the nations raging against the preeminence of the
     Roman peoplewhen I see the people imagining a vain thing
     as I once used to do when moreover I grieve over kings
     and princes agreeing in this only to be against their Lord
     and his anointed Roman Emperor Wherefore in derision not
     without a certain grief I can cry out for that glorious
     people and for Csar with him who cried in behalf of the
     Prince of Heaven Why did the nations rage and the people
     imagine vain things the kings of the earth stood up and
     the rulers were joined in one against the Lord and his
     anointed But because natural love suffers not derision to
     be of long duration but like the summer sun which
     scattering the morning mists irradiates the east with
     light so prefers to pour forth the light of correction
     therefore to break the bonds of the ignorance of such kings
     and rulers to show that the human race is free from their
     yoke I will exhort myself in company with the most holy
     Prophet taking up his following words Let us break their
     bonds and cast away from us their yokeDe Monarch

And to prove this preeminence of right in the Roman people and their
heirs the Emperors of Christendom he appeals not merely to the
course of Providence to their high and noble ancestry to the
blessings of their just and considerate laws to their unselfish
guardianship of the worldRomanum imperium de fonte nascitur

derived from the principles of the Christian faithbut to

perfections aided by the help of miracles therefore it was willed by
God and by consequence both was and is of right And these
miracles proved by the testimony of illustrious authorities are
the prodigies of Livythe ancile of Numa the geese of the Capitol

The intellectual phenomenon is a strange one It would be less strange
if Dante were arguing in the schools or pleading for a party But
even Henry of Luxemburg cared little for such a throne as the poet
wanted him to fill much less Can Grande and the Visconti The idea
the theory and the argument are of the writers own solitary
meditation We may wonder But there are few things more strange than
the history of argument How often has a cause or an idea turned out
in the eyes of posterity so much better than its arguments How
often have we seen argument getting as it were into a groove and
unable to extricate itself so as to do itself justice The everyday
cases of private experience of men defending right conclusions on
wrong or conventional grounds or in a confused form entangled with
conclusions of a like yet different natureof arguments theories
solutions which once satisfied satisfying us no longer on a question
about which we hold the same beliefof one party unable to comprehend
the arguments of anotherof one section of the same side smiling at
the defence of their common cause by anotherare all reproduced on a
grander scale in the history of society There too one age cannot
comprehend another there too it takes time to disengage subordinate
eliminate Truth of this sort is not the elaboration of one keen or
strong mind but of the secret experience of many nihil sine tate
est omnia tempus expectant But a counterpart to the De Monarchia
is not wanting in our own day theory has not ceased to be mighty In
warmth and earnestness in sense of historic grandeur in its support
of a great cause and a great idea not less than in the thought of its
motto Greek heis koiranos est De Maistres volume Du Pape
recalls the antagonist De Monarchia but it recalls it not less in
its bold dealing with facts and its bold assumption of principles
though the knowledge and debates of five more busy centuries and the
experience of modern courts and revolutions might have guarded the
Piedmontese nobleman from the mistakes of the old Florentine

But the idea of the De Monarchia is no key to the Commedia The
direct and primary purpose of the Commedia is surely its obvious
one It is to stamp a deep impression on the mind of the issues of
good and ill doing hereof the real worlds of pain and joy To do
this forcibly it is done in detailof course it can only be done in
figure Punishment purification or the fulness of consolation are
as he would think at this very moment the lot of all the numberless
spirits who have ever lived herespirits still living and sentient as
himself parallel with our life they too are suffering or are at
rest Without pause or interval in all its parts simultaneously this
awful scene is going onthe judgments of God are being
fulfilledcould we but see it It exists it might be seen at each
instant of time by a soul whose eyes were opened which was carried
through it And this he imagines It had been imagined before it is
the working out which is peculiar to him It is not a barren vision
His subject is besides the eternal world the soul which contemplates
it by sight according to his figuresin reality by faith As he is
led on from woe to deeper woe then through the tempered
chastisements and resignation of Purgatory to the beatific vision he
is tracing the course of the soul on earth realising sin and weaning
itself from itof its purification and preparation for its high lot
by converse with the good and wise by the remedies of grace by
efforts of will and love perhaps by the dominant guidance of some
single pure and holy influence whether of person or institution or
thought Nor will we say but that beyond this earthly probation he is
not also striving to grasp and imagine to himself something of that
awful process and training by which whether in or out of the flesh
the spirit is made fit to meet its Maker its Judge and its Chief
Good

Thus it seems that even in its main design the poem has more than one
aspect it is a picture a figure partially a history perhaps an
anticipation And this is confirmed by what the poet has himself
distinctly stated of his ideas of poetic composition His view is
expressed generally in his philosophical treatise the Convito but
it is applied directly to the Commedia in a letter which if in
its present form of doubtful authenticity without any question
represents his sentiments and the substance of which is incorporated
in one of the earliest writings on the poem Boccaccios commentary
The following is his account of the subject of the poem

     For the evidence of what is to be said it is to be noted
     that this work is not of one single meaning only but may be
     said to have many meanings polysensuum For the first
     meaning is that of the letteranother is that of things
     signified by the letter the first of these is called the
     literal sense the second the allegorical or moral This
     mode of treating a subject may for clearness sake be
     considered in those verses of the Psalm In exitu
     Israel When Israel came out of Egypt and the house of
     Jacob from the strange people Judah was his sanctuary and
     Israel his dominion For if we look at the letter only
     there is here signified the going out of the children of
     Israel in the time of Mosesif at the allegory there is
     signified our redemption through Christif at the moral
     sense there is signified to us the conversion of the soul
     from the mourning and misery of sin to the state of
     graceif at the anagogic sense there is signified
     the passing out of the holy soul from the bondage of this
     corruption to the liberty of everlasting glory And these
     mystical meanings though called by different names may all
     be called allegorical as distinguished from the literal or
     historical sense This being considered it is plain that
     there ought to be a twofold subject concerning which the
     two corresponding meanings may proceed Therefore we must
     consider first concerning the subject of this work as it is
     to be understood literally then as it is to be considered
     allegorically The subject then of the whole work taken
     literally only is the state of souls after death considered
     in itself For about this and on this the whole work
     turns But if the work be taken allegorically its subject
     is man as by his freedom of choice deserving well or ill
     he is subject to the justice which rewards and punishes

Footnote  Ep ad Kan Grand   

The passage in the Convito is to the same effect but his remarks on
the moral and anagogic meaning may be quoted

     The third sense is called moral that it is which readers
     ought to go on noting carefully in writings for their own
     profit and that of their disciples as in the Gospel it may
     be noted when Christ went up to the mountain to be
     transfigured that of the twelve Apostles he took with him
     only three in which morally we may understand that in the
     most secret things we ought to have but few companions The
     fourth sort of meaning is called anagogic that is above
     our sense and this is when we spiritually interpret a

     things signified expresses the heavenly things of
     everlasting glory as may be seen in that song of the
     Prophet which says that in the coming out of the people of
     Israel from Egypt Judah was made holy and free which
     although it is manifestly true according to the letter is
     not less true as spiritually understood that is that when
     the soul comes out of sin it is made holy and free in its

With this passage before us there can be no doubt of the meaning
however veiled of those beautiful lines already referred to in
which Virgil after having conducted the poet up the steeps of
Purgatory where his sins have been one by one cancelled by the
ministering angels finally takes leave of him and bids him wait for
Beatrice on the skirts of the earthly Paradise

The general meaning of the Commedia is clear enough But it
certainly does appear to refuse to be fitted into a connected formal
scheme of interpretation It is not a homogeneous consistent
allegory like the Pilgrims Progress and the Fairy Queen The
allegory continually breaks off shifts its ground gives place to
other elements or mingles with themlike a stream which suddenly
sinks into the earth and after passing under plains and mountains
reappears in a distant point and in different scenery We can
indeed imagine its strange author commenting on it and finding or
marking out its prosaic substratum with the coldblooded precision
and scholastic distinctions of the Convito However he has not done
so And of the many enigmas which present themselves either in its
structure or separate parts the key seems hopelessly lost The early
commentators are very ingenious but very unsatisfactory they see
where we can see but beyond that they are as full of uncertainty as
ourselves It is in character with that solitary and haughty spirit
while touching universal sympathies appalling and charming all
hearts to have delighted in his own dark sayings which had meaning
only to himself It is true that whether in irony or from that
quaint studious care for the appearance of literal truth which makes
him apologise for the wonders which he relates and confirm them by an
oath on the words of his poem he provokes and challenges us
bids us admire doctrine hidden under strange verses bids us
strain our eyes for the veil is thin

Yet the most certain and detailed commentary one which assigned the
exact reason for every image or allegory and its place and connexion
in a general scheme would add but little to the charm or to the use
of the poem It is not so obscure but that every mans experience who
has thought over and felt the mystery of our present life may supply
the commentarythe more ample the wider and more various has been
his experience the deeper and keener his feeling Details and links
of connexion may be matter of controversy Whether the three beasts of
the forest mean definitely the vices of the time or of Florence
specially or of the poet himselfthe wickedness of his heels
compassing him round aboutmay still exercise critics and
antiquaries but that they carry with them distinct and special
impressions of evil and that they are the hindrances of mans
salvation is not doubtful And our knowledge of the key of the
allegory where we possess it contributes but little to the effect
We may infer from the Convito that the eyes of Beatrice stand
definitely for the demonstrations and her smiles for the
persuasions of wisdom but the poetry of the Paradiso is not about
demonstrations and persuasions but about looks and smiles and the
ineffable and holy calmserenitatis et ternitatis afflatuswhich
pervades it comes from the sacred truths and holy persons and that
deep spirit of highraised yet composed devotion which it requires no
interpreter to show us

Figure and symbol then are doubtless the law of composition in the
Commedia but this law discloses itself very variously and with
different degrees of strictness In its primary and most general form
it is palpable consistent pervading There can be no doubt that the
poem is meant to be understood figurativelyno doubt of what in
general it is meant to shadow forthno doubt as to the general
meaning of its parts their connexion with each other But in its
secondary and subordinate applications the law worksto our eye at
leastirregularly unequally and fitfully There can be no question
that Virgil the poets guide represents the purely human element in
the training of the soul and of society as Beatrice does the divine
But neither represent the whole he does not sum up all appliances of
wisdom in Virgil nor all teachings and influences of grace in
Beatrice these have their separate figures And both represent
successively several distinct forms of their general antitypes They
have various degrees of abstractness and narrow down according to
that order of things to which they refer and correspond into the
special and the personal In the general economy of the poem Virgil
stands for human wisdom in its widest sense but he also stands for it
in its various shapes in the different parts He is the type of human
philosophy and science He is again more definitely that spirit
of imagination and poetry which opens mens eyes to the glory of the
visible and the truth of the invisible and to Italians he is a
definite embodiment of it their own great poet vates poeta
noster In the Christian order he is human wisdom dimly
mindful of its heavenly originpresaging dimly its return to
Godsheltering in heathen times that vague and unconnected family
of religious truths originally from God but sojourning without the
sanction of miracle or visible home as pilgrims up and down the
world In the political order he is the guide of lawgivers
wisdom fashioning the impulses and instincts of men into the harmony
of society contriving stability and peace guarding justice fit part
for the poet to fill who had sung the origin of Rome and the justice
and peace of Augustus In the order of individual life and the
progress of the individual soul he is the human conscience witnessing
to duty its discipline and its hopes and with yet more certain and
fearful presage to its vindication the human conscience seeing and
acknowledging the law but unable to confer power to fulfil
itwakened by grace from among the dead leading the living man up to
it and waiting for its light and strength But he is more than a
figure To the poet himself who blends with his high argument his
whole life Virgil had been the utmost that mind can be to
mindteacher quickener and revealer of power source of thought
exemplar and model never disappointing never attained to observed

And towards this great master the poets whole soul is poured forth
in reverence and affection To Dante he is no figure but a
personwith feelings and weaknessesovercome by the vexation
kindling into the wrath carried away by the tenderness of the
moment He reads his scholars heart takes him by the hand in danger
carries him in his arms and in his bosom like a son more than a
companion rebukes his unworthy curiosity kisses him when he shows a
noble spirit asks pardon for his own mistakes Never were the kind
yet severe ways of a master or the disciples diffidence and
openheartedness drawn with greater force or less effort and he
seems to have been reflecting on his own affection to Virgil when he
makes Statius forget that they were both but shades

And so with the poets second guide The great idea which Beatrice
figures though always present is seldom rendered artificially
prominent and is often entirely hidden beneath the rush of real
recollections and the creations of dramatic power Abstractions
venture and trust themselves among realities and for the time are
forgotten A name a real person a historic passage a lament or
denunciation a tragedy of actual life a legend of classic times the
fortunes of friendsthe story of Francesca or Ugolino the fate of
Buoncontes corpse the apology of Pier delle Vigne the epitaph of
Madonna Pia Ulysses western voyage the march of Roman
historyappear and absorb for themselves all interest or else it is
a philosophical speculation or a theory of morality or a case of
consciencenot indeed alien from the main subject yet independent of
the allegory and not translateable into any new meaningstanding on
their own ground worked out each according to its own law but they
do not disturb the main course of the poets thought who grasps and
paints each detail of human life in its own peculiarity while he sees
in each a significance and interest beyond itself He does not stop in
each case to tell us so but he makes it felt The tale ends the
individual disappears and the great allegory resumes its course It
is like one of those great musical compositions which alone seem
capable of adequately expressing in a limited time a course of
unfolding and change in an idea a career a life a societywhere
one great thought predominates recurs gives colour and meaning and
forms the unity of the whole yet passes through many shades and
transitions is at one time definite at another suggestive and
mysterious incorporating and giving free place and play to airs and
melodies even of an alien cast striking off abruptly from its
expected road but without ever losing itself without breaking its
true continuity or failing of its completeness

This then seems to us the end and purpose of the Commediato
produce on the mind a sense of the judgments of God analogous to that
produced by Scripture itself They are presented to us in the Bible in
shapes which address themselves primarily to the heart and conscience
and seek not carefully to explain themselves They are likened to the
great deep to the strong mountainsvast and awful but abrupt
and incomplete as the huge broken rugged piles and chains of
mountains And we see them through cloud and mist in shapes only
approximating to the true ones Still they impress us deeply and
truly often the more deeply because unconsciously A character an
event a word isolated and unexplained stamps its meaning
ineffaceably though ever a matter of question and wonder it may be
dark to the intellect yet the conscience understands it often but
too well In such suggestive ways is the Divine government for the
most part put before us in the Bibleways which do not satisfy the
understanding but which fill us with a sense of reality And it seems
to have been by meditating on them which he certainly did much and
thoughtfullyand on the infinite variety of similar ways in which
the strongest impressions are conveyed to us in ordinary life by
means short of clear and distinct explanationby looks by images by
sounds by motions by remote allusion and broken words that Dante
was led to choose so new and remarkable a mode of conveying to his
countrymen his thoughts and feelings and presentiments about the
mystery of Gods counsel The Bible teaches us by means of real
history traced so far as is necessary along its real course The poet
expresses his view of the world also in real history but carried on
into figure

The poetry with which the Christian Church had been instinct from the
beginning converges and is gathered up in the Commedia The faith
had early shown its poetical aspect It is superfluous to dwell on
this for it is the charge against ancient teaching that it was too
large and imaginative It soon began to try rude essays in sculpture
and mosaic expressed its feeling of nature in verse and prose rudely
also but often with originality and force and opened a new vein of
poetry in the thoughts hopes and aspirations of regenerate man
Modern poetry must go back for many of its deepest and most powerful
sources to the writings of the Fathers and their followers of the
School The Church further had a poetry of its own besides the poetry
of literature it had the poetry of devotionthe Psalter chanted
daily in a new language and a new meaning and that wonderful body of
hymns to which age after age had contributed its offering from the
Ambrosian hymns to the Veni Sancte Spiritus of a king of France
the Pange lingua of Thomas Aquinas the Dies ir and Stabat
Mater of the two Franciscan brethren Thomas of Celano and
Jacopone The elements and fragments of poetry were everywhere in
the Churchin her ideas of life in her rules and institutions for
passing through it in her preparation for death in her offices
ceremonial celebrations usages her consecration of domestic
literary commercial civic military political life the meanings
and ends she had given them the religious seriousness with which the
forms of each were dignifiedin her doctrine and her dogmatic
systemher dependence on the unseen worldher Bible From each and
all of these and from that public feeling which if it expressed
itself but abruptly and incoherently was quite alive to the poetry
which surrounded it the poet received due impressions of greatness
and beauty of joy and dread Then the poetry of Christian religion
and Christian temper hitherto dispersed or manifested in act only
found its full and distinct utterance not unworthy to rank in
grandeur in music in sustained strength with the last noble voices
from expiring Heathenism

Footnote  Trench Sacred Latin Poetry 

But a long interval had passed since then The Commedia first
disclosed to Christian and modern Europe that it was to have a
literature of its own great and admirable though in its own language
and embodying its own ideas It was as if at some of the ancient
games a stranger had appeared upon the plain and thrown his quoit
among the marks of former casts which tradition had ascribed to the
demigods We are so accustomed to the excellent and varied
literature of modern times so original so perfect in form and rich
in thought so expressive of all our sentiments meeting so completely
our wants fulfilling our ideas that we can scarcely imagine the time
when this condition was newwhen society was beholden to a foreign
language for the exponents of its highest thoughts and feelings But
so it was when Dante wrote The great poets historians philosophers
of his day the last great works of intellect belonged to old Rome
and the Latin language So wonderful and prolonged was the fascination
of Rome Men still lived under its influence believed that the Latin
language was the perfect and permanent instrument of thought in its
highest forms the only expression of refinement and civilisation and
had not conceived the hope that their own dialects could ever rise to
such heights of dignity and power Latin which had enchased and
preserved such precious remains of ancient wisdom was now shackling
the living mind in its efforts Men imagined that they were still
using it naturally on all high themes and solemn business but though
they used it with facility it was no longer natural it had lost the
elasticity of life and had become in their hands a stiffened and
distorted though still powerful instrument The very use of the word
latino in the writers of this period to express what is clear and
philosophical in language while it shows their deep reverence for
it shows how Latin civilisation was no longer their own how it had
insensibly become an external and foreign element But they found it
very hard to resign their claim to a share in its glories with
nothing of their own to match against it they still delighted to
speak of it as our language or its writers as our poets our
historians

The spell was indeed beginning to break Guido Cavalcanti Dantes
strange stern speculative friend who is one of the fathers of the
Italian language is characterised in the Commedia by his
scornful dislike of Latin even in the mouth of Virgil Yet Dante
himself the great assertor by argument and example of the powers of
the Vulgar tongue once dared not to think that the Vulgar tongue
could be other to the Latin than as a subject to his sovereign He
was bolder when he wrote De Vulgari Eloquio but in the earlier
Convito while pleading earnestly for the beauty of the Italian he
yields with reverence the first place to the Latinfor nobleness
because the Latin is permanent and the Vulgar subject to fluctuation
and corruption for power because the Latin can express conceptions
to which the Vulgar is unequal for beauty because the structure of
the Latin is a masterly arrangement of scientific art and the beauty
of the Vulgar depends on mere use The very title of his poem the
Commedia contains in it a homage to the lofty claims of the Latin
It is called a Comedy and not Tragedy he says after a marvellous
account of the essence and etymology of the two first because it
begins sadly and ends joyfully and next because of its language
that humble speech of ordinary life in which even women
converse

held lightly their mother tongue Many he says after enumerating

such a pretension Not that it was a time dead to literature or
literary ambition Poets and historians had written and were writing

Dantes mind and became the epoch of his visionthe same scene of
Roman greatness in its decay which afterwards suggested to Gibbon the

criticised and even descended from the high and refined circles to
the workshop A story is told of Dantes indignation when he heard
the canzoni which had charmed the Florentine ladies mangled by the
rude enthusiasm of a blacksmith at his forge Literature was a
growing fashion but it was humble in its aspirations and efforts Men
wrote like children surprised and pleased with their success yet
allowing themselves in mere amusement because conscious of weakness

been able to gather and recover them and for the future to follow at

Dante by the Divina Commedia was the restorer of seriousness in
literature He was so by the magnitude and pretensions of his work
and by the earnestness of its spirit He first broke through the
prescription which had confined great works to the Latin and the
faithless prejudices which in the language of society could see
powers fitted for no higher task than that of expressing in curiously
diversified forms its most ordinary feelings But he did much more
Literature was going astray in its tone while growing in importance
the Commedia checked it The Provenal and Italian poetry was with
the exception of some pieces of political satire almost exclusively
amatory in the most fantastic and affected fashion In expression it
had not even the merit of being natural in purpose it was trifling
in the spirit which it encouraged it was something worse Doubtless
it brought a degree of refinement with it but it was refinement
purchased at a high price by intellectual distortion and moral
insensibility But this was not all The brilliant age of Frederick
II for such it was was deeply mined by religious unbelief However
strange this charge first sounds against the thirteenth century no
one can look at all closely into its history at least in Italy
without seeing that the idea of infidelitynot heresy but
infidelitywas quite a familiar one and that side by side with the
theology of Aquinas and Bonaventura there was working among those who
influenced fashion and opinion among the great men and the men to
whom learning was a profession a spirit of scepticism and irreligion
almost monstrous for its time which found its countenance in
Fredericks refined and enlightened court The genius of the great
doctors might have kept in safety the Latin Schools but not the free
and home thoughts which found utterance in the language of the people
if the solemn beauty of the Italian Commedia had not seized on all
minds It would have been an evil thing for Italian perhaps for
European literature if the siren tales of the Decameron had been
the first to occupy the ear with the charms of a new language

Dante has had hard measure and from some who are most beholden to
him No one in his day served the Church more highly than he whose
faith and genius secured on her side the first great burst of
imagination and feeling the first perfect accents of modern speech
The firstfruits of the new literature were consecrated and offered
up There was no necessity or even probability in Italy in the
fourteenth century that it should be so as there might perhaps have
been earlier It was the poets free actfree in one for whom nature
and heathen learning had strong temptationsthat religion was the
lesson and influence of the great popular work of the time That
which he held up before mens awakened and captivated minds was the
verity of Gods moral government To rouse them to a sense of the
mystery of their state to startle their commonplace notions of sin
into an imagination of its variety its magnitude and its infinite
shapes and degrees to open their eyes to the beauty of the Christian
temper both as suffering and as consummated to teach them at once
the faithfulness and awful freeness of Gods grace to help the dull
and lagging soul to conceive the possibility in its own case of
rising step by step in joy without an endof a felicity not
unimaginable by man though of another order from the highest
perfection of earththis is the poets end Nor was it only vague
religious feelings which he wished to excite He brought within the
circle of common thought and translated into the language of the
multitude what the Schools had done to throw light on the deep
questions of human existence which all are fain to muse upon though
none can solve He who had opened so much of mens hearts to
themselves opened to them also that secret sympathy which exists
between them and the great mysteries of the Christian doctrine
He did the work in his day of a great preacher Yet he has been
both claimed and condemned as a disturber of the Churchs faith

He certainly did not spare the Churchs rulers He thought they were
betraying the most sacred of all trusts and if history is at all to
be relied on he had some grounds for thinking so But it is confusing
the feelings of the middle ages with our own to convert every fierce
attack on the Popes into an anticipation of Luther Strong language of
this sort was far too commonplace to be so significant No age is
blind to practical abuses or silent on them and when the middle ages
complained they did so with a fullvoiced and clamorous rhetoric
which greedily seized on every topic of vilification within its reach
It was far less singular and far less bold to criticise
ecclesiastical authorities than is often supposed but it by no means
implied unsettled faith or a revolutionary design In Dantes case
if words have any meaningnot words of deliberate qualification but
his unpremeditated and incidental expressionshis faith in the Divine
mission and spiritual powers of the Popes was as strong as his
abhorrence of their degeneracy and desire to see it corrected by a
power which they would respectthat of the temporal sword It would
be to mistake altogether his character to imagine of him either as a
fault or as an excellence that he was a doubter It might as well be
supposed of Aquinas

No one ever acknowledged with greater seriousness as a fact in his
position in the world the agreement in faith among those with whom he
was born No one ever inclined with more simplicity and reverence
before that long communion and consent in feeling and purpose the
publicus sensus of the Christian Church He did feel difficulties
but the excitement of lingering on them was not among his enjoyments
That was the lot of the heathen Virgil made wise by death counsels
him not to desire it

The Christian poet felt that it was greater to believe and to act In
the darkness of the world one bright light appeared and he followed
it Providence had assigned him his portion of truth his portion of
daily bread if to us it appears blended with human elements it is
perfectly clear that he was in no position to sift them To choose was
no trial of his To examine and seek where it was impossible to find
would have been folly The authority from which he started had not yet
been seriously questioned there were no palpable signs of
doubtfulness on the system which was to him the representative of
Gods will and he sought for none It came to him claiming his
allegiance by custom by universality by its completeness as a whole
and satisfying his intellect and his sympathies in detail And he gave
his allegiancereasonably because there was nothing to hope for in
doubtingwisely because he gave it loyally and from his heart

And he had his rewardthe reward of him who throws himself with
frankness and earnestness into a system who is not afraid or
suspicious of it who is not unfaithful to it He gained not merely
powerhe gained that freedom and largeness of mind which the
suspicious or the unfaithful miss His loyalty to the Church was no
cramping or blinding service it left to its full play that fresh and
original mind left it to range at will in all history and all nature
for the traces of Eternal wisdom left it to please itself with all
beauty and pay its homage to all excellence For upon all wisdom
beauty and excellence the Church had taught him to see in various
and duly distinguished degrees the seal of the one Creator She
imparts to the poem to its form and progressive development her own
solemnity her awe her calm her serenity and joy it follows her
sacred seasons and hours repeats her appointed words of benediction
and praise moulds itself on her belief her expectations and
forecastings Her intimations more or less distinct dogma or
tradition or vague hint guide the poets imagination through the land
where all eyes are open The journey begins under the Easter moon of
the year of jubilee on the evening of Good Friday the days of her
mourning he spends in the regions of woe where none dares to
pronounce the name of the Redeemer and he issues forth to behold
again the stars to learn how to die to sin and rise to
righteousness very early in the morning as it begins to dawn on the
day of the Resurrection The whole arrangement of the Purgatorio is
drawn from Church usages It is a picture of men suffering in calm and
holy hope the sharp discipline of repentance amid the prayers the
melodies the consoling images and thoughts the orderly ritual the
hours of devotion the sacraments of the Church militant When he
ascends in his hardiest flight and imagines the joys of the perfect
and the vision of God his abundant fancy confines itself strictly to
the limits sanctioned by her famous teachersventures into no new
sphere hazards no anticipations in which they have not preceded it
and is content with adding to the poetry which it elicits from their
ideas a beauty which it is able to conceive apart altogether from
bodily formthe beauty infinite in its variety of the expression of
the human eye and smilethe beauty of light of sound of motion And
when his song mounts to its last strain of triumph and the poets
thought imagination and feeling of beauty tasked to the utmost nor
failing under the weight of glory which they have to express breathe
themselves forth in words higher than which no poetry has ever risen
and represent in images transcending sense and baffling it yet
missing not one of those deep and transporting sympathies which they
were to touch the sight eye to eye of the Creator by the
creaturehe beholds the gathering together in the presence of God
of all that from our earth has to the skies returned and of the
countless orders of their thrones mirrored in His light

But this universal reference to the religious ideas of the Church is
so natural so unaffected that it leaves him at full liberty in other
orders of thought He can afford not to be conventionalhe can afford
to be comprehensive and genuine It has been remarked how in a poem
where there would seem to be a fitting place for them the
ecclesiastical legends of the middle ages are almost entirely absent
The sainted spirits of the Paradiso are not exclusively or chiefly
the Saints of popular devotion After the Saints of the Bible the
holy women the three great Apostles the Virgin mother they are

Without confusion or disturbance to the religious character of his
train of thought he is able freely to subordinate to it the lessons
and the great recollections of the Gentile times He contemplates them
with the veil drawn off from them as now known to form but one whole
with the history of the Bible and the Church in the design of
Providence He presents them in their own colours as drawn by their
own writershe only adds what Christianity seems to show to be their
event Under the conviction that the light of the Heathen was a real
guide from above calling for vengeance in proportion to
unfaithfulness or outrage done to itHe that nurtureth the heathen
it is He that teacheth man knowledgeshall not He punishthe great
criminals of profane history are mingled with sinners against Gods

of the greatness of their loss The story of the voyage of Ulysses is
told with as much vivid power and pathetic interest as the tales of
the day He honours unfeignedly the old heathens brave disdain
of ease that spirit even to old age eager fresh adventurous and
inquisitive His faith allowed him to admire all that was beautiful
and excellent among the heathen without forgetting that it fell short
of what the new gift of the Gospel can alone impart He saw in it
proof that God had never left His will and law without their witness
among men Virtue was virtue still though imperfect and
unconsecratedgenerosity largeness of soul truth condescension
justice were never unworthy of the reverence of Christians Hence he
uses without fear or scruple the classic element The examples which
recall to the minds of the penitents by sounds and sights in the
different terraces of Purgatory their sin and the grace they have to
attain to come indiscriminately from poetry and Scripture The
sculptured pavement to which the proud are obliged ever to bow down
their eyes shows at once the humility of S Mary and of the Psalmist
and the condescension of Trajan and elsewhere the pride of Nimrod and
Sennacherib of Niobe and Cyrus The envious hear the passing voices
of courtesy from saints and heroes and the bursting cry like
crashing thunder of repentant jealousy from Cain and Aglaurus the
avaricious to keep up the memory of their fault celebrate by day the
poverty of Fabricius and the liberality of S Nicolas and execrate by
night the greediness of Pygmalion and Midas of Achan Heliodorus and
Crassus

Dantes allsurveying allembracing mind was worthy to open the
grand procession of modern poets He had chosen his subject in a
region remote from popular thoughttoo awful for it too abstruse He
had accepted frankly the dogmatic limits of the Church and thrown
himself with even enthusiastic faith into her reasonings at once so
bold and so undoubtingher spirit of certainty and her deep
contemplations on the unseen and infinite And in literature he had
taken as guides and models above all criticism and all appeal the
classical writers Yet with his mind full of the deep and intricate
questions of metaphysics and theology and his poetical taste always
owning allegiance to Virgil Ovid and Statiuskeen and subtle as a
Schoolmanas much an idolator of old heathen art and grandeur as the
men of the Renaissancehis eye is as open to the delicacies of
character to the variety of external nature to the wonders of the
physical worldhis interest in them as diversified and fresh his
impressions as sharp and distinct his rendering of them as free and
true and forcible as little weakened or confused by imitation or by
conventional words his language as elastic and as completely under
his command his choice of poetic materials as unrestricted and
original as if he had been born in days which claim as their own such
freedom and such keen discriminative sense of what is real in
feeling and imageas if he had never felt the attractions of a
crabbed problem of scholastic logic or bowed before the mellow grace
of the Latins It may be said indeed that the time was not yet come
when the classics could be really understood and appreciated and this
is true perhaps fortunate But admiring them with a kind of devotion
and showing not seldom that he had caught their spirit he never
attempts to copy them His poetry in form and material is all his
own He asserted the poets claim to borrow from all science and from
every phase of nature the associations and images which he wants and
he showed that those images and associations did not lose their poetry
by being expressed with the most literal reality

But let no reader of fastidious taste disturb his temper by the study
of Dante Dante certainly opened that path of freedom and poetic
conquest in which the greatest efforts of modern poetry have followed
himopened it with a magnificence and power which have never been
surpassed But the greatest are but pioneers they must be content to
leave to a posterity which knows more if it cannot do as much a
keen and even growing sense of their defects The Commedia is open
to all the attacks that can be made on grotesqueness and extravagance
This is partly owing doubtless to the time in itself quaint
quainter to us by being remote and illunderstood but even then
weaker and less daring writers than Dante do not equally offend or
astonish us So that an image or an expression will render forcibly a
thought there is no strangeness which checks him Barbarous words are
introduced to express the cries of the demon or the confusion of
Babeleven to represent the incomprehensible song of the
blessed inarticulate syllables to convey the impression of some
natural soundthe cry of sorrowful surprise

It must be said that most of these images though by no means all
occur in the Inferno and that the poet means to paint sin not
merely in the greatness of its ruin and misery but in characters
which all understand of strangeness of vileness of despicableness
blended with diversified and monstrous horror Even he seems to
despair of his power at times

peculators and sellers of justice are fished up by the demons from the
boiling pitch but even there overreach and cheat their tormentors
and make them turn their fangs on each other The diversified forms of
falsehood seem to tempt the poets imagination to cope with its
changefulness and inventions as well as its audacity The
transformations of the wildest dream do not daunt him His power over
language is nowhere more forcibly displayed than in those cantos
which describe the punishments of theftmen passing gradually into

These are strange experiments in poetry their strangeness is
exaggerated as detached passages but they are strange enough when
they meet us in their place in the context as parts of a scene where
the mind is strung and overawed by the sustained power with which
dreariness horror hideous absence of every form of good is kept
before the imagination and feelings in the fearful picture of human
sin But they belong to the poets system of direct and forcible
representation What his inward eye sees what he feels that he means
us to see and feel as he does to make us see and feel is his art
Afterwards we may reflect and meditate but first we must seemust
see what he saw Evil and deformity are in the world as well as good
and beauty the eye cannot escape them they are about our path in
our heart and memory He has faced them without shrinking or
dissembling and extorted from them a voice of warning In all poetry
that is written for mere delight in all poetry which regards but a
part or an aspect of nature they have no placethey disturb and mar
but he had conceived a poetry of the whole which would be weak or
false without them Yet they stand in his poem as they stand in
naturesubordinate and relieved If the grotesque is allowed to
intrude itselfif the horrible and the foul undisguised and
unsoftened make us shudder and shrink they are kept in strong check
and in due subjection by other poetical influences and the same power
which exhibits them in their naked strength renders its full grace
and glory to beauty its full force and delicacy to the most
evanescent feeling

Dantes eye was free and open to external nature in a degree new among
poets certainly in a far greater degree than among the Latins even
including Lucretius whom he probably had never read We have already
spoken of his minute notice of the appearance of living creatures but
his eye was caught by the beautiful as well as by the grotesque

Take the following beautiful picture of the bird looking out for dawn

     Come laugello intra lamate fronde

       In che i gravi labor gli sono aggrati

It is curious to observe him taking Virgils similes and altering
them When Virgil describes the throng of souls he compares them to
falling leaves or gathering birds in autumn

       Quam multa in silvis auctumni frigore primo
     Lapsa cadunt folia aut ad terram gurgite ab alto
     Quam mult glomerantur aves ubi frigidus annus
     Trans pontum fugat et terris immittit apricis

Dante uses the same images but without copying

       Come dAutunno si levan le foglie
     Luna appresso dellaltra infin che l ramo
     Rende alla terra tutte le sue spoglie
       Similemente il mal seme dAdamo
     Gittansi di quel lito ad una ad una

It is impossible not to be reminded at every step in spite of the
knowledge and taste which Mr Cary and Mr Wright have brought to
their most difficult task of the truth which Dante has expressed with
his ordinary positiveness

He is saying that he does not wish his Canzoni to be explained in
Latin to those who could not read them in Italian Che sarebbe sposta
la loro sentenzia col dove elle non la potessono colla loro bellezza
portare E per sappia ciascuno che nulla cosa per legame musaico
ie poetico armonizzata si pu della sua loquela in altra
trasmutare senza rompere tutta la sua dolcezza e armonia E questa 
la ragione per che Omero non si mut mai di Greco in Latino come
laltre scritture che avemo da loroConvito i c  p 

Dr Carlyle has given up the idea of attempting to represent Dantes
verse by English verse and has confined himself to assisting
Englishmen to read him in his own language His prose translation is
accurate and forcible And he has added sensible and useful notes

carried at once to the mind and stamped upon it sometimes by a single
word The sense of morning its inspiring and cheering strength
softens the opening of the Inferno breathes its refreshing calm in
the interval of repose after the last horrors of hell in the first
canto of the Purgatorio and prepares for the entrance into the
earthly Paradise at its close In the waning light of evening and
its chilling sense of loneliness he prepared himself for his dread
pilgrimage

But light in general is his special and chosen source of poetic
beauty No poet that we know has shown such singular sensibility to
its varied appearanceshas shown that he felt it in itself the cause
of a distinct and peculiar pleasure delighting the eye apart from
form as music delights the ear apart from words and capable like
music of definite character of endless variety and infinite
meanings He must have studied and dwelt upon it like music His mind
is charged with its effects and combinations and they are rendered
with a force a brevity a precision a heedlessness and
unconsciousness of ornament an indifference to circumstance and
detail they flash out with a spontaneous readiness a suitableness
and felicity which show the familiarity and grasp given only by daily
observation daily thought daily pleasure Light everywherein the

light from every source and in all its shapes illuminates

serene life beneath the fair stars keeps up continually the gloom
of the Inferno Light such as we see it and recognise it the light
of morning and evening growing and fading takes off from the
unearthliness of the Purgatorio peopled as it is by the undying
who though suffering for sin can sin no more it is thus made like
our familiar world made to touch our sympathies as an image of our
own purification in the flesh And when he rises beyond the regions of
earthly day light simple unalloyed unshadowed eternal lifts the
creations of his thought above all affinity to time and matter light
never fails him as the expression of the gradations of bliss never
reappears the same never refuses the new shapes of his invention
never becomes confused or dim though it is seldom thrown into
distinct figure and still more seldom coloured Only once that we
remember is the thought of colour forced on us when the bright joy
of heaven suffers change and eclipse and deepens into red at the
sacrilege of men

not merely nature but science tributary to a poetry with whose
general aim and spirit it has little in commontributary in its
exact forms even in its technicalities He speaks of the
Mediterranean Sea not merely as a historian or an observer of its
storms or its smiles but as a geologist of light not merely in
its beautiful appearances but in its natural laws There is a
charm an imaginative charm to him not merely in the sensible
magnificence of the heavens in their silence and light and
watchfulness but in the system of Ptolemy and the theories of
astrology and he delights to interweave the poetry of feeling and of
the outward sense with the grandeurso far as he knew itof order
proportion measured magnitudes the relations of abstract forces
displayed on such a scene as the material universe as if he wished to
show that imagination in its boldest flight was not afraid of the
company of the clear and subtle intellect

Indeed the real never daunts him It is his leading principle of
poetic composition to draw out of things the poetry which is latent
in them either essentially or as they are portions images or
reflexes of something greaternot to invest them with a poetical
semblance by means of words which bring with them poetical
associations and have received a general poetical stamp Dante has
few of those indirect charms which flow from the subtle structure and
refined graces of languagenone of that exquisitelyfitted and
selfsustained mechanism of choice words of the Greeksnone of that
tempered and majestic amplitude of diction which clothes like the
folds of a royal robe the thoughts of the Latinsnone of that
abundant play of fancy and sentiment soft or grand in which the
later Italian poets delighted Words with him are used sparingly
never in playnever because they carry with them poetical
recollectionsnever for their own sake but because they are
instruments which will give the deepest clearest sharpest stamp of
that image which the poets mind piercing to the very heart of his
subject or seizing the characteristic feature which to other mens
eyes is confused and lost among others accidental and common draws
forth in severe and living truth Words will not always bend
themselves to his demands on them they make him often uncouth
abrupt obscure But he is too much in earnest to heed uncouthness
and his power over language is too great to allow uncertainty as to
what he means to be other than occasional Nor is he a stranger to
the utmost sweetness and melody of language But it appears unsought
for and unlaboured the spontaneous and inevitable obedience of the
tongue and pen to the impressions of the mind as grace and beauty of
themselves command and guide the eye of the painter who thinks not
of his hand but of them All is in character with the absorbed and
serious earnestness which pervades the poem there is no toying no
ornament that a man in earnest might not throw into his
wordswhether in single images or in pictures like that of the
Meadow of the Heroes Inf  or the angel appearing in hell to
guide the poet through the burning city Inf or in histories
like those of Count Ugolino or the life of S Francis Parad
or in the dramatic scenes like the meeting of the poets Sordello
and Virgil Purgat  or that one unequalled in beauty where
Dante himself after years of forgetfulness and sin sees Beatrice in
glory and hears his name never but once pronounced during the
vision from her lips

But extracts can give but an imperfect notion of this grand and
touching canto

But this or any other array of scenes and images might be matched
from poets of a far lower order than Dante and to specimens which
might be brought together of his audacity and extravagance no
parallel could be found except among the lowest We cannot honestly
plead the barbarism of the time as his excuse That doubtless
contributed largely to them but they were the faults of the man In
another age their form might have been different yet we cannot
believe so much of time that it would have tamed Dante Nor can we
wish it It might have made him less great and his greatness can
well bear its own blemishes and will not less meet its due honour
among men because they can detect its kindred to themselves

The greatness of his work is not in its detailsto be made or marred
by them It is the greatness of a comprehensive and vast conception
sustaining without failure the trial of its long and hazardous
execution and fulfilling at its close the hope and promise of its
beginning like the greatnesswhich we watch in its course with
anxious suspense and look back upon when it is secured by death with
deep admirationof a perfect life Many a surprise many a
difficulty many a disappointment many a strange reverse and
alternation of feelings attend the progress of the most patient and
admiring reader of the Commedia as many as attend on one who
follows the unfolding of a strong character in life We are often
shocked when we were prepared to admirerepelled when we came with
sympathy the accustomed key fails at a critical momentdepths are
revealed which we cannot sound mysteries which baffle and confound
us But the check is for a timethe gap and chasm does not dissever
Haste is even an evidence of lifethe brief word the obscure hint
the unexplained the unfinished or even the unachieved are the marks
of human feebleness but are also among those of human truth The
unity of the whole is unimpaired The strength which is working it
out though it may have at times disappointed us shows no hollowness
or exhaustion The surprise of disappointment is balancedthere is
the surprise of unimagined excellence Powers do more than they
promised and that spontaneous and living energy without which
neither man nor poet can be trusted and which showed its strength
even in its failures shows it more abundantly in the novelties of
successby touching sympathies which have never been touched before
by the unconstrained freshness with which it meets the proverbial and
familiar by the freedom with which it adjusts itself to a new
position or an altered taskby the completeness unstudied and
instinctive with which it holds together dissimilar and uncongenial
materials and forces the most intractable the most unaccustomed to
submission to receive the colour of the wholeby its orderly and
unmistakable onward march and its progress as in height so in what
corresponds to height It was one and the same man who rose from the
despair the agony the vivid and vulgar horrors of the Inferno to
the sense and imagination of certainty sinlessness and joy
ineffablethe same man whose power and whose sympathies failed him
not whether discriminating and enumerating as if he had gone through
them all the various forms of human suffering from the dull
gnawing sense of the loss of happiness to the infinite woes of the
wrecked and ruined spirit and the coarser pangs of the material
flesh or dwelling on the changeful lights and shades of earnest
repentance in its hard but not unaided or ungladdened struggle and
on that restoration to liberty and peace which can change even this
life into paradise and reverse the doom which made sorrow our
condition and laughter and joy unnatural and dangerousthe penalty
of that first fault which

               In pianto ed in affanno
     Cambi onesto riso e dolce giuoco

or rising finally above mortal experience to imagine the freedom of
the saints and the peace of eternity In this consists the greatness
of his power It is not necessary to read through the Commedia to
see itopen it where we please we see that he is on his way and
whither he is going episode and digression share in the solemnity of
the general order

And his greatness was more than that of power That reach and play of
sympathy ministered to a noble wisdom which used it thoughtfully and
consciously for a purpose to which great poetry had never yet been
applied except in the mouth of prophets Dante was a stern man and
more than stern among his fellows But he has left to those who
never saw his face an inheritance the most precious he has left them
that which reflecting and interpreting their minds does so not to
amuse not to bewilder not to warp not to turn them in upon
themselves in distress or gloom or selfishness not merely to hold up
a mirror to nature but to make them true and make them hopeful Dark
as are his words of individuals his thoughts are not dark or
onesided about mankind his is no cherished and perverse
severityhis faith is too large too real for such a fault He did
not write only the Inferno And the Purgatorio and the Paradiso
are not an afterthought a feebler appendix and compensation
conceived when too late to a finished whole which has taken up into
itself the poets real mind Nowhere else in poetry of equal power is
there the same balanced view of what man is and may be nowhere so
wide a grasp shown of his various capacities so strong a desire to
find a due place and function for all his various dispositions Where
he stands contrasted in his idea of human life with other poets who
have been more powerful exponents of its separate sides is in his
large and truthful comprehensiveness Fresh from the thought of mans
condition as a whole fresh from the thought of his goodness his
greatness his power as well as of his evil his mind is equally in
tune when rejoicing over his restoration as when contemplating the
ruins of his fall He never lets go the recollection that human life
if it grovels at one end in corruption and sin and has to pass
through the sweat and dust and disfigurement of earthly toil has
throughout compensations remedies functions spheres innumerable of
profitable activity sources inexhaustible of delight and
consolationand at the other end a perfection which cannot be named
No one ever measured the greatness of man in all its forms with so
true and yet with so admiring an eye and with such glowing hope as
he who has also portrayed so awfully mans littleness and vileness
And he went fartherno one who could understand and do homage to
greatness in man ever drew the line so strongly between greatness and
goodness and so unhesitatingly placed the hero of this world
onlyplaced him in all his magnificence honoured with no timid or
dissembling reverenceat the distance of worlds below the place of
the lowest saint

Those who know the Divina Commedia best will best know how hard it
is to be the interpreter of such a mind but they will sympathise with
the wish to call attention to it They know and would wish others
also to know not by hearsay but by experience the power of that
wonderful poem They know its austere yet subduing beauty they know
what force there is in its free and earnest and solemn verse to
strengthen to tranquillise to console It is a small thing that it
has the secret of Nature and Man that a few keen words have opened
their eyes to new sights in earth and sea and sky have taught them
new mysteries of sound have made them recognise in distinct image or
thought fugitive feelings or their unheeded expression by look or
gesture or motion that it has enriched the public and collective
memory of society with new instances never to be lost of human
feeling and fortune has charmed ear and mind by the music of its
stately march and the variety and completeness of its plan But
besides this they know how often its seriousness has put to shame
their trifling its magnanimity their faintheartedness its living
energy their indolence its stern and sad grandeur rebuked low
thoughts its thrilling tenderness overcome sullenness and assuaged
distress its strong faith quelled despair and soothed perplexity its
vast grasp imparted the sense of harmony to the view of clashing
truths They know how often they have found in times of trouble if
not light at least that deep sense of reality permanent though
unseen which is more than light can always givein the view which
it has suggested to them of the judgments and the love of God

Footnote  It is necessary to state that these remarks were
written before we had seen the chapter on Dante in Italy past and
present by L Mariotti Had we become acquainted with it earlier we
should have had to refer to it often in the way of acknowledgment
and as often in the way of strong protest




DE MONARCHIA




BOOK I


IIt very greatly concerns all men on whom a higher nature has
impressed the love of truth that as they have been enriched by
the labour of those before them so they also should labour for those
that are to come after them to the end that posterity may receive
from them an addition to its wealth For he is far astray from his
dutylet him not doubt itwho having been trained in the lessons of
public business cares not himself to contribute aught to the public
good He is no tree planted by the waterside that bringeth forth
his fruit in due season He is rather the devouring whirlpool ever
engulfing but restoring nothing Pondering therefore often on these
things lest some day I should have to answer the charge of the
talent buried in the earth I desire not only to show the budding
promise but also to bear fruit for the general good and to set forth
truths by others unattempted For what fruit can he be said to bear
who should go about to demonstrate again some theorem of Euclid or
when Aristotle has shown us what happiness is should show it to us
once more or when Cicero has been the apologist of old age should a
second time undertake its defence Such squandering of labour would
only engender weariness and not profit

But seeing that among other truths illunderstood yet profitable the
knowledge touching temporal monarchy is at once most profitable and
most obscure and that because it has no immediate reference to
worldly gain it is left unexplored by all therefore it is my purpose
to draw it forth from its hidingplaces as well that I may spend my
toil for the benefit of the world as that I may be the first to win
the prize of so great an achievement to my own glory The work indeed
is difficult and I am attempting what is beyond my strength but I
trust not in my own powers but in the light of that Bountiful Giver
Who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not


IIFirst therefore we must see what is it that is called Temporal
Monarchy in its idea so to speak and according to its purpose
Temporal Monarchy then or as men call it the Empire is the
government of one prince above all men in time or in those things and
over those things which are measured by time Three great questions
are asked concerning it First there is the doubt and the question
is it necessary for the welfare of the world Secondly did the Roman
people take to itself by right the office of Monarchy And thirdly
does the authority of Monarchy come from God directly or only from
some other minister or vicar of God

Now since every truth which is not itself a first principle becomes
manifest from the truth of some first principle it is therefore
necessary in every inquiry to have a knowledge of the first principle
involved to which by analysis we may go back for the certainty of all
the propositions which are afterwards accepted And since this
treatise is an inquiry we must begin by examining the first principle
on the strength of which deductions are to rest It must be understood
then that there are certain things which since they are not subject
to our power are matters of speculation but not of action such are
Mathematics and Physics and things divine But there are some things
which since they are subject to our power are matters of action as
well as of speculation and in them we do not act for the sake of
speculation but contrariwise for in such things action is the end
Now since the matter which we have in hand has to do with states
nay with the very origin and principle of good forms of government
and since all that concerns states is subject to our power it is
manifest that our subject is not in the first place speculation but
action And again since in matters of action the end sought is the
first principle and cause of all for that it is which first moves the
agent to act it follows that all our method concerning the means
which are set to gain the end must be taken from the end For there
will be one way of cutting wood to build a house and another to build
a ship That therefore if it exists which is the ultimate end for
the universal civil order of mankind will be the first principle from
which all the truth of our future deductions will be sufficiently
manifest But it is folly to think that there is an end for this and
for that particular civil order and yet not one end for all


IIINow therefore we must see what is the end of the whole civil
order of men and when we have found this then as the
Philosopher says in his book to Nicomachus the half of our
labour will have been accomplished And to render the question
clearer we must observe that as there is a certain end for which
nature makes the thumb and another different from this for which
she makes the whole hand and again another for which she makes the
arm and another different from all for which she makes the whole man
so there is one end for which she orders the individual man and
another for which she orders the family and another end for the city
and another for the kingdom and finally an ultimate one for which the
Everlasting God by His art which is nature brings into being the
whole human race And this is what we seek as a first principle to
guide our whole inquiry

Footnote  The common title for Aristotle from the first half of
the thirteenth century Vide Jourdain Recherches sur les
traductions dAristote p  note

Footnote  Arist Ethics i 

Let it then be understood that God and nature make nothing to be idle
Whatever comes into being exists for some operation or working For
no created essence is an ultimate end in the creators purpose so far
as he is a creator but rather the proper operation of that essence
Therefore it follows that the operation does not exist for the sake of
the essence but the essence for the sake of the operation

There is therefore a certain proper operation of the whole body of
human kind for which this whole body of men in all its multitudes is
ordered and constituted but to which no one man nor single family
nor single neighbourhood nor single city nor particular kingdom can
attain What this is will be manifest if we can find what is the
final and characteristic capacity of humanity as a whole I say then
that no quality which is shared by different species of things is the
distinguishing capacity of any one of them For were it so since this
capacity is that which makes each species what it is it would follow
that one essence would be specifically distributed to many species
which is impossible Therefore the ultimate quality of men is not
existence taken simply for the elements share therein Nor is it
existence under certain conditions for we find this in minerals
too Nor is it existence with life for plants too have life Nor is
it percipient existence for brutes share in this power It is to be
percipient with the possibility of understanding for this
quality falls to the lot of none but man either above or below him
For though there are other beings which with him have understanding
yet this understanding is not as mans capable of development For
such beings are only certain intellectual natures and not anything
besides and their being is nothing other than to understand which is
without interruption otherwise they would not be eternal It is
plain therefore that the distinguishing quality of humanity is the
faculty or the power of understanding

Footnote  Esse complexionatum

Footnote  Apprehensivum per intellectum possibilem V
Aquin I    

And because this faculty cannot be realised in act in its entirety at
one time by a single man nor by any of the individual societies which
we have marked therefore there must be multitude in the human race
in order to realise it just as it is necessary that there should be a
multitude of things which can be brought into being so that the
capacity of the primal matter for being acted on may be ever open to
what acts on it For if this were not so we could speak of a capacity
apart from its substance which is impossible And with this opinion
Averroes in his comment on Aristotles treatise on the Soul
agrees For the capacity for understanding of which I speak is
concerned not only with universal forms or species but also by a
kind of extension with particular ones Therefore it is commonly said
that the speculative understanding becomes practical by extension and
then its end is to do and to make This I say in reference to things
which may be done which are regulated by political wisdom and in
reference to things which may be made which are regulated by art
all which things wait as handmaidens on the speculative intellect as
on that best good for which the Primal Goodness created the human
race Hence the saying of the Politics that those who are strong
in understanding are the natural rulers of others

Footnote  Generabilium

Footnote  Arist Polit i  W


IVIt has thus been sufficiently set forth that the proper work of
the human race taken as a whole is to set in action the whole
capacity of that understanding which is capable of development first
in the way of speculation and then by its extension in the way of
action And seeing that what is true of a part is true also of the
whole and that it is by rest and quiet that the individual man
becomes perfect in wisdom and prudence so the human race by living
in the calm and tranquillity of peace applies itself most freely and
easily to its proper work a work which according to the saying
Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels is almost divine
Whence it is manifest that of all things that are ordered to secure
blessings to men peace is the best And hence the word which sounded
to the shepherds from above was not riches nor pleasure nor honour
nor length of life nor health nor strength nor beauty but peace
For the heavenly host said Glory to God in the highest and on
earth peace to men of goodwill Therefore also Peace be with you
was the salutation of the Saviour of mankind For it behoved Him who
was the greatest of saviours to utter in His greeting the greatest of
saving blessings And this custom His disciples too chose to preserve
and Paul also did the same in his greetings as may appear manifest to
all

Now that we have declared these matters it is plain what is the
better nay the best way in which mankind may attain to do its proper
work And consequently we have seen the readiest means by which to
arrive at the point for which all our works are ordered as their
ultimate end namely the universal peace which is to be assumed as
the first principle for our deductions As we said this assumption
was necessary for it is as a signpost to us that into it we may
resolve all that has to be proved as into a most manifest truth


VAs therefore we have already said there are three doubts and
these doubts suggest three questions concerning Temporal Monarchy
which in more common speech is called the Empire and our purpose is
as we explained to inquire concerning these questions in their given
order and starting from the first principle which we have just laid
down The first question then is whether Temporal Monarchy is
necessary for the welfare of the world and that it is necessary can
I think be shown by the strongest and most manifest arguments for
nothing either of reason or of authority opposes me Let us first
take the authority of the Philosopher in his Politics There on
his venerable authority it is said that where a number of things are
arranged to attain an end it behoves one of them to regulate or
govern the others and the others to submit And it is not only the
authority of his illustrious name which makes this worthy of belief
but also reason instancing particulars

Footnote  Arist Polit i 

If we take the case of a single man we shall see the same rule
manifested in him all his powers are ordered to gain happiness but
his understanding is what regulates and governs all the others and
otherwise he would never attain to happiness Again take a single
household its end is to fit the members thereof to live well but
there must be one to regulate and rule it who is called the father of
the family or it may be one who holds his office As the
Philosopher says Every house is ruled by the oldest And as
Homer says it is his duty to make rules and laws for the rest Hence
the proverbial curse Mayst thou have an equal at home Take a
single village its end is suitable assistance as regards persons and
goods but one in it must be the ruler of the rest either set over
them by another or with their consent the head man amongst them If
it be not so not only do its inhabitants fail of this mutual
assistance but the whole neighbourhood is sometimes wholly ruined by
the ambition of many who each of them wish to rule If again we
take a single city its end is to secure a good and sufficient life to
the citizens but one man must be ruler in imperfect as well as
in good forms of the state If it is otherwise not only is the end of
civil life lost but the city too ceases to be what it was Lastly if
we take any one kingdom of which the end is the same as that of a
city only with greater security for its tranquillity there must be
one king to rule and govern For if this is not so not only do his
subjects miss their end but the kingdom itself falls to destruction
according to that word of the infallible truth Every kingdom divided
against itself shall be brought to desolation If then this holds
good in these cases and in each individual thing which is ordered to
one certain end what we have laid down is true

Footnote  Ibid i   quoting Hom Od ix W

Footnote  Ficinus translates Uno proverbio che quasi
bestemmiando dice Abbi pari in casa

Footnote  Obliqua  Greek parekbaseis V Arist Eth
viii  Pol iii W

Now it is plain that the whole human race is ordered to gain some end
as has been before shown There must therefore be one to guide and
govern and the proper title for this office is Monarch or Emperor
And so it is plain that Monarchy or the Empire is necessary for the
welfare of the world


VIAnd as the part is to the whole so is the order of parts to the
order of the whole The part is to the whole as to an end and highest
good which is aimed at and therefore the order in the parts is to
the order in the whole as it is to the end and highest good aimed at
Hence we have it that the goodness of the order of parts does not
exceed the goodness of the order of the whole but that the converse
of this is true Therefore we find a double order in the world
namely the order of parts in relation to each other and their order
in relation to some one thing which is not a part as there is in the
order of the parts of an army in relation to each other and then in
relation to the general and the order of the parts in relation to
the one thing which is not a part is the higher for it is the end of
the other order and the other exists for the sake of it Therefore
if the form of this order is found in the units of the mass of
mankind much more may we argue by our syllogism that it is found in
mankind considered as a whole for this latter order or its form is
better But as was said in the preceding chapter and it is
sufficiently plain this order is found in all the units of the mass
of mankind Therefore it is or should be found in the mass
considered as a whole And therefore all the parts that we have
mentioned which are comprised in kingdoms and the kingdoms
themselves ought to be ordered with reference to one Prince or
Princedom that is with reference to a Monarch or Monarchy


VIIFurther the whole human race is a whole with reference to
certain parts and with reference to another whole it is a part For
it is a whole with reference to particular kingdoms and nations as we
have shown and it is a part with reference to the whole universe as
is manifest without argument Therefore as the lower portions of the
whole system of humanity are well adapted to that whole so that whole
is said to be well adapted to the whole which is above it It is only
under the rule of one prince that the parts of humanity are well
adapted to their whole as may easily be collected from what we have
said therefore it is only by being under one Princedom or the rule
of a single Prince that humanity as a whole is well adapted to the
Universe or its Prince who is the One God And it therefore follows
that Monarchy is necessary for the welfare of the world


VIIIAnd all is well and at its best which exists according to the
will of the first agent who is God This is selfevident except to
those who deny that the divine goodness attains to absolute
perfection Now it is the intention of God that all created things
should represent the likeness of God so far as their proper nature
will admit Therefore was it said Let us make man in our image
after our likeness And though it could not be said that the lower
part of creation was made in the image of God yet all things may be
said to be after His likeness for what is the whole universe but the
footprint of the divine goodness The human race therefore is well
nay at its best state when so far as can be it is made like unto
God But the human race is then most made like unto God when most it
is one for the true principle of oneness is in Him alone Wherefore
it is written Hear O Israel the Lord thy God is one God But the
race of man is most one when it is united wholly in one body and it
is evident that this cannot be except when it is subject to one
prince Therefore in this subjection mankind is most made like unto
God and in consequence such a subjection is in accordance with the
divine intention and it is indeed well and best for man when this is
so as we showed at the beginning of this chapter


IXAgain things are well and at their best with every son when he
follows so far as by his proper nature he can the footsteps of a
perfect father Mankind is the son of heaven which is most perfect in
all its works for it is man and the sun which produce man
according to the second book on Natural Learning The human
race therefore is at its best when it imitates the movements of
heaven so far as human nature allows And since the whole heaven is
regulated with one motion to wit that of the primum mobile and by
one mover who is God in all its parts movements and movers and
this human reason readily seizes from science therefore if our
argument be correct the human race is at its best state when both in
its movements and in regard to those who move it it is regulated by
a single Prince as by the single movement of heaven and by one law
as by the single motion Therefore it is evidently necessary for the
welfare of the world for there to be a Monarchy or single Princedom
which men call the Empire And this thought did Boethius breathe when
he said Oh happy race of men if your hearts are ruled by the love
which rules the heaven

XWherever there is controversy there ought to be judgment
otherwise there would be imperfection without its proper remedy
which is impossible for God and Nature in things necessary do not
fail in their provisions But it is manifest that there may be
controversy between any two princes where the one is not subject to
the other either from the fault of themselves or even of their
subjects Therefore between them there should be means of judgment
And since when one is not subject to the other he cannot be judged
by the other for there is no rule of equals over equals there must
be a third prince of wider jurisdiction within the circle of whose
laws both may come Either he will or he will not be a Monarch If he
is we have what we sought if not then this one again will have an
equal who is not subject to his jurisdiction and then again we have
need of a third And so we must either go on to infinity which is
impossible or we must come to that judge who is first and highest by
whose judgment all controversies shall be either directly or
indirectly decided and he will be Monarch or Emperor Monarchy is
therefore necessary to the world and this the Philosopher saw when he
said The world is not intended to be disposed in evil order in a
multitude of rulers there is evil therefore let there be one
prince

XIFurther the world is ordered best when justice is most paramount
therein whence Virgil wishing to celebrate that age which in his
own time seemed to be arising sang in his Bucolics Now doth
the Virgin return and the kingdom of Saturn For Justice was named
the Virgin and also Astra The kingdom of Saturn was the good
time which they also called the Golden Age But Justice is paramount
only in a Monarchy and therefore a Monarchy that is the Empire is
needed if the world is to be ordered for the best For better proof of
this assumption it must be recognised that Justice considered in
itself and in its proper nature is a certain rightness or rule of
conduct which rejects on either side all that deviates from it It is
like whiteness considered as an abstraction not admitting of degrees
For there are certain forms of this sort which belong to things
compounded and exist themselves in a simple and unchanging essence
as the Master of the Six Principles rightly says Yet qualities
of this sort admit of degrees on the part of their subjects with which
they are connected according as in their subjects more or less of
their contraries is mingled Justice therefore is strongest in man
both as a state of mind and in practice where there is least
admixture of its opposite and then we may say of it in the words of
the Philosopher that neither the star of morning nor of evening is
so admirable For then is it like Phoebe when she looks
across the heavens at her brother from the purple of the morning calm

Footnote  From Arist Ethics v W

Now Justice as a state of mind has a force which opposes it in
the will for where the will of a man is not pure from all desire
then though there be Justice yet there is not Justice in all its
ideal brightness for there is in that man however little yet in
some degree an opposing force and therefore they who would work on
the feelings of a judge are rightly repelled But in
practice Justice finds an opposing force in what men are able to
do For seeing that it is a virtue regulating our conduct towards
other men how shall any act according to Justice if he has not the
power of rendering to all their due Therefore it is plain that the
operation of Justice will be wide in proportion to the power of the
just man

Footnote  Quantum ad habitum

Footnote  Passionare

Footnote  Quantum ad operationem

From this let us argue Justice is strongest in the world when it is
in one who is most willing and most powerful only the Monarch is
this therefore only when Justice is in the Monarch is it strongest
in the world This prosyllogism goes on through the second figure
with an involved negative and is like this All B is A only C is A
therefore only C is B or all B is A nothing but C is A therefore
nothing but C is B

Our previous explanation makes the first proposition apparent the
second is proved thus first in regard to will and secondly in regard
to power First it must be observed that the strongest opponent of
Justice is Appetite as Aristotle intimates in the fifth book to
Nicomachus Remove Appetite altogether and there remains nothing
adverse to Justice and therefore it is the opinion of the Philosopher
that nothing should be left to the judge if it can be decided by
law and this ought to be done for fear of Appetite which easily
perverts mens minds Where then there is nothing to be wished for
there can be no Appetite for the passions cannot exist if their
objects are destroyed But the Monarch has nothing to desire for his
jurisdiction is bounded only by the ocean and this is not the case
with other princes whose kingdoms are bounded by those of their
neighbours as for instance the kingdom of Castile is bounded by the
kingdom of Aragon From which it follows that the Monarch is able to
be the purest embodiment of Justice among men

Footnote  Eth v W

Footnote  Rhetoric i W

Further as Appetite in some degree however small clouds the habit
of Justice so does Charity or rightlydirected affection sharpen
and enlighten it In whomsoever therefore rightlydirected affection
may chiefly dwell in him may Justice best have place and of this
sort is the Monarch Therefore where a Monarch reigns Justice is or
at least may be strongest That rightlydirected affections work as
we have said we may see thus Appetite scorning what in itself
belongs to man seeks for other things outside him but Charity sets
aside all else and seeks God and man and consequently the good of
man And since of all the good things that men can have the greatest
is to live in peace as we have already said and as it is Justice
which most chiefly brings peace therefore Charity will chiefly make
Justice strong and the more so in proportion to its own strength

Footnote  Perseitas hominum  facultas per se
subsistendiDUCANGE

And it is clear that right affections ought to exist in a Monarch more
than in any other man for this reason the object of love is the more
loved the nearer it is to him that loves but men are nearer to a
Monarch than they are to other princes therefore it is by a Monarch
that they are or ought to be most loved The first proposition is
manifest if the nature of activity and passivity are considered The
second is manifest because men are brought near to a Monarch in their
totality but to other princes only partially and it is only by
means of the Monarch that men are brought near other princes at all
Thus the Monarch cares for all primarily and directly whereas other
princes only care for their subjects through the Monarch and because
their care for their subjects descends from the supreme care of the
Monarch

Again a cause has the nature of a cause in proportion as it is more
universal for the lower cause is such only on account of the higher
one as appears from the Treatise on Causes And in proportion
as a cause is really a cause it loves what it effects for such love
follows the cause by itself Now Monarchy is the most universal cause
of men living well for other princes work only through the Monarch
as we have said and it therefore follows that it is the Monarch who
will most chiefly love the good of men But that in practice the
Monarch is most disposed to work Justice who can doubt except indeed
a man who understands not the meaning of the word for if he be
really a Monarch he cannot have enemies

or Proclus which under various names passed for a work of

The principle assumed being therefore sufficiently explained the
conclusion is certain to wit that a Monarch is necessary that the
world may be ordered for the best


XIIAgain the human race is ordered best when it is most free This
will be manifest if we see what is the principle of freedom It must
be understood that the first principle of our freedom is freedom of
will which many have in their mouth but few indeed understand For
they come so far as to say that the freedom of the will means a free
judgment concerning will And this is true But what is meant by the
words is far from them and they do just as our logicians do all day
long with certain propositions which are set as examples in the books
of logic as that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two
right angles

Footnote  Cf Arist Magna Moral i  It would be absurd if
a man wishing to prove that the angles of a triangle were equal to
two right angles assumed as his principle that the soul is
immortalWITTE

Therefore I say that Judgment is between Apprehension and Appetite
First a man apprehends a thing then he judges it to be good or bad
then he pursues or avoids it accordingly If therefore the Judgment
guides the Appetite wholly and in no way is forestalled by the
Appetite then is the Judgment free But if the Appetite in any way at
all forestalls the Judgment and guides it then the Judgment cannot be
free it is not its own it is captive to another power Therefore the
brute beasts cannot have freedom of Judgment for in them the Appetite
always forestalls the Judgment Therefore too it is that
intellectual beings whose wills are unchangeable and souls which are
separate from the body which have gone hence in peace do not lose
the freedom of their wills because their wishes cannot change nay
it is in full strength and completeness that their wills are
free

Footnote  Cf Purgatorio xviii WITTE

It is therefore again manifest that this liberty or this principle of
all our liberty is the greatest gift bestowed by God on mankind by
it alone we gain happiness as men by it alone we gain happiness
elsewhere as gods But if this is so who will say that human
kind is not in its best state when it can most use this principle
But he who lives under a Monarchy is most free Therefore let it be
understood that he is free who exists not for anothers sake but for
his own as the Philosopher in his Treatise of simple Being
thought For everything which exists for the sake of some other
thing is necessitated by that other thing as a road has to run to
its ordained end Men exist for themselves and not at the pleasure of
others only if a Monarch rules for then only are the perverted forms
of government set right while democracies oligarchies and
tyrannies drive mankind into slavery as is obvious to any who goes
about among them all and public power is in the hands of kings
and aristocracies which they call the rule of the best and champions
of popular liberty And because the Monarch loves his subjects much
as we have seen he wishes all men to be good which cannot be the
case in perverted forms of government therefore the Philosopher
says in his Politics In the bad state the good man is a bad
citizen but in a good state the two coincide Good states in this
way aim at liberty that in them men may live for themselves The
citizens exist not for the good of consuls nor the nation for the
good of its king but the consuls for the good of the citizens and
the king for the good of his nation For as the laws are made to suit
the state and not the state to suit the laws so those who live under
the laws are not ordered for the legislator but he for them as
also the Philosopher holds in what he has left us on the present
subject Hence too it is clear that although the king or the consul
rule over the other citizens in respect of the means of
government yet in respect of the end of government they are the
servants of the citizens and especially the Monarch who without
doubt must be held the servant of all Thus it becomes clear that the
Monarch is bound by the end appointed to himself in making his laws
Therefore mankind is best off under a Monarchy and hence it follows
that Monarchy is necessary for the welfare of the world

XIIIFurther he who can be best fitted to rule can best fit others
For in every action the main end of the agent whether acting by
necessity of nature or voluntarily is to unfold his own likeness and
therefore every agent so far as he is of this sort delights in
action For since all that is desires its own existence and since the
agent in acting enlarges his own existence in some way delight
follows action of necessity for delight is inseparable from gaining
what is desired Nothing therefore acts unless it is of such sort as
that which is acted on ought to be therefore the Philosopher said in
his Metaphysics Everything which becomes actual from being
potential becomes so by means of something actual of the same kind
and were anything to try to act in any other way it would fail Hence
we may overthrow the error of those who think to form the moral
character of others by speaking well and doing ill forgetting that
the hands of Jacob were more persuasive with his father than his
words though his hands deceived and his voice spake truth Hence the
Philosopher to Nicomachus In matters of feeling and action words
are less to be trusted than deeds And therefore God said to
David in his sin What hast thou to do to declare my statutes as
though He would say Thou speakest in vain for thou art different
from what thou speakest Hence it may be gathered that he needs to be
fitted for his work in the best way who wishes to fit others

Footnote  Metaphys ix W

Footnote  Arist Eth x W

But the Monarch is the only one who can be fitted in the best possible
way to govern Which is thus proved Each thing is the more easily and
perfectly qualified for any habit or actual work the less there is
in it of what is contrary to such a disposition Therefore they who
have never even heard of philosophy arrive at a habit of truth in
philosophy more easily and completely than those who have listened to
it at odd times and are filled with false opinions For which reason
Galen well says Such as these require double time to acquire
knowledge A Monarch then has nothing to tempt appetite or at
least less than any other man as we have shown before whereas other
princes have much and appetite is the only corrupter of
righteousness and the only impediment to justice A Monarch therefore
is wholly or at least more than any other prince disposed to govern
well for in him there may be judgment and justice more strongly than
in any other But these two things are the preeminent attributes of a
maker of law and of an executor of law as that most holy king David
testified when he asked of God the things which were befitting the
king and the kings son saying Give the king thy judgment O God
and thy righteousness unto the kings son

Footnote  De cognosc animi morbis c WITTE

Footnote  Cf Parad xiii W

We were right then when we assumed that only the Monarch can be best
fitted to rule Therefore only the Monarch can in the best way fit
other men Therefore it follows that Monarchy is necessary for the
best ordering of the world


XIVAnd where a thing can be done by one agent it is better to do
it by one than by several for this reason Let it be possible to do a
certain thing by means of A and also by means of A and B If
therefore what is done by A and B can be done by A alone it is
useless to add B for nothing follows from the addition for the same
end which A and B produced is produced also by A All additions of
this kind are useless and superfluous all that is superfluous is
displeasing to God and Nature and all that is displeasing to God and
Nature is bad as is manifest It therefore follows not only that it
is better that a thing should be done by one than by many agents if
it is possible to produce the effect by one but also that to produce
the effect by one is good and to produce it by many is simply bad
Again a thing is said to be better by being nearer to the best and
the end has the nature of the best But for a thing to be done by one
agent is better for so it comes nearer to the end And that so it
comes nearer is manifest for let C be the end which may be reached by
A or by A and B together plainly it is longer to reach C by A and B
together than by B alone But mankind may be governed by one supreme
prince who is the Monarch

But it must be carefully observed that when we say that mankind may be
ruled by one supreme prince we do not mean that the most trifling
judgments for each particular town are to proceed immediately from
him For municipal laws sometimes fail and need guidance as the
Philosopher shows in his fifth book to Nicomachus when he praises
equity For nations and kingdoms and states have each of them
certain peculiarities which must be regulated by different laws For
law is the rule which directs life Thus the Scythians need one rule
for they live beyond the seventh climate and suffer cold which
is almost unbearable from the great inequality of their days and
nights But the Garamantes need a different law for their country is
equinoctial and they cannot wear many clothes from the excessive
heat of the air because the day is as long as the darkness of the
night But our meaning is that it is in those matters which are common
to all men that men should be ruled by one Monarch and be governed
by a rule common to them all with a view to their peace And the
individual princes must receive this rule of life or law from him
just as the practical intellect receives its major premiss from the
speculative intellect under which it places its own particular
premiss and then draws its particular conclusion with a view to
action And it is not only possible for one man to act as we have
described it is necessary that it should proceed from one man only to
avoid confusion in our first principles Moses himself wrote in his
law that he had acted thus For he took the elders of the tribes of
the children of Israel and left to them the lesser judgments
reserving to himself such as were more important and wider in their
scope and the elders carried these wider ones to their tribes
according as they were applicable to each separate tribe

Therefore it is better for the human race to be ruled by one than by
many and therefore there should be a Monarch who is a single prince
and if it is better it is more acceptable to God since God always
wills what is best And since of these two ways of government the one
is not only the better but the best of all it follows not only that
this one is more acceptable to God as between one and many but that
it is the most acceptable Therefore it is best for the human race to
be governed by one man and Monarchy is necessary for the welfare of
the world


XVI say also that Being and Unity and the Good come in order
after the fifth mode of priority For Being comes by nature
before Unity and Unity before Good Where Being is most there Unity
is greatest and where Unity is greatest there Good is also greatest
and in proportion as anything is far from Being in its highest form
is it far from Unity and therefore from Good Therefore in every kind
of things that which is most one is best as the Philosopher holds in
the treatise about simple Being Therefore it appears that to be one
is the root of Good and to be many the root of Evil Therefore
Pythagoras in his parallel tables placed the one or Unity under the
line of good and the many under the line of Evil as appears from the
first book of the Metaphysics Hence we may see that to sin is
nothing else than to pass on from the one which we despise and to seek
many things as the Psalmist saw when he said By the fruit of their
corn and wine and oil are they multiplied

Hence it is plain that whatever is good is good for this reason that
it consists in unity And because concord is a good thing in so far as
it is concord it is manifest that it consists in a certain unity as
its proper root the nature of which will appear if we find the real
nature of concord Concord then is the uniform motion of many wills
and hence it appears that a unity of wills by which is meant their
uniform motion is the root of concord nay concord itself For as we
should say that many clods of earth are concordant because that they
all gravitate together towards the centre and that many flames are
concordant because that they all ascend together towards the
circumference if they did this of their own free will so we say that
many men are in concord because that they are all moved together as
regards their willing to one thing which one thing is formally in
their wills just as there is one quality formally in the clods of
earth that is gravity and one in the flame of fire that is
lightness For the force of willing is a certain power but the
quality of good which it apprehends is its form which form like as
others being one is multiplied in itself according to the
multiplication of the matters which receive it as the soul and
numbers and other forms which belong to what is compound

Footnote  On the scholastic doctrine of forms v Thom Aquin
Summ I  art 

To explain our assumption as we proposed let us argue thus All
concord depends on unity which is in wills the human race when it is
at its best is a kind of concord for as one man at his best is a
kind of concord and as the like is true of the family the city and
the kingdom so is it of the whole human race Therefore the human
race at its best depends on the unity which is in will But this
cannot be unless there be one will to be the single mistress and
regulating influence of all the rest For the wills of men on account
of the blandishments of youth require one to direct them as
Aristotle shows in the tenth book of his Ethics And this
cannot be unless there is one prince over all whose will shall be the
mistress and regulating influence of all the others But if all these
conclusions be true as they are it is necessary for the highest
welfare of the human race that there should be a Monarch in the world
and therefore Monarchy is necessary for the good of the world

Footnote  Arist Eth x W


XVITo all these reasons alleged above a memorable experience adds
its confirmation I mean that condition of mankind which the Son of
God when for the salvation of man He was about to put on man
either waited for or at the moment when He willed Himself so
ordered For if from the fall of our first parents which was the
turning point at which all our going astray began we carry our
thoughts over the distribution of the human race and the order of its
times we shall find that never but under the divine Augustus who was
sole ruler and under whom a perfect Monarchy existed was the world
everywhere quiet And that then the human race was happy in the
tranquillity of universal peace this is the witness of all writers of
history this is the witness of famous poets this too he who wrote
the story of the meekness and gentleness of Christ has thought fit
to attest And last of all Paul has called that most blessed
condition the fulness of the times For then indeed time was full
and all the things of time because no office belonging to our
felicity wanted its minister But how the world has fared since that
seamless robe has suffered rending by the talons of ambition we may
read in books would that we might not see it with our eyes Oh race
of mankind what storms must toss thee what losses must thou endure
what shipwrecks must buffet thee as long as thou a beast of many
heads strivest after contrary things Thou art sick in both thy
faculties of understanding thou art sick in thine affections
Unanswerable reasons fail to heal thy higher understanding the very
sight of experience convinces not thy lower understanding not even
the sweetness of divine persuasion charms thy affections when it
breathes into thee through the music of the Holy Ghost Behold how
good and how pleasant a thing it is brethren to dwell together in
unity

BOOK II


IWhy do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing The
kings of the earth stand up and the rulers take counsel together
against the Lord and against His anointed saying Let us break their
bonds asunder and cast away their cords from us As we
commonly wonder at a new effect when we have never been face to face
with its cause so as soon as we understand the cause we look down
with a kind of scorn on those who remain in wonder I myself was
once filled with wonder that the Roman people had become paramount
throughout all the earth without any to withstand them for when I
looked at the thing superficially I thought that this supremacy had
been obtained not by any right but only by arms and violence But
after that I had carefully and thoroughly examined the matter when I
had recognised by the most effectual signs that it was divine
providence that had wrought this my wonder ceased and a certain
scornful contempt has taken its place when I perceive the nations
raging against the preeminence of the Roman people when I see the
people imagining a vain thing as I of old imagined when above all
I grieve that kings and princes agree in this one matter only in
opposing their Lord and His one only Roman Emperor Wherefore in
derision yet not without a touch of sorrow I can cry on behalf of
the glorious people and for Csar together with him who cried on
behalf of the Prince of heaven Why do the heathen rage and the
people imagine a vain thing The kings of the earth stand up and the
rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against His
anointed But the love which nature implants in us allows not scorn
to last for long but like the summer sun that when it has dispersed
the morning clouds shines with full brightness this love prefers to
put scorn aside and to pour forth the light which shall set men
right So then to break the bonds of the ignorance of those kings
and princes and to show that mankind is free from their yoke I
will comfort myself in company with that most holy prophet whom I
follow taking the words which come after Let us break their bonds
asunder and cast away their yoke from us

Footnote  Ps ii W

These two things will be sufficiently performed if I address myself
to the second part of the argument and manifest the truth of the
question before us For thus if we show that the Roman Empire is by
right not only shall we disperse the clouds of ignorance from the
eyes of those princes who have wrongly seized the helm of public
government falsely imputing this thing to the Roman people but all
men shall understand that they are free from the yoke of these
usurpers The truth of the question can be made clear not only by the
light of human reason but also by the ray of Gods authority and
when these two coincide then heaven and earth must agree together
Supported therefore by this conviction and trusting in the
testimony both of reason and of authority I proceed to settle the
second question


IIInquiry concerning the truth of the first doubt has been made as
accurately as the nature of the subject permitted we have now to
inquire concerning the second which is Whether the Roman people
assumed to itself of right the dignity of the Empire And the first
thing in this question is to find the truth to which the reasonings
concerning it may be referred as to their proper first principle

It must be recognised then that as there are three degrees in every
art the mind of the artist his instrument and the material on which
he works so we may look upon nature in three degrees For nature
exists first in the mind of the First Agent who is God then in
heaven as in an instrument by means of which the likeness of the
Eternal Goodness unfolds itself on shapeless matter If an artist
is perfect in his art and his instrument is perfect any fault in the
form of his art must be laid to the badness of the material and so
since God holds the summit of perfection and since His instrument
which is heaven admits of no failure of its due perfection which is
manifest from our philosophy touching heaven it follows that
whatever fault is to be found in the lower world is a fault on the
part of the subject matter and is contrary to the intention of God
who makes nature and of heaven and if in this lower world there
is aught that is good it must be ascribed first to the artist who is
God and then to heaven the instrument of Gods art which men call
nature for the material being merely a possibility can do nothing
of itself

Hence it is apparent that since all Right is good it therefore
exists first in the mind of God and since all that is in the mind of
God is God according to the saying What was made in Him was
life and as God chiefly wishes for what is Himself it follows
that Right is the wish of God so far as it is in Him And since in
God the will and the wish are the same it further follows that this
Right is the will of God Again it follows that Right in the world is
nothing else than the likeness of the will of God and therefore
whatever does not agree with the divine will cannot be Right and
whatever does agree with the divine will is Right itself Therefore to
ask if a thing be by Right is only to ask in other words if it is what
God wills It may therefore be assumed that what God wills to see in
mankind is to be held as real and true Right

Footnote  Jus

Footnote  St John i W

Besides we must remember Aristotles teaching in the first book of his
Ethics where he says We must not seek for certitude in every
matter but only as far as the nature of the subject admits
Therefore our arguments from the first principle already found will be
sufficient if from manifest evidence and from the authority of the
wise we seek for the right of that glorious people The will of God
is an invisible thing but the invisible things of God are seen
being understood by the things which are made For when the seal is
out of sight the wax which has its impression gives manifest
evidence of it though it be unseen nor is it strange that the will
of God must be sought by signs for the human will except to the
person himself who wills is only discerned by signs

IIIMy answer then to the question is that it was by right and not
by usurpation that the Roman people assumed to itself the office of
Monarchy or as men call it the Empire over all mankind For in the
first place it is fitting that the noblest people should be preferred
to all others the Roman people was the noblest therefore it is
fitting that it should be preferred to all others By this reasoning I
make my proof for since honour is the reward of goodness and since
to be preferred is always honour therefore to be preferred is always
the reward of goodness It is plain that men are ennobled for their
virtues that is for their own virtues or for those of their
ancestors for nobleness is virtue and ancestral wealth according to
Aristotle in his Politics and according to Juvenal There is no
nobleness of soul but virtue which two statements refer to two
sorts of nobleness our own and that of our ancestors

Footnote  Arist Pol iii  Juv viii W

Footnote  Witte refers to Dantes commentary on his own Canzone
in the Convito iv  and the Parad xvi 

To be preferred therefore is according to reason the fitting
reward of the noble And since rewards must be measured by desert
according to that saying of the Gospel with what measure ye mete it
shall be measured to you again therefore to the most noble the
highest place should be given The testimonies of the ancients confirm
our opinion for Virgil our divine poet testifies throughout his
neid that men may ever remember it that the glorious king neas
was the father of the Roman people And this Titus Livius the famous
chronicler of the deeds of the Romans confirms in the first part of
his work which takes its beginning from the capture of Troy The
nobleness of this most unconquerable and most pious ancestor not only
in regard to his own great virtue but also to that of his forefathers
and of his wives the nobleness of whom was combined in their
descendant by the rightful law of descent I cannot unfold at length
I can but touch lightly on the outlines of the truth

Footnote  Sed summa sequar vestigia rerum Virg n i 
fastigia in all good MSS and edd

For the virtue then of neas himself hear what our poet tells us when
he introduces Ilioneus in the first neid praying thus neas was
our king in justice and piety he has not left a peer nor any to
equal him in war Hear Virgil in the sixth neid when he speaks
of the death of Misenus who had been Hectors attendant in war and
after Hectors death had attached himself to neas for there Virgil
says that Misenus followed as good a man thus comparing neas to
Hector whom Homer ever praises above all men as the Philosopher
witnesses in his Ethics in what he writes to Nicomachus on habits
to be avoided

Footnote  n i  vi  Il xxiv  quoted in
Aristotle Ethics vii W

But as for hereditary virtue he was ennobled from all three
continents both by his forefathers and his wives From Asia came his
immediate ancestor Assaracus and others who reigned in Phrygia
which is a part of Asia Therefore Virgil writes in the third neid
After that it had seemed good to Heaven to overthrow the power of
Asia and the guiltless race of Priam From Europe came the male
founder of his race who was Dardanus from Africa his grandmother
Electra daughter of the great king Atlas to both which things the
poet testifies in the eighth neid where neas says to Evander
Dardanus the father of our city and its founder whom the Greeks
call the son of Atlas and Electra came to the race of TeucerElectra
whose sire was great Atlas on whose shoulders rests the circle of
heaven But in the third neid Virgil says that Dardanus drew his
origin from Europe There is a land which the Greeks have named
Hesperia an ancient land strong and wealthy where the notrians
dwell it is said that now their descendants have named the country
Italy from the name of their king There is our rightful home from
that land did Dardanus come That Atlas came from Africa the
mountain called by his name which stands in that continent bears
witness and Orosius says that it is in Africa in his description of
the world where he writes Its boundary is Mount Atlas and the
islands which are called the happy isles Itsthat is of
Africa of which he was speaking

Footnote  n iii  viii  iii  Oros i W

Likewise I find that by marriage also neas was ennobled his first
wife Creusa the daughter of king Priam was from Asia as may be
gathered from our previous quotations and that she was his wife our
poet testifies in the third neid where Andromache asks neas
What of the boy Ascanius whom Creusa bore to thee while the ruins
of Troy were yet smoking Lives he yet to breathe this air The
second wife was Dido the queen and foundress of Carthage in Africa
That she was the wife of neas our poet sings in his fourth neid
where he says of Dido No more does Dido think of love in secret
She calls it marriage and with this name she covers her sin The
third wife was Lavinia the mother of Albans and Romans alike the
daughter of king Latinus and his heir if we may trust the testimony
of our poet in his last neid where he introduces Turnus conquered
praying to neas thus Thou hast conquered and the Ausonians have
seen me lift my hands in prayer for mercy Lavinia is thine
This last wife was from Italy the noblest region of Europe

Footnote  III  The best MSS of Virgil omit peperit fumante
Creusa

Footnote  n xii W

And now that we have marked these things for evidence of our
assertion who will not rest persuaded that the father of the Romans
and therefore the Romans themselves were the noblest people under
heaven Who can fail to see the divine predestination shown forth by
the double meeting of blood from every part of the world in the veins
of one man


IVAgain that which is helped to its perfection by miracles is
willed by God and therefore it is of right This is manifestly true
for as Thomas says in his third book against the Gentiles a miracle
is something done by God beyond the commonly established order of
things And so he proves that God alone can work miracles and
his proof is strengthened by the authority of Moses for on the
occasion of the plague of lice when the magicians of Pharaoh used
natural principles artfully and then failed they said This is the
finger of God A miracle therefore being the immediate working
of the first agent without the cooperation of any secondary agents
as Thomas himself sufficiently proves in the book which we have
mentioned it is impious to say where a miracle is worked in aid of
anything that that thing is not of God as something well pleasing to
him which he foresaw Therefore it is religious to accept the
contradictory of this The Roman Empire has been helped to its
perfection by miracles therefore it was willed by God and
consequently was and is by right

Footnote  Contra Gent iii W

Footnote  Exod vii W

Footnote  Witte refers to the Ep ad Reges   for the same
thought

It is proved by the testimony of illustrious authors that God
stretched forth His hand to work miracles on behalf of the Roman
Empire For Livy in the first part of his work testifies that a
shield fell from heaven into the city chosen of God in the time of
Numa Pompilius the second king of Rome whilst he was sacrificing
after the manner of the Gentiles Lucan mentions this miracle in the
ninth book of his Pharsalia when he is describing the incredible
force of the South wind He says Surely it was thus while Numa was
offering sacrifices that the shield fell with which the chosen
patrician youth moves along The South wind or the North wind had
spoiled the people that bore our shields And when the Gauls had
taken all the city and under cover of the darkness were stealing on
to attack the Capitol itself the capture of which was all that
remained to destroy the very name of Rome then as Livy and many
other illustrious writers agree in testifying a goose which none had
seen before gave a warning note of the approach of the Gauls and
aroused the guards to defend the Capitol And our poet
commemorates the event in his description of the shield of neas in
the eighth book Higher and in front of the temple stood Manlius
the watchman of the Tarpeian keep guarding the rock of the Capitol
The palace stood out clear rough with the thatch which Romulus had
laid here the goose inlaid in silver fluttered on the portico of
gold as it warned the Romans that the Gauls were even now on the
threshold

And when the nobility of Rome had so fallen under the onset of
Hannibal that nothing remained for the final destruction of the Roman
commonwealth but the Carthaginian assault on the city Livy tells us
in the course of his history of the Punic war that a sudden dreadful
storm of hail fell upon them so that the victors could not follow up
their victory

Footnote  Liv xxvi  Oros iv W

Was not the escape of Cloelia wonderful a woman and captive in the
power of Porsenna when she burst her bonds and by the marvellous
help of God swam across the Tiber as almost all the historians of
Rome tell us to the glory of that city

Footnote  Liv ii  Oros ii W

Thus was it fitting that He should work who foresaw all things from
the beginning and ordained them in the beauty of His order so that
He who when made visible was to show forth miracles for the sake of
things invisible should whilst invisible also show forth miracles
for the sake of things visible


VFurther whoever works for the good of the state works with Right
as his end This may be shown as follows Right is that proportion of
man to man as to things and as to persons which when it is
preserved preserves society and when it is destroyed destroys
society The description of Right in the Digest does not give the
essence of right but only describes it for practical purposes
If therefore our definition comprehends well the essence and reason
of Right and if the end of any society is the common good of its
members it is necessary that the end of all Right is the common good
and it is impossible that that can be Right which does not aim at the
common good Therefore Cicero says well in the first book of his
Rhetoric Laws must always be interpreted for the good of the
state If laws do not aim at the good of those who live under
them they are laws only in name in reality they cannot be laws For
it behoves them to bind men together for the common good and Seneca
therefore says well in his book on the four virtues Law is the
bond of human society It is therefore plain that whoever aims
at the good of the state aims at the end of Right and therefore if
the Romans aimed at the good of the state we shall say truly that
they aimed at the end of Right

That in bringing the whole world into subjection they aimed at this
good their deeds declare They renounced all selfishness a thing
always contrary to the public weal they cherished universal peace and
liberty and that sacred pious and glorious people are seen to have
neglected their own private interests that they might follow public
objects for the good of all mankind Therefore was it well written
The Roman Empire springs from the fountain of piety

Footnote  Romanum imperium de fonte nascitur
pietatisWITTE He has not been able to trace the saying

But seeing that nothing is known of the intention of an agent who acts
by free choice to any but the agent himself save only by external
signs and since reasonings must be examined according to the subject
matter as has already been said it will be sufficient on this point
if we set forth proofs which none can doubt of the intention of the
Roman people both in their public bodies and individually

Concerning those public bodies by which men seem in a way to be bound
to the state the authority of Cicero alone in the second book of the
De Officiis will suffice So long he says as the Empire of the
republic was maintained not by injustice but by the benefits which it
conferred we fought either for our allies or for the Empire Our wars
brought with them an ending which was either indulgent or else was
absolutely necessary All kings peoples and nations found a port of
refuge in the Senate Our magistrates and generals alike sought renown
by defending our provinces and our allies with good faith and with
justice Our government might have been called not so much Empire as
a Protectorate of the whole world So wrote Cicero

Footnote  De Off ii W

Of individuals I will speak shortly Shall we not say that they
intended the common good who by hard toil by poverty by exile by
bereavement of their children by loss of limb by sacrifice of their
lives endeavoured to build up the public weal Did not great
Cincinnatus leave us a sacred example of freely laying down his office
at its appointed end when as Livy tells us he was taken from the
plough and made dictator And after his victory after his triumph he
gave back his Imperators sceptre to the consuls and returned to the
ploughshare to toil after his oxen Well did Cicero arguing
against Epicurus in the volume De Finibus speak in praise of him
mindful of this good deed And so he says our ancestors took
Cincinnatus from the plough and made him dictator

Footnote  Liv vi   Oros ii W

Footnote  II W

Has not Fabricius left us a lofty example of resisting avarice when
poor man as he was for the faith by which he was bound to the
republic he laughed to scorn the great weight of gold which was
offered him and refused it scorning it with words which became him
well His story too is confirmed by our poet in the sixth
neid where he speaks of Fabricius strong in his poverty

Footnote  VI W

Has not Camillus left us a memorable example of obeying the laws
instead of seeking our private advantage For according to Livy he was
condemned to exile and then after that he had delivered his country
from the invaders and had restored to Rome her own Roman spoils he
yet turned to leave the sacred city though the whole people bade him
stay nor did he return till leave was given him to come back by the
authority of the Senate This highsouled hero also is commended in
the sixth neid where our poet speaks of Camillus that restored
to us our standards

Footnote  Liv v  n vi W

Was not Brutus the first to teach that our sons that all others are
second in importance to the liberty of our country For Livy tells us
how when he was consul he condemned his own sons to death for that
they had conspired with the enemy His glory is made new in our poets
sixth book where he sings how The father shall summon the sons to
die for the sake of fair liberty when they seek to stir fresh
wars

Footnote  n vi W

Has not Mucius encouraged us to dare everything for our countrys
sake when after attacking Porsenna unawares he watched the hand
which had missed its stroke being burnt though it was his own as if
he were beholding the torment of a foe This also Livy witnesses to
with astonishment

Add to these those sacred victims the Decii who laid down their lives
by an act of devotion for the public safety whom Livy glorifies in
his narrative not as they deserve but as he was able Add to these
the selfsacrifice which words cannot express of Marcus Cato that
staunchest champion of true liberty These were men of whom the one
that he might save his country did not fear the shadow of death
while the other that he might kindle in the world the passionate love
of liberty showed how dear was liberty choosing to pass out of life
a free man rather than without liberty to abide in life The
glory of all these heroes glows afresh in the words of Cicero in his
book De Finibus of the Decii he speaks thus Publius Decius the
head of the Decii a consul when he devoted himself for the state
and charged straight into the Latin host was he thinking aught of his
pleasure where and when he should take itwhen he knew that he had
to die at once and sought that death with more eager desire than
according to Epicurus we should seek pleasure And were it not that
his deed had justly received its praise his son would not have done
the like in his fourth consulship nor would his grandson again in
the war with Pyrrhus have fallen a consul in battle and a third
time in continuous succession in that family have offered himself a
victim for the commonwealth But in the De Officiis Cicero
says of Cato Marcus Cato was in no different position from his
comrades who in Africa surrendered to Csar The others had they
slain themselves would perhaps have been blamed for the act for
their life was of less consequence and their principles were not
so strict But for Cato to whom nature had given incredible firmness
and who had strengthened this severity by his unremitting constancy to
his principles and who never formed a resolution by which he did not
abide he was indeed bound to die rather than to look on the face of a
tyrant

VITwo things therefore have been made clear first that whoever
aims at the good of the state aims at right and secondly that
the Roman people in bringing the world into subjection aimed at the
public weal Therefore let us argue thus Whoever aims at right walks
according to right the Roman people in bringing the world into
subjection aimed at right as we have made manifest in the preceding
chapter Therefore in bringing the world into subjection the Roman
people acted according to right consequently it was by right that
they assumed the dignity of Empire

Footnote  Finem juris intendit

We reach this conclusion on grounds which are manifest to all It is
manifest from this that whosoever aims at right walks according to
right To make this clear we must mark that everything is made to
gain a certain end otherwise it would be in vain and as we said
before this cannot be And as everything has its proper end so every
end has some distinct thing of which it is the end And therefore it
is impossible that any two things spoken of as separate things
and in so far as they are two should have the same end as their aim
for so the same absurdity would follow that one of them would
exist in vain Since then there is a certain end of right as we
have explained it necessarily follows that when we have decided what
that end is we have also decided what right is for it is the natural
and proper effect of right And since in any sequence it is impossible
to have an antecedent without its consequent for instance to have
man without animal as is evident by putting together and taking
to pieces the idea so also it is impossible to seek for the end
of right without right for each thing stands in the same relation to
its proper end as the consequent does to its antecedent as without
health it is impossible to attain to a good condition of the body
Wherefore it is most evidently clear that he who aims at the end of
right must aim in accordance with right nor does the contradictory
instance which is commonly drawn from Aristotles treatment of good
counsel avail anything He there says It is possible to obtain
what is the right result from a syllogism which is incorrect but not
by an argument which is right for the middle term is wrong For if
sometimes a right conclusion is obtained from false principles this
is only by accident and happens only in so far as the true conclusion
is imported in the words of the inference Truth never really follows
from falsehood but the signs of truth may easily follow from the
signs of falsehood So also it is in matters of conduct If a thief
helps a poor man out of the spoils of his thieving we must not call
that charity but it is an action which would have the form of
charity if it had been done out of the mans own substance And so of
the end of right If anything such as the end of right were gained
without right it would only be the end of right that is the common
good in the same sense that the gift made from evil gains is
charity And so the example proves nothing for in our proposition we
speak not of the apparent but of the real end of right What was
sought therefore is clear

VIIWhat nature has ordained is maintained of right For nature in
its providence does not come short of mens providence for if it were
to come short the effect would excel the cause in goodness which is
impossible But we see that when public bodies are founded not only
are the relations of the members to each other considered but also
their capacities for exercising offices and this is to consider the
end of right in the society or order which is founded for right is
not extended beyond what is possible Nature then in her ordinances
does not come short in this foresight Therefore it is clear that
nature in ordaining a thing has regard to its capacities and this
regard is the fundamental principle of right which nature lays down
From this it follows that the natural order of things cannot be
maintained without right for this fundamental principle of right is
inseparably joined to the natural order of things It is necessary
therefore that it is of right that this order is preserved

The Roman people was ordained for empire by nature and this may be
shown as follows The man would come short of perfection in his art
who aimed only to produce his ultimate form and neglected the means
of reaching it in the same way if nature only aimed at reproducing
in the world the universal form of the divine likeness and neglected
the means of doing so she would be imperfect But nature which is
the work of the divine intelligence is wholly perfect she therefore
aims at all the means by which her final end is arrived at

Since then mankind has a certain end and since there is a certain
means necessary for the universal end of nature it necessarily
follows that nature aims at obtaining that means And therefore the
Philosopher in the second book of Natural Learning well shows
that nature always acts for the end And since nature cannot reach
this end through one man because that there are many actions
necessary to it which need many to act therefore nature must produce
many men and set them to act And besides the higher influence
the powers and properties of inferior spheres contribute much to this
And therefore we see not only that individual men but also that
certain races are born to govern and certain others to be governed
and to serve as the Philosopher argues in the Politics and
for the latter as he himself says subjection is not only expedient
but just even though they be forced into subjection

Footnote  Arist Phys Ausc ii W

Footnote  Ie of the heavens Witte quotes Parad viii 
Purg xiv 

Footnote  I    W

And if this is so it cannot be doubted that nature ordained in the
world a country and a nation for universal sovereignty if this were
not so she would have been untrue to herself which is impossible
But as to where that country is and which is that nation it is
sufficiently manifest both from what we have said and from what we
shall say that it was Rome and her citizens or people and this our
poet very skilfully touches on in the sixth neid where he
introduces Anchises prophesying to neas the ancestor of the Romans
Others may mould the breathing bronze more delicatelyI doubt it
not they may chisel from marble the living countenance they may
surpass thee in pleading causes they may track the course of the
heavens with the rod and tell when the stars will rise but thou
Roman remember to rule the nations with thy sway These shall be thy
endowmentsto make peace to be the custom of the world to spare thy
foes when they submit and to crush the proud And again Virgil
skilfully notes the appointment of the place in the fourth
neid when he brings in Jupiter speaking to Mercury concerning
neas His fair mother did not promise him to us to be such as this
it was not for this that twice she rescues him from Grecian arms but
that there should be one to rule over Italy teeming with empires
tempestuous with wars It has therefore sufficiently been shown
that the Roman people was by nature ordained to empire Therefore it
was of right that they gained empire by subduing to themselves the
world

Footnote  n vi  iv W


VIIIBut in order properly to discover the truth in our inquiry we
must recognise that the judgment of God is sometimes made manifest to
men and sometimes hidden from them

It may be made manifest in two ways namely by reason and by faith

There are some judgments of God to which the human reason by its own
paths can arrive as that a man should risk death to save his
country For a part should always risk itself to save its whole and
each man is a part of his State as is clear from the Philosopher in
his Politics Therefore every man ought to risk himself for his
country as the less good for the better whence the Philosopher says
to Nicomachus The end is desirable indeed even for an individual
but it is better and more divine for a nation and State And
this is the judgment of God for if it were not so right reason in
men would miss the intention of nature which is impossible

Footnote  Arist Pol i  W

Footnote  Ethics i 

There are also some judgments of God to which though human reason
cannot reach them by its own powers yet by the aid of faith in those
things which are told us in Holy Scripture it can be lifted up as
for instance that no one however perfect he may be in moral and
intellectual virtues both in habit and in action can be saved
without faith it being supposed that he never heard aught of Christ
For human reason cannot of itself see this to be just yet by faith it
can For in the Epistle to the Hebrews it is written without faith
it is impossible to please God and in Leviticus what man
soever there be of the House of Israel that killeth an ox or lamb or
goat in the camp or that killeth it out of the camp and bringeth it
not to the door of the tabernacle to offer an offering unto the Lord
blood shall be imputed to that man The door of the tabernacle
stands for Christ who is the door of the kingdom of heaven as may be
proved from the Gospel the killing of animals represents mens
actions

Footnote  Cf Parad xix W

Footnote  Heb ii  Levit xvii  W

Footnote  Witte quotes from Isidore of Seville a writer much
used in the middle ages the following In a moral sense we offer a
calf when we conquer the pride of the flesh a lamb when we correct
our irrational impulses a kid when we master impurity a dove when
we are simple a turtledove when we observe chastity unleavened
bread when we keep the feast not in the leaven of malice but in the
unleavened bread of sincerity and truth

But the judgment of God is a hidden one when man cannot arrive at the
knowledge of it either by the law of nature or by the written law but
only occasionally by a special grace This grace comes in several
ways sometimes by simple revelation sometimes by revelation assisted
by a certain kind of trial or debate Simple revelation too is of
two kinds either God gives it of his own accord or it is gained by
prayer God gives it of his own accord in two ways either plainly or
by a sign His judgment against Saul was revealed to Samuel plainly
but it was by a sign that it was revealed to Pharaoh what God had
judged touching the setting free of the children of Israel The
judgment of God is also given in answer to prayer as he knew who
spoke in the second book of Chronicles When we know not what we
ought to do this only have we left to direct our eyes to Thee

Footnote   Chron xx  Vulg

Revelation by means of trial is also of two kinds It is given either
by casting lots or by combat for to strive certare is derived
from a phrase which means to make certain certum facere It is
clear that the judgment of God is sometimes revealed to men by casting
lots as in the substitution of Matthias in the Acts of the Apostles

Again the judgment of God is revealed to men by combat in two ways
either it is by a trial of strength as in the duels of champions who
are called duelliones or it is by the contention of many men
each striving to reach a certain mark first as happens in the
contests of athletes who run for a prize The first of these methods
was prefigured among the Gentiles by the contests between Hercules and
Antus which Lucan mentions in the fourth book of his Pharsalia
and Ovid in the ninth book of his Metamorphoses The second is
prefigured by the contest between Atalanta and Hippomenes described
in the tenth book of Ovids Metamorphoses

Footnote  Phars iv  Metam ix  x W

Moreover it ought not to pass unnoticed concerning these two kinds of
strife that while in the first each champion may fairly hinder his
antagonist in the second this is not so for athletes must not hinder
one another in their strife though our poet seems to have thought
differently in the fifth neid where Euryalus so receives the
prize But Cicero has done better in forbidding this practice in
the third book of the De Officiis following the opinion of
Chrysippus He there says Chrysippus is right here as he often
is for he says that he who runs in a race should strive with all his
might to win but in no way should he try to trip up his competitor

Footnote  V W

Footnote  III W

With these distinctions then we may assume that there are two ways
in which men may learn the judgment of God as we have on this point
stated first by the contests of athletes and secondly by the
contests of champions These ways of discovering the judgment of God I
will treat of in the chapter following


IXThat people then which conquered when all were striving hard for
the Empire of the world conquered by the will of God For God cares
more to settle a universal strife than a particular one and even in
particular contests the athletes sometimes throw themselves on the
judgment of God according to the common proverb To whom God makes
the grant him let Peter also bless It cannot then be
doubted that the victory in the strife for the Empire of the world
followed the judgment of God The Roman people when all were striving
for the Empire of the world conquered it will be plain that so it
was if we consider the prize or goal and those who strove for it
The prize or goal was the supremacy over all men for it is this that
we call the Empire None reached this but the Roman people Not only
were they the first they were the only ones to reach the goal as we
shall shortly see

Footnote  Witte only gives a query  The saying expresses the
Ghibelline view of the relation of the Empire to the Pope it may have
originated with the coronation of Charles the Great

The first man who panted for the prize was Ninus King of the
Assyrians but although for more than ninety years as Orosius
tells he with his royal consort Semiramis strove for the
Empire of the world and made all Asia subject to himself nevertheless
he never subdued the West Ovid mentions both him and his queen in the
fourth book of the Metamorphoses when he says in the story of
Pyramus Semiramis girdled the round space with brickbuilt
walls and let them come to Ninus tomb and hide beneath in its
shade

Footnote  I W

Footnote  Metam iv  W

Secondly Vesoges King of Egypt aspired to this prize but though he
vexed the North and South of Asia as Orosius relates yet he
never gained for himself onehalf of the world nay when as it
were between the judges and the goal the Scythians drove him
back from his rash enterprise

Footnote  Oros i W

Footnote  Athlothet The judges or umpires in the Greek games
whose seats were opposite to the goal at the side of the stadium
Vide Smiths Dictionary of Antiquities sv stadium

Then Cyrus King of the Persians made the same attempt but after the
destruction of Babylon and the transference of its Empire to Persia
he did not even reach the regions of the West but lost his life and
his object in one day at the hands of Tamiris Queen of the
Scythians

Footnote  Oros ii W

But after that these had failed Xerxes the son of Darius and king
among the Persians assailed the world with so great a multitude of
nations with so great a power that he bridged the channel of the sea
which separates Asia from Europe between Sestos and Abydos And of
this wonderful work Lucan makes mention in the second book of his
Pharsalia Such paths across the seas made by Xerxes in his
pride fame tells of But finally he was miserably repulsed from his
enterprise and could not attain the goal

Footnote  Phars ii W

Besides these kings and after their times Alexander King of
Macedon came nearest of all to the prize of monarchy he sent
ambassadors to the Romans to demand their submission but before the
Roman answer came he fell in Egypt as Livy tells us as it were
in the middle of the course Of his burial there Lucan speaks in the
eighth book of his Pharsalia where he is inveighing against
Ptolemy King of Egypt Thou last of the Lagan race soon to perish
in thy degeneracy and to yield thy kingdom to an incestuous sister
while for thee the Macedonian is kept in the sacred cave

Footnote  Not Livy Cf ix   where speaking of Alexander
and the Romans he says Quem ne fam quidem illis notum arbitror
fuisse The story is Greek in origin coming from Cleitarchus

Rome lect  Grote History of Greece vol xii p  note

Footnote  VIII 

Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God
Who will not marvel at thee here For when Alexander was trying to
hinder his Roman competitor in the race thou didst suddenly snatch
him away from the contest that his rashness might proceed no further

But that Rome has won the crown of so great a victory is proved on the
testimony of many Our poet in his first neid says Hence
surely shall one day the Romans come as the years roll on to be the
leaders of the world from the blood of Teucer renewed over the sea
and over the land they shall hold full sway And Lucan in his
first book writes The sword assigns the kingdom and the fortune of
that mighty people that rules oer sea and land and the whole earth
admitted not two to rule And Boethius in his second book
speaking of the Roman prince says With his sceptre he ruled the
nations those whom Phoebus beholds from his rising afar to where
he sinks his beams beneath the waves those who are benumbed by the
frosty Seven Stars of the north those whom the fierce south wind
scorches with his heat parching the burning sands And Luke the
Scribe of Christ bears the same testimony whose every word is true
where he says There went out a decree from Csar Augustus that all
the world should be taxed from which words we must plainly
understand that the Romans had jurisdiction over the whole world

Footnote  I W

Footnote  I W

Footnote  De Consol Phil ii W

From all this evidence it is manifest that the Roman people prevailed
when all were striving to gain the Empire of the world Therefore it
was by the judgment of God that it prevailed consequently its Empire
was gained by the judgment of God which is to say that it was gained
by right


XAnd what is gained as the result of single combat or duel is
gained of right For whenever human judgment fails either because it
is involved in the clouds of ignorance or because it has not the
assistance of a judge then lest justice should be left deserted we
must have recourse to Him who loved justice so much that He died to
fulfil what it required by shedding His own blood Therefore the
Psalmist wrote The righteous Lord loveth righteousness This result
is gained when by the free consent of the parties not from hatred
but from love of justice men inquire of the judgment of God by a
trial of strength as well of soul as of body And this trial of
strength is called a duel because in the first instance it was
between two combatants man to man

But when two nations quarrel they are bound to try in every possible
way to arrange the quarrel by means of discussion it is only when
this is hopeless that they may declare war Cicero and Vegetius agree
on this point the former in his De Officiis the latter in his
book on war In the practice of medicine recourse may only be had to
amputation and cauterising when every other means of cure have been
tried So in the same way it is only when we have sought in vain for
all other modes of deciding a quarrel that we may resort to the remedy
of a single combat forced thereto by a necessity of justice

Footnote  De Off i  De Re Milit iii prolW

Two formal rules then of the single combat are clear one which we
have just mentioned the other which we touched on before that the
combatants or champions must enter the lists by common consent not
animated by private hatred or love but simply by an eager desire for
justice Therefore Cicero in touching on this matter spoke well when
he said Wars which are waged for the crown of empire must be waged
without bitterness

Footnote  Imperii gloria not corona in Cic de Off
i W

But if the rules of single combat be kept when men are driven by
justice to meet together by common consent in their zeal for justice
and if they are not the contest ceases to be a single combat do
not they meet together in the name of God And if it is so is not God
in the midst of them for He Himself promises us this in the Gospel
And if God is there is it not impious to suppose that justice can
failthat justice which He loved so much as we have just seen And
if single combat cannot fail to secure justice is not what is gained
in single combat gained as of right

This truth the Gentiles too recognised before the trumpet of the
Gospel was sounded when they sought for a judgment in the fortune of
single combat So Pyrrhus noble both in the manners and in the blood
of acid gave a worthy answer when the Roman envoys were sent to him
to treat for the ransom of prisoners I ask not for gold ye shall
pay me no price being not warmongers but true men of war Let each
decide his fate with steel and not with gold Whether it be you or I
that our mistress wills to reign or what chance she may bring to
each let us try by valour Hear ye also this word those whose valour
the fortune of war has spared their liberty will I too spare Take ye
them as my gift So spoke Pyrrhus By mistress he meant
Fortune which we better and more rightly call the Providence of God
Therefore let the combatants beware that they fight not for money
then it would be no true single combat in which they fought for they
would strive in a court of blood and injustice and let it not be
thought that God would then be present to judge nay for it would be
that ancient enemy who had been the instigator of the strife If they
wish to be true combatants and not dealers in blood and injustice
let them keep Pyrrhus before their eyes when they enter the arena the
man who when he was striving for empire so scorned gold as we have
said

Footnote  Ennius in Cic de Off i  W Warmonger is
Spensers word FQ   

But if men will not receive the truth which we have proved and
object as they are wont that all men are not equal in strength we
will refute them with the instance of the victory of David over
Goliath and if the Gentiles seek for aught more let them repel the
objection by the victory of Hercules over Antus For it is mere folly
to fear that the strength which God makes strong should be weaker than
a human champion It is therefore now sufficiently clear that what
is acquired by single combat is acquired by right


XIBut the Roman people gained their empire by duel between man and
man and this is proved by testimonies that are worthy of all
credence and in proving this we shall also show that where any
question had to be decided from the beginning of the Roman Empire it
was tried by single combat

For first of all when a quarrel arose about the settling in Italy of
Father neas the earliest ancestor of this people and when Turnus
King of the Rutuli withstood neas it was at last agreed between the
two kings to discover the good pleasure of God by a single combat
which is sung in the last book of the neid And in this combat
neas was so merciful in his victory that he would have granted life
and peace to the conquered foe had he not seen the belt which Turnus
had taken on slaying Pallas as the last verses of our poet describe

Again when two peoples had grown up in Italy both sprung from the
Trojan stem namely the Romans and the Albans and they had long
striven whose should be the sign of the eagle and the Penates of
Troy and the honours of empire at last by mutual consent in order
to have certain knowledge of the case in hand the three Horatii who
were brethren and the three Curatii who were also brethren fought
together before the kings and all the people anxiously waiting on
either side and since the three Alban champions were killed while
one Roman survived the palm of victory fell to the Romans in the
reign of Hostilius the king This story has been diligently put
together by Livy in the first part of his history and Orosius also
gives similar testimony

Footnote  Il sacrosanto segno V Parad vi 

Footnote  Liv i  Oros ii 

Next they fought for empire with their neighbours the Sabines and
Samnites as Livy tells us all the laws of war were kept and though
those who fought were very many in number the war was in the form of
a combat between man and man In the contest with the Samnites
Fortune nearly repented her of what she had begun as Lucan instances
in the second book of his Pharsalia How many companies lay
dead by the Colline gate then when the headship of the world and
universal empire wellnigh were transferred to other seats and the
Samnite heaped the corpses of Rome beyond the numbers of the
Caudine Forks

Footnote  II 

Footnote 

                   Romanaque Samnis
     Ultra Caudinas superavit vulnera furcas

Another reading is speravit

But after that the intestine quarrels of Italy had ceased and while
the issue of the strife with Greece and Carthage was not yet made
certain by the judgment of Godfor both Greece and Carthage aimed at
empirethen Fabricius for Rome and Pyrrhus for Greece fought with
vast hosts for the glory of empire and Rome gained the day And when
Scipio for Rome and Hannibal for Carthage fought man to man the
Africans fell before the Italians as Livy and all the other Roman
historians strive to tell

Who then is so dull of understanding as not to see that this glorious
people has won the crown of all the world by the decision of combat
Surely the Roman may repeat Pauls words to Timothy There is laid up
for me a crown of righteousness laid up that is in the eternal
providence of God Let then the presumptuous Jurists see how far
they stand below that watchtower of reason whence the mind of man
regards these principles and let them be silent content to show
forth counsel and judgment according to the meaning of the law

It has now become manifest that it was by combat of man against man
that the Romans gained their empire therefore it was by right that
they gained it and this is the principal thesis of the present book
Up to this point we have proved our thesis by arguments which mostly
rest on principles of reason we must now make our point clear by
arguments based on the principles of the Christian faith


XIIFor it is they who profess to be zealous for the faith of Christ
who have chiefly raged together and imagined a vain thing against
the Roman empire men who have no compassion on the poor of Christ
whom they not only defraud as to the revenues of the Church but the
very patrimonies of the Church are daily seized upon and the Church
is made poor while making a show of justice they yet refuse to allow
the minister of justice to fulfil his office

Nor does this impoverishment happen without the judgment of God For
their possessions do not afford help to the poor to whom belongs as
their patrimony the wealth of the Church and these possessions are
held without gratitude to the empire which gives them Let these
possessions go back to whence they came They came well their return
is evil for they were well given and they are mischievously held
What shall we say to shepherds like these What shall we say when the
substance of the Church is wasted while the private estates of their
own kindred are enlarged But perchance it is better to proceed with
what is set before us and in religious silence to wait for our
Saviours help

I say then that if the Roman empire did not exist by right Christ
in being born presupposed and sanctioned an unjust thing But the
consequent is false therefore the contradictory of the antecedent is
true for it is always true of contradictory propositions that if one
is false the other is true It is not needful to prove the falsity of
the consequent to a true believer for if he be faithful he will
grant it to be false and if he be not faithful then this reasoning
is not for him

I prove the consequence thus wherever a man of his own free choice
carries out a public order he countenances and persuades by his act
the justice of that order and seeing that acts are more forcible to
persuade than words as Aristotle holds in the tenth book of his
Ethics therefore by this he persuades us more than if it were
merely an approval in words But Christ as Luke who writes His
story says willed to be born of the Virgin Mary under an edict of
Roman authority so that in that unexampled census of mankind the Son
of God made man might be counted as man and this was to carry out
that edict Perhaps it is even more religious to suppose that it was
of God that the decree issued through Csar so that He who had been
such long years expected among men should Himself enroll himself with
mortal man

Footnote  Eth x 

Therefore Christ by His action enforced the justice of the edict of
Augustus who then wielded the Roman power And since to issue a just
edict implies jurisdiction it necessarily follows that He who showed
that He thought an edict just must also have showed that He thought
the jurisdiction under which it was issued just but unless it existed
by right it were unjust

And it must be noted that the force of the argument taken to destroy
the consequent though the argument partly holds from its form shows
its force in the second figure if it be reduced as a syllogism just
as the argument based on the assumption of the antecedent is in the
first figure The reduction is made thus all that is unjust is
persuaded to men unjustly Christ did not persuade us unjustly
therefore He did not persuade us to do unjust things From the
assumption of the antecedent thus all injustice is persuaded to men
unjustly Christ persuaded a certain injustice to man therefore He
persuaded unjustly


XIIIAnd if the Roman empire did not exist by right the sin of Adam
was not punished in Christ This is false therefore its contradictory
is true The falsehood of the consequent is seen thus Since by the
sin of Adam we were all sinners as the Apostle saysWherefore as
by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death
passed upon all men for that all have sinnedthen if Christ had
not made satisfaction for Adams sin by his death we should still by
our depraved nature be the children of wrath But this is not so for
Paul speaking of the Father in his Epistle to the Ephesians says
Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
to Himself according to the good pleasure of His will to the praise
of the glory of His grace wherein He hath made us accepted in the
beloved in whom we have redemption by His blood the forgiveness of
sins according to the riches of His grace wherein He has abounded
towards us And Christ Himself suffering in Himself the punishment
says in St John It is finished for where a thing is finished
naught remains to be done

It is convenient that it should be understood that punishment is not
merely penalty inflicted on him who has done wrong but that penalty
inflicted by one who has penal jurisdiction And therefore a penalty
should not be called punishment but rather injury except where it is
inflicted by the sentence of a regular judge Therefore the
Israelites said unto Moses Who made thee a judge over us

Footnote  Ab ordinario judice

If therefore Christ had not suffered by the sentence of a regular
judge the penalty would not properly have been punishment and none
could be a regular judge who had not jurisdiction over all mankind
for all mankind was punished in the flesh of Christ who hath borne
our griefs and carried our sorrows as saith the Prophet Isaiah And
if the Roman empire had not existed by right Tiberius Csar whose
vicar was Pontius Pilate would not have had jurisdiction over all
mankind It was for this reason that Herod not knowing what he did
like Caiaphas when he spoke truly of the decree of heaven sent
Christ to Pilate to be judged as Luke relates in his gospel For
Herod was not the vicegerent of Tiberius under the standard of the
eagle or the standard of the Senate but only a king with one
particular kingdom given him by Tiberius and ruling the kingdom
committed to his charge under Tiberius

Let them cease then to insult the Roman empire who pretend that
they are the sons of the Church when they see that Christ the
bridegroom of the Church sanctioned the Roman empire at the beginning
and at the end of His warfare on earth And now I think that I have
made it sufficiently clear that it was by right that the Romans
acquired to themselves the empire of the world

Oh happy people oh Ausonia how glorious hadst thou been if either
he that weakener of thine empire had never been born or if his own
pious intention had never deceived him

BOOK III


IHe hath shut the lions mouths and they have not hurt me
forasmuch as before Him justice was found in me At the
beginning of this work I proposed to examine into three questions
according as the subjectmatter would permit me Concerning the two
first questions our inquiry as I think has been sufficiently
accomplished in the preceding books It remains to treat of the third
question and perchance it may arouse a certain amount of
indignation against me for the truth of it cannot appear without
causing shame to certain men But seeing that truth from its
changeless throne appeals to methat Solomon too entering on the
forest of his proverbs teaches me in his own person to meditate on
truth to hate the wicked seeing that the Philosopher my
instructor in morals bids me for the sake of truth to put aside
what is dearest I will therefore take confidence from the
words of Daniel in which the power of God the shield of the defenders
of truth is set forth and according to the exhortation of St
Paul putting on the breastplate of faith and in the heat of that
coal which one of the seraphim had taken from off the altar and laid
on the lips of Isaiah I will enter on the present contest and by
the arm of Him who delivered us by His blood from the powers of
darkness drive out from the lists the wicked and the liar in the
sight of all the world Why should I fear when the Spirit which is
coeternal with the Father and the Son saith by the mouth of David
The righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance he shall not
be afraid of evil tidings

Footnote  Dan vi  VulgW

Footnote  Prov vii  VulgW

Footnote  Arist Eth i W

Footnote  Ps cxii W

The present question then concerning which we have to inquire is
between two great luminaries the Roman Pontiff and the Roman Prince
and the question is does the authority of the Roman Monarch who as
we have proved in the second book is the monarch of the world depend
immediately on God or on some minister or vicar of God by whom I
understand the successor of Peter who truly has the keys of the
kingdom of heaven


IIFor this as for the former questions we must take some
principle on the strength of which we may fashion the arguments of
the truth which is to be expounded For what does it profit to labour
even in speaking truth unless we start from a principle For the
principle alone is the root of all the propositions which are the
means of proof

Let us therefore start from the irrefragable truth that that which
is repugnant to the intention of nature is against the will of God
For if this were not true its contradictory would not be false
namely that what is repugnant to the intention of nature is not
against Gods will and if this be not false neither are the
consequences thereof false For it is impossible in consequences which
are necessary that the consequent should be false unless the
antecedent were false also

But if a thing is not against the will it must either be willed or
simply not willed just as not to hate means to love or not to
love for not to love does not mean to hate and not to will
does not mean to will not as is selfevident But if this is not
false neither will this proposition be false God wills what He does
not will than which a greater contradiction does not exist

I prove that what I say is true as follows It is manifest that God
wills the end of nature otherwise the motions of heaven would be of
none effect and this we may not say If God willed that the end
should be hindered He would will also that the hindering power should
gain its end otherwise His will would be of none effect And since
the end of the hindering power is the nonexistence of what it
hinders it would follow that God wills the nonexistence of the end
of nature which He is said to will

For if God did not will that the end should be hindered in so far as
He did not will it it would follow as a consequence to His not
willing it that He cared nought about the hindering power neither
whether it existed nor whether it did not But he who cares not for
the hindering power cares not for the thing which can be hindered
and consequently has no wish for it and when a man has no wish for a
thing he wills it not Therefore if the end of nature can be
hindered as it can it follows of necessity that God wills not the
end of nature and we reach our previous conclusion that God wills
what He does not will Our principle is therefore most true seeing
that from its contradictions such absurd results follow


IIIAt the outset we must note in reference to this third question
that the truth of the first question had to be made manifest rather to
remove ignorance than to end a dispute In the second question we
sought equally to remove ignorance and to end a dispute For there are
many things of which we are ignorant but concerning which we do not
quarrel In geometry we know not how to square the circle but we do
not quarrel on that point The theologian does not know the number of
the angels but he does not quarrel about the number The Egyptian is
ignorant of the political system of the Scythians but he does not
therefore quarrel concerning it But the truth in this third
question provokes so much quarrelling that whereas in other matters
ignorance is commonly the cause of quarrelling here quarrelling is
the cause of ignorance For this always happens where men are hurried
by their wishes past what they see by their reason in this evil bias
they lay aside the light of reason and being dragged on blindly by
their desires they obstinately deny that they are blind And
therefore it often follows not only that falsehood has its own
inheritance but that many men issue forth from their own bounds and
stray through the foreign camp where they understand nothing and no
man understands them and so they provoke some to anger and some to
scorn and not a few to laughter

Footnote  Scytharum Civilitatem Cf Arist Ethics iii 
where Greek to bouleuton is discussed and thence come the first
and the third example a little altered the Egyptian being
substituted for the Spartan

Now three classes of men chiefly strive against the truth which we are
trying to prove

First the Chief Pontiff Vicar of our Lord Jesus Christ and the
successor of Peter to whom we owe not indeed all that we owe to
Christ but all that we owe to Peter contradicts this truth urged it
may be by zeal for the keys and also other pastors of the Christian
sheepfolds and others whom I believe to be only led by zeal for our
mother the Church These all perchance from zeal and not from pride
withstand the truth which I am about to prove

But there are certain others in whom obstinate greed has extinguished
the light of reason who are of their father the devil and yet
pretend to be sons of the Church They not only stir up quarrels in
this question but they hate the name of the most sacred office of
Prince and would shamelessly deny the principles which we have laid
down for this and the previous questions

There is also a third class called Decretalists utterly without
knowledge or skill in philosophy or theology who relying entirely on
their Decretals which doubtless I think should be venerated and
hoping I believe that these Decretals will prevail disparage the
power of the Empire And no wonder for I have heard one of them
speaking of these Decretals assert shamelessly that the traditions of
the Church are the foundation of the faith May this wickedness be
taken away from the thoughts of men by those who antecedently to the
traditions of the Church have believed in Christ the Son of God
whether to come or present or as having already suffered and who
from their faith have hoped and from their hope have kindled into
love and who burning with love will the world doubts not be made
coheirs with Him

Footnote  Parad ix W

And that such arguers may be excluded once for all from the present
debate it must be noted that part of Scripture was before the
Church that part of it came with the Church and part after the
Church

Before the Church were the Old and the New Testamentthe covenant
which the Psalmist says was commanded for ever of which the Church
speaks to her Bridegroom saying Draw me after thee

Footnote  Ps cxi  Cant i W

With the Church came those venerable chief Councils with which no
faithful Christian doubts but that Christ was present For we have His
own words to His disciples when He was about to ascend into heaven
Lo I am with you always even unto the end of the world to which
Matthew testifies There are also the writings of the doctors
Augustine and others of whom if any doubt that they were aided by
the Holy Spirit either he has never beheld their fruit or if he has
beheld he has never tasted thereof

Footnote  Scriptur

After the Church are the traditions which they call Decretals
which although they are to be venerated for their apostolical
authority yet we must not doubt that they are to be held inferior to
fundamental Scripture seeing that Christ rebuked the Pharisees for
this very thing for when they had asked Why do thy disciples
transgress the tradition of the elders for they neglected the
washing of hands He answered them as Matthew testifies Why do ye
also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition Thus He
intimates plainly that tradition was to have a lower place

But if the traditions of the Church are after the Church it follows
that the Church had not its authority from traditions but rather
traditions from the Church and therefore the men of whom we speak
seeing that they have nought but traditions must be excluded from the
debate For those who seek after this truth must proceed in their
inquiry from those things from which flows the authority of the
Church

Further we must exclude others who boast themselves to be white sheep
in the flock of the Lord when they have the plumage of crows These
are the children of wickedness who that they may be able to follow
their evil ways put shame on their mother drive out their brethren
and when they have done all will allow none to judge them Why should
we seek to reason with these when they are led astray by their evil
desires and so cannot see even our first principle

Therefore there remains the controversy only with the other sort of
men who are influenced by a certain kind of zeal for their mother the
Church and yet know not the truth which is sought for With these
men thereforestrong in the reverence which a dutiful son owes to
his father which a dutiful son owes to his mother dutiful to Christ
dutiful to the Church dutiful to the Chief Shepherd dutiful to all
who profess the religion of ChristI begin in this book the contest
for the maintenance of the truth


IVThose men to whom all our subsequent reasoning is addressed when
they assert that the authority of the Empire depends on the authority
of the Church as the inferior workman depends on the architect are
moved to take this view by many arguments some of which they draw
from Holy Scripture and some also from the acts of the Supreme
Pontiff and of the Emperor himself Moreover they strive to have some
proof of reason

For in the first place they say that God according to the book of
Genesis made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and
the lesser light to rule the night this they understand to be an
allegory for that the lights are the two powers the spiritual
and the temporal And then they maintain that as the moon which is
the lesser light only has light so far as she receives it from the
sun so the temporal power only has authority as it receives authority
from the spiritual power

Footnote  Regimina

For the disposing of these and of other like arguments we must
remember the Philosophers words in his book on Sophistry the
overthrow of an argument is the pointing out of the mistake

Footnote  Soph El ii W

Error may arise in two ways either in the matter or in the form of
an argument either that is by assuming to be true what is false or
by transgressing the laws of the syllogism The Philosopher raised
objections to the arguments of Parmenides and Melissus on both of
these grounds saying that they accepted what was false and that they
did not argue correctly I use false in a large sense as
including the inconceivable that which in matters admitting only
of probability has the nature of falseness If the error is in the
form of an argument he who wishes to destroy the error must do so by
showing that the laws of the syllogism have been transgressed If the
error is in the matter it is because something has been assumed
which is either false in itself or false in relation to that
particular instance If the assumption is false in itself the
argument must be destroyed by destroying the assumption if it is
false only in that particular instance we must draw a distinction
between the falseness in that particular instance and its general
truth

Footnote  Aristotle Phys i W

Footnote  Inopinabili

Having noted these things to make it more clear how we destroy this
and the further fallacies of our adversaries we must remark that
there are two ways in which error may arise concerning the mystical
sense either by seeking it where it is not or by accepting it in a
sense other than its real sense

On account of the first of these ways Augustine says in his work Of
the City of God that we must not think that all things of
which we are told have a special meaning for it is on account of
that which means something that that also which means nothing is
woven into a story It is only with the ploughshare that we turn up
the earth but the other parts of the plough are also necessary

Footnote  Dante does not quote St Augustines words but gives
his meaning xvii W

On account of the second way in which error touching the
interpretation of mysteries may arise Augustine in his book
concerning Christian doctrine speaking of those who wish to find
in Scripture something other than he who wrote the Scripture
meant says that such are misled in the same way as a man who
leaves the straight path and then arrives at the end of the path by a
long circuit And he adds It ought to be shown that this is a
mistake lest through the habit of going out of the way the man be
driven to going into cross or wrong ways And then he intimates why
such precautions must be taken in interpreting Scripture Faith will
falter if the authority of Scripture be not sure But I say that if
these things happen from ignorance we must pardon those who do them
when we have carefully reproved them as we pardon those who imagine a
lion in the clouds and are afraid But if they are done purposely we
must deal with those who err thus as we do with tyrants who instead
of following the laws of the state for the public good try to pervert
them for their own advantage

Footnote  I   Dante writes per gyrum The Benedictine
text has per agrum

Oh worst of crimes even though a man commit it in his dreams to turn
to ill use the purpose of the Eternal Spirit Such an one does not sin
against Moses or David or Job or Matthew or Paul but against the
Eternal Spirit that speaketh in them For though the reporters of the
words of God are many yet there is one only that tells them what to
write even God who has deigned to unfold to us His will through the
pens of many writers

Having thus first noted these things I will proceed as I said above
to destroy the argument of those who say that the two great lights are
typical of the two great powers on earth for on this type rests the
whole strength of their argument It can be shown in two ways that
this interpretation cannot be upheld First seeing that these two
kinds of power are in a sense accidents of men God would thus
appear to have used a perverted order by producing the accidents
before the essence to which they belong existed and it is ridiculous
to say this of God For the two great lights were created on the
fourth day while man was not created till the sixth day as is
evident in the text of Scripture

Secondly seeing that these two kinds of rule are to guide men to
certain ends as we shall see it follows that if man had remained in
the state of innocence in which God created him he would not have
needed such means of guidance These kinds of rule then are remedies
against the weakness of sin Since then man was not a sinner on the
fourth day for he did not then even exist it would have been idle to
make remedies for his sin and this would be contrary to the goodness
of God For he would be a sorry physician who would make a plaster
for an abscess which was to be before the man was born It cannot
therefore be said that God made these two kinds of rule on the fourth
day and therefore the meaning of Moses cannot have been what these
men pretend

We may also be more tolerant and overthrow this falsehood by drawing
a distinction This way of distinction is a gentler way of treating an
adversary for so his arguments are not made to appear consciously
false as is the case when we utterly overthrow him I say then that
although the moon has not light of its own abundantly unless it
receives it from the sun yet it does not therefore follow that the
moon is from the sun Therefore be it known that the being and the
power and the working of the moon are all different things For its
being the moon in no way depends on the sun nor for its power nor
for its working considered in itself Its motion comes from its
proper mover its influence is from its own rays For it has a certain
light of its own which is manifest at the time of an eclipse though
for its better and more powerful working it receives from the sun an
abundant light which enables it to work more powerfully

Therefore I say that the temporal power does not receive its being
from the spiritual power nor its power which is its authority nor
its working considered in itself Yet it is good that the temporal
power should receive from the spiritual the means of working more
effectively by the light of the grace which the benediction of the
Supreme Pontiff bestows on it both in heaven and on earth Therefore
we may see that the argument of these men erred in its form because
the predicate of the conclusion is not the predicate of the major
premiss The argument runs thus The moon receives her light from the
sun which is the spiritual power The temporal power is the moon
Therefore the temporal power receives authority from the spiritual
power Light is the predicate of the major premiss authority the
predicate of the conclusion which two things we have seen to be very
different in their subject and in their idea


VThey draw another argument from the text of Moses saying that the
types of these two powers sprang from the loins of Jacob for that
they are prefigured in Levi and Judah whereof one was founder of the
spiritual power and the other of the temporal From this they argue
the Church has the same relation to the Empire that Levi had to Judah
Levi preceded Judah in his birth therefore the Church precedes the
Empire in authority

This error is easily overthrown For when they say that Levi and
Judah the sons of Jacob are the types of spiritual and temporal
power I could show this argument too to be wholly false but I will
grant it to be true Then they infer as Levi came first in birth so
does the Church come first in authority But as in the previous
argument the predicates of the conclusion and of the major premiss
are different authority and birth are different things both in their
subject and in their idea and therefore there is an error in the form
of the argument The argument is as follows A precedes B in C D and
E stand in the same relation as A and B therefore D precedes E in F
But then F and C are different things And if it is objected that F
follows from C that is authority from priority of birth and that
the effect is properly substituted for the cause as if animal were
used in an argument for men the objection is bad For there are many
men who were born before others who not only do not precede those
others in authority but even come after them as is plain where we
find a bishop younger than his archpresbyters Therefore their
objection appears to err in that it assumes as a cause that which is
none


VIAgain from the first book of Kings they take the election and
the deposition of Saul and they say that Saul an enthroned king was
deposed by Samuel who by Gods command acted in the stead of God
as appears from the text of Scripture From this they argue that as
that Vicar of God had authority to give temporal power and to take it
away and bestow it on another so now the Vicar of God the bishop of
the universal Church has authority to give the sceptre of temporal
power and to take it away and even to give it to another And if
this were so it would follow without doubt that the authority of the
Empire is dependent on the Church as they say

But we may answer and destroy this argument by which they say that
Samuel was the Vicar of God for it was not as Vicar of God that he
acted but as a special delegate for this purpose or as a messenger
bearing the express command of his Lord For it is clear that what God
commanded him that only he did and that only he said

Therefore we must recognise that it is one thing to be anothers
vicar and that it is another to be his messenger or minister just as
it is one thing to be a doctor and another to be an interpreter For
a vicar is one to whom is committed jurisdiction with law or with
arbitrary power and therefore within the bounds of the jurisdiction
which is committed to him he may act by law or by his arbitrary power
without the knowledge of his lord It is not so with a mere messenger
in so far as he is a messenger but as the mallet acts only by the
strength of the smith so the messenger acts only by the authority of
him that sent him Although then God did this by His messenger
Samuel it does not follow that the Vicar of God may do the same For
there are many things which God has done and still does and yet will
do through angels which the Vicar of God the successor of Peter
might not do

Therefore we may see that they argue from the whole to a part thus
Men can hear and see therefore the eye can hear and see which does
not hold Were the argument negative it would be good for instance
man cannot fly therefore mans arm cannot fly And in the same way
God cannot by his messenger cause what is not to have been as
Agathon says therefore neither can his Vicar

Footnote  As quoted by Aristotle Ethics vi W


VIIFurther they use the offering of the wise men from the text of
Matthew saying that Christ accepted from them both frankincense and
gold to signify that He was lord and ruler both of things temporal
and of things spiritual and from this they infer that the Vicar of
Christ is also lord and ruler both of things temporal and of things
spiritual and that consequently he has authority over both

To this I answer that I acknowledge that Matthews words and meaning
are both as they say but that the inference which they attempt to
draw therefrom fails because it fails in the terms of the argument
Their syllogism runs thus God is the lord both of things temporal and
of things spiritual the holy Pontiff is the Vicar of God therefore
he is lord both of things temporal and of things spiritual Both of
these propositions are true but the middle term in them is different
and four terms are introduced by which the form of the syllogism is
not kept as is plain from what is said of the syllogism
simply For God is the subject of the major premiss and the
Vicar of God is the predicate of the minor and these are not the
same

Footnote  Arist Anal Prior or rather the Summul Logic
l iv of Petrus HispanusW

And if anyone raises the objection that the Vicar of God is equal in
power to God his objection is idle for no vicar whether human or
divine can be equal in power to the master whose vicar he is which
is at once obvious We know that the successor of Peter had not equal
authority with God at least in the works of nature he could not make
a clod of earth fall upwards nor fire to burn in a downward
direction by virtue of the office committed to him Nor could all
things be committed to him by God for God could not commit to any the
power of creation and of baptism as is clearly proved
notwithstanding what the Master says in his fourth book

Footnote  Peter Lombard magister sententiarum iv dist  f
W

We know also that the vicar of a mortal man is not equal in authority
to the man whose vicar he is so far as he is his vicar for none can
give away what is not his The authority of a prince does not belong
to a prince except for him to use it for no prince can give to
himself authority He can indeed receive authority and give it up
but he cannot create it in another man for it does not belong to a
prince to create another prince And if this is so it is manifest
that no prince can substitute for himself a vicar equal to himself in
authority respecting all things and therefore the objection to our
argument has no weight


VIIIThey also bring forward that saying in Matthew of Christ to
Peter Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven
and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
which also from the text of Matthew and John they allow to have been
in like manner said to all the Apostles From this they argue that it
has been granted by God to the successor of Peter to be able to bind
and to loose all things hence they infer that he can loose the laws
and decrees of the Empire and also bind laws and decrees for the
temporal power and if this were so this conclusion would rightly
follow

But we must draw a distinction touching their major premiss Their
syllogism is in this form Peter could loose and bind all things the
successor of Peter can do whatever Peter could do therefore the
successor of Peter can bind and can loose all things whence they
conclude that he can bind and can loose the decrees and the authority
of the Empire

Now I admit the minor premiss but touching the major premiss I draw a
distinction The universal everything which is included in
whatever is not distributed beyond the extent of the distributed
term If I say all animals run all is distributed so as to
include everything which comes under the class animal But if I say
all men run then all is only distributed so as to include every
individual in the class man and when I say every grammarian runs
then is the distribution even more limited

Therefore we must always look to see what it is that is to be included
in the word all and when we know the nature and extent of the
distributed term it will easily be seen how far the distribution
extends Therefore when it is said whatsoever thou shalt bind if
whatsoever bore an unlimited sense they would speak truly and the
power of the Pope would extend even beyond what they say for he might
then divorce a wife from her husband and marry her to another while
her first husband was yet alive which he can in no wise do He might
even absolve me when impenitent which God Himself cannot do

Therefore it is manifest that the distribution of the term in question
is not absolute but in reference to something What this is will be
sufficiently clear if we consider what power was granted to Peter
Christ said to Peter To thee will I give the keys of the kingdom of
heaventhat is I will make thee the doorkeeper of the kingdom of
heaven And then He adds Whatsoever which is to say all
thatto wit all that has reference to this dutythou shalt have
power to bind and to loose And thus the universal which is implied
in whatsoever has only a limited distribution referring to the
office of the keys of the kingdom of heaven And in this sense the
proposition of our opponents is true but taken absolutely it is
manifestly false I say then that although the successor of Peter
has power to bind and to loose as belongs to him to whom the office
of Peter was committed yet it does not therefore follow that he has
power to bind and to loose the decrees of the Empire as our opponents
say unless they further prove that to do so belongs to the office of
the keys which we shall shortly show is not the case


IXThey further take the words in Luke which Peter spake to Christ
saying Behold here are two swords and they understood that by
these two swords the two kinds of rule were foretold And since Peter
said here where he was which is to say with him they argue
that the authority of the two kinds of rule rests with the successor
of Peter

We must answer by showing that the interpretation on which the
argument rests is wrong They say that the two swords of which Peter
spake mean the two kinds of rule which we have spoken of but this we
wholly deny for then Peters answer would not be according to the
meaning of the words of Christ and also we say that Peter made as
was his wont a hasty answer touching only the outside of things

It will be manifest that such an answer as our opponents allege would
not be according to the meaning of the words of Christ if the
preceding words and the reason of them be considered Observe then
that these words were spoken on the day of the feast for a little
before Luke writes thus Then came the day of unleavened bread when
the Passover must be killed and at this feast Christ had spoken of
His Passion which was at hand in which it was necessary for Him to
be separated from His disciples Observe too that when these words
were spoken the twelve were assembled together and therefore shortly
after the words which we have just quoted Luke says And when the
hour was come He sat down and the twelve Apostles with Him And
continuing His discourse with them He came to this When I sent you
without purse and scrip and shoes lacked ye anything And they
said Nothing Then said He unto them But now he that hath a purse
let him take it and likewise his scrip and he that hath no sword
let him sell his garment and buy one From these words the purpose
of Christ is sufficiently manifest for He did not say Buy or get
for yourselves two swords but rather twelve swords seeing that
He spake unto twelve disciples He that hath not let him buy so
that each should have one And He said this to admonish them of the
persecution and scorn that they should suffer as though He would say
As long as I was with you men received you gladly but now you will
be driven away therefore of necessity ye must prepare for yourselves
those things which formerly I forbade you to have And therefore if
the answer of Peter bore the meaning which our opponents assign to it
it would have been no answer to the words of Christ and Christ would
have rebuked him for answering foolishly as He often did rebuke him
But Christ did not rebuke him but was satisfied saying unto him It
is enough as though He would say I speak because of the necessity
but if each one of you cannot possess a sword two are enough

And that it was Peters wont to speak in a shallow manner is proved by
his hasty and thoughtless forwardness to which he was led not only by
the sincerity of his faith but also I believe by the natural purity
and simplicity of his character All the Evangelists bear testimony to
this forwardness

Matthew writes that when Jesus had asked His disciples Whom say ye
that I am Peter answered before them all and said Thou art Christ
the Son of the living God He writes also that when Christ was saying
to His disciples that he must go up to Jerusalem and suffer many
things Peter took Him and began to rebuke Him saying Be it far
from Thee Lord this shall not be unto Thee But Christ turned and
rebuked him and said Get thee behind me Satan Matthew also
writes that in the Mount of Transfiguration on the sight of Christ
and of Moses and Elias and of the two sons of Zebedee Peter said
Lord it is good for us to be here if Thou wilt let us make here
three tabernacles one for Thee one for Moses and one for Elias He
also writes that when the disciples were in a ship in the night and
Christ went unto them walking on the sea then Peter said unto Him
Lord if it be Thou bid me come unto Thee on the water And when
Christ foretold that all His disciples should be offended because of
Him Peter answered and said Though all men shall be offended
because of Thee yet will I never be offended and then Though I
should die with Thee yet will I not deny Thee And to this saying
Mark bears witness also And Luke writes that Peter had said to
Christ a little before the words touching the swords which we have
quoted Lord I am ready to go with Thee both into prison and to
death And John says of him that when Christ wished to wash his
feet Peter answered and said Lord dost Thou wash my feet and
then Thou shalt never wash my feet The same Evangelist tells us
that it was Peter who smote the High Priests servant with a sword
and the other Evangelists also bear witness to this thing He tells us
also how Peter entered the sepulchre at once when he saw the other
disciple waiting outside and how when Christ was on the shore after
the resurrection when Peter had heard that it was the Lord he girt
his fishers coat unto him for he was naked and did cast himself
into the sea Lastly John tells that when Peter saw John he said
unto Jesus Lord and what shall this man do

It is a pleasure to have pursued this point about our Chief
Shepherd in praise of his purity of spirit but from what I have
said it is plain that when he spake of the two swords he answered the
words of Christ with no second meaning

Footnote  Archimandrita nostro Cf Parad xi  of St
FrancisW

But if we are to receive these words of Christ and of Peter typically
they must not be explained as our adversaries explain them but they
must be referred to that sword of which Matthew writes Think not
that I am come to send peace on the earth I come not to send peace
but a sword For I am come to set a man at variance against his
father c And this comes to pass not only in words but also in
fact And therefore Luke speaks to Theophilus of all that Jesus began
both to do and to teach It was a sword of that kind that Christ
commanded them to buy and Peter said that it was already doubly
there For they were ready both for words and for deeds by which they
should accomplish what Christ said that He had come to do by the
sword


XCertain persons say further that the Emperor Constantine having
been cleansed from leprosy by the intercession of Sylvester then the
Supreme Pontiff gave unto the Church the seat of Empire which was
Rome together with many other dignities belonging to the Empire
Hence they argue that no man can take unto himself these dignities
unless he receive them from the Church whose they are said to be
From this it would rightly follow that one authority depends on the
other as they maintain

Footnote  On the Donation of Constantine Witte refers to Inf

The arguments which seemed to have their roots in the Divine words
have been stated and disproved It remains to state and disprove those
which are grounded on Roman history and in the reason of mankind The
first of these is the one which we have mentioned in which the
syllogism runs as follows No one has a right to those things which
belong to the Church unless he has them from the Church and this we
grant The government of Rome belongs to the Church therefore no one
has a right to it unless it be given him by the Church The minor
premiss is proved by the facts concerning Constantine which we have
touched on

This minor premiss then will I destroy and as for their proof I say
that it proves nothing For the dignity of the Empire was what
Constantine could not alienate nor the Church receive And when they
insist I prove my words as follows No man on the strength of the
office which is committed to him may do aught that is contrary to
that office for so one and the same man viewed as one man would be
contrary to himself which is impossible But to divide the Empire is
contrary to the office committed to the Emperor for his office is to
hold mankind in all things subject to one will as may be easily seen
from the first book of this treatise Therefore it is not permitted to
the Emperor to divide the Empire If therefore as they say any
dignities had been alienated by Constantine and had passed to the
Church the coat without seamwhich even they who pierced Christ
the true God with a spear dared not rendwould have been rent

Footnote  Each side in the controversy used the type of the
seamless robe one of the Empire supr i  the other of the
Church eg in the Bull of Boniface VIII Unam Sanctam

Further just as the Church has its foundation so has the Empire its
foundation The foundation of the Church is Christ as Paul says in
his first Epistle to the Corinthians For other foundation can no man
lay than that which is laid which is Jesus Christ He is the
rock on which the Church is built but the foundation of the Empire is
human right Now I say that as the Church may not go contrary to its
foundationbut must always rest on its foundation as the words of
the Canticles say Who is she that cometh up from the desert
abounding in delights leaning on her belovedin the same way
I say that the Empire may not do aught that transgresses human right
But were the Empire to destroy itself it would so transgress human
right Therefore the Empire may not destroy itself Since then to
divide the Empire would be to destroy it because the Empire consists
in one single universal Monarchy it is manifest that he who exercises
the authority of the Empire may not destroy it and from what we have
said before it is manifest that to destroy the Empire is contrary to
human right

Footnote   Cor iii W

Footnote  Cant viii W

Moreover all jurisdiction is prior in time to the judge who has it
for it is the judge who is ordained for the jurisdiction not the
jurisdiction for the judge But the Empire is a jurisdiction
comprehending within itself all temporal jurisdiction therefore it is
prior to the judge who has it who is the Emperor For it is the
Emperor who is ordained for the Empire and not contrariwise
Therefore it is clear that the Emperor in so far as he is Emperor
cannot alter the Empire for it is to the Empire that he owes his
being I say then that he who is said to have conferred on the Church
the authority in question either was Emperor or he was not If he was
not it is plain that he had no power to give away any part of the
Empire Nor could he if he was Emperor in so far as he was Emperor
for such a gift would be a diminishing of his jurisdiction

Further if one Emperor were able to cut off a certain portion of the
jurisdiction of the Empire so could another and since temporal
jurisdiction is finite and since all that is finite is taken away by
finite diminutions it would follow that it is possible for the first
of all jurisdictions to be annihilated which is absurd

Further since he that gives is in the position of an agent and he to
whom a thing is given in that of a patient as the Philosopher holds
in the fourth book to Nicomachus therefore that a gift may be
given we require not only the fit qualification of the giver but
also of the receiver for the acts of the agent are completed in a
patient who is qualified But the Church was altogether
unqualified to receive temporal things for there is an express
command forbidding her so to do which Matthew gives thus Provide
neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses For though we
find in Luke a relaxation of the command in regard to certain matters
yet I have not anywhere been able to find that the Church after that
prohibition had licence given her to possess gold and silver If
therefore the Church was unable to receive temporal power even
granting that Constantine was able to give it yet the gift was
impossible for the receiver was disqualified It is therefore plain
that neither could the Church receive in the way of possession nor
could Constantine give in the way of alienation though it is true
that the Emperor as protector of the Church could allot to the
Church a patrimony and other things if he did not impair his supreme
lordship the unity of which does not allow division And the Vicar of
God could receive such things not to possess them but as a steward
to dispense the fruits of them to the poor of Christ on behalf of the
Church as we know the Apostles did

Footnote  Dispositio dispositus indisposita


XIOur adversaries further say that the Pope Hadrian summoned
Charles the Great to his own assistance and to that of the
Church on account of the wrongs suffered from the Lombards in the
time of their king Desiderius and that Charles received from that
Pope the imperial dignity notwithstanding that Michael was emperor at
Constantinople And therefore they say that all the Roman emperors who
succeeded Charles were themselves the advocates of the Church and
ought by the Church to be called to their office From which would
follow that dependence of the Empire on the Church which they wish to
prove

Footnote  AD W

Footnote  Advocavit

But to overset their argument I reply that what they say is nought
for a usurpation of right does not make right and if it were so it
might be proved in the same way that the Church is dependent on the
Empire for the Emperor Otto restored the Pope Leo and deposed
Benedict leading him into exile to Saxony

XIIBut from reason they thus argue they take the principle laid
down in the tenth book of Philosophia Prima saying that all
things which belong to one genus are to be brought under one head
which is the standard and measure of all that come under that genus
But all men belong to one genus therefore they are to be brought
under one head as the standard and measure of them all But the
Supreme Pontiff and the Emperor are men therefore if the preceding
reasoning be true they must be brought under one head And since the
Pope cannot come under any other man the result is that the Emperor
together with all other men must be brought under the Pope as the
measure and rule of all and then what those who argue thus desire
follows

Footnote  Arist Metaph x W

To overset this argument I answer that they are right when they say
that all the individuals of one genus ought to be brought under one
head as their measure and that they are again right when they say
that all men belong to one genus and that they are also right when
they argue from these truths that all men should be brought under one
head taken from the genus man as their measure and type But when
they obtain the further conclusion concerning the Pope and the
Emperor they fall into a fallacy touching accidental attributes

That this thing may be understood it must be clearly known that to be
a man is one thing and to be a pope or an emperor is another just as
to be a man is different from being a father or a ruler A man is that
which exists by its essential form which gives it its genus and
species and by which it comes under the category of substance But a
father is that which exists by an accidental form that is one which
stands in a certain relation which gives it a certain genus and
species and through which it comes under the category of relation If
this were not so all things would come under the category of
substance seeing that no accidental form can exist by itself without
the support of an existing substance and this is not so Seeing
therefore that the Pope and the Emperor are what they are by virtue
of certain relations for they owe their existence to the Papacy and
the Empire which are both relations one coming within the sphere of
fatherhood and the other within that of rule it manifestly follows
that both the Pope and the Emperor in so far as they are Pope and
Emperor must come under the category of relation and therefore that
they must be brought under some head of that genus

I say then that there is one standard under which they are to be
brought as men and another under which they come as Pope and
Emperor For in so far as they are men they have to be brought under
the best man whoever he be who is the measure and the ideal of all
mankind under him that is who is most one in his kind as may
be gathered from the last book to Nicomachus When however two
things are relative it is evident that they must either be
reciprocally brought under each other if they are alternately
superior or if by the nature of their relation they belong to
connected species or else they must be brought under some third
thing as their common unity But the first of these suppositions is
impossible for then both would be predicable of both which cannot
be We cannot say that the Emperor is the Pope or the Pope the
Emperor Nor again can it be said that they are connected in species
for the idea of the Pope is quite other than the idea of the Emperor
in so far as they are Pope and Emperor Therefore they must be reduced
to some single thing above them

Footnote  Ad existentem maxime unum in genere suo

Footnote  Eth x  W

Now it must be understood that the relative is to the relative as the
relation to the relation If therefore the Papacy and the Empire
seeing that they are relations of paramount superiority have to be
carried back to some higher point of superiority from which they with
the features which make them different branch off the Pope and
Emperor being relative to one another must be brought back to some
one unity in which the higher point of superiority without this
characteristic difference is found And this will be either God to
whom all things unite in looking up or something below God which is
higher in the scale of superiority while differing from the simple
and absolute superiority of God Thus it is evident that the Pope and
the Emperor in so far as they are men have to be brought under some
one head while in so far as they are Pope and Emperor they have to
be brought under another head and so far is clear as regards the
argument from reason

Footnote  Cum differentialibus suis


XIIIWe have now stated and put on one side those erroneous
reasonings on which they who assert that the authority of the Roman
Emperor depends on the Pope of Rome do most chiefly rely We have now
to go back and show forth the truth in this third question which we
proposed in the beginning to examine The truth will appear plainly
enough if I start in my inquiry from the principle which I laid down
and then show that the authority of the Empire springs immediately
from the head of all being who is God This truth will be made
manifest either if it be shown that the authority of the Empire does
not spring from the authority of the Church for there is no argument
concerning any other authority Or again if it be shown by direct
proof that the authority of the Empire springs immediately from God

We prove that the authority of the Church is not the cause of the
authority of the Empire in the following manner Nothing can be the
cause of power in another thing when that other thing has all its
power while the first either does not exist or else has no power of
action But the Empire had its power while the Church was either
not existing at all or else had no power of acting Therefore the
Church is not the cause of the power of the Empire and therefore not
of its authority either for power and authority mean the same thing
Let A be the Church B the Empire C the authority or power of the
Empire If C is in B while A does not exist A cannot be the cause of
C being in B for it is impossible for an effect to exist before its
cause Further if C is in B while A does not act it cannot be that A
is the cause of C being in B for to produce an effect it is
necessary that the cause especially the efficient cause of which we
are speaking should have been at work first The major premiss of
this argument is selfevident and the minor premiss is confirmed by
Christ and the Church Christ confirms it by His birth and His death
as we have said the Church confirms it in the words which Paul spake
to Festus in the Acts of the Apostles I stand at Csars
judgmentseat where I ought to be judged and by the words which an
angel of God spake to Paul a little afterwards Fear not Paul thou
must be brought before Csar and again by Pauls words to the Jews
of Italy But when the Jews spake against it I was constrained to
appeal unto Csar not that I had aught to accuse my nation of but
to deliver my soul from death But if Csar had not at that time had
the authority to judge in temporal matters Christ would not have
argued thus nor would the angel have brought these words nor would
he who spake of himself as having a desire to depart and to be with
Christ have made an appeal to a judge not having authority

Footnote  Non virtuante

Footnote  Incompetentem Acts xxv  xxvii  xxviii 
Phil i W

And if Constantine had not had the authority over the patronage of the
Church those things which he allotted from the Empire he could not
have had the right to allot and so the Church would be using this
gift against right whereas God wills that offerings should be pure
as is commanded in Leviticus No meat offering that ye shall bring
unto the Lord shall be made with leaven And though this command
appears to regard those who offer nevertheless it also regards those
who receive an offering For it is folly to suppose that God wishes to
be received that which He forbids to be offered for in the same book
there is a command to the Levites Ye shall not make yourselves
abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth neither shall ye
make yourselves unclean with them that ye shall be defiled
thereby But to say that the Church so misuses the patrimony
assigned to her is very unseemly therefore the premiss from which
this conclusion followed is false

Footnote  Levit ii  xi W


XIVAgain if the Church had power to bestow authority on the Roman
Prince she would have it either from God or from herself or from
some Emperor or from the universal consent of mankind or at least of
the majority of mankind There is no other crevice by which this power
could flow down to the Church But she has it not from any of these
sources therefore she has it not at all

It is manifest that she has it from none of these sources for if she
had received it from God she would have received it either by the
divine or by the natural law because what is received from nature is
received from God though the converse of this is not true But this
power is not received by the natural law for nature lays down no law
save for the effects of nature for God cannot fail in power where he
brings anything into being without the aid of secondary agents Since
therefore the Church is not an effect of nature but of God who said
Upon this rock I will build my Church and elsewhere I have
finished the work which Thou gavest me to do it is manifest that
nature did not give the Church this law

Nor was this power bestowed by the divine law for the whole of the
divine law is contained in the bosom of the Old or of the New
Testament and I cannot find therein that any thought or care for
worldly matters was commanded either to the early or to the latter
priesthood Nay I find rather such care taken away from the priests
of the Old Testament by the express command of God to Moses and
from the priests of the New Testament by the express command of Christ
to His disciples But it could not be that this care was taken
away from them if the authority of the temporal power flowed from the
priesthood for at least in giving the authority there would be an
anxious watchfulness of forethought and afterwards continued
precaution lest he to whom authority had been given should leave the
straight way

Footnote  Numbers xviii  Cf Purg xvi W

Footnote  Matt x W

Then it is quite plain that the Church did not receive this power from
herself for nothing can give what it has not Therefore all that does
anything must be such in its doing as that which it intends to do
as is stated in the book of Simple Being But it is plain that
if the Church gave to herself this power she had it not before she
gave it Thus she would have given what she had not which is
impossible

Footnote  Arist Metaph ix W

But it is sufficiently manifest from what we have previously made
evident that the Church has received not this power from any Emperor

And further that she had it not from the consent of all or even of
the greater part of mankind who can doubt seeing that not only all
the inhabitants of Asia and Africa but even the greater number of
Europeans hold the thought in abhorrence It is mere weariness to
adduce proofs in matters which are so plain


XVAgain that which is contrary to the nature of a thing cannot be
counted as one of its essential powers for the essential powers of
each individual follow on its nature in order to gain its end But
the power to grant authority in that which is the realm of our mortal
state is contrary to the nature of the Church Therefore it is
not in the number of its essential powers For the proof of the minor
premiss we must know that the nature of the Church means the form or
essence of the Church For although men use the word nature not
only of the form of a thing but also of its matter nevertheless it
is of the form that they use it more properly as is proved in the
book of Natural Learning But the essence or form of the
Church is nothing else than the life of Christ as it is contained
both in His sayings and in His deeds For His life was the example and
ideal of the militant Church especially of its pastors and above all
of its chief pastor to whom it belongs to feed the sheep and the
lambs of Christ And therefore when Christ left His life unto men for
an example He said in Johns Gospel I have given you an example that
ye should do as I have done to you And He said unto Peter specially
after that He had committed unto him the office of shepherd the words
which John also reports Peter follow me But Christ denied before
Pilate that His rule was of this sort saying My kingdom is not of
this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants
fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my
kingdom not from hence

Footnote  Virtus auctorizandi regnum nostr mortalitatis est
contra naturam Ecclesi

Footnote  Forma

Footnote  Arist Phys Ausc ii W

Footnote  John xiii  xxi  xviii W

But this saying must not be understood to mean that Christ who is
God is not the lord of this kingdom for the Psalmist says The sea
is His and He made it and His hands formed the dry land We
must understand it to mean that as the pattern of the Church He
had not the care of this kingdom It is as if a golden seal were to
speak of itself and say I am not the standard for such and such a
class of things for in so far as it is gold this saying is untrue
seeing that gold is the standard of all metals but it is true in so
far as it is a sign capable of being received by impression

Footnote  Ps xcv W

It belongs then to the very form of the Church always to speak the
same always to think the same and to do the opposite of this is
evidently contrary to its essential formthat is to say to its
nature And from this it may be collected that the power of bestowing
authority on this kingdom is contrary to the nature of the Church for
contrariety which is in thought or word follows from contrariety which
is in the thing thought and the thing said just as truth and
falsehood in speech come from the being or the notbeing of the thing
as we learn from the doctrine of the Categories It has then become
manifest enough by means of the preceding arguments by which the
contention of our opponents has been shown to lead to an absurd
result that the authority of the Empire is not in any way dependent
on the authority of the Church


XVIAlthough it has been proved in the preceding chapter that the
authority of the Empire has not its cause in the authority of the
Supreme Pontiff for we have shown that this argument led to absurd
results yet it has not been entirely shown that the authority of the
Empire depends directly upon God except as a result from our
argument For it is a consequence that if the authority comes not
from the vicar of God it must come from God Himself And therefore
for the complete determination of the question proposed we have to
prove directly that the emperor or monarch of the world stands in an
immediate relation to the King of the universe who is God

For the better comprehending of this it must be recognised that man
alone of all created things holds a position midway between things
corruptible and things incorruptible and therefore philosophers
rightly liken him to a dividing line between two hemispheres For man
consists of two essential parts namely the soul and the body If he
be considered in relation to his body only he is corruptible but if
he be considered in relation to his soul only he is incorruptible
And therefore the Philosopher spoke well concerning the incorruptible
soul when he said in the second book of the Soul It is this alone
which may be separated as being eternal from the corruptible

Footnote  In the De Causis v above i  Propos 
Intelligentia comprehendit generata et naturam et horizontem natur
scilicet animam nam ipsa est supra naturamW

Footnote  Arist De Anim ii W

If therefore man holds this position midway between the corruptible
and the incorruptible since every middle nature partakes of both
extremes man must share something of each nature And since every
nature is ordained to gain some final end it follows that for man
there is a double end For as he alone of all beings participates
both in the corruptible and the incorruptible so he alone of all
beings is ordained to gain two ends whereby one is his end in so far
as he is corruptible and the other in so far as he is incorruptible

Two ends therefore have been laid down by the ineffable providence
of God for man to aim at the blessedness of this life which consists
in the exercise of his natural powers and which is prefigured in
the earthly Paradise and next the blessedness of the life eternal
which consists in the fruition of the sight of Gods countenance and
to which man by his own natural powers cannot rise if he be not aided
by the divine light and this blessedness is understood by the
heavenly Paradise

Footnote  See Purg xxviii and Mr Longfellows note ad loc

But to these different kinds of blessedness as to different
conclusions we must come by different means For at the first we may
arrive by the lessons of philosophy if only we will follow them by
acting in accordance with the moral and intellectual virtues But at
the second we can only arrive by spiritual lessons transcending human
reason so that we follow them in accordance with the theological
virtues faith hope and charity The truth of the first of these
conclusions and of these means is made manifest by human reason
which by the philosophers has been all laid open to us The other
conclusions and means are made manifest by the Holy Spirit who by the
mouth of the Prophets and holy writers and by Jesus Christ the
coeternal Son of God and His disciples has revealed to us
supernatural truth of which we have great need Nevertheless human
passion would cast them all behind its back if it were not that men
going astray like the beasts that perish were restrained in
their course by bit and bridle like horses and mules

Footnote  Sua bestialitate vagantes V Ps xxxii 

Therefore man had need of two guides for his life as he had a twofold
end in life whereof one is the Supreme Pontiff to lead mankind to
eternal life according to the things revealed to us and the other is
the Emperor to guide mankind to happiness in this world in
accordance with the teaching of philosophy And since none or but a
few only and even they with sore difficulty could arrive at this
harbour of happiness unless the waves and blandishments of human
desires were set at rest and the human race were free to live in
peace and quiet this therefore is the mark at which he who is to care
for the world and whom we call the Roman Prince must most chiefly
aim at I mean that in this little plot of earth belonging to
mortal men life may pass in freedom and with peace And since the
order of this world follows the order of the heavens as they run
their course it is necessary to the end that the learning which
brings liberty and peace may be duly applied by this guardian of the
world in fitting season and place that this power should be dispensed
by Him who is ever present to behold the whole order of the heavens
And this is He who alone has preordained this that by it in His
providence He might bind all things together each in their own order

Footnote  Cf Parad xxii  Lajuola che ci fa tanto
feroci

But if this is so God alone elects God alone confirms for there is
none higher than God And hence there is the further conclusion that
neither those who now are nor any others who may in whatsoever way
have been called Electors ought to have that name rather they are
to be held as declarers and announcers of the providence of God And
therefore it is that they to whom is granted the privilege of
announcing Gods will sometimes fall into disagreement because that
all of them or some of them have been blinded by their evil desires
and have not discerned the face of Gods appointment

Footnote  V Hallam Middle Ages c v Bryce Roman
Empire c xiv Witte Prf p xxxiv xlv

It is therefore clear that the authority of temporal Monarchy comes
down with no intermediate will from the fountain of universal
authority and this fountain one in its unity flows through many
channels out of the abundance of the goodness of God

And now methinks I have reached the goal which I set before me I
have unravelled the truth of the questions which I asked whether the
office of Monarchy was necessary to the welfare of the world whether
it was by right that the Roman people assumed to themselves the office
of Monarchy and further that last question whether the authority
of the Monarch springs immediately from God or from some other Yet
the truth of this latter question must not be received so narrowly as
to deny that in certain matters the Roman Prince is subject to the
Roman Pontiff For that happiness which is subject to mortality in a
sense is ordered with a view to the happiness which shall not taste of
death Let therefore Csar be reverent to Peter as the firstborn
son should be reverent to his father that he may be illuminated with
the light of his fathers grace and so may be stronger to lighten the
world over which he has been placed by Him alone who is the ruler of
all things spiritual as well as temporal

WHETHER THE ROMAN PEOPLE ASSUMED TO ITSELF BY RIGHT THE DIGNITY OF
EMPIRE

CHAP                                                             PAGE

IIntroduction                                                   

IIThat which God wills in human society is to be held as
Right                                                              

IIIIt was fitting for the Romans as being the noblest
nation to be preferred before all others                          

IVThe Roman Empire was helped by miracles and therefore
was willed by God                                                  

VThe Romans in bringing the world into subjection
aimed at the good of the state and therefore at the
end of Right                                                       

VIAll men who aim at Right walk according to Right            

VIIThe Romans were ordained for empire by Nature                

VIIIThe judgment of God showed that empire fell to the
lot of the Romans                                                  

IXThe Romans prevailed when all nations were striving
for empire                                                         

XWhat is acquired by single combat is acquired as of
Right                                                              

XIThe single combats of Rome                                    

XIIChrist by being born proves to us that the authority of
the Roman Empire was just                                          

XIIIChrist by dying confirmed the jurisdiction of the Roman
Empire over all mankind                                            


BOOK III

WHETHER THE AUTHORITY OF THE MONARCH COMES DIRECTLY FROM GOD OR FROM
SOME VICAR OF GOD

CHAP                                                             PAGE

IIntroduction                                                   

IIGod wills not that which is repugnant to the intention
of Nature                                                          

IIIOf the three classes of our opponents and of the too
great authority which many ascribe to tradition                    

IVThe argument drawn by our opponents from the sun
and the moon                                                       

VThe argument drawn from the precedence of Levi over
Judah                                                              

VIThe argument drawn from the crowning and deposition
of Saul by Samuel                                                  

VIIThe argument drawn from the oblation of the Magi             

VIIIThe argument drawn from the power of the keys given
to Peter                                                           

IXThe argument drawn from the two swords                        

XThe argument drawn from the donation of Constantine            

XIThe argument drawn from the summoning of Charles
the Great by Pope Hadrian                                          

XIIThe argument drawn from reason                               

XIIIThe authority of the Church is not the cause of the
authority of the Empire                                            

XIVThe Church has power to bestow such authority neither
from God nor from itself nor from any emperor                    

XVThe power of giving authority to the Empire is against
the nature of the Church                                           

XVIThe authority of the Empire comes directly from God
