CHAPTER XXI

IT was after sunup now but we went right on and didnt tie up  The
king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty but after
theyd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal
After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft and
pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches and let his legs dangle
in the water so as to be comfortable and lit his pipe and went to
getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart  When he had got it pretty good
him and the duke begun to practice it together  The duke had to learn
him over and over again how to say every speech and he made him sigh
and put his hand on his heart and after a while he said he done it
pretty well only he says you mustnt bellow out ROMEO that way
like a bullyou must say it soft and sick and languishy soRoomeo
that is the idea for Juliets a dear sweet mere child of a girl you
know and she doesnt bray like a jackass

Well next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of
oak laths and begun to practice the sword fightthe duke called himself
Richard III and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft was
grand to see  But by and by the king tripped and fell overboard and
after that they took a rest and had a talk about all kinds of adventures
theyd had in other times along the river

After dinner the duke says

Well Capet well want to make this a firstclass show you know so I
guess well add a little more to it  We want a little something to
answer encores with anyway

Whats onkores Bilgewater

The duke told him and then says

Ill answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailors hornpipe and
youwell let me seeoh Ive got ityou can do Hamlets soliloquy

Hamlets which

Hamlets soliloquy you know the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare
Ah its sublime sublime  Always fetches the house  I havent got it
in the bookIve only got one volumebut I reckon I can piece it out
from memory  Ill just walk up and down a minute and see if I can call
it back from recollections vaults

So he went to marching up and down thinking and frowning horrible every
now and then then he would hoist up his eyebrows next he would squeeze
his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan next he would
sigh and next hed let on to drop a tear  It was beautiful to see him
By and by he got it  He told us to give attention  Then he strikes a
most noble attitude with one leg shoved forwards and his arms stretched
away up and his head tilted back looking up at the sky and then he
begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth and after that all through
his speech he howled and spread around and swelled up his chest and
just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before  This is the
speechI learned it easy enough while he was learning it to the king

To be or not to be that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity of so
long life For who would fardels bear till Birnam Wood do come to
Dunsinane But that the fear of something after death Murders the
innocent sleep Great natures second course And makes us rather sling
the arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of
Theres the respect must give us pause Wake Duncan with thy knocking  I
would thou couldst For who would bear the whips and scorns of time The
oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely The laws delay and the
quietus which his pangs might take In the dead waste and middle of the
night when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black But that
the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns Breathes
forth contagion on the world And thus the native hue of resolution like
the poor cat i the adage Is sicklied oer with care And all the clouds
that lowered oer our housetops With this regard their currents turn
awry And lose the name of action Tis a consummation devoutly to be
wished  But soft you the fair Ophelia Ope not thy ponderous and marble
jaws But get thee to a nunnerygo

Well the old man he liked that speech and he mighty soon got it so he
could do it firstrate  It seemed like he was just born for it and when
he had his hand in and was excited it was perfectly lovely the way he
would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off

The first chance we got the duke he had some showbills printed and after
that for two or three days as we floated along the raft was a most
uncommon lively place for there warnt nothing but sword fighting and
rehearsingas the duke called itgoing on all the time  One morning
when we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw we come in sight of a
little onehorse town in a big bend so we tied up about threequarters
of a mile above it in the mouth of a crick which was shut in like a
tunnel by the cypress trees and all of us but Jim took the canoe and
went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our
show

We struck it mighty lucky there was going to be a circus there that
afternoon and the country people was already beginning to come in in
all kinds of old shackly wagons and on horses  The circus would leave
before night so our show would have a pretty good chance  The duke he
hired the courthouse and we went around and stuck up our bills  They
read like this

Then we went loafing around town  The stores and houses was most all
old shackly dried up frame concerns that hadnt ever been painted they
was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts so as to be out of
reach of the water when the river was overflowed  The houses had little
gardens around them but they didnt seem to raise hardly anything in
them but jimpsonweeds and sunflowers and ash piles and old curledup
boots and shoes and pieces of bottles and rags and playedout tinware
The fences was made of different kinds of boards nailed on at different
times and they leaned every which way and had gates that didnt generly
have but one hingea leather one  Some of the fences had been
whitewashed some time or another but the duke said it was in Clumbus
time like enough  There was generly hogs in the garden and people
driving them out

All the stores was along one street  They had white domestic awnings in
front and the country people hitched their horses to the awningposts
There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings and loafers roosting on
them all day long whittling them with their Barlow knives and chawing
tobacco and gaping and yawning and stretchinga mighty ornery lot
They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella but
didnt wear no coats nor waistcoats they called one another Bill and
Buck and Hank and Joe and Andy and talked lazy and drawly and used
considerable many cuss words  There was as many as one loafer leaning up
against every awningpost and he most always had his hands in his
britchespockets except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of
tobacco or scratch  What a body was hearing amongst them all the time
was

Gimme a chaw v tobacker Hank

Caint I haint got but one chaw left  Ask Bill

Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw maybe he lies and says he aint got none
Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world nor a chaw
of tobacco of their own  They get all their chawing by borrowing they
say to a fellow I wisht youd len me a chaw Jack I jist this minute
give Ben Thompson the last chaw I hadwhich is a lie pretty much
everytime it dont fool nobody but a stranger but Jack aint no
stranger so he says

YOU give him a chaw did you  So did your sisters cats grandmother
You pay me back the chaws youve awready borryd offn me Lafe Buckner
then Ill loan you one or two ton of it and wont charge you no back
intrust nuther

Well I DID pay you back some of it wunst

Yes you didbout six chaws  You borryd store tobacker and paid back
niggerhead

Store tobacco is flat black plug but these fellows mostly chaws the
natural leaf twisted  When they borrow a chaw they dont generly cut it
off with a knife but set the plug in between their teeth and gnaw with
their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two
then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when
its handed back and says sarcastic

Here gimme the CHAW and you take the PLUG

All the streets and lanes was just mud they warnt nothing else BUT mud
mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places and two
or three inches deep in ALL the places  The hogs loafed and grunted
around everywheres  Youd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come
lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way where
folks had to walk around her and shed stretch out and shut her eyes and
wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her and look as happy as if
she was on salary And pretty soon youd hear a loafer sing out Hi  SO
boy sick him Tige and away the sow would go squealing most horrible
with a dog or two swinging to each ear and three or four dozen more
acoming and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing
out of sight and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise  Then
theyd settle back again till there was a dog fight  There couldnt
anything wake them up all over and make them happy all over like a dog
fightunless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting
fire to him or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to
death

On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank and
they was bowed and bent and about ready to tumble in The people had
moved out of them  The bank was caved away under one corner of some
others and that corner was hanging over  People lived in them yet but
it was dangersome because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house
caves in at a time  Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep
will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the
river in one summer Such a town as that has to be always moving back
and back and back because the rivers always gnawing at it

The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons
and horses in the streets and more coming all the time  Families
fetched their dinners with them from the country and eat them in the
wagons  There was considerable whisky drinking going on and I seen
three fights  By and by somebody sings out

Here comes old Boggsin from the country for his little old monthly
drunk here he comes boys

All the loafers looked glad I reckoned they was used to having fun out
of Boggs  One of them says

Wonder who hes agwyne to chaw up this time  If hed achawed up all
the men hes ben agwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year hed have
considerable ruputation now

Another one says I wisht old Boggs d threaten me cuz then Id know I
warnt gwyne to die for a thousan year

Boggs comes atearing along on his horse whooping and yelling like an
Injun and singing out

Cler the track thar  Im on the wawpath and the price uv coffins is
agwyne to raise

He was drunk and weaving about in his saddle he was over fifty year
old and had a very red face  Everybody yelled at him and laughed at him
and sassed him and he sassed back and said hed attend to them and lay
them out in their regular turns but he couldnt wait now because hed
come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn and his motto was Meat
first and spoon vittles to top off on

He see me and rode up and says

Whard you come fm boy  You prepared to die

Then he rode on  I was scared but a man says

He dont mean nothing hes always acarryin on like that when hes
drunk  Hes the best naturedest old fool in Arkansawnever hurt nobody
drunk nor sober

Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town and bent his head down so
he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells

Come out here Sherburn Come out and meet the man youve swindled
Youre the houn Im after and Im agwyne to have you too

And so he went on calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue
to and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and
going on  By and by a proudlooking man about fiftyfiveand he was a
heap the best dressed man in that town toosteps out of the store and
the crowd drops back on each side to let him come  He says to Boggs
mighty cam and slowhe says

Im tired of this but Ill endure it till one oclock  Till one
oclock mindno longer  If you open your mouth against me only once
after that time you cant travel so far but I will find you

Then he turns and goes in  The crowd looked mighty sober nobody
stirred and there warnt no more laughing  Boggs rode off blackguarding
Sherburn as loud as he could yell all down the street and pretty soon
back he comes and stops before the store still keeping it up  Some men
crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up but he wouldnt they
told him it would be one oclock in about fifteen minutes and so he MUST
go homehe must go right away  But it didnt do no good  He cussed
away with all his might and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode
over it and pretty soon away he went araging down the street again
with his gray hair aflying Everybody that could get a chance at him
tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up
and get him sober but it warnt no useup the street he would tear
again and give Sherburn another cussing  By and by somebody says

Go for his daughterquick go for his daughter sometimes hell listen
to her  If anybody can persuade him she can

So somebody started on a run  I walked down street a ways and stopped
In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again but not on his
horse  He was areeling across the street towards me bareheaded with
a friend on both sides of him aholt of his arms and hurrying him along
He was quiet and looked uneasy and he warnt hanging back any but was
doing some of the hurrying himself  Somebody sings out

Boggs

I looked over there to see who said it and it was that Colonel Sherburn
He was standing perfectly still in the street and had a pistol raised in
his right handnot aiming it but holding it out with the barrel tilted
up towards the sky  The same second I see a young girl coming on the
run and two men with her  Boggs and the men turned round to see who
called him and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side and
the pistolbarrel come down slow and steady to a levelboth barrels
cocked Boggs throws up both of his hands and says O Lord dont
shoot  Bang goes the first shot and he staggers back clawing at the
airbang goes the second one and he tumbles backwards on to the
ground heavy and solid with his arms spread out  That young girl
screamed out and comes rushing and down she throws herself on her
father crying and saying Oh hes killed him hes killed him  The
crowd closed up around them and shouldered and jammed one another with
their necks stretched trying to see and people on the inside trying to
shove them back and shouting Back back give him air give him air

Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground and turned around
on his heels and walked off

They took Boggs to a little drug store the crowd pressing around just
the same and the whole town following and I rushed and got a good place
at the window where I was close to him and could see in  They laid him
on the floor and put one large Bible under his head and opened another
one and spread it on his breast but they tore open his shirt first and
I seen where one of the bullets went in  He made about a dozen long
gasps his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his breath and
letting it down again when he breathed it outand after that he laid
still he was dead  Then they pulled his daughter away from him
screaming and crying and took her off  She was about sixteen and very
sweet and gentle looking but awful pale and scared

Well pretty soon the whole town was there squirming and scrouging and
pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look but people that
had the places wouldnt give them up and folks behind them was saying
all the time Say now youve looked enough you fellows taint right
and taint fair for you to stay thar all the time and never give nobody
a chance other folks has their rights as well as you

There was considerable jawing back so I slid out thinking maybe there
was going to be trouble  The streets was full and everybody was
excited Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened
and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows
stretching their necks and listening  One long lanky man with long
hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head and a
crookedhandled cane marked out the places on the ground where Boggs
stood and where Sherburn stood and the people following him around from
one place to tother and watching everything he done and bobbing their
heads to show they understood and stooping a little and resting their
hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his
cane and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had stood
frowning and having his hatbrim down over his eyes and sung out
Boggs and then fetched his cane down slow to a level and says Bang
staggered backwards says Bang again and fell down flat on his back
The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect said it was
just exactly the way it all happened  Then as much as a dozen people got
out their bottles and treated him

Well by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched  In about a
minute everybody was saying it so away they went mad and yelling and
snatching down every clothesline they come to to do the hanging with




CHAPTER XXII

THEY swarmed up towards Sherburns house awhooping and raging like
Injuns and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped
to mush and it was awful to see  Children was heeling it ahead of the
mob screaming and trying to get out of the way and every window along
the road was full of womens heads and there was nigger boys in every
tree and bucks and wenches looking over every fence and as soon as the
mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of
reach  Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on scared most
to death

They swarmed up in front of Sherburns palings as thick as they could jam
together and you couldnt hear yourself think for the noise  It was a
little twentyfoot yard  Some sung out Tear down the fence tear down
the fence  Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing
and down she goes and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like
a wave

Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch
with a doublebarrel gun in his hand and takes his stand perfectly cam
and deliberate not saying a word  The racket stopped and the wave
sucked back

Sherburn never said a wordjust stood there looking down  The
stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable  Sherburn run his eye slow
along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little to
outgaze him but they couldnt they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky
Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed not the pleasant kind but the
kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread thats got sand
in it

Then he says slow and scornful

The idea of YOU lynching anybody  Its amusing  The idea of you
thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a MAN  Because youre brave
enough to tar and feather poor friendless castout women that come along
here did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a
MAN  Why a MANS safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kindas
long as its daytime and youre not behind him

Do I know you  I know you clear through was born and raised in the
South and Ive lived in the North so I know the average all around
The average mans a coward  In the North he lets anybody walk over him
that wants to and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it
In the South one man all by himself has stopped a stage full of men in
the daytime and robbed the lot  Your newspapers call you a brave people
so much that you think you are braver than any other peoplewhereas
youre just AS brave and no braver  Why dont your juries hang
murderers  Because theyre afraid the mans friends will shoot them in
the back in the darkand its just what they WOULD do

So they always acquit and then a MAN goes in the night with a hundred
masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal  Your mistake is that
you didnt bring a man with you thats one mistake and the other is
that you didnt come in the dark and fetch your masks  You brought PART
of a manBuck Harkness thereand if you hadnt had him to start you
youd a taken it out in blowing

You didnt want to come  The average man dont like trouble and danger
YOU dont like trouble and danger  But if only HALF a manlike Buck
Harkness thereshouts Lynch him lynch him youre afraid to back
downafraid youll be found out to be what you areCOWARDSand so
you raise a yell and hang yourselves on to that halfamans coattail
and come raging up here swearing what big things youre going to do
The pitifulest thing out is a mob thats what an army isa mob they
dont fight with courage thats born in them but with courage thats
borrowed from their mass and from their officers  But a mob without any
MAN at the head of it is BENEATH pitifulness  Now the thing for YOU to
do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole  If any real
lynchings going to be done it will be done in the dark Southern
fashion and when they come theyll bring their masks and fetch a MAN
along  Now LEAVEand take your halfaman with youtossing his gun up
across his left arm and cocking it when he says this

The crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing
off every which way and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them looking
tolerable cheap  I could a stayed if I wanted to but I didnt want to

I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman
went by and then dived in under the tent  I had my twentydollar gold
piece and some other money but I reckoned I better save it because
there aint no telling how soon you are going to need it away from home
and amongst strangers that way  You cant be too careful  I aint
opposed to spending money on circuses when there aint no other way but
there aint no use in WASTING it on them

It was a real bully circus  It was the splendidest sight that ever was
when they all come riding in two and two a gentleman and lady side by
side the men just in their drawers and undershirts and no shoes nor
stirrups and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable
there must a been twenty of themand every lady with a lovely
complexion and perfectly beautiful and looking just like a gang of real
sureenough queens and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars
and just littered with diamonds  It was a powerful fine sight I never
see anything so lovely  And then one by one they got up and stood and
went aweaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful the men
looking ever so tall and airy and straight with their heads bobbing and
skimming along away up there under the tentroof and every ladys
roseleafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips and she looking
like the most loveliest parasol

And then faster and faster they went all of them dancing first one foot
out in the air and then the other the horses leaning more and more and
the ringmaster going round and round the centerpole cracking his whip
and shouting Hihi and the clown cracking jokes behind him and by
and by all hands dropped the reins and every lady put her knuckles on
her hips and every gentleman folded his arms and then how the horses did
lean over and hump themselves  And so one after the other they all
skipped off into the ring and made the sweetest bow I ever see and then
scampered out and everybody clapped their hands and went just about
wild

Well all through the circus they done the most astonishing things and
all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people  The
ringmaster couldnt ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick
as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said and how he ever
COULD think of so many of them and so sudden and so pat was what I
couldnt noway understand Why I couldnt a thought of them in a year
And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ringsaid he wanted to
ride said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was  They argued
and tried to keep him out but he wouldnt listen and the whole show
come to a standstill  Then the people begun to holler at him and make
fun of him and that made him mad and he begun to rip and tear so that
stirred up the people and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the
benches and swarm towards the ring saying Knock him down throw him
out and one or two women begun to scream  So then the ringmaster he
made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldnt be no disturbance
and if the man would promise he wouldnt make no more trouble he would
let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse  So everybody
laughed and said all right and the man got on The minute he was on the
horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around with two circus
men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him and the drunk man
hanging on to his neck and his heels flying in the air every jump and
the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears
rolled down  And at last sure enough all the circus men could do the
horse broke loose and away he went like the very nation round and round
the ring with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck with
first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side and then tother
one on tother side and the people just crazy  It warnt funny to me
though I was all of a tremble to see his danger  But pretty soon he
struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle areeling this way and
that and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood
and the horse agoing like a house afire too  He just stood up there
asailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warnt ever drunk in his
lifeand then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them  He shed
them so thick they kind of clogged up the air and altogether he shed
seventeen suits And then there he was slim and handsome and dressed
the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw and he lit into that horse with
his whip and made him fairly humand finally skipped off and made his
bow and danced off to the dressingroom and everybody just ahowling
with pleasure and astonishment

Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled and he WAS the sickest
ringmaster you ever see I reckon  Why it was one of his own men  He
had got up that joke all out of his own head and never let on to nobody
Well I felt sheepish enough to be took in so but I wouldnt a been in
that ringmasters place not for a thousand dollars  I dont know there
may be bullier circuses than what that one was but I never struck them
yet Anyways it was plenty good enough for ME and wherever I run across
it it can have all of MY custom every time

Well that night we had OUR show but there warnt only about twelve
people therejust enough to pay expenses  And they laughed all the
time and that made the duke mad and everybody left anyway before the
show was over but one boy which was asleep  So the duke said these
Arkansaw lunkheads couldnt come up to Shakespeare what they wanted was
low comedyand maybe something ruther worse than low comedy he
reckoned  He said he could size their style  So next morning he got
some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint and drawed off
some handbills and stuck them up all over the village  The bills said

AT THE COURT HOUSE FOR  NIGHTS ONLY
The WorldRenowned Tragedians
DAVID GARRICK THE YOUNGER
AND EDMUND KEAN THE ELDER
Of the London and
Continental Theatres
In their Thrilling Tragedy of
THE KINGS CAMELEOPARD
OR THE ROYAL NONESUCH   
Admission  cents

Then at the bottom was the biggest line of all which said

LADIES AND CHILDREN NOT ADMITTED

There says he if that line dont fetch them I dont know Arkansaw




CHAPTER XXIII

WELL all day him and the king was hard at it rigging up a stage and a
curtain and a row of candles for footlights and that night the house was
jam full of men in no time  When the place couldnt hold no more the
duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the
stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech and
praised up this tragedy and said it was the most thrillingest one that
ever was and so he went on abragging about the tragedy and about
Edmund Kean the Elder which was to play the main principal part in it
and at last when hed got everybodys expectations up high enough he
rolled up the curtain and the next minute the king come aprancing out
on all fours naked and he was painted all over ringstreakedand
striped all sorts of colors as splendid as a rainbow  Andbut never
mind the rest of his outfit it was just wild but it was awful funny
The people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done
capering and capered off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and
stormed and hawhawed till he come back and done it over again and after
that they made him do it another time Well it would make a cow laugh to
see the shines that old idiot cut

Then the duke he lets the curtain down and bows to the people and says
the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more on accounts of
pressing London engagements where the seats is all sold already for it
in Drury Lane and then he makes them another bow and says if he has
succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them he will be deeply
obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come
and see it

Twenty people sings out

What is it over  Is that ALL

The duke says yes  Then there was a fine time  Everybody sings out
Sold and rose up mad and was agoing for that stage and them
tragedians  But a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts

Hold on  Just a word gentlemen  They stopped to listen  We are
soldmighty badly sold  But we dont want to be the laughing stock of
this whole town I reckon and never hear the last of this thing as long
as we live  NO  What we want is to go out of here quiet and talk this
show up and sell the REST of the town  Then well all be in the same
boat  Aint that sensible You bet it isthe jedge is right
everybody sings out All right thennot a word about any sell  Go
along home and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy

Next day you couldnt hear nothing around that town but how splendid that
show was  House was jammed again that night and we sold this crowd the
same way  When me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all
had a supper and by and by about midnight they made Jim and me back
her out and float her down the middle of the river and fetch her in and
hide her about two mile below town

The third night the house was crammed againand they warnt newcomers
this time but people that was at the show the other two nights  I stood
by the duke at the door and I see that every man that went in had his
pockets bulging or something muffled up under his coatand I see it
warnt no perfumery neither not by a long sight  I smelt sickly eggs
by the barrel and rotten cabbages and such things and if I know the
signs of a dead cat being around and I bet I do there was sixtyfour of
them went in  I shoved in there for a minute but it was too various for
me I couldnt stand it  Well when the place couldnt hold no more
people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for
him a minute and then he started around for the stage door I after him
but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says

Walk fast now till you get away from the houses and then shin for the
raft like the dickens was after you

I done it and he done the same  We struck the raft at the same time
and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream all dark and
still and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying a word
I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience
but nothing of the sort pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam
and says

Well howd the old thing pan out this time duke  He hadnt been
uptown at all

We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village
Then we lit up and had a supper and the king and the duke fairly laughed
their bones loose over the way theyd served them people  The duke says

Greenhorns flatheads  I knew the first house would keep mum and let
the rest of the town get roped in and I knew theyd lay for us the third
night and consider it was THEIR turn now  Well it IS their turn and
Id give something to know how much theyd take for it  I WOULD just
like to know how theyre putting in their opportunity  They can turn it
into a picnic if they want tothey brought plenty provisions

Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixtyfive dollars in that
three nights  I never see money hauled in by the wagonload like that
before  By and by when they was asleep and snoring Jim says

Dont it sprise you de way dem kings carries on Huck

No I says it dont

Why dont it Huck

Well it dont because its in the breed  I reckon theyre all alike

But Huck dese kings o ourn is reglar rapscallions dats jist what
dey is deys reglar rapscallions

Well thats what Im asaying all kings is mostly rapscallions as fur
as I can make out

Is dat so

You read about them onceyoull see  Look at Henry the Eight this n
s a Sundayschool Superintendent to HIM  And look at Charles Second
and Louis Fourteen and Louis Fifteen and James Second and Edward
Second and Richard Third and forty more besides all them Saxon
heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain  My
you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom  He WAS a
blossom  He used to marry a new wife every day and chop off her head
next morning  And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was
ordering up eggs  Fetch up Nell Gwynn he says  They fetch her up
Next morning Chop off her head  And they chop it off  Fetch up Jane
Shore he says and up she comes Next morning Chop off her headand
they chop it off  Ring up Fair Rosamun  Fair Rosamun answers the
bell  Next morning Chop off her head  And he made every one of them
tell him a tale every night and he kept that up till he had hogged a
thousand and one tales that way and then he put them all in a book and
called it Domesday Bookwhich was a good name and stated the case  You
dont know kings Jim but I know them and this old rip of ourn is one
of the cleanest Ive struck in history  Well Henry he takes a notion he
wants to get up some trouble with this country How does he go at it
give noticegive the country a show  No  All of a sudden he heaves
all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard and whacks out a declaration of
independence and dares them to come on  That was HIS stylehe never
give anybody a chance  He had suspicions of his father the Duke of
Wellington  Well what did he do  Ask him to show up  Nodrownded
him in a butt of mamsey like a cat  Spose people left money laying
around where he waswhat did he do  He collared it  Spose he
contracted to do a thing and you paid him and didnt set down there and
see that he done itwhat did he do  He always done the other thing
Spose he opened his mouthwhat then  If he didnt shut it up powerful
quick hed lose a lie every time  Thats the kind of a bug Henry was
and if wed a had him along stead of our kings hed a fooled that town a
heap worse than ourn done  I dont say that ourn is lambs because they
aint when you come right down to the cold facts but they aint nothing
to THAT old ram anyway  All I say is kings is kings and you got to
make allowances  Take them all around theyre a mighty ornery lot
Its the way theyre raised

But dis one do SMELL so like de nation Huck

Well they all do Jim  We cant help the way a king smells history
dont tell no way

Now de duke hes a tolerble likely man in some ways

Yes a dukes different  But not very different  This ones a middling
hard lot for a duke  When hes drunk there aint no nearsighted man
could tell him from a king

Well anyways I doan hanker for no mo un um Huck  Dese is all I kin
stan

Its the way I feel too Jim  But weve got them on our hands and we
got to remember what they are and make allowances  Sometimes I wish we
could hear of a country thats out of kings

What was the use to tell Jim these warnt real kings and dukes  It
wouldnt a done no good and besides it was just as I said  you
couldnt tell them from the real kind

I went to sleep and Jim didnt call me when it was my turn  He often
done that  When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with
his head down betwixt his knees moaning and mourning to himself  I
didnt take notice nor let on  I knowed what it was about  He was
thinking about his wife and his children away up yonder and he was low
and homesick because he hadnt ever been away from home before in his
life and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white
folks does for theirn  It dont seem natural but I reckon its so  He
was often moaning and mourning that way nights when he judged I was
asleep and saying Po little Lizabeth po little Johnny its mighty
hard I spec I aint ever gwyne to see you no mo no mo  He was a
mighty good nigger Jim was

But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young
ones and by and by he says

What makes me feel so bad dis time uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder
on de bank like a whack er a slam while ago en it mine me er de time I
treat my little Lizabeth so ornery  She warnt ony bout fo year ole

CHAPTER XXIV

NEXT day towards night we laid up under a little willow towhead out in
the middle where there was a village on each side of the river and the
duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns  Jim he
spoke to the duke and said he hoped it wouldnt take but a few hours
because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all
day in the wigwam tied with the rope  You see when we left him all
alone we had to tie him because if anybody happened on to him all by
himself and not tied it wouldnt look much like he was a runaway nigger
you know So the duke said it WAS kind of hard to have to lay roped all
day and hed cipher out some way to get around it

He was uncommon bright the duke was and he soon struck it  He dressed
Jim up in King Lears outfitit was a long curtaincalico gown and a
white horsehair wig and whiskers and then he took his theater paint and
painted Jims face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead dull
solid blue like a man thats been drownded nine days  Blamed if he
warnt the horriblest looking outrage I ever see  Then the duke took and
wrote out a sign on a shingle so

Sick Arabbut harmless when not out of his head

And he nailed that shingle to a lath and stood the lath up four or five
foot in front of the wigwam  Jim was satisfied  He said it was a sight
better than lying tied a couple of years every day and trembling all
over every time there was a sound  The duke told him to make himself
free and easy and if anybody ever come meddling around he must hop out
of the wigwam and carry on a little and fetch a howl or two like a wild
beast and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone  Which
was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and he wouldnt
wait for him to howl  Why he didnt only look like he was dead he
looked considerable more than that

These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again because there was so
much money in it but they judged it wouldnt be safe because maybe the
news might a worked along down by this time  They couldnt hit no
project that suited exactly so at last the duke said he reckoned hed
lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldnt put up
something on the Arkansaw village and the king he allowed he would drop
over to tother village without any plan but just trust in Providence to
lead him the profitable waymeaning the devil I reckon  We had all
bought store clothes where we stopped last and now the king put hisn
on and he told me to put mine on  I done it of course  The kings
duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy  I never
knowed how clothes could change a body before  Why before he looked
like the orneriest old rip that ever was but now when hed take off his
new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and
good and pious that youd say he had walked right out of the ark and
maybe was old Leviticus himself  Jim cleaned up the canoe and I got my
paddle ready  There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up
under the point about three mile above the townbeen there a couple
of hours taking on freight  Says the king

Seein how Im dressed I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St
Louis or Cincinnati or some other big place  Go for the steamboat
Huckleberry well come down to the village on her

I didnt have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride  I
fetched the shore a half a mile above the village and then went scooting
along the bluff bank in the easy water  Pretty soon we come to a nice
innocentlooking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat
off of his face for it was powerful warm weather and he had a couple of
big carpetbags by him

Run her nose in shore says the king  I done it  Wher you bound
for young man

For the steamboat going to Orleans

Git aboard says the king  Hold on a minute my servant ll hep you
with them bags  Jump out and hep the gentleman Adolphusmeaning me
I see

I done so and then we all three started on again  The young chap was
mighty thankful said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather
He asked the king where he was going and the king told him hed come
down the river and landed at the other village this morning and now he
was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there  The
young fellow says

When I first see you I says to myself Its Mr Wilks sure and he
come mighty near getting here in time  But then I says again No I
reckon it aint him or else he wouldnt be paddling up the river  You
AINT him are you

No my names BlodgettElexander BlodgettREVEREND Elexander Blodgett
I spose I must say as Im one o the Lords poor servants  But still
Im jist as able to be sorry for Mr Wilks for not arriving in time all
the same if hes missed anything by itwhich I hope he hasnt

Well he dont miss any property by it because hell get that all
right but hes missed seeing his brother Peter diewhich he maynt
mind nobody can tell as to thatbut his brother would a give anything
in this world to see HIM before he died never talked about nothing else
all these three weeks hadnt seen him since they was boys togetherand
hadnt ever seen his brother William at allthats the deef and dumb
oneWilliam aint more than thirty or thirtyfive  Peter and George
were the only ones that come out here George was the married brother
him and his wife both died last year  Harvey and Williams the only ones
thats left now and as I was saying they havent got here in time

Did anybody send em word

Oh yes a month or two ago when Peter was first took because Peter
said then that he sorter felt like he warnt going to get well this time
You see he was pretty old and Georges gyirls was too young to be much
company for him except Mary Jane the redheaded one and so he was
kinder lonesome after George and his wife died and didnt seem to care
much to live  He most desperately wanted to see Harveyand William
too for that matterbecause he was one of them kind that cant bear to
make a will  He left a letter behind for Harvey and said hed told in
it where his money was hid and how he wanted the rest of the property
divided up so Georges gyirls would be all rightfor George didnt
leave nothing  And that letter was all they could get him to put a pen
to

Why do you reckon Harvey dont come  Wher does he live

Oh he lives in EnglandSheffieldpreaches therehasnt ever been in
this country  He hasnt had any too much timeand besides he mightnt a
got the letter at all you know

Too bad too bad he couldnt a lived to see his brothers poor soul
You going to Orleans you say

Yes but that aint only a part of it  Im going in a ship next
Wednesday for Ryo Janeero where my uncle lives

Its a pretty long journey  But itll be lovely wisht I was agoing
Is Mary Jane the oldest  How old is the others

Mary Janes nineteen Susans fifteen and Joannas about fourteen
thats the one that gives herself to good works and has a harelip


Poor things to be left alone in the cold world so

Well they could be worse off  Old Peter had friends and they aint
going to let them come to no harm  Theres Hobson the Babtis preacher
and Deacon Lot Hovey and Ben Rucker and Abner Shackleford and Levi
Bell the lawyer and Dr Robinson and their wives and the widow
Bartley andwell theres a lot of them but these are the ones that
Peter was thickest with and used to write about sometimes when he wrote
home so Harvey ll know where to look for friends when he gets here

Well the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied
that young fellow  Blamed if he didnt inquire about everybody and
everything in that blessed town and all about the Wilkses and about
Peters businesswhich was a tanner and about Georgeswhich was a
carpenter and about Harveyswhich was a dissentering minister and so
on and so on  Then he says

What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for

Because shes a big Orleans boat and I was afeard she mightnt stop
there  When theyre deep they wont stop for a hail  A Cincinnati boat
will but this is a St Louis one

Was Peter Wilks well off

Oh yes pretty well off  He had houses and land and its reckoned he
left three or four thousand in cash hid up somers

When did you say he died

I didnt say but it was last night

Funeral tomorrow likely

Yes bout the middle of the day

Well its all terrible sad but weve all got to go one time or
another So what we want to do is to be prepared then were all right

Yes sir its the best way  Ma used to always say that

When we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she
got off  The king never said nothing about going aboard so I lost my
ride after all  When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up
another mile to a lonesome place and then he got ashore and says

Now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new
carpetbags  And if hes gone over to tother side go over there and
git him  And tell him to git himself up regardless  Shove along now

I see what HE was up to but I never said nothing of course  When I got
back with the duke we hid the canoe and then they set down on a log and
the king told him everything just like the young fellow had said it
every last word of it  And all the time he was adoing it he tried to
talk like an Englishman and he done it pretty well too for a slouch
I cant imitate him and so I aint agoing to try to but he really done
it pretty good  Then he says

How are you on the deef and dumb Bilgewater

The duke said leave him alone for that said he had played a deef and
dumb person on the histronic boards  So then they waited for a
steamboat

About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along
but they didnt come from high enough up the river but at last there was
a big one and they hailed her  She sent out her yawl and we went
aboard and she was from Cincinnati and when they found we only wanted
to go four or five mile they was booming mad and gave us a cussing and
said they wouldnt land us  But the king was cam  He says

If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and
put off in a yawl a steamboat kin afford to carry em cant it

So they softened down and said it was all right and when we got to the
village they yawled us ashore  About two dozen men flocked down when
they see the yawl acoming and when the king says

Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher Mr Peter Wilks lives they give
a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say What
d I tell you  Then one of them says kind of soft and gentle

Im sorry sir but the best we can do is to tell you where he DID live
yesterday evening

Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash and fell up
against the man and put his chin on his shoulder and cried down his
back and says

Alas alas our poor brothergone and we never got to see him oh
its too too hard

Then he turns around blubbering and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the
duke on his hands and blamed if he didnt drop a carpetbag and bust out
acrying  If they warnt the beatenest lot them two frauds that ever I
struck

Well the men gathered around and sympathized with them and said all
sorts of kind things to them and carried their carpetbags up the hill
for them and let them lean on them and cry and told the king all about
his brothers last moments and the king he told it all over again on his
hands to the duke and both of them took on about that dead tanner like
theyd lost the twelve disciples  Well if ever I struck anything like
it Im a nigger It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race




CHAPTER XXV

THE news was all over town in two minutes and you could see the people
tearing down on the run from every which way some of them putting on
their coats as they come  Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd
and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march  The windows and
dooryards was full and every minute somebody would say over a fence

Is it THEM

And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say

You bet it is

When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed and the
three girls was standing in the door  Mary Jane WAS redheaded but that
dont make no difference she was most awful beautiful and her face and
her eyes was all lit up like glory she was so glad her uncles was come
The king he spread his arms and Mary Jane she jumped for them and the
harelip jumped for the duke and there they HAD it  Everybody most
leastways women cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have
such good times

Then the king he hunched the duke privateI see him do itand then he
looked around and see the coffin over in the corner on two chairs so
then him and the duke with a hand across each others shoulder and
tother hand to their eyes walked slow and solemn over there everybody
dropping back to give them room and all the talk and noise stopping
people saying Sh and all the men taking their hats off and drooping
their heads so you could a heard a pin fall  And when they got there
they bent over and looked in the coffin and took one sight and then
they bust out acrying so you could a heard them to Orleans most and
then they put their arms around each others necks and hung their chins
over each others shoulders and then for three minutes or maybe four I
never see two men leak the way they done  And mind you everybody was
doing the same and the place was that damp I never see anything like it
Then one of them got on one side of the coffin and tother on tother
side and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin and
let on to pray all to themselves  Well when it come to that it worked
the crowd like you never see anything like it and everybody broke down
and went to sobbing right out loudthe poor girls too and every woman
nearly went up to the girls without saying a word and kissed them
solemn on the forehead and then put their hand on their head and
looked up towards the sky with the tears running down and then busted
out and went off sobbing and swabbing and give the next woman a show  I
never see anything so disgusting

Well by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little and works
himself up and slobbers out a speech all full of tears and flapdoodle
about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the
diseased and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of
four thousand mile but its a trial thats sweetened and sanctified to
us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears and so he thanks them out
of his heart and out of his brothers heart because out of their mouths
they cant words being too weak and cold and all that kind of rot and
slush till it was just sickening and then he blubbers out a pious
goodygoody Amen and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust

And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd
struck up the doxolojer and everybody joined in with all their might
and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting
out Music is a good thing and after all that soulbutter and hogwash I
never see it freshen up things so and sound so honest and bully

Then the king begins to work his jaw again and says how him and his
nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family
would take supper here with them this evening and help set up with the
ashes of the diseased and says if his poor brother laying yonder could
speak he knows who he would name for they was names that was very dear
to him and mentioned often in his letters and so he will name the same
to wit as follows vizzRev Mr Hobson and Deacon Lot Hovey and
Mr Ben Rucker and Abner Shackleford and Levi Bell and Dr Robinson
and their wives and the widow Bartley

Rev Hobson and Dr Robinson was down to the end of the town ahunting
togetherthat is I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to tother
world and the preacher was pinting him right  Lawyer Bell was away up
to Louisville on business  But the rest was on hand and so they all
come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him and
then they shook hands with the duke and didnt say nothing but just kept
asmiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst he
made all sorts of signs with his hands and said Googoogoogoogoo
all the time like a baby that cant talk

So the king he blattered along and managed to inquire about pretty much
everybody and dog in town by his name and mentioned all sorts of little
things that happened one time or another in the town or to Georges
family or to Peter  And he always let on that Peter wrote him the
things but that was a lie  he got every blessed one of them out of that
young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat

Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind and the
king he read it out loud and cried over it  It give the dwellinghouse
and three thousand dollars gold to the girls and it give the tanyard
which was doing a good business along with some other houses and land
worth about seven thousand and three thousand dollars in gold to
Harvey and William and told where the six thousand cash was hid down
cellar  So these two frauds said theyd go and fetch it up and have
everything square and aboveboard and told me to come with a candle  We
shut the cellar door behind us and when they found the bag they spilt it
out on the floor and it was a lovely sight all them yallerboys  My
the way the kings eyes did shine  He slaps the duke on the shoulder and
says

Oh THIS aint bully nor nothn  Oh no I reckon not  Why Billy it
beats the Nonesuch DONT it

The duke allowed it did  They pawed the yallerboys and sifted them
through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor and the king
says

It aint no use talkin bein brothers to a rich dead man and
representatives of furrin heirs thats got left is the line for you and
me Bilge  Thish yer comes of trustn to Providence  Its the best way
in the long run  Ive tried em all and ther aint no better way

Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile and took it on
trust but no they must count it  So they counts it and it comes out
four hundred and fifteen dollars short  Says the king

Dern him I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen
dollars

They worried over that awhile and ransacked all around for it  Then the
duke says

Well he was a pretty sick man and likely he made a mistakeI reckon
thats the way of it  The best ways to let it go and keep still about
it  We can spare it

Oh shucks yes we can SPARE it  I dont kyer nothn bout thatits
the COUNT Im thinkin about  We want to be awful square and open and
aboveboard here you know  We want to lug this hyer money up stairs
and count it before everybodythen ther aint nothn suspicious  But
when the dead man says thers six thousn dollars you know we dont
want to

Hold on says the duke  Les make up the deffisit and he begun to
haul out yallerboys out of his pocket

Its a most amazn good idea dukeyou HAVE got a rattlin clever head
on you says the king  Blest if the old Nonesuch aint a heppin us
out agin and HE begun to haul out yallerjackets and stack them up

It most busted them but they made up the six thousand clean and clear

Say says the duke I got another idea  Les go up stairs and count
this money and then take and GIVE IT TO THE GIRLS

Good land duke lemme hug you  Its the most dazzling idea at ever a
man struck  You have certnly got the most astonishin head I ever see
Oh this is the boss dodge ther aint no mistake bout it  Let em
fetch along their suspicions now if they want tothis ll lay em out

When we got upstairs everybody gethered around the table and the king
he counted it and stacked it up three hundred dollars in a piletwenty
elegant little piles  Everybody looked hungry at it and licked their
chops  Then they raked it into the bag again and I see the king begin
to swell himself up for another speech  He says

Friends all my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them
thats left behind in the vale of sorrers  He has done generous by these
yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered and thats left
fatherless and motherless  Yes and we that knowed him knows that he
would a done MORE generous by em if he hadnt ben afeard o woundin his
dear William and me  Now WOULDNT he  Ther aint no question bout it
in MY mind  Well then what kind o brothers would it be that d stand
in his way at sech a time  And what kind o uncles would it be that d
robyes ROBsech poor sweet lambs as these at he loved so at sech a
time  If I know Williamand I THINK I dohewell Ill jest ask him
He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his
hands and the duke he looks at him stupid and leatherheaded a while
then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning and jumps for the
king googooing with all his might for joy and hugs him about fifteen
times before he lets up  Then the king says I knowed it I reckon THAT
ll convince anybody the way HE feels about it  Here Mary Jane Susan
Joanner take the moneytake it ALL  Its the gift of him that lays
yonder cold but joyful

Mary Jane she went for him Susan and the harelip went for the duke and
then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet  And everybody
crowded up with the tears in their eyes and most shook the hands off of
them frauds saying all the time

You DEAR good soulshow LOVELYhow COULD you

Well then pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased
again and how good he was and what a loss he was and all that and
before long a big ironjawed man worked himself in there from outside
and stood alistening and looking and not saying anything and nobody
saying anything to him either because the king was talking and they was
all busy listening  The king was sayingin the middle of something hed
started in on

they bein partickler friends o the diseased  Thats why theyre
invited here this evenin but tomorrow we want ALL to comeeverybody
for he respected everybody he liked everybody and so its fitten that
his funeral orgies shd be public

And so he went amooning on and on liking to hear himself talk and
every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again till the duke
he couldnt stand it no more so he writes on a little scrap of paper
OBSEQUIES you old fool and folds it up and goes to googooing and
reaching it over peoples heads to him  The king he reads it and puts it
in his pocket and says

Poor William afflicted as he is his HEARTS aluz right  Asks me to
invite everybody to come to the funeralwants me to make em all
welcome  But he neednt a worriedit was jest what I was at

Then he weaves along again perfectly cam and goes to dropping in his
funeral orgies again every now and then just like he done before  And
when he done it the third time he says

I say orgies not because its the common term because it aint
obsequies bein the common termbut because orgies is the right term
Obsequies aint used in England no more nowits gone out  We say
orgies now in England  Orgies is better because it means the thing
youre after more exact  Its a word thats made up outn the Greek
ORGO outside open abroad and the Hebrew JEESUM to plant cover up
hence inTER  So you see funeral orgies is an open er public funeral

He was the WORST I ever struck  Well the ironjawed man he laughed
right in his face  Everybody was shocked  Everybody says Why
DOCTOR and Abner Shackleford says

Why Robinson haint you heard the news  This is Harvey Wilks

The king he smiled eager and shoved out his flapper and says

Is it my poor brothers dear good friend and physician  I

Keep your hands off of me says the doctor  YOU talk like an
Englishman DONT you  Its the worst imitation I ever heard  YOU Peter
Wilkss brother  Youre a fraud thats what you are

Well how they all took on  They crowded around the doctor and tried to
quiet him down and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey d
showed in forty ways that he WAS Harvey and knowed everybody by name
and the names of the very dogs and begged and BEGGED him not to hurt
Harveys feelings and the poor girls feelings and all that  But it
warnt no use he stormed right along and said any man that pretended to
be an Englishman and couldnt imitate the lingo no better than what he
did was a fraud and a liar  The poor girls was hanging to the king and
crying and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on THEM  He says

I was your fathers friend and Im your friend and I warn you as a
friend and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of
harm and trouble to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing
to do with him the ignorant tramp with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew as
