DEAR BRUTUS


By

J M Barrie





ACT I


The scene is a darkened room which the curtain reveals so stealthily
that if there was a mouse on the stage it is there still Our object
is to catch our two chief characters unawares they are Darkness and
Light

The room is so obscure as to be invisible but at the back of the
obscurity are French windows through which is seen Lobs garden
bathed in moonshine The Darkness and Light which this room and
garden represent are very still but we should feel that it is only
the pause in which old enemies regard each other before they come to
the grip The moonshine stealing about among the flowers to give
them their last instructions has left a smile upon them but it is a
smile with a menace in it for the dwellers in darkness What we
expect to see next is the moonshine slowly pushing the windows open
so that it may whisper to a confederate in the house whose name is
Lob But though we may be sure that this was about to happen it does
not happen a stir among the dwellers in darkness prevents it

These unsuspecting ones are in the diningroom and as a communicating
door opens we hear them at play Several tenebrious shades appear in
the lighted doorway and hesitate on the two steps that lead down into
the unlit room The fanciful among us may conceive a rustle at the
same moment among the flowers The engagement has begun though not
in the way we had intended

VOICES
  Go on Coady lead the way
  Oh dear I dont see why I should go first
  The nicest always goes first
  It is a strange house if I am the nicest
  It is a strange house
  Dont close the door I cant see where the switch is
  Over here

They have been groping their way forward blissfully unaware of how
they shall be groping there again more terribly before the night is
out Some one finds a switch and the room is illumined with the
effect that the garden seems to have drawn back a step as if worsted
in the first encounter But it is only waiting

The apparently inoffensive chamber thus suddenly revealed is for a
bachelors home creditably like a charming country house
drawingroom and abounds in the little feminine touches that are so
often best applied by the hand of man There is nothing in the room
inimical to the ladies unless it be the cut flowers which are from
the garden and possibly in collusion with it The fireplace may also
be a little dubious It has been hacked out of a thick wall which may
have been there when the other walls were not and is presumably the
cavern where Lob when alone sits chatting to himself among the blue
smoke He is as much at home by this fire as any gnome that may be
hiding among its shadows but he is less familiar with the rest of
the room and when he sees it as for instance on his lonely way to
bed he often stares long and hard at it before chuckling
uncomfortably

There are five ladies and one only of them is elderly the Mrs Coade
whom a voice in the darkness has already proclaimed the nicest She
is the nicest though the voice was no good judge Coady as she is
familiarly called and as her husband also is called each having for
many years been able to answer for the other is a rounded old lady
with a beaming smile that has accompanied her from childhood If she
lives to be a hundred she will pretend to the census man that she is
only ninetynine She has no other vice that has not been smoothed
out of existence by her placid life and she has but one complaint
against the male Coady the rather odd one that he has long forgotten
his first wife Our Mrs Coady never knew the first one but it is she
alone who sometimes looks at the portrait of her and preserves in
their home certain mementoes of her such as a lock of brown hair
which the equally gentle male Coady must have treasured once but has
now forgotten The first wife had been slightly lame and in their
brief married life he had carried solicitously a rest for her foot
had got so accustomed to doing this that after a quarter of a
century with our Mrs Coady he still finds footstools for her as if
she were lame also She has ceased to pucker her face over this
taking it as a kind little thoughtless attention and indeed with the
years has developed a friendly limp

Of the other four ladies all young and physically fair two are
married Mrs Dearth is tall of smouldering eye and fierce desires
murky beasts lie in ambush in the labyrinths of her mind she is a
whitefaced gypsy with a husky voice most beautiful when she is
sullen and therefore frequently at her best The other ladies when
in conclave refer to her as The Dearth Mrs Purdie is a safer
companion for the toddling kind of man She is soft and pleading and
would seek what she wants by laying her head on the loved ones
shoulder while The Dearth might attain it with a pistol A brighter
spirit than either is Joanna Trout who when her affections are not
engaged has a merry face and figure but can dismiss them both at
the important moment which is at the word love Then Joanna
quivers her sense of humour ceases to beat and the dullest man may
go ahead There remains Lady Caroline Laney of the disdainful poise
lately from the enormously select school where they are taught to
pronounce their rs as ws nothing else seems to be taught but for
matrimonial success nothing else is necessary Every woman who
pronounces r as w will find a mate it appeals to all that is
chivalrous in man

An oldfashioned gallantry induces us to accept from each of these
ladies her own estimate of herself and fortunately it is favourable
in every case This refers to their estimate of themselves up to the
hour of ten on the evening on which we first meet them the estimate
may have changed temporarily by the time we part from them on the
following morning What their mirrors say to each of them is A dear
face not classically perfect but abounding in that changing charm
which is the best type of English womanhood here is a woman who has
seen and felt far more than her reticent nature readily betrays she
sometimes smiles but behind that concession controlling it in a
manner hardly less than adorable lurks the sigh called Knowledge a
strangely interesting face mysterious a line for her tombstone
might be If I had been a man what adventures I could have had with
her who lies here

Are these ladies then so very alike They would all deny it so we
must take our own soundings At this moment of their appearance in
the drawingroom at least they are alike in having a common interest
No sooner has the diningroom door closed than purpose leaps to
their eyes oddly enough the men having been got rid of the drama
begins


ALICE DEARTH the darkest spirit but the bravest We must not waste a
second Our minds are made up I think

JOANNA Now is the time

MRS COADE at once delighted and appalled Yes now if at all but
should we

ALICE Certainly and before the men come in

MABEL PURDIE You dont think we should wait for the men They are as
much in it as we are

LADY CAROLINE unlucky as her opening remark is without a single r
Lob would be with them If the thing is to be done at all it should
be done now

MRS COADE IS it quite fair to Lob After all he is our host

JOANNA Of course it isnt fair to him but lets do it Coady

MRS COADE Yes lets do it

MABEL Mrs Dearth is doing it

ALICE who is writing out a telegram Of course I am The men are not
coming are they

JOANNA reconnoitring NO your husband is having another glass of
port

ALICE I am sure he is One of you ring please

The bold Joanna rings

MRS COADE Poor Matey

LADY CAROLINE He wichly desewves what he is about to get

JOANNA He is coming Dont all stand huddled together like
conspirators

MRS COADE It is what we are

Swiftly they find seats and are sunk thereon like ladies waiting
languidly for their lords when the doomed butler appears He is a man
of brawn who could cast any one of them forth for a wager but we
are about to connive at the triumph of mind over matter

ALICE always at her best before the bright face of danger Ah
Matey I wish this telegram sent

MATEY a general favourite Very good maam The village post office
closed at eight but if your message is important

ALICE It is and you are so clever Matey I am sure that you can
persuade them to oblige you

MATEY taking the telegram I will see to it myself maam you can
depend on its going

There comes a little gasp from COADY which is the equivalent to
dropping a stitch in needlework

ALICE who is THE DEARTH now Thank you Better read the telegram
Matey to be sure that you can make it out MATEY reads it to
himself and he has never quite the same faith in woman again THE
DEARTH continues in a purring voice Read it aloud Matey

MATEY Oh maam

ALICE without the purr Aloud

Thus encouraged he reads the fatal missive

MATEY To Police Station Great Cumney Send officer first thing
tomorrow morning to arrest Matey butler for theft of rings

ALICE Yes that is quite right

MATEY Maam But seeing that she has taken up a book he turns to
LADY CAROLINE My lady

LADY CAROLINE whose voice strikes colder than THE DEARTHS Should
we not say how many wings

ALICE Yes put in the number of rings Matey

MATEY does not put in the number but he produces three rings from
unostentatious parts of his person and returns them without noticeable
dignity to their various owners

MATEY hopeful that the incident is now closed May I tear up the
telegram maam

ALICE Certainly not

LADY CAROLINE I always said that this man was the culpwit I am
nevaw mistaken in faces and I see bwoad awwows all over youws
Matey

He might reply that he sees ws all over hers but it is no moment
for repartee

MATEY It is deeply regretted

ALICE darkly I am sure it is

JOANNA who has seldom remained silent for so long We may as well
tell him now that it is not our rings we are worrying about They
have just been a means to an end Matey

The stir among the ladies shows that they have arrived at the more
interesting point

ALICE Precisely In other words that telegram is sent unless

MATEYS head rises

JOANNA Unless you can tell us instantly whet peculiarity it is that
all we ladies have in common

MABEL Not only the ladies all the guests in this house

ALICE We have been here a week and we find that when Lob invited us
he knew us all so little that we begin to wonder why he asked us And
now from words he has let drop we know that we were invited because
of something he thinks we have in common

MABEL But he wont say what it is

LADY CAROLINE drawing back a little from JOANNA One knows that no
people could be more unlike

JOANNA thankfully One does

MRS COADE And we cant sleep at night Matey for wondering what
this something is

JOANNA summing up But we are sure you know and it you dont tell
usquod

MATEY with growing uneasiness I dont know what you mean ladies

ALICE Oh yes you do

MRS COADE You must admit that your master is a very strange person

MATEY wriggling He is a little odd maam That is why every one
calls him Lob not Mr Lob

JOANNA He is so odd that it has got on my nerves that we have been
invited here for some sort of horrid experiment MATEY shivers You
look as if you thought so too

MATEY Oh no miss Ihe The words he would keep back elude him
You shouldnt have come ladies you didnt ought to have come

For the moment he is sorrier for them than for himself

LADY CAROLINE Shouldnt have come Now my man what do you mean
by that

MATEY Nothing my lady II just mean why did you come if you are
the kind he thinks

MABEL The kind he thinks

ALICE What kind does he think Now we are getting at it

MATEY guardedly I havent a notion maam

LADY CAROLINE whose ws must henceforth be supplied by the judicious
reader Then it is not necessarily our virtue that makes Lob
interested in us

MATEY thoughtlessly No my lady oh no my lady This makes an
unfavourable impression

MRS COADE And yet you know he is rather lovable

MATEY carried away He is maam He is the most lovable old
devilI beg pardon maam

JOANNA You scarcely need to for in a way it is true I have seen him
out there among his flowers petting them talking to them coaxing
them till they simply had to grow

ALICE making use perhaps of the wrong adjective It is certainly a
divine garden

They all look at the unblinking enemy

MRS COADE not more deceived than the others How lovely it is in
the moonlight Roses roses all the way Dreamily It is like a
hat I once had when I was young

ALICE Lob is such an amazing gardener that I believe he could even
grow hats

LADY CAROLINE who will catch it for this He is a wonderful
gardener but is that quite nice at his age What is his age man

MATEY shuffling He wont tell my lady I think he is frightened
that the police would step in if they knew how old he is They do say
in the village that they remember him seventy years ago looking just
as he does today

ALICE Absurd

MATEY Yes maam but there are his razors

LADY CAROLINE Razors

MATEY You wont know about razors my lady not being marriedas
yetexcuse me But a married lady can tell a mans age by the number
of his razors A little scared If you saw his razorsthere is a
little world of them from patents of the present day back to
implements so horrible you can picture him with them in his hand
scraping his way through the ages

LADY CAROLINE You amuse one to an extent Was he ever married

MATEY too lightly He has quite forgotten my lady Reflecting
How long ago is it since Merry England

LADY CAROLINE Why do you ask

MABEL In Queen Elizabeths time wasnt it

MATEY He says he is all that is left of Merry England that little
man

MABEL who has brothers Lob I think there is a famous cricketer
called Lob

MRS COADE Wasnt there a Lob in Shakespeare No of course I am
thinking of Robin Goodfellow

LADY CAROLINE The names are so alike

JOANNA Robin Goodfellow was Puck

MRS COADE with natural elation That is what was in my head Lob
was another name for Puck

JOANNA Well he is certainly rather like what Puck might have grown
into if he had forgotten to die And by the way I remember now he
does call his flowers by the old Elizabethan names

MATEY He always calls the Nightingale Philomel missif that is any
help

ALICE who is not omniscient None whatever Tell me this did he
specially ask you all for Midsummer week

They assent

MATEY who might more judiciously have remained silent He would

MRS COADE Now what do you mean

MATEY He always likes them to be here on Midsummer night maam

ALICE Them Whom

MATEY Them who have that in common

MABEL What can it be

MATEY I dont know

LADY CAROLINE suddenly introspective I hope we are all nice women
We dont know each other very well Certain suspicions are reborn in
various breasts Does anything startling happen at those times

MATEY I dont know

JOANNA Why I believe this is Midsummer Eve

MATEY Yes miss it is The villagers know it They are all inside
their houses tonightwith the doors barred

LADY CAROLINE Because ofof him

MATEY He frightens them There are stories

ALICE What alarms them Tell usorShe brandishes the telegram

MATEY I know nothing for certain maam I have never done it myself
He has wanted me to but I wouldnt

MABEL Done what

MATEY with fine appeal Oh maam dont ask me Be merciful to me
maam I am not bad naturally It was just going into domestic
service that did for me the accident of being flung among bad
companions Its touch and go how the poor turn out in this world
all depends on your taking the right or the wrong turning

MRS COADE the lenient I daresay that is true

MATEY under this touch of sun When I was young maam I was
offered a clerkship in the city If I had taken it there wouldnt be
a more honest man alive today I would give the world to be able to
begin over again

He means every word of it though the flowers would here if they
dared burst into ironical applause

MRS COADE It is very sad Mrs Dearth

ALICE I am sorry for him but still

MATEY his eyes turning to LADY CAROLINE What do you say my lady

LADY CAROLINE briefly As you ask me I should certainly say jail

MATEY desperately If you will say no more about this maamIll
give you a tip that is worth it

ALICE Ah now you are talking

LADY CAROLINE Dont listen to him

MATEY lowering You are the one that is hardest on me

LADY CAROLINE Yes I flatter myself I am

MATEY forgetting himself You might take a wrong turning yourself
my lady

LADY CAROLINE I How dare you man

But the flowers rather like him for this it is possibly what gave
them a certain idea

JOANNA near the keyhole of the diningroom door The men are
rising

ALICE hurriedly Very well Matey we agreeif the tip is good
enough

LADY CAROLINE You will regret this

MATEY I think not my lady Its this I wouldnt go out tonight if
he asks you Go into the garden if you like The garden is all
right He really believes this I wouldnt go farthernot
tonight

MRS COADE But he never proposes to us to go farther Why should he
tonight

MATEY I dont know maam but dont any of you godevilishly
except you my lady I should like you to go

LADY CAROLINE Fellow

They consider this odd warning

ALICE Shall I They nod and she tears up the telegram

MATEY with a gulp Thank you maam

LADY CAROLINE You should have sent that telegram off

JOANNA You are sure you have told us all you know Matey

MATEY Yes miss But at the door he is more generous Above all
ladies I wouldnt go into the wood

MABEL The wood Why there is no wood within a dozen miles of here

MATEY NO maam But all the same I wouldnt go into it ladiesnot
if I was you

With this cryptic warning he leaves them and any discussion of it
is prevented by the arrival of their host LOB is very small and
probably no one has ever looked so old except some newborn child To
such as watch him narrowly as the ladies now do for the first time
he has the effect of seeming to be hollow an attenuated piece of
piping insufficiently inflated one feels that if he were to strike
against a solid object he might rebound feebly from it which would
be less disconcerting if he did not obviously know this and carefully
avoid the furniture he is so light that the subject must not be
mentioned in his presence but it is possible that were the ladies
to combine they could blow him out of a chair He enters
portentously his hands behind his back as if every bit of him from
his domed head to his little feet were the physical expressions of
the deep thoughts within him then suddenly he whirls round to make
his guests jump This amuses him vastly and he regains his gravity
with difficulty He addresses MRS COADE

LOB Standing dear lady Pray be seated

He finds a chair for her and pulls it away as she is about to sit or
kindly pretends to be about to do so for he has had this quaint
conceit every evening since she arrived

MRS COADE who loves children You naughty

LOB eagerly It is quite a flirtation isnt it

He rolls on a chair kicking out his legs in an ecstasy of
satisfaction But the ladies are not certain that he is the little
innocent they have hitherto thought him The advent of MR COADE and
MR PURDIE presently adds to their misgivings MR COADE is old a
sweet pippin of a man with a gentle smile for all he must have
suffered much you conclude incorrectly to acquire that tolerant
smile Sometimes as when he sees other people at work a wistful
look takes the place of the smile and MR COADE fidgets like one who
would be elsewhere Then there rises before his eyes the room called
the study in his house whose walls are lined with boxes marked A B
C to Z and A B C to K These contain dusty notes for his
great work on the Feudal System the notes many years old the work
strictly speaking not yet begun He still speaks at times of
finishing it but never of beginning it He knows that in more
favourable circumstances for instance if he had been a poor man
instead of pleasantly well to do he could have flung himself avidly
into that noble undertaking but he does not allow his secret sorrow
to embitter him or darken the house Quickly the vision passes and
he is again his bright self Idleness he says in his game way has
its recompenses It is charming now to see how he at once crosses to
his wife solicitous for her comfort He is bearing down on her with
a footstool when MR PURDIE comes from the diningroom He is the
most brilliant of our company recently notable in debate at Oxford
where he was runnerup for the presidentship of the Union and only
lost it because the other man was less brilliant Since then he has
gone to the bar on Monday married on Tuesday and had a brief on
Wednesday Beneath his brilliance and making charming company for
himself he is aware of intellectual powers beyond his years As we
are about to see he has made one mistake in his life which he is
bravely facing

ALICE Is my husband still sampling the port Mr Purdie

PURDIE with a disarming smile for the absent DEARTH Do you know I
believe he is Do the ladies like our proposal Coade

COADE I have not told them of it yet The fact is I am afraid that
it might tire my wife too much Do you feel equal to a little
exertion tonight Coady or is your foot troubling you

MRS COADE the kind creature I have been resting it Coady

COADE propping it on the footstool There Is that more
comfortable Presently dear if you are agreeable we are all going
out for a walk

MRS COADE quoting MATEY The garden is all right

PURDIE with jocular solemnity Ah but it is not to be the garden
We are going farther afield We have an adventure for tonight Get
thick shoes and a wrap Mrs Dearth all of you

LADY CAROLINE with but languid interest Where do you propose to
take us

PURDIE To find a mysterious wood With the word wood the ladies
are blown upright Their eyes turn to LOB who however has never
looked more innocent

JOANNE Are you being funny Mr Purdie You know quite well that
there are not any trees for miles around You have said yourself that
it is the one blot on the landscape

COADE almost as great a humorist as PURDIE Ah on ordinary
occasions But allow us to point out to you Miss Joanna that this
is Midsummer Eve

LOB again comes sharply under female observation

PURDIE Tell them what you told us Lob

LOB with a pout for the credulous It is all nonsense of course
just foolish talk of the villagers They say that on Midsummer Eve
there is a strange wood in this part of the country

ALICE lowering Where

PURDIE Ah that is one of its most charming features It is never
twice in the same place apparently It has been seen on different
parts of the Downs and on More Common once it was close to Radley
village and another time about a mile from the sea Oh a sporting
wood

LADY CAROLINE And Lob is anxious that we should all go and look for
it

COADE Not he Lob is the only sceptic in the house Says it is all
rubbish and that we shall be sillies if we go But we believe eh
Purdie

PURDIE waggishly Rather

LOB the artful Just wasting the evening Let us have a round game
at cards here instead

PURDIE grandly No sir I am going to find that wood

JOANNA What is the good of it when it is found

PURDIE We shall wander in it deliciously listening to a new sort of
bird called the Philomel

LOB is behaving in the most exemplary manner making sweet little
clucking sounds

JOANNA doubtfully Shall we keep together Mr Purdie

PURDIE No we must hunt in pairs

JOANNA converted I think it would be rather fun Come on Coady
Ill lace your boots for you I am sure your poor foot will carry you
nicely

ALICE Miss Trout wait a moment Lob has this wonderful wood any
special properties

LOB Pooh Theres no wood

LADY CAROLINE Youve never seen it

LOB Not I I dont believe in it

ALICE Have any of the villagers ever been in it

LOB dreamily So its said so its said

ALICE What did they say were their experiences

LOB That isnt known They never came back

JOANNA promptly resuming her seat Never came back

LOB Absurd of course You see in the morning the wood was gone and
so they were gone too He clucks again

JOANNA I dont think I like this wood

MRS COADE It certainly is Midsummer Eve

COADE remembering that women are not yet civilised Of course if you
ladies are against it we will drop the idea It was only a bit of
fun

ALICE with a malicious eye on LOB Yes better give it upto please
Lob

PURDIE Oh all right Lob What about that round game of cards

The proposal meets with approval

LOB bursting into tears I wanted you to go I had set my heart on
your going It is the thing I wanted and it isnt good for me not to
get the thing I want

He creeps under the table and threatens the hands that would draw
him out

MRS COADE Good gracious he has wanted it all the time You wicked
Lob

ALICE Now you see there is something in it

COADE Nonsense Mrs Dearth it was only a joke

MABEL melting Dont cry Lobby

LOB Nobody cares for menobody loves me And I need to be loved

Several of them are on their knees to him

JOANNA Yes we do we all love you Nice nice Lobby

MABEL Dear Lob I am so fond of you

JOANNA Dry his eyes with my own handkerchief He holds up his eyes
but is otherwise inconsolable

LADY CAROLINE Dont pamper him

LOB furiously I need to be pampered

MRS COADE You funny little man Let us go at once and look for his
wood

All feel that thus alone can his tears be dried

JOANNA Boots and cloaks hats forward Come on Lady Caroline just
to show you are not afraid of Matey

There is a general exodus and LOB left alone emerges from his
temporary retirement He ducks victoriously but presently is on his
knees again distressfully regarding some flowers that have fallen
from their bowl

LOB Poor bruised one it was I who hurt you Lob is so sorry Lie
there To another Pretty pretty let me see where you have a
pain You fell on your head is this the place Now I make it better
Oh little rascal you are not hurt at all you just pretend Oh
dear oh dear Sweetheart dont cry you are now prettier than ever
You were too tall Oh how beautifully you smell now that you are
small He replaces the wounded tenderly in their bowl rink drink
Now you are happy again The little rascal smiles All smile
pleasenod headsaha aha You love LobLob loves you

JOANNA and MR PURDIE stroll in by the window

JOANNA What were you saying to them Lob

LOB I was saying Twos company threes none

He departs with a final cluck

JOANNA That manhe suspects

This is a very different JOANNA from the one who has so far flitted
across our scene It is also a different PURDIE In company they
seldom look at each other though when the one does so the eyes of
the other magnetically respond We have seen them trivial almost
cynical but now we are to greet them as they know they really are
the great stronghearted man and his natural mate in the grip of the
master passion For the moment LOBS words have unnerved JOANNA and
it is JOHN PURDIEs dear privilege to soothe her

PURDIE No one minds Lob My dear oh my dear

JOANNA faltering Yes but he saw you kiss my hand Jack if Mabel
were to suspect

PURDIE happily There is nothing for her to suspect

JOANNA eagerly No there isnt is there She is desirous ever to
be without a flaw Jack I am not doing anything wrong am I

PURDIE You

With an adorable gesture she gives him one of her hands and manlike
he takes the other also

JOANNA Mabel is your wife Jack I should so hate myself if I did
anything that was disloyal to her

PURDIE pressing her hand to her eyes as if counting them in the
strange manner of lovers Those eyes could never be disloyalmy
lady of the nutbrown eyes He holds her from him surveying her
and is scorched in the flame of her femininity Oh the sveldtness
of you Almost with reproach Joanna why are you so sveldt

For his sake she would be less sveldt if she could but she cant
She admits her failure with eyes grown still larger and he envelops
her so that he may not see her Thus men seek safety

JOANNA while out of sight All I want is to help her and you

PURDIE I knowhow well I knowmy dear brave love

JOANNA I am very fond of Mabel Jack I should like to be the best
friend she has in the world

PURDIE You are dearest No woman ever had a better friend

JOANNA And yet I dont think she really likes me I wonder why

PURDIE who is the bigger brained of the two It is just that Mabel
doesnt understand Nothing could make me say a word against my wife

JOANNA sternly I wouldnt listen to you if you did

PURDIE I love you all the more dear for saying that But Mabel is a
cold nature and she doesnt understand

JOANNA thinking never of herself but only of him She doesnt
appreciate your finer qualities

PURDIE ruminating Thats it But of course I am difficult I always
was a strange strange creature I often think Joanna that I am
rather like a flower that has never had the sun to shine on it nor
the rain to water it

JOANNA You break my heart

PURDIE with considerable enjoyment I suppose there is no more
lonely man than I walking the earth today

JOANNA beating her wings It is so mournful

PURDIE It is the thought of you that sustains me elevates me You
shine high above me like a star

JOANNA No no I wish I was wonderful but I am not

PURDIE You have made me a better man Joanna

JOANNA I am so proud to think that

PURDIE You have made me kinder to Mabel

JOANNA I am sure you are always kind to her

PURDIE Yes I hope so But I think now of special little ways of
giving her pleasure That nevertobeforgotten day when we first
met you and I

JOANNA fluttering nearer to him That tragic lovely day by the
weir Oh Jack

PURDIE Do you know how in gratitude I spent the rest of that day

JOANNA crooning Tell me

PURDIE I read to Mabel aloud for an hour I did it out of kindness to
her because I had met you

JOANNA It was dear of you

PURDIE Do you remember that first time my armsyour waistyou are
so fluid Joanna Passionately Why are you so fluid

JOANNA downcast I cant help it Jack

PURDIE I gave her a ruby bracelet for that

JOANNA It is a gem You have given that lucky woman many lovely
things

PURDIE It is my invariable custom to go straight off and buy Mabel
something whenever you have been sympathetic to me Those new
earrings of hersthey are in memory of the first day you called me
Jack Her Paquin gownthe one with the beadswas because you let me
kiss you

JOANNA I didnt exactly let you

PURDIE No but you have such a dear way of giving in

JOANNA Jack she hasnt worn that gown of late

PURDIE No nor the jewels I think she has some sort of idea now that
when I give her anything nice it means that you have been nice to me
She has rather a suspicious nature Mabel she never used to have it
but it seems to be growing on her I wonder why I wonder why

In this wonder which is shared by JOANNA their lips meet and MABEL
who has been about to enter from the garden quietly retires

JOANNA Was that any one in the garden

PURDIE returning from a quest There is no one there now

JOANNA I am sure I heard some one If it was Mabel With a
perspicacity that comes of knowledge of her sex Jack if she saw us
she will think you were kissing me

These fears are confirmed by the rather odd bearing of MABEL who now
joins their select party

MABEL apologetically I am so sorry to interrupt you Jack but
please wait a moment before you kiss her again Excuse me Joanna
She quietly draws the curtains thus shutting out the garden and any
possible onlooker I did not want the others to see you they might
not understand how noble you are Jack You can go on now

Having thus passed the time of day with them she withdraws by the
door leaving JACK bewildered and JOANNA knowing all about it

JOANNA How extraordinary Of all the Oh but how contemptible
She sweeps to the door and calls to MABEL by name

MABEL returning with promptitude Did you call me Joanna

JOANNA guardedly I insist on an explanation With creditable
hauteur What were you doing in the garden Mabel

MABEL who has not been so quiet all day I was looking for something
I have lost

PURDIE hope springing eternal Anything important

MABEL I used to fancy it Jack It is my husbands love You dont
happen to have picked it up Joanna If so and you dont set great
store by it I should like it backthe pieces I mean

MR PURDIE is about lo reply to this when JOANNA rather wisely fills
the breach

JOANNA Mabel II will not be talked to in that way To imply that
Ithat your husbandoh shame

PURDIE finely I must say Mabel that I am a little disappointed in
you I certainly understood that you had gone upstairs to put on your
boots

MABEL Poor old Jack She muses A woman like that

JOANNA changing her comment in the moment of utterance I forgive
you Mabel you will be sorry for this afterwards

PURDIE warningly but still reluctant to think less well of his
wife Not a word against Joanna Mabel If you knew how nobly she
has spoken of you

JOANNA imprudently She does know She has been listening

There is a moments danger of the scene degenerating into something
midVictorian Fortunately a chivalrous man is present to lift it to a
higher plane JOHN PURDIE is one to whom subterfuge of any kind is
abhorrent if he has not spoken out before it is because of his
reluctance to give MABEL pain He speaks out now and seldom
probably has he proved himself more worthy

PURDIE This is a mans business I must be open with you now Mabel
it is the manlier way If you wish it I shall always be true to you
in word and deed it is your right But I cannot pretend that Joanna
is not the one woman in the world for me If I had met her before
youits Kismet I suppose He swells

JOANNA from a chair Too late too late

MABEL although the woman has seen him swell I suppose you never
knew what true love was till you met her Jack

PURDIE You force me to say it Joanna and I are as one person We
have not a thought at variance We are one rather than two

MABEL looking at JOANNA Yes and thats the one With the
cheapest sarcasm I am so sorry to have marred your lives

PURDIE If any blame there is it is all mine she is as spotless as
the driven snow The moment I mentioned love to her she told me to
desist

MABEL Not she

JOANNA So you were listening The obtuseness of MABEL is very
strange to her Mabel dont you see how splendid he is

MABEL Not quite Joanna

She goes away She is really a better woman than this but never
capable of scaling that higher plane to which he has as it were
offered her a hand

JOANNA How lovely of you Jack to take it all upon yourself

PURDIE simply It is the mans privilege

JOANNA Mabel has such a horrid way of seeming to put people in the
wrong

PURDIE Have you noticed that Poor Mabel it is not an enviable
quality

JOANNA despondently I dont think I care to go out now She has
spoilt it all She has taken the innocence out of it Jack

PURDIE a rock We must be brave and not mind her Ah Joanna if we
had met in time If only I could begin again To be battered for ever
just because I once took the wrong turning it isnt fair

JOANNA emerging from his arms The wrong turning Now who was
saying that a moment agoabout himself Why it was Matey

A footstep is heard

PURDIE for the first time losing patience with his wife Is that her
coming back again Its too bad

But the intruder is MRS DEARTH and he greets her with relief

Ah it is you Mrs Dearth

ALICE Yes it is but thank you for telling me Mr Purdie I dont
intrude do I

JOANNA descending to the lower plane on which even goddesses snap
Why should you

PURDIE Rather not We werehoping it would be you We want to start
on the walk I cant think what has become of the others We have
been looking for them everywhere He glances vaguely round the room
as if they might so far have escaped detection

ALICE pleasantly Well do go on looking under that flowerpot
would be a good place It is my husband I am in search of

PURDIE who likes her best when they are in different rooms Shall I
rout him out for you

ALICE How too unutterably kind of you Mr Purdie I hate to trouble
you but it would be the sort of service one never forgets

PURDIE You know I believe you are chaffing me

ALICE No no I am incapable of that

PURDIE I wont be a moment

ALICE Miss Trout and I will await your return with illconcealed
impatience

They await it across a table the newcomer in a reverie and JOANNA
watching her Presently MRS DEARTH looks up and we may notice that
she has an attractive screw of the mouth which denotes humour

Yes I suppose you are right I dare say I am

JOANNA puzzled I didnt say anything

ALICE I thought I heard you say That hateful Dearth woman coming
butting in where she is not wanted

Joanna draws up her sveldt figure but a screw of one mouth often
calls for a similar demonstration from another and both ladies
smile They nearly become friends

JOANNA You certainly have good ears

ALICE drawling Yes they have always been rather admired

JOANNA snapping By the painters for whom you sat when you were an
artists model

ALICE measuring her So that has leaked out has it

JOANNA ashamed I shouldnt have said that

ALICE their brief friendship over Do you think I care whether you
know or not

JOANNA making an effort to be good Im sure you dont Still it
was cattish of me

ALICE It was

JOANNA in flame I dont see it

MRS DEARTH laughs and forgets her and with the entrance of a man
from the dining room JOANNA drifts elsewhere Not so much a man this
newcomer as the relic of what has been a good one it is the most he
would ever claim for himself Sometimes brandy in hand he has
visions of the WILL DEARTH he used to be clear of eye sees him but
a field away singing at his easel or fishingrod in hand leaping a
stile Our WILL stares after the fellow for quite a long time so
long that the two melt into the one who finishes LOBs brandy He is
scarcely intoxicated as he appears before the lady of his choice but
he is shaky and has watery eyes

ALICE has had a rather wild love for this man or for that other one
and he for her but somehow it has gone whistling down the wind We
may expect therefore to see them at their worst when in each others
company

DEARTH who is not without a humorous outlook on his own degradation
I am uncommonly flattered Alice to hear that you have sent for me
It quite takes me aback

ALICE with cold distaste It isnt your company I want Will

DEARTH You know I felt that Purdie must have delivered your message
wrongly

ALICE I want you to come with us on this mysterious walk and keep an
eye on Lob

DEARTH On poor little Lob Oh surely not

ALICE I cant make the man out I want you to tell me something when
he invited us here do you think it was you or me he specially
wanted

DEARTH Oh you He made no bones about it said there was something
about you that made him want uncommonly to have you down here

ALICE Will try to remember this did he ask us for any particular
time

DEARTH Yes he was particular about its being Midsummer week

ALICE Ah I thought so Did he say what it was about me that made him
want to have me here in Midsummer week

DEARTH No but I presumed it must be your fascination Alice

ALICE Just so Well I want you to come out with us tonight to watch
him

DEARTH CrackinmyeyeTommy spy on my host And such a harmless
little chap too Excuse me Alice Besides I have an engagement

ALICE An engagementwith the port decanter I presume

DEARTH A good guess but wrong The decanter is now but an empty
shell  Still how you know me My engagement is with a quiet cigar
in the garden

ALICE Your hand is so unsteady you wont be able to light the
match

DEARTH I shall just manage He triumphantly proves the exact truth
of his statement

ALICE A nice hand for an artist

DEARTH One would scarcely call me an artist nowadays

ALICE Not so far as any work is concerned

DEARTH Not so far as having any more pretty dreams to paint is
concerned  Grinning at himself Wonder why I have become such a
waster Alice

ALICE I suppose it was always in you

DEARTH with perhaps a glimpse of the fishingrod I suppose so and
yet I was rather a good sort in the days when I went courting you

ALICE Yes I thought so Unlucky days for me as it has turned out

DEARTH heartily Yes a bad job for you Puzzling unsteadily over
himself I didnt know I was a wrong un at the time thought quite
well of myself thought a vast deal more of you CrackinmyeyeTommy
how I used to leap out of bed at  AM all agog to be at my easel
blood ran through my veins in those days And now Im middleaged
and done for Funny Dont know how it has come about nor what has
made the music mute Mildly curious When did you begin to despise
me Alice

ALICE When I got to know you really Will a long time ago

DEARTH bleary of eye Yes I think that is true It was a long time
ago and before I had begun to despise myself It wasnt till I knew
you had no opinion of me that I began to go down hill You will grant
that wont you and that I did try for a bit to fight on If you had
cared for me I wouldnt have come to this surely

ALICE Well I found I didnt care for you and I wasnt hypocrite
enough to pretend I did Thats blunt but you used to admire my
bluntness

DEARTH The bluntness of you the adorable wildness of you you
untamed thing  There were never any shades in you kiss or kill was
your motto Alice I felt from the first moment I saw you that you
would love me or knife me

Memories of their shooting star flare in both of them for as long as
a sheet of paper might take to burn

ALICE I didnt knife you

DEARTH No I suppose that was where you made the mistake It is hard
on you old lady Becoming watery I suppose its too late to try
to patch things up

ALICE Lets be honest it is too late Will  DEARTH whose tears
would smell of brandy Perhaps if we had had childrenPity

ALICE A blessing I should think seeing what sort of a father they
would have had

DEARTH ever reasonable I dare say youre right Well Alice I know
that somehow its my fault Im sorry for you

ALICE Im sorry for myself If I hadnt married you what a different
woman I should be What a fool I was

DEARTH Ah Three things they say come not back to men nor womenthe
spoken word the past life and the neglected opportunity Wonder if
we should make any more of them Alice if they did come back to us

ALICE You wouldnt

DEARTH avoiding a hiccup I guess youre right

ALICE But I

DEARTH sincerely Yes what a boon for you But I hope its not
Freddy FinchFallowe you would put in my place I know he is
following you about again He is far from threatening her he has
too beery an opinion of himself for that

ALICE He followed me about as you put it before I knew you I dont
know why I quarrelled with him

DEARTH Your heart told you that he was no good Alice

ALICE My heart told me that you were So it wasnt of much service to
me my heart

DEARTH The Honourable Freddy FinchFallowe is a rotter

ALICE ever inflammable You are certainly an authority on the
subject

DEARTH with the sad smile of the disillusioned You have me there
After which brief but pleasant little connubial chat he pursued
his dishonoured way into the garden

He is however prevented doing so for the moment by the return of the
others  They are all still in their dinner clothes though wearing
wraps They crowd in through the door chattering

LOB Here they are Are you ready dear lady

MRS COADE seeing that DEARTHs hand is on the window curtains Are
you not coming with us to find the wood Mr Dearth

DEARTH Alas I am unavoidably detained You will find me in the
garden when you come back

JOANNA whose sense of humour has been restored If we ever do come
back

DEARTH Precisely With a groggy bow Should we never meet again
Alice fare thee well Purdie if you find the tree of knowledge in
the wood bring me back an apple

PURDIE I promise

LOB Come quickly Matey mustnt see me He is turning out the
lights

LADY CAROLINE pouncing Matey What difference would that make
Lob

LOB He would take me off to bed its past my time

COADE not the least gay of the company You know old fellow you
make it very difficult for us to embark upon this adventure in the
proper eerie spirit

DEARTH Well Im for the garden

He walks to the window and the others are going out by the door But
they do not go There is a hitch somewhereat the window apparently
for DEARTH having begun to draw the curtains apart lets them fall
like one who has had a shock The others remember long afterwards his
grave face as he came quietly back and put his cigar on the table
The room is in darkness save for the light from one lamp

PURDIE wondering How now Dearth

DEARTH What is it we get in that wood Lob

ALICE Ah he wont tell us that

LOB shrinking Come on

ALICE impressed by the change that has come over her husband Tell
us first

LOB forced to the disclosure They say that in the wood you get what
nearly everybody here is longing fora second chance

The ladies are simultaneously enlightened

JOANNA speaking for all So that is what we have in common

COADE with gentle regret I have often thought Coady that if I
had a second chance I should be a useful man instead of just a nice
lazy one

ALICE morosely A second chance

LOB Come on

PURDIE gaily Yes to the woodthe wood

DEARTH as they are going out by the door Stop why not go this
way

He pulls the curtains apart and there comes a sudden indrawing of
breath from all for no garden is there now In its place is an
endless wood of great trees the nearest of them has come close to
the window It is a sombre wood with splashes of moonshine and of
blackness standing very still in it

The party in the drawingroom are very still also there is scarcely a
cry or a movement It is perhaps strange that the most obviously
frightened is LOB who calls vainly for MATEY  The first articulate
voice is DEARTHS

DEARTH very quietly Any one ready to risk it

PURDIE after another silence Of course there is nothing in itjust

DEARTH grimly Of course Going out Purdie

PURDIE draws back

MRS DEARTH the only one who is undaunted A second chance She is
looking at her husband They all look at him as if he had been a
leader once

DEARTH with his sweet mournful smile I shall be back in a
momentprobably

As he passes into the wood his hands rise as if a hammer  had tapped
him on the forehead He is soon lost to view

LADY CAROLINE after a long pause He does not come back

MRS COADE Its horrible

She steals off by the door to her room calling to her husband to do
likewise He takes a step after her and stops in the grip of the two
words that holds them all The stillness continues At last MRS
PURDIE goes out into the wood her hands raised and is swallowed up
by it

PURDIE Mabel

ALICE sardonically You will have to go now Mr Purdie

He looks at JOANNA and they go out together one tap of the hammer
for each

LOB Thats enough Warningly Dont you go Mrs Dearth Youll
catch it if you go

ALICE A second chance

She goes out unflinching

LADY CAROLINE One would like to know

She goes out MRS COADES voice is heard from the stair calling to
her husband He hesitates but follows LADY CAROLINE To LOB now alone
comes MATEY with a tray of coffee cups

MATEY as he places his tray on the table It is past your bedtime
sir Say goodnight to the ladies and come along

LOB Matey look

MATEY looks

MATEY shrinking Great heavens then its true

LOB Yes but II wasnt sure

MATEY approaches the window cautiously to peer out and his master
gives him a sudden push that propels him into the wood LOBs back is
toward us as he stands alone staring out upon the unknown He is
terrified still yet quivers of rapture are running up and down his
little frame



ACT II

We are translated to the depths of the wood in the enchantment of a
moonlight night In some other glade a nightingale is singing in
this one in proud motoring attire recline two mortals whom we have
known in different conditions the second chance has converted them
into husband and wife The man of gross muddy build lies luxurious
on his back exuding affluence a prominent part of him heaving
playfully like some little wave that will not rest in a still sea A
handkerchief over his face conceals from us what Colossus he may be
but his mate is our Lady Caroline The nightingale trills on and
Lady Caroline takes up its song

LADY CAROLINE Is it not a lovely night Jim Listen my own to
Philomel he is saying that he is lately married So are we you
ducky thing I feel Jim that I am Rosalind and that you are my
Orlando

The handkerchief being removed MR MATEY is revealed and the
nightingale seeks some farther tree

MATEY What do you say I am Caroliny

LADY CAROLINE clapping her hands My own one dont you think it
would be fun if we were to write poems about each other and pin them
on the tree trunks

MATEY tolerantly Poems I never knew such a lass for highflown
language

LADY CAROLINE Your lass dearest Jims lass

MATEY pulling her ear And dont you forget it

LADY CAROLINE with the curiosity of woman What would you do if I
were to forget it great bear

MATEY Take a stick to you

LADY CAROLINE so proud of him I love to hear you talk like that
it is so virile I always knew that it was a master I needed

MATEY Its what you all need

LADY CAROLINE It is it is you knowing wretch

MATEY Listen Caroliny He touches his money pocket which emits a
crinkly soundthe squeak of angels That is what gets the ladies

LADY CAROLINE How much have you made this week you wonderful man

MATEY blandly Another two hundred or so Thats all just two
hundred or so

LADY CAROLINE caressing her wedding ring My dear golden fetter
listen to him Kiss my fetter Jim

MATEY Wait till I light this cigar

LADY CAROLINE Let me hold the darling match

MATEY Tidylooking Petitey Corona this There was a time when one of
that sort would have run away with two days of my screw

LADY CAROLINE How I should have loved Jim to know you when you were
poor  Fancy your having once been a clerk

MATEY remembering Napoleon and others We all have our beginnings
But it wouldnt have mattered how I began Caroliny I should have
come to the top just the same Becoming a poet himself I am a
climber and there are nails in my boots for the parties beneath me
Boots I tell you if I had been a bootmaker I should have been the
first bootmaker in London

LADY CAROLINE a humourist at last I am sure you would Jim but
should you have made the best boots

MATEY uxoriously wishing that others could have heard this Very
good  Caroliny that is the nearest thing I have heard you say But
its late we had best be strolling back to our RollsRoyce

LADY CAROLINE as they rise I do hope the ground wasnt damp

MATEY Dont matter if it was I was lying on your rug

Indeed we notice now that he has had all the rug and she the bare
ground  JOANNA reaches the glade now an unhappy lady who has got
what she wanted She is in country dress and is unknown to them as
they are to her Who is the mournful party

JOANNA hesitating I wonder sir whether you happen to have seen
my husband I have lost him in the wood

MATEY We are strangers in these parts ourselves missis Have we
passed any one Caroliny

LADY CAROLINE coyly Should we have noticed dear Might it be that
old gent over there After the delightful manner of those happily
wed she has already picked up many of her lovers favourite words and
phrases

JOANNA Oh no my husband is quite young

The woodlander referred to is MR COADE in gala costume at his mouth
a whistle he has made him from some friendly twig To its ravishing
music he is seen pirouetting charmingly among the trees his new
occupation

MATEY signing to the unknown that he is wanted Seems a merry old
cock  Evening to you sir Do you happen to have seen a young
gentleman in the wood lately all by himself and looking for his
wife

COADE with a flourish of his legs Cant say I have

JOANNA dolefully He isnt necessarily by himself and I dont know
that he is looking for me There may be a young lady with him

The more happily married lady smiles and Joanna is quick to take
offence

JOANNA What do you mean by that  LADY CAROLINE neatly Ohoif
you like that better

MATEY Now now nowyour manners Caroliny

COADE Would he be singing or dancing

JOANNA Oh noat least I hope not

COADE an artist to the tips Hope not Odd If he is doing neither I
am not likely to notice him but if I do what name shall I say

JOANNA gloating not Purdie I am Mrs Purdie

COADE I will try to keep a lookout and if I see him   but I am
rather occupied at present   The reference is to his legs and a
new step they are acquiring He sways this way and that and whistle
to lips minuets off in the direction of Paradise

JOANNA looking elsewhere I am sorry I troubled you I see him now

LADY CAROLINE Is he alone

JOANNA glares at her

Ah I see from your face that he isnt

MATEY who has his wench in training Caroliny no awkward
questions  Evening missis and I hope you will get him to go along
with you quietly  Looking after COADE Watch the old codger
dancing

Lighthearted as children they dance after him while JOANNA behind a
tree awaits her lord PURDIE in knickerbockers approaches with
misgivings to make sure that his JOANNA is not in hiding and then he
gambols joyously with a charming confection whose name is MABEL They
chase each other from tree to tree but fortunately not round
JOANNAS tree

MABEL as he catches her No and no and no I dont know you nearly
well enough for that Besides what would your wife say I shall
begin to think you are a very dreadful man Mr Purdie

PURDIE whose sincerity is not to be questioned Surely you might
call me Jack by this time

MABEL heaving Perhaps if you are very good Jack

PURDIE of noble thoughts compact If only Joanna were more like
you

MABEL Like me You mean her face It is awell if it is not
precisely pretty it is a good face Handsomely I dont mind her
face at all I am glad you have got such a dependable little wife
Jack

PURDIE gloomily Thanks

MABEL seated with a moonbeam in her lap What would Joanna have said
if she had seen you just now

PURDIE A wife should be incapable of jealousy

MABEL Joanna jealous But has she any reason Jack tell me who is
the woman

PURDIE restraining himself by a mighty effort for he wishes always
to be true to JOANNA Shall I Mabel shall I

MABEL faltering yet not wholly giving up the chase I cant think
who she is Have I ever seen her

PURDIE Every time you look in a mirror

MABEL with her head on one side How odd Jack that cant be when
I look in a mirror I see only myself

PURDIE gloating How adorably innocent you are Mabel Joanna would
have guessed at once

Slowly his meaning comes to her and she is appalled

MABEL Not that

PURDIE aflame Shall I tell you now

MABEL palpitating exquisitely I dont know I am not sure Jack
try not to say it but if you feel you must say it in such a way
that it would not hurt the feelings of Joanna if she happened to be
passing by as she nearly always is

A little moan from JOANNAS tree is unnoticed

PURDIE I would rather not say it at all than that way He is
touchingly anxious that she should know him as he really is I dont
know Mabel whether you have noticed that I am not like other men
He goes deeply into the very structure of his being All my life I
have been a soul that has had to walk alone Even as a child I had no
hope that it would be otherwise I distinctly remember when I was six
thinking how unlike other children I was  Before I was twelve I
suffered from terrible selfdepreciation I do so still  I suppose
there never was a man who had a more lowly opinion of himself

MABEL Jack you who are so universally admired

PURDIE That doesnt help I remain my own judge I am afraid I am a
dark spirit Mabel Yes yes my dear let me leave nothing untold
however it may damage me in your eyes Your eyes I cannot remember a
time when I did not think of Love as a great consuming passion I
visualised it Mabel as perhaps few have done but always as the
abounding joy that could come to others but never to me I expected
too much of women I suppose I was touched to finer issues than most
That has been my tragedy

MABEL Then you met Joanna

PURDIE Then I met Joanna Yes Foolishly as I now see I thought she
would understand that I was far too deep a nature really to mean the
little things I sometimes said to her I suppose a man was never
placed in such a position before What was I to do Remember I was
always certain that the ideal love could never come to me Whatever
the circumstances I was convinced that my soul must walk alone

MABEL Joanna how could you

PURDIE firmly Not a word against her Mabel if blame there is the
blame is mine

MABEL And so you married her

PURDIE And so I married her

MABEL Out of pity

PURDIE I felt it was a mans part I was such a child in worldly
matters that it was pleasant to me to have the right to pay a womans
bills I enjoyed seeing her garments lying about on my chairs In
time that exultation wore off But I was not unhappy I didnt expect
much I was always so sure that no woman could ever plumb the well of
my emotions

MABEL Then you met me

PURDIE Then I met you

MABEL Too lateneverforeverforevernever They are the saddest
words in the English tongue

PURDIE At the time I thought a still sadder word was Joanna

MABEL What was it you saw in me that made you love me

PURDIE plumbing the well of his emotions I think it was the feeling
that you are so like myself

MABEL with great eyes Have you noticed that Jack Sometimes it has
almost terrified me

PURDIE We think the same thoughts we are not two Mabel we are one
Your hair

MABEL Joanna knows you admire it and for a week she did hers in the
same way

PURDIE I never noticed

MABEL That was why she gave it up And it didnt really suit her
Ruminating I cant think of a good way of doing dear Joannas hair
What is that you are muttering to yourself Jack Dont keep anything
from me

PURDIE I was repeating a poem I have written it is in two words
Mabel Purdie May I teach it to you sweet say Mabel Purdie to
me

MABEL timidly covering his mouth with her little hand If I were to
say it Jack I should be false to Joanna never ask me to be that
Let us go on

PURDIE merciless in his passion Say it Mabel say it See I write
it on the ground with your sunshade

MABEL If it could be Jack Ill whisper it to you

She is whispering it as they wander not two but one farther into
the forest ardently believing in themselves they are not
hypocrites The somewhat bedraggled figure of Joanna follows them
and the nightingale resumes his lovesong Thats all you know you
bird thinks Joanna cynically The nightingale however is not
singing for them nor for her but for another pair he has espied
below They are racing the prize to be for the one who first finds
the spot where the easel was put up last night The hobbledehoy is
sure to be the winner for she is less laden and the father loses
time by singing as he comes Also she is all legs and she started
ahead Brambles adhere to her one boot has been in the water and she
has as many freckles as there are stars in heaven She is as lovely
as you think she is and she is aged the moment when you like your
daughter best A hoot of triumph from her brings her father to the
spot

MARGARET Daddy Daddy I have won Here is the place
CrackinmyeyeTommy

He comes CrackinmyeyeTommy this engaging fellow in tweeds
is MR DEARTH ablaze in happiness and health and a daughter He
finishes his song picked up in the Latin Quarter

DEARTH Yes that is the tree I stuck my easel under last night and
behold the blessed moon behaving more gorgeously than ever I am
sorry to have kept you waiting old moon but you ought to know by
now how time passes Now keep still while I hand you down to
posterity

The easel is erected MARGARET helping by getting in the way

MARGARET critical as an artists daughter should be The moon
is rather pale tonight isnt she

DEARTH Comes of keeping late hours

MARGARET showing off Daddy watch me look at me Please sweet
moon a pleasant expression No no not as if you were sitting or
it that is too professional That is better thank you Now keep it
That is the sort of thing you say to them Dad

DEARTH quickly at work I oughtnt to have brought you out so late
you should be tucked up in your cosy bed at home

MARGARET pursuing a squirrel that isnt there With the pillow
anyhow

DEARTH Except in its proper place

MARGARET wetting the other foot And the sheet over my face

DEARTH Where it oughtnt to be

MARGARET more or less upside down And Daddy tiptoeing in to take it off

DEARTH Which is more than you deserve

MARGARET in a tree Then why does he stand so long at the door And
before he has gone she bursts out laughing for she has been awake
all the time

DEARTH Thats about it What a life But I oughtnt to have brought
you here  Best to have the sheet over you when the moon is about
moonlight is bad for little daughters

MARGARET pelting him with nuts I cant sleep when the moons at the
full she keeps calling to me to get up Perhaps I am her daughter
too

DEARTH Gad you look it tonight

MARGARET Do I Then cant you paint me into the picture as well as
Mamma You could call it A Mother and Daughter or simply Two
ladies if the moon thinks that calling me her daughter would make
her seem too old

DEARTH O matre pulchra filia pulchrior That means O Moonmore
beautiful than any twopennyhalfpenny daughter

MARGARET emerging in an unexpected place Daddy do you really
prefer her

DEARTH Sh Shes not a patch on you its the sort of thing we say
to our sitters to keep them in good humour He surveys ruefully a
great stain on her frock I wish to heaven Margaret we were not
both so fond of appletart  And whats this Catching hold of her
skirt

MARGARET unnecessarily Its a tear

DEARTH I should think it is a tear

MARGARET That boy at the farm did it He kept calling Snubs after me
but I got him down and kicked him in the stomach He is rather a
jolly boy

DEARTH He sounds it Ye Gods what a night

MARGARET considering the picture And what a moon Dad she is not
quite so fine as that

DEARTH Sh I have touched her up

MARGARET Dad Dadwhat a funny man

She has seen MR COADE with whistle enlivening the wood He
pirouettes round them and departs to add to the happiness of others
MARGARET gives an excellent imitation of him at which her father
shakes his head then reprehensibly joins in the dance Her mood
changes she clings to him

MARGARET Hold me tight Daddy I m frightened I think they want to
take you away from me

DEARTH Who gosling

MARGARET I dont know Its too lovely Daddy I wont be able to
keep hold of it

DEARTH What is

MARGARET The worldeverythingand you Daddy most of all Things
that are too beautiful cant last

DEARTH who knows it Now how did you find that out

MARGARET still in his arms I dont know Daddy am I sometimes
stranger than other peoples daughters

DEARTH More of a madcap perhaps

MARGARET solemnly Do you think I am sometimes too full of
gladness

DEARTH My sweetheart you do sometimes run over with it He is at
his easel again

MARGARET persisting To be very gay dearest dear is so near to
being very sad

DEARTH who knows it How did you find that out child

MARGARET I dont know From something in me thats afraid
Unexpectedly Daddy what is a mighthavebeen

DEARTH A mighthavebeen They are ghosts Margaret I daresay I
might have been a great swell of a painter instead of just this
uncommonly happy nobody Or again I might have been a worthless idle
waster of a fellow

MARGARET laughing You

DEARTH Who knows Some little kink in me might have set me off on the
wrong road And that poor soul I might so easily have been might have
had no Margaret My word Im sorry for him

MARGARET So am I She conceives a funny picture The poor old
Daddy wandering about the world without me

DEARTH And there are other mighthavebeenslovely ones but
intangible  Shades Margaret made of sad folks thoughts

MARGARET jigging about I am so glad I am not a shade How awful it
would be Daddy to wake up and find one wasnt alive

DEARTH It would dear

MARGARET Daddy wouldnt it be awful I think men need daughters

DEARTH They do

MARGARET Especially artists

DEARTH Yes especially artists

MARGARET Especially artists

DEARTH Especially artists

MARGARET covering herself with leaves and kicking them off Fame is
not everything

DEARTH Fame is rot daughters are the thing

MARGARET Daughters are the thing

DEARTH Daughters are the thing

MARGARET I wonder if sons would be even nicer

DEARTH Not a patch on daughters The awful thing about a son is that
never neverat least from the day he goes to schoolcan you tell
him that you rather like him By the time he is ten you cant even
take him on your knee  Sons are not worth having Margaret Signed
W Dearth

MARGARET But if you were a mother Dad I daresay he would let you do
it

DEARTH Think so

MARGARET I mean when no one was looking Sons are not so bad Signed
M  Dearth But Im glad you prefer daughters She works her way
toward him on her knees making the tear larger At what age are we
nicest Daddy She has constantly to repeat her questions he is so
engaged with his moon Hie Daddy at what age are we nicest Daddy
hie hie at what age are we nicest

DEARTH Eh Thats a poser I think you were nicest when you were two
and knew your alphabet up to G but fell over at H No you were best
when you were halfpast three or just before you struck six or in
the mumps year when I asked you in the early morning how you were
and you said solemnly I havent tried yet

MARGARET awestruck Did I

DEARTH Such was your answer Struggling with the momentous
question But I am not sure that chickenpox doesnt beat mumps Oh
Lord Im all wrong The nicest time in a fathers life is the year
before she puts up her hair

MARGARET topheavy with pride in herself I suppose that is a
splendid time  But theres a nicer year coming to you Daddy there
is a nicer year coming to you

DEARTH Is there darling

MARGARET Daddy the year she does put up her hair

DEARTH with arrested brush Puts it up for ever You know I am
afraid that when the day for that comes I shant be able to stand it
It will be too exciting My poor heart Margaret

MARGARET rushing at him No no it will be lucky you for it isnt
to be a bit like that I am to be a girl and woman day about for the
first year You will never know which I am till you look at my hair
And even then you wont know for if it is down I shall put it up
and if it is up I shall put it down And so my Daddy will gradually
get used to the idea

DEARTH wryly I see you have been thinking it out

MARGARET gleaming I have been doing more than that Shut your eyes
Dad and I shall give you a glimpse into the future

DEARTH I dont know that I want that the present is so good

MARGARET Shut your eyes please

DEARTH No Margaret

MARGARET Please Daddy

DEARTH Oh all right They are shut

MARGARET Dont open them till I tell you What finger is that

DEARTH The dirty one

MARGARET on her knees among the leaves Daddy now I am putting up
my hair  I have got such a darling of a mirror It is such a darling
mirror I ve got Dad Dad dont look I shall tell you about it It
is a little pool of water  I wish we could take it home and hang it
up Of course the moment my hair is up there will be other changes
also for instance I shall talk quite differently

DEARTH Pooh Where are my matches dear

MARGARET Top pocket waistcoat

DEARTH trying to light his pipe in darkness You were meaning to
frighten me just now

MARGARET No I am just preparing you You see darling I cant call
you Dad when my hair is up I think I shall call you Parent He
growls Parent dear do you remember the days when your Margaret was
a slip of a girl and sat on your knee How foolish we were Parent
in those distant days

DEARTH Shut up Margaret

MARGARET Now I must be more distant to you more like a boy who could
not sit on your knee any more

DEARTH See here I want to go on painting Shall I look now

MARGARET I am not quite sure whether I want you to It makes such a
difference Perhaps you wont know me Even the pool is looking a
little scared The change in her voice makes him open his eyes
quickly She confronts him shyly What do you think Will I do

DEARTH Stand still dear and let me look my fill The Margaret that
is to be

MARGARET the change in his voice falling clammy on her Youll see
me often enough Daddy like this so you dont need to look your
fill You are looking as long as if this were to be the only time

DEARTH with an odd tremor Was I Surely it isnt to be that

MARGARET Be gay Dad Bumping into him and round him and over him
You will be sick of Margaret with her hair up before you are done
with her

DEARTH I expect so

MARGARET Shut up Daddy She waggles her head and down comes her
hair Daddy I know what you are thinking of You are thinking what
a handful she is going to be

DEARTH Well I guess she is

MARGARET surveying him from another angle Now you are thinking
aboutabout my being in love some day

DEARTH with unnecessary warmth Rot

MARGARET reassuringly I wont you know no never Oh I have
quite decided so dont be afraid Disordering his hair Will you
hate him at first Daddy Daddy will you hate him Will you hate
him Daddy

DEARTH at work Whom

MARGARET Well if there was

DEARTH If there was what darling

MARGARET You know the kind of thing I mean quite well Would you
hate him at first

DEARTH I hope not I should want to strangle him but I wouldnt hate
him

MARGARET I would That is to say if I liked him

DEARTH If you liked him how could you hate him

MARGARET For daring

DEARTH Daring what

MARGARET You know Sighing But of course I shall have no say in
the matter You will do it all You do everything for me

DEARTH with a groan I cant help it

MARGARET You will even write my loveletters if I ever have any to
write which I wont

DEARTH ashamed Surely to goodness Margaret I will leave you alone
to do that

MARGARET Not you you will try to but you wont be able

DEARTH in a hopeless attempt at selfdefence I want you you see
to do everything exquisitely I do wish I could leave you to do
things a little more for yourself I suppose its owing to my having
had to be father and mother both I knew nothing practically about
the bringing up of children and of course I couldnt trust you to a
nurse

MARGARET severely Not you so sure you could do it better yourself
Thats you all over Daddy do you remember how you taught me to
balance a biscuit on my nose like a puppy

DEARTH sadly Did I

MARGARET You called me Rover

DEARTH I deny that

MARGARET And when you said snap I caught the biscuit in my mouth

DEARTH Horrible

MARGARET gleaming Daddy I can do it still Putting a biscuit on
her nose Here is the last of my supper Say snap Daddy

DEARTH Not I

MARGARET Say snap please

DEARTH I refuse

MARGARET Daddy

DEARTH Snap She catches the biscuit in her mouth Let that be the
last time Margaret

MARGARET Except just once more I dont mean now but when my hair is
really up If I should ever have aa Margaret of my own come in and
see me Daddy in my white bed and say snapand Ill have the
biscuit ready

DEARTH turning away his head Right O

MARGARET Dad if I ever should marry not that I will but if I
shouldat the marriage ceremony will you let me be the one who says
I do

DEARTH I suppose I deserve this

MARGARET coaxingly You think I m pretty dont you Dad whatever
other people say

DEARTH Not so bad

MARGARET I know I have nice ears

DEARTH They are all right now but I had to work on them for months

MARGARET You dont mean to say that you did my ears

DEARTH Rather

MARGARET grown humble My dimple is my own

DEARTH I am glad you think so I wore out the point of my little
finger over that dimple

MARGARET Even my dimple Have I anything that is really mine A bit
of my nose or anything

DEARTH When you were a babe you had a laugh that was all your own

MARGARET Havent I it now

DEARTH Its gone He looks ruefully at her Ill tell you how it
went We were fishing in a streamthat is to say I was wading and
you were sitting on my shoulders holding the rod We didnt catch
anything Somehow or anotherI cant think how I did ityou
irritated me and I answered you sharply

MARGARET gasping I cant believe that

DEARTH Yes it sounds extraordinary but I did It gave you a shock
and for the moment the world no longer seemed a safe place to you
your faith in me had always made it safe till then You were suddenly
not even sure of your bread and butter and a frightened tear came to
your eyes I was in a nice state about it I can tell you He is in
a nice state about it still

MARGARET Silly Bewildered But what has that to do with my laugh
Daddy

DEARTH The laugh that children are born with lasts just so long as
they have perfect faith To think that it was I who robbed you of
yours

MARGARET Dont dear I am sure the laugh just went off with the tear
to comfort it and they have been playing about that stream ever
since They have quite forgotten us so why should we remember them
Cheeky little beasts  Shall I tell you my farthest back
recollection In some awe I remember the first time I saw the
stars I had never seen night and then I saw it and the stars
together Crackinmyeye Tommy it isnt every one who can boast of
such a lovely lovely recollection for their earliest is it

DEARTH I was determined your earliest should be a good one

MARGARET blankly Do you mean to say you planned it

DEARTH Rather Most peoples earliest recollection is of some trivial
thing how they cut their finger or lost a piece of string I was
resolved my Margarets should be something bigger I was poor but I
could give her the stars

MARGARET clutching him round the legs Oh how you love me
Daddikins

DEARTH Yes I do rather

A vagrant woman has wandered in their direction one whom the shrill
winds of life have lashed and bled here and there ragged graces
still cling to her and unruly passion smoulders but she once a
dear fierce rebel with eyes of storm is now first of all a
whimperer She and they meet as strangers

MARGARET nicely as becomes an artists daughter Good evening

ALICE Good evening Missy evening Mister

DEARTH seeing that her eyes search the ground Lost anything

ALICE Sometimes when the tourists have had their sandwiches there are
bits left over and they squeeze them between the roots to keep the
place tidy I am looking for bits

DEARTH You dont tell me you are as hungry as that

ALICE with spirit Try me Strange that he should not know that
once loved husky voice

MARGARET rushing at her father and feeling all his pockets Daddy
that was my last biscuit

DEARTH We must think of something else

MARGARET taking her hand Yes wait a bit we are sure to think of
something Daddy think of something

ALICE sharply Your father doesnt like you to touch the likes of
me

MARGARET Oh yes he does Defiantly And if he didnt Id do it all
the same This is a bit of myself daddy

DEARTH That is all you know

ALICE whining You neednt be angry with her Mister Im all
right

DEARTH I am not angry with her I am very sorry for you

ALICE flaring if I had my rights I would be as good as youand
better

DEARTH I daresay

ALICE I have had menservants and a motorcar  DEARTH Margaret and
I never rose to that

MARGARET stung I have been in a taxi several times and Dad often
gets telegrams

DEARTH Margaret

MARGARET Im sorry I boasted

ALICE Thats nothing I have a town houseat least I had   At
any rate he said there was a town house

MARGARET interested Fancy his not knowing for certain

ALICE The Honourable Mrs FinchFallowethats who I am

MARGARET cordially Its a lovely name

ALICE Curse him

MARGARET Dont you like him

DEARTH We wont go into that I have nothing to do with your past
but I wish we had some food to offer you

ALICE You havent a flask

DEARTH No I dont take anything myself But let me see

MARGARET sparkling I know You said we had five pounds To the
needy one Would you like five pounds

DEARTH Darling dont be stupid we havent paid our bill at the
inn

ALICE with bravado All right I never asked you for anything

DEARTH Dont take me up in that way I have had my ups and downs
myself Here is ten bob and welcome

He surreptitiously slips a coin into MARGARETS hand

MARGARET And I have half a crown It is quite easy for us Dad will
be getting another fiver any day You cant think how exciting it is
when the fiver comes in we dance and then we run out and buy chops

DEARTH Margaret

ALICE Its kind of you Im richer this minute than I have been for
many a day

DEARTH Its nothing I am sure you would do the same for us

ALICE I wish I was as sure

DEARTH Of course you would Glad to be of any help Get some victuals
as quickly as you can Best of wishes maam and may your luck
change

ALICE Same to you and may yours go on

MARGARET Goodnight

ALICE What is her name Mister

DEARTH who has returned to his easel Margaret

ALICE Margaret You drew something good out of the lucky bag when you
got her Mister

DEARTH Yes

ALICE Take care of her they are easily lost

She shuffles away

DEARTH Poor soul I expect she has had a rough time and that some
man is to blame for itpartly at any rate Restless That woman
rather affects me Margaret I dont know why Didnt you like her
husky voice He goes on painting I say Margaret we lucky ones
lets swear always to be kind to people who are down on their luck
and then when we are kind lets be a little kinder

MARGARET gleefully Yes lets

DEARTH Margaret always feel sorry for the failures the ones who are
always failuresespecially in my sort of calling Wouldnt it be
lovely to turn them on the thirtyninth year of failure into
glittering successes

MARGARET Topping

DEARTH Topping

MARGARET Oh topping How could we do it Dad

DEARTH By letter To poor old Tom Broken Heart Top Attic Garret
Chambers SEDEAR SIRHis Majesty has been graciously pleased
to purchase your superb picture of Marlow Ferry

MARGARET PSI am sending the money in a sack so as you can hear
it chink

DEARTH What could we do for our friend who passed just now I cant
get her out of my head

MARGARET You have made me forget her Plaintively Dad I didnt
like it

DEARTH Didnt like what dear

MARGARET shuddering I didnt like her saying that about your losing
me

DEARTH the one thing of which he is sure I shant lose you

MARGARET hugging his arm It would be hard for me if you lost me
but it would be worse for you I dont know how I know that but I do
know it What would you do without me

DEARTH almost sharply Dont talk like that dear It is wicked and
stupid and naughty Somehow that poor womanI wont paint any more
tonight

MARGARET Lets get out of the wood it frightens me

DEARTH And you loved it a moment ago Hullo He has seen a distant
blurred light in the wood apparently from a window I hadnt
noticed there was a house there

MARGARET tingling Daddy I feel sure there wasnt a house there

DEARTH Goose It is just that we didnt look our old way of letting
the world go hang so interested in ourselves Nice behaviour for
people who have been boasting about what they would do for other
people Now I see what I ought to do

MARGARET Lets get out of the wood

DEARTH Yes but my idea first It is to rouse these people and get
food from them for the husky one

MARGARET clinging to him She is too far away now

DEARTH I can overtake her

MARGARET in a frenzy Dont go into that house Daddy I dont know
why it is but I am afraid of that house

He waggles a reproving finger at her

DEARTH There is a kiss for each moment until I come back She wipes
them from her face Oh naughty go and stand in the corner She
stands against a tree but she stamps her foot Who has got a nasty
temper

She tries hard not to smile but she smiles and he smiles and they
make comic faces at each other as they have done in similar
circumstances since she first opened her eyes

I shall be back before you can count a hundred

He goes off humming his song so that she may still hear him when he
is lost to sight all just as so often before She tries dutifully to
count her hundred but the wood grows dark and soon she is afraid
again She runs from tree to tree calling to her Daddy We begin to
lose her among the shadows

MARGARET Out of the impalpable that is carrying her away Daddy
come back I dont want to be a mighthavebeen



ACT III

Lobs room has gone very dark as it sits up awaiting the possible
return of the adventurers The curtains are drawn so that no light
comes from outside  There is a tapping on the window and anon two
intruders are stealing about the floor with muffled cries when they
meet unexpectedly They find the switch and are revealed as Purdie
and his Mabel Something has happened to them as they emerged from
the wood but it is so superficial that neither notices it they are
again in the evening dress in which they had left the house But they
are still being led by that strange humour of the blood

MABEL looking around her curiously A pretty little room I wonder
who is the owner

PURDIE It doesnt matter the great thing is that we have escaped
Joanna

MABEL Jack look a man

The term may not be happily chosen but the person indicated is Lob
curled up on his chair by a dead fire The last look on his face
before he fell asleep having been a leery one it is still there

PURDIE He is asleep

MABEL Do you know him

PURDIE Not I Excuse me sir Hi No shaking however wakens the
sleeper

MABEL Darling how extraordinary

PURDIE always considerate After all precious have we any right to
wake up a stranger just to tell him that we are runaways hiding in
his house

MABEL who comes of a good family I think he would expect it of us

PURDIE after trying again There is no budging him

MABEL appeased At any rate we have done the civil thing

She has now time to regard the room more attentively including the
tray of coffee cups which MATEY had left on the table in a not
unimportant moment of his history There have evidently been people
here but they havent drunk their coffee Ugh cold as a deserted
egg in a birds nest Jack if you were a clever detective you could
construct those people out of their neglected coffee cups I wonder
who they are and what has spirited them away

PURDIE Perhaps they have only gone to bed Ought we to knock them
up

MABEL after considering what her mother would have done I think
not dear  I suppose we have run away Jackmeaning to

PURDIE with the sturdiness that weaker vessels adore Irrevocably
Mabel if the doglike devotion of a lifetime   He becomes
conscious that something has happened to LOBS leer It has not left
his face but it has shifted He is not shamming do you think

MABEL Shake him again

PURDIE after shaking him Its all right Mabel if the doglike
devotion of a lifetime 

MABEL Poor little Joanna Still if a woman insists on being a
pendulum round a mans neck 

PURDIE Do give me a chance Mabel If the doglike devotion of a
lifetime 

JOANNA comes through the curtains so inopportunely that for the
moment he is almost pettish

May I say this is just a little too much Joanna

JOANNA unconscious as they of her return to her dinner gown So
sweet husband your soul is still walking alone is it

MABEL who hates coarseness of any kind How can you sneak about in
this way Joanna Have you no pride

JOANNA dashing away a tear Please to address me as Mrs Purdie
madam She sees LOB Who is this man

PURDIE We dont know and there is no waking him You can try if you
like

Failing to rouse him JOANNA makes a third at table They are all a
little inconsequential as if there were still some moonshine in
their hair

JOANNA You were saying something about the devotion of a lifetime
please go on

PURDIE diffidently I dont like to before you Joanna

JOANNA becoming coarse again Oh dont mind me

PURDIE looking like a note of interrogation I should certainly like
to say it

MABEL loftily And I shall be proud to hear it

PURDIE I should have liked to spare you this Joanna you wouldnt
put your hands over your ears

JOANNA alas No sir

MABEL Fie Joanna Surely a wifes natural delicacy 

PURDIE severely As you take it in that spirit Joanna I can
proceed with a clear conscience If the doglike devotion of a
lifetimeHe reels a little staring at LOB over whose face the
leer has been wandering like an insect

MABEL Did he move

PURDIE It isnt that I am feelingvery funny Did one of you tap me
just now on the forehead

Their hands also have gone to their foreheads

MABEL I think I have been in this room before

PURDIE flinching There is something coming rushing back to me

MABEL I seem to know that coffee set If I do the lid of the milk
jug is chipped It is

JOANNA I cant remember this mans name but I am sure it begins with L

MABEL Lob

PURDIE Lob

JOANNA Lob

PURDIE Mabel your dress

MABEL beholding it How on earth

JOANNA My dress To PURDIE You were in knickerbockers in the
wood

PURDIE And so I am now He sees he is not Where did I change The
wood  Let me think The wood  the wood certainly But the
wood wasnt the wood

JOANNA revolving like one in pursuit My head is going round

MABEL Lobs wood I remember it all We were here We did go

PURDIE So we did But how could where was

JOANNE And who was

MABEL And what was

PURDIE even in this supreme hour a man Dont let go Hold on to
what we were doing or we shall lose grip of ourselves Devotion
Something about devotion Hold on to devotion If the doglike
devotion of a lifetime Which of you was I saying that to

MABEL To me

PURDIE Are you sure

MABEL shakily I am not quite sure

PURDIE anxiously Joanna what do you think With a sudden increase
of uneasiness Which of you is my wife

JOANNA without enthusiasm I am No I am not It is Mabel who is
your wife

MABEL Me

PURDIE with a curious gulp Why of course you are Mabel

MABEL I believe I am

PURDIE And yet how can it be I was running away with you

JOANNA solving that problem You dont need to do it now

PURDIE The wood Hold on to the wood The wood is what explains it
Yes I see the whole thing He gazes at LOB You infernal old
rascal Let us try to think it out Dont any one speak for a moment
Think first Love   Hold on to love He gets another tap I
say I believe I am not a deeply passionate chap at all I believe I
am just  a philanderer

MABEL It is what you are

JOANNA more magnanimous Mabel what about ourselves

PURDIE to whom it is truly a nauseous draught I didnt know Just
a philanderer The soul of him would like at this instant to creep
into another body And if people dont change I suppose we shall
begin all over again now

JOANNA the practical I daresay but not with each other I may
philander again but not with you

They look on themselves without approval always a sorry occupation
The man feels it most because he has admired himself most or perhaps
partly for some better reason

PURDIE saying goodbye to an old friend John Purdie John Purdie
the fine fellow I used to think you When he is able to look them in
the face again The wood has taught me one thing at any rate

MABEL dismally What Jack

PURDIE That it isnt accident that shapes our lives

JOANNA No its Fate

PURDIE the truth running through him seeking for a permanent home in
him willing to give him still another chance loth to desert him
Its not Fate Joanna Fate is something outside us What really
plays the dickens with us is some thing in ourselves Something that
makes us go on doing the same sort of fool things however many
chances we get

MABEL Something in ourselves

PURDIE shivering Something we are born with

JOANNA Cant we cut out the beastly thing

PURDIE Depends I expect on how long we have pampered him We can at
least control him if we try hard enough But I have for the moment an
abominably clear perception that the likes of me never really tries
Forgive me Joannano Mabelboth of you He is a shamed
man It isnt very pleasant to discover that one is a rotter I
suppose I shall get used to it

JOANNA I could forgive anybody anything tonight Candidly It is
so lovely not to be married to you Jack

PURDIE spiritless I can understand that I do feel small

JOANNA the true friend You will soon swell up again

PURDIE for whom alas we need not weep That is the appalling
thing But at present at any rate I am a rag at your feet
Joannano at yours Mabel  Are you going to pick me up I dont
advise it

MABEL I dont know whether I want to Jack To begin with which of
us is it your lonely soul is in search of

JOANNA Which of us is the fluid one or the fluider one

MABEL Are you and I one Or are you and Joanna one Or are the three
of us two

JOANNA He wants you to whisper in his ear Mabel the entrancing
poem Mabel Purdie Do it Jack there will be nothing wrong in it
now

PURDIE Rub it in

MABEL When I meet Joannas successor

PURDIE quailing No no Mabel none of that At least credit me with
having my eyes open at last There will be no more of this I swear
it by all that is

JOANNA in her excellent imitation of a sheep Baaa he is off
again

PURDIE Oh Lord so I am

MABEL Dont Joanna

PURDIE his mind still illumined She is quite rightI was In my
present state of depressionwhich wont lastI feel there is
something in me that will make me go on being the same ass however
many chances I get I havent the stuff in me to take warning My
whole being is corroded Shakespeare knew what he was talking
aboutThe fault dear Brutus is not in our stars But in
ourselves that we are underlings

JOANNA For dear Brutus we are to read dear audience I suppose

PURDIE You have it

JOANNA Meaning that we have the power to shape ourselves

PURDIE We have the power right enough

JOANNA But isnt that rather splendid

PURDIE For those who have the grit in them yes Still seeing with a
strange clearness through the chink the hammer has made And they
are not the dismal chappies they are the ones with the thin bright
faces He sits lugubriously by his wife and is sorry for the first
time that she has not married a better man I am afraid there is not
much fight in me Mabel but we shall see If you catch me at it
again have the goodness to whisper to me in passing Lobs Wood
That may cure me for the time being

MABEL still certain that she loved him once but not so sure why
Perhaps I will  as long as I care to bother Jack It depends on
you how long that is to be

JOANNA to break an awkward pause I feel that there is hope in that
as well as a warning Perhaps the wood may prove to have been useful
after all This brighter view of the situation meets with no
immediate response With her next suggestion she reaches harbour
You know we are not people worth being sorrowful aboutso let us
laugh

The ladies succeed in laughing though not prettily but the man has
been too much shaken

JOANNA in the middle of her laugh We have forgotten the others I
wonder what is happening to them

PURDIE reviving Yes what about them Have they changed

MABEL I didnt see any of them in the wood

JOANNA Perhaps we did see them without knowing them we didnt know
Lob

PURDIE daunted Thats true

JOANNA Wont it be delicious to be here to watch them when they come
back and see them waking upor whatever it was we did

PURDIE What was it we did I think something tapped me on the
forehead

MABEL blanching How do we know the others will come back

JOANNA infected We dont know How awful

MABEL Listen

PURDIE I distinctly hear some one on the stairs

MABEL It will be Matey

PURDIE the chink beginning to close Be cautious both of you dont
tell him we have had any  odd experiences

It is however MRS COADE who comes downstairs in a dressinggown
and carrying a candle and her husbands muffler

MRS COADE So you are back at last A nice house I must say Where
is Coady

PURDIE taken aback Coady Did he go into the wood too

MRS COADE placidly I suppose so I have been down several times to
look for him

MABEL Coady too

JOANNA seeing visions I wonder   Oh how dreadful

MRS COADE What is dreadful Joanna

JOANNA airily Nothing I was just wondering what he is doing

MRS COADE Doing What should he be doing Did anything odd happen to
you in the wood

PURDIE taking command No no nothing

JOANNA We just strolled about and came back That subject being
exhausted she points to LOB Have you noticed him

MRS COADE Oh yes he has been like that all the time A sort of
stupor I think and sometimes the strangest grin comes over his
face

PURDIE wincing Grin

MRS COADE Just as if he were seeing amusing things in his sleep

PURDIE guardedly I daresay he is Oughtnt we to get Matey to him

MRS COADE Matey has gone too

PURDIE Whaat

MRS COADE At all events he is not in the house

JOANNA unguardedly Matey I wonder who is with him

MRS COADE Must somebody be with him

JOANNA Oh no not at all

They are simultaneously aware that someone outside has reached the
window

MRS COADE I hope it is Coady

The other ladies are too fond of her to share this wish

MABEL Oh I hope not

MRS COADE blissfully Why Mrs Purdie

JOANNA coaxingly Dear Mrs Coade whoever he is and whatever he
does I beg you not to be surprised We feel that though we had no
unusual experiences in the wood others may not have been so
fortunate

MABEL And be cautious you dear what you say to them before they
come to

MRS COADE Come to You puzzle me And Coady didnt have his
muffler

Let it be recorded that in their distress for this old lady they
forget their own misadventures PURDIE takes a step toward the
curtains in a vague desire to shield herand gets a rich reward he
has seen the coming addition to their circle

PURDIE elated and pitiless It is Matey

A butler intrudes who still thinks he is wrapped in fur

JOANNA encouragingly Do come in

MATEY With apologies ladies and gents   May I ask who is host

PURDIE splashing in the temperature that suits him best A very
reasonable request Third on the left

MATEY advancing upon Lob Merely to ask sir if you can direct me
to my hotel

The sleepers only response is a alight quiver in one leg

The gentleman seems to be reposing

MRS COADE It is Lob

MATEY What is lob maam

MRS COADE pleasantly curious Surely you havent forgotten

PURDIE overriding her Anything we can do for you sir Just give
it a name

JOANNA in the same friendly spirit I hope you are not alone do say
you have some lady friends with you

MATEY with an emphasis on his leading word My wife is with me

JOANNA His wife  With commendation You have been quick

MRS COADE I didnt know you were married

MATEY Why should you madam You talk as if you knew me

MRS COADE Good gracious do you really think I dont

PURDIE indicating delicately that she is subject to a certain
softening Sit down wont you my dear sir and make yourself
comfy

MATEY accustomed of late to such deferential treatment Thank you
But my wife 

JOANNA hospitably Yes bring her in we are simply dying to make
her acquaintance

MATEY You are very good I am much obliged

MABEL as he goes out Who can she be

JOANNA leaping Who who who

MRS COADE But what an extraordinary wood He doesnt seem to know
who he is at all

MABEL soothingly Dont worry about that Coady darling He will
know soon enough

JOANNA again finding the bright side And so will the little wife
By the way whoever she is I hope she is fond of butlers

MABEL who has peeped It is Lady Caroline

JOANNA leaping again Oh joy joy And she was so sure she couldnt
take the wrong turning

Lady Caroline is evidently still sure of it

MATEY May I present my wifeLady Caroline Matey

MABEL glowing How do you do

PURDIE Your servant Lady Caroline

MRS COADE Lady Caroline Matey You

LADY CAROLINE without an r in her Charmed Im sure

JOANNA neatly Very pleased to meet any wife of Mr Matey

PURDIE taking the floor Allow me The Duchess of Candelabra The
Ladies Helena and Matilda MNab I am the Lord Chancellor

MABEL I have wanted so long to make your acquaintance

LADY CAROLINE Charmed

JOANNA gracefully These informal meetings are so delightful dont
you think

LADY CAROLINE Yes indeed

MATEY the introductions being thus pleasantly concluded And your
friend by the fire

PURDIE I will introduce you to him when you wake upI mean when he
wakes up

MATEY Perhaps I ought to have said that I am James Matey

LADY CAROLINE the happy creature The James Matey

MATEY A name not perhaps unknown in the world of finance

JOANNA Finance Oh so you did take that clerkship in the City

MATEY a little stiffly I began as a clerk in the City certainly
and I am not ashamed to admit it

MRS COADE still groping Fancy that now And did it save you

MATEY Save me madam

JOANNA Excuse uswe ask odd questions in this house we only mean
did that keep you honest Or are you still a pilferer

LADY CAROLINE an outraged swan Husband mine what does she mean

JOANNA No offence I mean a pilferer on a large scale

MATEY remembering certain newspaper jealousy If you are referring
to that Labrador businessor the Working Womens Bank 

PURDIE after the manner of one who has caught a fly Oho got him

JOANNA bowing Yes those are what I meant

MATEY stoutly There was nothing proved

JOANNA like one calling a meeting Mabel Jack here is another of
us You have gone just the same way again my friend Ecstatically
There is more in it you see than taking the wrong turning you
would always take the wrong turning The only fitting comment
Tralala

LADY CAROLINE If you are casting any aspersions on my husband allow
me to say that a prouder wife than I does not today exist

MRS COADE who finds herself the only clearheaded one My dear do
be careful

MABEL So long as you are satisfied dear Lady Caroline But I thought
you shrank from all blood that was not blue

LADY CAROLINE You thought Why should you think about me I beg to
assure you that I adore my Jim

She seeks his arm but her Jim has encountered the tray containing
coffee cups and a cake and his hands close on it with a certain
intimacy Whatever are you doing Jim

MATEY I dont understand it Caroliny but somehow I feel at home
with this in my hands

MABEL Caroliny

MRS COADE Look at me well dont you remember me

MATEY musing I dont remember you but I seem to associate you
with hardboiled eggs With conviction You like your eggs
hardboiled

PURDIE Hold on to hardboiled eggs She used to tip you especially to
see to them

MATEYS hand goes to his pocket

Yes that was the pocket

LADY CAROLINE with distaste Tip

MATEY without distaste Tip

PURDIE Jolly word isnt it

MATEY raising the tray It seems to set me thinking

LADY CAROLINE feeling the tap of the hammer Why is my workbasket
in this house

MRS COADE You are living here you know

LADY CAROLINE That is what a person feels But when did I come It is
very odd but one feels one ought to say when did one go

PURDIE She is coming to with a wush

MATEY under the hammer Mr Purdie

LADY CAROLINE MRS Coade

MATEY The Guvnor My clothes

LADY CAROLINE One is in evening dress

JOANNA charmed to explain You will understand clearly in a minute
Caroliny You didnt really take that clerkship Jim you went into
domestic service but in the essentials you havent altered

PURDIE pleasantly Ill have my shaving water at  sharp Matey

MATEY mechanically Very good sir

LADY CAROLINE Sir Midsummer Eve The wood

PURDIE Yes hold on to the wood

MATEY You are  you are  you are Lady Caroline Laney

LADY CAROLINE It is Matey the butler

MABEL You seemed quite happy with him you know Lady Caroline

JOANNA nicely We wont tell

LADY CAROLINE subsiding Caroline Matey And I seemed to like it
How horrible

MRS COADE expressing a general sentiment It is rather difficult to
see what we should do next

MATEY tentatively Perhaps if I were to go downstairs

PURDIE It would be conferring a personal favour on us all

Thus encouraged MATEY and his tray resume friendly relations with
the pantry

LADY CAROLINE with itching fingers as she glares at Lob It is all
that wretchs doing

A quiver from Lobs right leg acknowledges the compliment The gay
music of a pipe is heard from outside

JOANNA peeping Coady

MRS COADE Coady Why is he so happy

JOANNA troubled Dear hold my hand

MRS COADE suddenly trembling Wont he know me

PURDIE abashed by that soft face Mrs Coade I m sorry It didnt
so much matter about the likes of us but for your sake I wish Coady
hadnt gone out

MRS COADE We that have been happily married this thirty years

COADE popping in buoyantly May I intrude My name is Coade The
fact is I was playing about in the wood on a whistle and I saw your
light

MRS COADE the only one with the nerve to answer Playing about in
the wood with a whistle

COADE with mild dignity And why not madam

MRS COADE Madam Dont you know me

COADE I dont know you  Reflecting But I wish I did

MRS COADE Do you Why

COADE If I may say so you have a very soft lovable face

Several persons breathe again

MRS COADE inquisitorially Who was with you playing whistles in
the wood

The breathing ceases

COADE No one was with me

And is resumed

MRS COADE No  lady

COADE Certainly not Then he spoils it I am a bachelor

MRS COADE A bachelor

JOANNA Dont give way dear it might be much worse

MRS COADE A bachelor And you are sure you never spoke to me before
Do think

COADE Not to my knowledge Never  except in dreams

MABEL taking a risk What did you say to her in dreams

COADE I said My dear This when uttered surprises him Odd

JOANNA The darling man

MRS COADE wavering How could you say such things to an old woman

COADE thinking it out Old I didnt think of you as old No no
youngwith the morning dew on your facecoming across a lawnin a
black and green dressand carrying such a pretty parasol

MRS COADE thrilling That was how he first met me He used to love
me in black and green and it was a pretty parasol Look I am old
So it cant be the same woman

COADE blinking Old Yes I suppose so But it is the same soft
lovable face and the same kind beaming smile that children could
warm their hands at

MRS COADE He always liked my smile

PURDUE So do we all

COADE to himself Emma

MRS COADE He hasnt forgotten my name

COADE It is sad that we didnt meet long ago I think I have been
waiting for you I suppose we have met too late You couldnt
overlook my being an old fellow could you eh

JOANNA How lovely he is going to propose to her again Coady you
happy thing he is wanting the same soft face after thirty years

MRS COADE undoubtedly hopeful We mustnt be too sure but I think
that is it Primly What is it exactly that you want Mr Coade

COADE under a lucky star I want to have the right to hold the
parasol over you Wont you be my wife my dear and so give my long
dream of you a happy ending

MRS COADE preening Kisses are not called for at our age Coady
but here is a muffler for your old neck

COADE My muffler I have missed it It is however to his forehead
that his hand goes Immediately thereafter he misses his sylvan
attire Why  why  what  who  how is this

PURDIE nervously He is coming to

COADE reeling and righting himself Lob

The leg indicates that he has got it

Bless me Coady I went into that wood

MRS COADE And without your muffler you that are so subject to
chills What are you feeling for in your pocket

COADE The whistle It is a whistle IGone of course it is Its
rather a pity but  Anxious Have I been saying awful things
to you

MABEL You have been making her so proud It is a compliment to our
whole sex You had a second chance and it is her again

COADE Of course it is Crestfallen But I see I was just the same
nice old lazy Coady as before and I had thought that if I had a
second chance I could do things I have often said to you Coady
that it was owing to my being cursed with a competency that I didnt
write my great book But I had no competency this time and I havent
written a word

PURDIE bitterly enough That neednt make you feel lonely in this
house

MRS COADE in a small voice You seem to have been quite happy as an
old bachelor dear

COADE I am surprised at myself Emma but I fear I was

MRS COADE with melancholy perspicacity I wonder if what it means
is that you dont especially need even me I wonder if it means that
you are just the sort of amiable creature that would be happy
anywhere and anyhow

COADE Oh dear can it be as bad as that

JOANNA a ministering angel she Certainly not It is a romance and
I wont have it looked upon as anything else

MRS COADE Thank you Joanna You will try not to miss that whistle
Coady

COADE getting the footstool for her You are all I need

MRS COADE Yes but I am not so sure as I used to be that it is a
great compliment

JOANNA Coady behave

There is a knock on the window

PURDIE peeping Mrs Dearth His spirits revive She is alone Who
would have expected that of her

MABEL She is a wild one Jack but I sometimes thought rather a dear
I do hope she has got off cheaply

ALICE comes to them in her dinner gown

PURDIE the irrepressible Pleased to see you stranger

ALICE prepared for ejection I was afraid such an unceremonious
entry might startle you

PURDIE Not a bit

ALICE defiant I usually enter a house by the front door

PURDIE I have heard that such is the swagger way

ALICE simpering So stupid of me I lost myself in the wood  and 

JOANNA genially Of course you did But never mind that do tell us
your name

LADY CAROLINE emerging again Yes yes your name

ALICE Of course I am the Honourable Mrs FinchFallowe

LADY CAROLINE Of course of course

PURDIE I hope Mr FinchFallowe is very well We dont know him
personally but may we have the pleasure of seeing him bob up
presently

ALICE No I am not sure where he is

LADY CAROLINE with point I wonder if the dear clever police know

ALICE imprudently No they dont

It is a very secondary matter to her This woman of calamitous fires
hears and sees her tormentors chiefly as the probable owner of the
cake which is standing on that tray So awkward I gave my
sandwiches to a poor girl and her father whom I met in the wood and
now  isnt it a nuisanceI am quite hungry So far with a
mincing bravado May I

Without waiting for consent she falls to upon the cake looking over
it like one ready to fight them for it

PURDIE sobered again Poor soul

LADY CAROLINE We are so anxious to know whether you met a friend of
ours in the wooda Mr Dearth Perhaps you know him too

ALICE Dearth I dont know any Dearth

MRS COADE Oh dear what a wood

LADY CAROLINE He is quite a front door sort of man knocks and rings
you know

PURDIE Dont worry her

ALICE gnawing I meet so many you see I go out a great deal I
have visitingcardsprinted ones

LADY CAROLINE How very distingue Perhaps Mr Dearth has painted
your portrait he is an artist

ALICE Very likely they all want to paint me I daresay that is the
man to whom I gave my sandwiches

MRS COADE But I thought you said he had a daughter

ALICE Such a pretty girl I gave her half a crown

COADE A daughter That cant be Dearth

PURDIE darkly Dont be too sure Was the man you speak of a rather
chopfallen gonetoseed sort of person

ALICE No I thought him such a jolly attractive man

COADE Dearth jolly attractive Oh no Did he say anything about his
wife

LADY CAROLINE Yes do try to remember if he mentioned her

ALICE snapping No he didnt

PURDIE He was far from jolly in her time

ALICE with an archness for which the cake is responsible Perhaps
that was the ladys fault

The last of the adventurers draws nigh carolling a French song as he
comes

COADE Dearths voice He sounds quite merry

JOANNA protecting Alice you poor thing

PURDIE This is going to be horrible

A cleareyed man of lusty gait comes in

DEARTH I am sorry to bounce in on you in this way but really I have
an excuse I am a painter of sorts and

He sees he has brought some strange discomfort here

MRS COADE I must say Mr Dearth I am delighted to see you looking
so well Like a new man isnt he

No one dares to answer

DEARTH I am certainly very well if you care to know But did I tell
you my name

JOANNA for some one has to speak No butbut we have an instinct
in this house

DEARTH Well it doesnt matter Here is the situation my daughter
and I have just met in the wood a poor woman famishing for want of
food We were as happy as grigs ourselves and the sight of her
distress rather cut us up Can you give me something for her Why are
you looking so startled Seeing the remains of the cake May I have
this

A shrinking movement from one of them draws his attention and he
recognises in her the woman of whom he has been speaking He sees her
in fine clothing and he grows stern

I feel I cant be mistaken it was you I met in the wood Have you
been playing some trick on me To the others It was for her I
wanted the food

ALICE her hand guarding the place where his gift lies Have you come
to take hack the money you gave me

DEARTH Your dress You were almost in rags when I saw you outside

ALICE frightened as she discovers how she is now attired I dont 
understand 

COADE gravely enough For that matter Dearth I daresay you were
different in the wood too

DEARTH sees his own clothing

DEARTH What

ALICE frightened Where am I To Mrs Coade I seem to know you
 do I

MRS COADE motherly Yes you do hold my hand and you will soon
remember all about it

JOANNA I am afraid Mr Dearth it is harder for you than for the
rest of us

PURDIE looking away I wish I could help you but I cant I am a
rotter

MABEL We are awfully sorry Dont you remember  Midsummer Eve

DEARTH controlling himself Midsummer Eve This room Yes this room
 You was it you  were going out to look for something 
The tree of knowledge wasnt it Somebody wanted me to go too 
Who was that A lady I think  Why did she ask me to go
What was I doing here I was smoking a cigar  I laid it down
there  He finds the cigar Who was the lady

ALICE feebly Something about a second chance

MRS COADE Yes you poor dear you thought you could make so much of
it

DEARTH A lady who didnt like me With conviction She had good
reasons toobut what were they

ALICE A little old man He did it What did he do

The hammer is raised

DEARTH I am  it is coming backI am not the man I thought
myself

ALICE I am not Mrs FinchFallowe Who am I

DEARTH staring at her You were that lady

ALICE It is youmy husband

She is overcome

MRS COADE My dear you are much better off so far as I can see
than if you were Mrs FinchFallowe

ALICE with passionate knowledge Yes yes indeed Generously But
he isnt

DEARTH Alice  IHe tries to smile I didnt know you when I
was in the wood with Margaret She  she  Margaret
The hammer falls

O my God

He buries his face in his hands

ALICE I wishI wish

She presses his shoulder fiercely and then stalks out by the door

PURDIE to LOB after a time You old ruffian

DEARTH No I am rather fond of him our lonely friendly little host
Lob I thank thee for that hour

The seedylooking fellow passes from the scene

COADE Did you see that his hand is shaking again

PURDIE The watery eye has come back

JOANNA And yet they are both quite nice people

PURDIE finding the tragedy of it We are all quite nice people

MABEL If she were not such a savage

PURDIE I daresay there is nothing the matter with her except that she
would always choose the wrong man good man or bad man but the wrong
man for her

COADE We cant change

MABEL Jack says the brave ones can

JOANNA The ones with the thin bright faces

MABEL Then there is hope for you and me Jack

PURDIE ignobly I dont expect so

JOANNA wandering about the room like one renewing acquaintance with
it after returning from a journey Hadnt we better go to bed It
must be getting late

PURDIE Hold on to bed They all brighten

MATEY entering Breakfast is quite ready

They exclaim

LADY CAROLINE My watch has stopped

JOANNA And mine Just as well perhaps

MABEL There is a smell of coffee

The gloom continues to lift

COADE Come along Coady I do hope you have not been tiring your
foot

MRS COADE I shall give it a good rest tomorrow dear

MATEY I have given your egg six minutes maam

They set forth once more upon the eternal round The curious JOANNA
remains behind

JOANNA A strange experiment Matey does it ever have any permanent
effect

MATEY on whom it has had none So far as I know not often miss
but I believe once in a while

There is hope in this for the brave ones If we could wait long
enough we might see the DEARTHS breasting their way into the light

He could tell you

The elusive person thus referred to kicks responsively meaning
perhaps that none of the others will change till there is a tap from
another hammer But when MATEY goes to rout him from his chair he is
no longer there His disappearance is no shock to MATEY who shrugs
his shoulders and opens the windows to let in the glory of a summer
morning The garden has returned and our queer little hero is busy
at work among his flowers A lark is rising
