The receptionist ushered the patient into Dr Walter Needzaks office
She punched her glasses higher onto the bridge of her nose patted the
bun of hair at the back of her head and said

This is Mr Stallings doctor

Dr Needzak motioned the patient to a chair Stallings sat down slowly
but limberly He still held his hat and placed it in the precise
center of his lap The receptionist handed a form to Dr Needzak and
returned to the waiting room after looking once over her shoulder

Youre only  Mr Stallings Dr Needzak asked The patient nodded
sadly Well you should be hale and hearty for another  years
judging by the report on your preliminary exam Are you sure that its
any use for you to consult me

I wouldnt bother you Stallings said age showing only in the high
pitch of his voice except for the funny feeling in my chest the other
day I had to visit an office on the twelfth story The elevator wasnt
running so I walked up Just as an experiment I went as fast as I
could The way my chest felt got me so interested and excited that I
forgot what I wanted at the office once I was there So I thought that
that was a hopeful enough sign for me to come around and see you

Dr Needzak a young man at  and who looked even younger hoisted
the stethoscope amplifier onto his desk turned it on and signalled
for Stallings to unbutton his shirt He placed the stethoscope against
the bony chest The bumping of the heart filled the room drew a wild
pattern on the unfolding strip of paper in the visual section of the
amplifier and created magnetic patterns on the tape

Dr Needzak listened for two minutes then thumbed through a reference
listing of visual heart patterns Finally he switched off the
amplifier and said

You have no history of heart trouble

Im afraid not

Well I dont want to raise false hopes The only thing that I can
suggest is more physical exertion Really vigorous exertion the kind
that makes you pant and tremble and get a bit dizzy Try that every
day for a month and come back to see me Theres just a trace of a
flutter now and we might be able to speed up its development

The old man smiled for the first time at something that his eyes saw
behind the white plaster of the far wall Finally Stallings rose to
leave Buttoning himself up he said Youll send the bill

Dr Needzak laughed genially I can see that you arent accustomed to
visiting doctors young man The better the doctor the more risky it
is to send the bill My policy is to request full payment before the
patient leaves the office just in case Ive given the right sort of
advice In cases where I prescribe medicine of course you may pay for
the prescription and the consultation fee simultaneously Before taking
the medicine you understand Again he laughed

I understand I should have guessed I work in a bank myself I hate
the work Im tired of everything in fact But I know how important it
is to pay promptly

The doctor had just filed away Stallings physical record when the
receptionist ushered in an extremely elderly woman Dr Needzak smiled
broadly and said

Mrs Watkins I didnt expect to see you again so soon He waved in
annoyance at the receptionist who hovered behind the new patient She
left reluctantly

Mrs Watkins groped her way to the chair wincing when the receptionist
slammed the door The old woman rubbed her bony forehead with a mottled
hand that trembled and said

I know that I wasnt supposed to come back for another three months
But did you realize that Ill have my th birthday before those three
months are up When a person gets to be that old she looks forward
to seeing the doctor more than she used to look forward for Santa to
arrive back in the old days

No symptoms since your last visit Dr Needzak spoke more loudly than
usual in deference to her failing hearing and turned up the light to
aid weak old eyes

None She spat out the word Im going to change doctors if this
keeps up Ive heard of a couple of doctors who arent as scrupulous as
you are After living all this time I think that I could be permitted
one little crime lying to them about a symptom Then I know that Id
be made happy Whats the use being moral when youre too frail and
tottery to enjoy life

Dr Needzak shook his head disapprovingly I dont think youre quite
as miserable as you think you are Dont go to those quack doctors
Suppose youre caught halfway through a crime You might linger for
decades halfwell halfsick from the effects of what theyd give
you Even the quacks wont supply you with strychnine you know

I know I shouldnt have suggested it But I get so tired of living

Well I cant see any physical trouble that could have developed
enough to warrant a complete exam since your last one Maybe those
arteries will start hardening by the time you have that th
birthday Or you could take up chemistry as a hobby Just think what a
fine explosion you might get mixed up in

I thought of that A couple of tears trickled down the wrinkled
cheeks of Mrs Watkins But the thricegreatgrandchildren watch
me like a hawk They dont let me do anything that might hurt me I
suppose Ill just have to wait and hope and wait and pray

She rose very suddenly Then she shook her head disgustedly I dont
even get dizzy when I do that like most people my age Thank you
anyway doctor Mrs Watkins walked out with dignity

Dr Needzak noticed that his waiting room was filling rapidly during
the two seconds that Mrs Watkins opened the door to leave He fumed
inwardly at his patience in dealing at length with cases like the last
two whom he couldnt possibly be sure of helping

But his illhumor was replaced by astonishment The receptionist
introduced a woman even younger than he She was very pale but Dr
Needzak guessed that that pallor derived from tension not some rare
organic disturbance

Are you sure that you havent made a mistake Miss Tillett He
asked the question quietly trying to catch her eyes She kept them
resolutely on her hands which were folding and unfolding in her lap

I talked with several good friends before coming to you doctor the
girl said Her voice was very low You had been a good doctor for
their grandparents or greatgrandparents They told me that you could
help me if anybody could

But your preliminary examination shows nothing whatsoever wrong with
you the doctor said Itll be another century before you would
normally develop the slightest symptom on which Id be allowed to work
And people of your age just dont go to doctors Its only when youre
past the century mark and know that decade after decade stretches out
ahead of you that you start feeling that a doctor might

Please she interrupted almost inaudibly I dont think that a
physician should allow the consideration of a patients age to enter
into his course of action For personal reasons I may need a doctor
more than the average person six times my age

Will you tell me something about yourself Im not curious except as
far as knowledge might affect my recommendations

I dont care to discuss personal problems Now doctor your assistant
who gave the preliminary examination overlooked the reason for my
coming to you Right here and she carefully touched a spot on the
welltailored dress I think that it might be a tumor

What good does it do to come to a doctor for that Dr Needzak said
Tumors are so rare that theres very little chance that its more than
your imagination And the best physician cant speed up the growth of a
tumor or change it from benign to malign

A physician can diagnose she answered If its malign Ill be
able to have patience I wont need to break the law Unexpectedly
grotesquely she drew one finger across her throat in a cutting
gesture and looked squarely at him for the first time

Dr Needzak walked softly to the door that led to the reception room
He drew noiselessly a bolt across the jamb locking it Then he pointed
to another door telling the girl Go in there and undress Ill be
ready for you in a moment

He whistled softly under his breath as he pulled instruments and jars
of colored substances from the deepest recesses of a cupboard

The girl already lay calmly on a metal table in the inner room when Dr
Needzak entered He staggered a trifle under a precariously balanced
pile of equipment in his arms He explained

I should let the receptionist do the hard work like this But I dont
let her snoop around in this private room

Will you really need all those things the girl asked uncertainly
I thought that you just snip out a tiny specimen with a little gadget
to make a diagnosis

I could probably get along with just that one gadget the doctor
said He pulled a mask from a drawer and snapped on the sterilite
But Im an old boy scout at heart Always prepared Unexpectedly
he plopped the mask squarely over the girls face Her cry was almost
inaudible as the thick gauze clamped itself over her mouth clung
tightly beneath the jaw

Dr Needzak pinioned her shoulders to the table while her legs kicked
wildly for a few seconds The anesthetic stopped the kicking within
five seconds He waited for a count of ten before he wrenched the mask
free Turning up the sterilite to full strength Dr Needzak began to
line up surgical instruments in a neat row humming under his breath

                                   

Fifteen minutes later the physician made a pair of injections into
the girls upper arm Then he swished oxygen into her face until she
recovered consciousness

Wonderful stuff this new anesthetic he told her placidly It works
fast wears off just as fast doesnt leave the patient retching Now
you can sit up slowly If you dont try anything strenuous for the next
day or two youll never know that youve had an operation

Miss Tilletts eyes widened Operation I came here for a diagnosis I
didnt authorize

Im sorry I operated without your consent But I had a good reason
It wasnt even a benign tumor that you had It was only a cyst If
I had merely diagnosed and told you the truth you would have kept
clinging to the hope that it might be a malign tumor You wouldnt have
let me take it out It would have grown big enough to disfigure you
not big enough to cause you any physical damage You would have gone
through the years with a new trouble that of deformity and you might
have been mentally warped in the delusion that you had a fatal disease
Youre as sound as a rock

Something inside the girl seemed to turn into liquid She sat with
slumped shoulders arms dangling limply at her side and head sunk so
far that her chin rested against her chest

After a moment she rose and walked slowly into the dressing cubicle
When she emerged she ignored the doctor unlocked the door with her
own hands and walked into the reception room sobbing softly

Dr Needzak cleaned up rapidly and hustled into his main office to see
his next patient No one was there He grumbled to himself and opened
the door into the reception room Blinking he saw that it was empty
It had been filling rapidly not a halfhour earlier

The doctor had heard no noises indicating a commotion on the street
outside and that was the only reason he could think of for the sudden
disappearance of his patients To make sure he strode through the
reception room walked briskly down the short hall and stuck his head
through the door leading into the street Everything appeared normal in
the bustling business district until a large black sedan ground to a
stop at the curb in a noparking zone The receptionist climbed from
the vehicle two men behind her

Miss Waters Dr Needzak exploded when she reached the buildings
entrance What do you mean by leaving without my permission All my
patients have left They must have thought that office hours were over

The receptionist gave him one baleful look and shoved past him into
the building And Dr Needzak suddenly recognized the two men

Bill Carson And Pop Manville What brings you big doctors down here
to see a smalltime pilldealer like me

Lets go into your office Pop said softly He was old tall and
gaunt with a perpetual look of worry Dr Carson younger and bustling
evaded Dr Needzaks eyes

Miss Waters was shoveling personal belongings from her desk into a
giant handbag when they reached the reception room Dr Needzak felt
her eyes upon him as the other two physicians kept him moving by the
sheer impetus of their bodies into his consultation room

Where is it Walt Dr Manville asked looking gloomily around the
consultation room

Wheres what Pop The drinks I keep them

The door to your operating room Dr Carson interrupted hurriedly
Lets not drag this thing out Its going to be painful enough among
old friends Your private office has been wired for sight and sound for
the past three weeks You shouldnt have tried to get away with that
kind of practice in a big city

Dr Needzak felt the blood draining from his face He reached for a
drawer Dr Manville grabbed his arm with a tight clawlike grasp
before it could touch the handle

Its all right Pop he said Nothing but gin in there Im not the
violent type

Dr Carson pulled open the drawer toward which he had reached He
pulled out the tall bottle slipped off the patent top and sniffled
Handing it to Dr Needzak he said

Okay You need some Then save the rest for us Well feel like it
too when were done

Dr Needzak coughed after three large swallows He looked at the other
two doctors Who ratted

Dr Carson nodded toward the reception room Dr Needzak instinctively
clenched his fists He halfrose from his chair then sank back slowly
I thought you guys were my friends he said

We are Walt Dr Manville said thoughtfully But this is
business When someone charges violation of medical ethics were the
investigation committee It looks like a simple investigation this
time with those tapes on file

What does she have against you anyway Dr Carson asked Usually
a receptionist will go through hell to cover up little flubs for her
boss Were you mixed up with her in a personal way

Mixed up with her Dr Needzak laughed mirthlessly Shes worked for
me fifteen years Ive never made a pass at her

Dr Manville nodded sadly That was your mistake Walt Frustration
Disappointment Worse than jealousy Now why not tell us everything

Theres nothing to tell Those tapes give a false impression
sometimes I just take difficult cases back there where Im sure there
wont be any disturbance

No use Dr Carson interrupted Things will be harder for you
if we lose patience with you We know youve been curing illness
against the patients wishes time after time We just saw you take
out a tumor The poor kid will probably drag through another hundred
years before she develops anything else serious You prescribed
anticoagulants to a man with an obvious blood clot You even talked a
couple with weak lungs into moving to Denver

All right it was a tumor Dr Needzak admitted It was malign and
it would have killed her in two or three years But shes too young
to make a decision for herself Five years from now she may have a
different outlook on her personal problems I have ethics and I cant
help it if they dont correspond in some details with the associations
ethics

You were given your medical license under an oath to respect the
ethics of the profession Dr Manville said slowly emphatically The
license did not give you the right to practice under ethics of your own
invention

Ethics Dr Needzak looked as if he wanted to spit Ethics is just a
word There was a time when physicians spent their time curing diseases
and preventing them They called that ethics Now that there arent
enough illnesses left to give us work now that people live long past
the time when they want to go on living now that we make our money
helping people commit suicide the legal way we call that ethics

You cant annihilate a concept simply by thinking its only a word
Dr Manville said There was a time when physicians used leeches for
almost every patient They fitted that nasty habit into their ethics
You wouldnt want to introduce leeches into this century would you
But you should if youre so consistently opposed to anything that
sounds like changes in ethics

But Ive done my part to get rid of human miseries Dr Needzak said
nodding toward a filing cabinet I can show you the data on hundreds
of my patients Old folks who just got tired of living I helped
them die legally Even younger people who had a genuine reason for
being tired of life I couldnt have my fine home or pay rent in this
building if I went around curing every patient Theres no money in
that

You wouldnt keep a filing cabinet for the times you disobeyed the
medical code Dr Carson broke in But we have some of those cases on
tape You didnt refuse to handle the cases You went ahead and played
God going directly against the direct will of your patients Did you
follow up all of the patients who arent in your file cabinets We
traced the later records of some of them Several suicided right out
in the open Their families havent gotten back on their feet from the
disgrace yet

Dr Needzak took two more deep swallows from the bottle He looked
glumly at the low level of the liquid through its dark side saying

You fellows are enjoying this conversation more than old friends
should enjoy the job of taking action against a fellowdoctor And
Ill tell you why you arent too unhappy about it Youre jealous of
me Youre jealous of the fact that Ive been following a physicians
natural instincts and healing people Youre angry with me for doing
the things that youd really love to do yourselves if you had the
guts You arent worried about that girl youre peeved because youd
give your shirts for a chance to take out a genuine tumor yourself

Admitted Dr Carson said cheerfully I havent seen a live tumor in
three or four years Theyre scarce But we cant sit here chatting We
dont want to end up arguing

Dr Needzak rose What do I do then

The best action would be to come along with us to the association
headquarters Dr Manville advised avoiding Dr Needzaks eyes
In a halfhour or so you can sign enough statements to avoid weeks
of hearings Otherwise well be forced to bother lots of other
physicians hunt up your old patients endure newspaper publicity and
have a general mess

After that I start pounding the pavements hunting a job Dr
Needzak flexed his long lean fingers Is it hard to learn how to
operate ditch diggers

Dr Carson stood up and slapped him on the back It isnt that bad
You can find a place in any pharmacy in the country if we get through
this disbarment without publicity Youll never be rich handing out
irritants and hyperstimulants but

Dr Needzak was already striding toward the street The other two
doctors trailed after him waiting while he locked up carefully They
glanced at one another significantly noting that he had unconsciously
brought along his little black bag Dr Needzak explained as they began
the twoblock walk to association headquarters

The kids are married and away from home I suppose that I can get
enough income from subleasing the office to keep the wife and me
eating until I find

A grating crash broke into his sentence The three doctors whirled
simultaneously Thin wails drifted through the constant rumble of
traffic from somewhere around a corner People erupted from buildings
running toward the source of the noise The doctors instinctively
trotted after them

                                   

They turned the corner coming upon a rare sight It was a motor
vehicle accident first in the business district for months A school
bus lay on its side just short of the intersection Children were
clambering cautiously from the emergency door The uniformed driver was
ignoring his passengers staring in disbelief at the radar controls at
the street corner which had failed a moment earlier

The other vehicle involved in the crash was wrapped around a power
pole It was an auto of antique vintage produced before full automatic
driving provisions There werent more than a dozen such vehicles
remaining on the streets of the city The radar controls almost
never went on the blink Only the combination of the vehicle and the
inoperative controls could have created an accident

Dr Needzak led the other doctors through the thickening crowd to the
side of the bus Kids were no longer climbing through the emergency
exit but noises were coming from within the vehicle His bag under
his left arm he hauled himself atop the overturned bus and dropped
through the emergency exit into its halfdark interior He saw the
other two doctors outlined against the sky as they perched on the
horizontal side of the vehicle peering down helpless without their
bags

Dr Needzak found a small boy sprawled awkwardly around a seat
bleeding rapidly from the leg face ashen unconscious The physician
clipped off the trousers leg bound the leg tightly above the deep
gash and slipped on a bandage Then he lifted the small boy up to Dr
Carson

A girl was struggling to raise herself from the next seat obviously
unaware that the leg wouldnt support her because it had suffered a
compound fracture Dr Needzak forced a grin when he attracted her
attention He persuaded her to lie flat With one quick motion he
roughset the leg Then he boosted her out of the vehicle and looked
down to investigate the source of the plucking at his coat

It was a small chubby boy standing beside him Im hurt real bad
the boy said Needzak ran his hands over the boys body to make sure
the bones were sound You better take care of me real quick the
child said looking more worried than ever

Dr Needzak made sure that the blood on the boys cheek came from only
a scratch and found the heartbeat normal So he pulled a sugar wafer
from his bag and ordered the boy to swallow it

Think you can climb out now Dr Needzak asked The youngster face
brightening leaped to the door and went out unassisted

The only child remaining in the vehicle hadnt uttered a sound But the
doctor sensed that her breathing was heavier He bent over her and
pushed back the lid of her halfclosed eye When he saw the back of her
head he stopped his hasty examination Her words were barely audible
Am I hurt bad

Why there wont even be any pain Dr Needzak told her cheerfully
Before he could yell to the other doctors to call for a stretcher the
girls breathing stopped

Slowly as if suddenly tired Dr Needzak climbed out of the vehicle

Police had already dispersed the crowd Tow trucks were waiting to haul
away the vehicles The injured children were gone The three doctors
resumed their walk

Dr Needzak felt the eyes of the other two men on him lost patience
after a moment and said irritably

Go ahead start bawling me out But Ive not signed anything yet Im
still a licensed physician I had every right to help those kids

The other two doctors stopped looking at one another as if trying
to probe each others thoughts Simultaneous smiles spread over their
faces Dr Needzak stopped walking when he heard them starting to
laugh He pushed between them with a frown asking

Look if you

Dr Carson slapped him on the back hard Dr Manville grasped Dr
Needzaks hand and squeezed it with unexpected strength

The same thing hit us both at the same time Ill bet the older
doctor said It would be the ideal thing for you

Dr Carson was pumping Dr Needzaks other hand up and down Sure
Emergency physician I dont know why we didnt think of that in the
first place Accidents still happen now and then It isnt easy to find
doctors who are willing to specialize in them because it isnt steady
income and it doesnt pay a whole lot But you have those screwball
ideas about helping people to get well And thats just what an
emergency physician must do

Ill talk to a couple of the men on the association board as soon as
I can get to a telephone Dr Manville said I think I can persuade
them to assign you to accidents without going through a disbarring
procedure as long as you agree to stay away from general practice
Youre willing I assume

Dr Needzak pulled his hands free and looked at the spots of dried
blood that remained on the fingers and palms He hadnt been able to
wash up after the accident He saw surgeons hands healing hands
hands that would never be satisfied to wrap up syrups or count pills

I suppose that its the best thing in a bad deal But Im wondering
about accidents Just the other day I read an insurance company
statement The insurance statisticians said that accidents have become
so scarce in the past decade that theyll be virtually nonexistent
in another halfcentury Ill be  by that time just in the prime of
life If there arent any more accident victims what will I do for a
living I couldnt find a job at that age you know

The other two doctors shrugged their shoulders in unison With the
wisdom of age Dr Manville said

Well if you find yourself in that situation you can always go to see
a doctor
