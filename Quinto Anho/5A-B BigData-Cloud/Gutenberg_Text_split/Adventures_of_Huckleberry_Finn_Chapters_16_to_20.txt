CHAPTER XVI

WE slept most all day and started out at night a little ways behind a
monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession  She had
four long sweeps at each end so we judged she carried as many as thirty
men likely  She had five big wigwams aboard wide apart and an open
camp fire in the middle and a tall flagpole at each end  There was a
power of style about her  It AMOUNTED to something being a raftsman on
such a craft as that

We went drifting down into a big bend and the night clouded up and got
hot  The river was very wide and was walled with solid timber on both
sides you couldnt see a break in it hardly ever or a light  We talked
about Cairo and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it  I
said likely we wouldnt because I had heard say there warnt but about a
dozen houses there and if they didnt happen to have them lit up how
was we going to know we was passing a town  Jim said if the two big
rivers joined together there that would show  But I said maybe we might
think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old
river again That disturbed Jimand me too  So the question was what
to do  I said paddle ashore the first time a light showed and tell
them pap was behind coming along with a tradingscow and was a green
hand at the business and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo  Jim
thought it was a good idea so we took a smoke on it and waited

There warnt nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town and
not pass it without seeing it  He said hed be mighty sure to see it
because hed be a free man the minute he seen it but if he missed it
hed be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom  Every
little while he jumps up and says

Dah she is

But it warnt  It was Jackolanterns or lightning bugs so he set
down again and went to watching same as before  Jim said it made him
all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom  Well I can
tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish too to hear him
because I begun to get it through my head that he WAS most freeand who
was to blame for it  Why ME  I couldnt get that out of my conscience
no how nor no way It got to troubling me so I couldnt rest I couldnt
stay still in one place  It hadnt ever come home to me before what
this thing was that I was doing  But now it did and it stayed with me
and scorched me more and more  I tried to make out to myself that I
warnt to blame because I didnt run Jim off from his rightful owner
but it warnt no use conscience up and says every time But you knowed
he was running for his freedom and you could a paddled ashore and told
somebody  That was soI couldnt get around that noway  That was
where it pinched  Conscience says to me What had poor Miss Watson done
to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and
never say one single word  What did that poor old woman do to you that
you could treat her so mean  Why she tried to learn you your book she
tried to learn you your manners she tried to be good to you every way
she knowed how  THATS what she done

I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead  I
fidgeted up and down the raft abusing myself to myself and Jim was
fidgeting up and down past me  We neither of us could keep still  Every
time he danced around and says Dahs Cairo it went through me like a
shot and I thought if it WAS Cairo I reckoned I would die of
miserableness

Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself  He was
saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he
would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent and when he
got enough he would buy his wife which was owned on a farm close to
where Miss Watson lived and then they would both work to buy the two
children and if their master wouldnt sell them theyd get an
Ablitionist to go and steal them

It most froze me to hear such talk  He wouldnt ever dared to talk such
talk in his life before  Just see what a difference it made in him the
minute he judged he was about free  It was according to the old saying
Give a nigger an inch and hell take an ell  Thinks I this is what
comes of my not thinking  Here was this nigger which I had as good as
helped to run away coming right out flatfooted and saying he would
steal his childrenchildren that belonged to a man I didnt even know a
man that hadnt ever done me no harm

I was sorry to hear Jim say that it was such a lowering of him  My
conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever until at last I says
to it Let up on meit aint too late yetIll paddle ashore at the
first light and tell  I felt easy and happy and light as a feather
right off  All my troubles was gone  I went to looking out sharp for a
light and sort of singing to myself  By and by one showed  Jim sings
out

Wes safe Huck wes safe  Jump up and crack yo heels  Dats de good
ole Cairo at las I jis knows it

I says

Ill take the canoe and go and see Jim  It mightnt be you know

He jumped and got the canoe ready and put his old coat in the bottom for
me to set on and give me the paddle and as I shoved off he says

Pooty soon Ill be ashoutn for joy en Ill say its all on accounts
o Huck Is a free man en I couldnt ever ben free ef it hadn ben for
Huck Huck done it  Jim wont ever forgit you Huck yous de bes fren
Jims ever had en yous de ONLY fren ole Jims got now

I was paddling off all in a sweat to tell on him but when he says this
it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me  I went along slow
then and I warnt right down certain whether I was glad I started or
whether I warnt  When I was fifty yards off Jim says

Dah you goes de ole true Huck de ony white genlman dat ever kep his
promise to ole Jim

Well I just felt sick  But I says I GOT to do itI cant get OUT of
it  Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns and
they stopped and I stopped  One of them says

Whats that yonder

A piece of a raft I says

Do you belong on it

Yes sir

Any men on it

Only one sir

Well theres five niggers run off tonight up yonder above the head of
the bend  Is your man white or black

I didnt answer up prompt  I tried to but the words wouldnt come I
tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it but I warnt man
enoughhadnt the spunk of a rabbit  I see I was weakening so I just
give up trying and up and says

Hes white

I reckon well go and see for ourselves

I wish you would says I because its pap thats there and maybe
youd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is  Hes sickand so
is mam and Mary Ann

Oh the devil were in a hurry boy  But I spose weve got to  Come
buckle to your paddle and lets get along

I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars  When we had made a
stroke or two I says

Papll be mighty much obleeged to you I can tell you  Everybody goes
away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore and I cant do it
by myself

Well thats infernal mean  Odd too  Say boy whats the matter with
your father

Its theathewell it aint anything much

They stopped pulling  It warnt but a mighty little ways to the raft
now One says

Boy thats a lie  What IS the matter with your pap  Answer up square
now and itll be the better for you

I will sir I will honestbut dont leave us please  Its thethe
Gentlemen if youll only pull ahead and let me heave you the
headline you wont have to come anear the raftplease do

Set her back John set her back says one  They backed water  Keep
away boykeep to looard  Confound it I just expect the wind has
blowed it to us  Your paps got the smallpox and you know it precious
well  Why didnt you come out and say so  Do you want to spread it all
over

Well says I ablubbering Ive told everybody before and they just
went away and left us

Poor devil theres something in that  We are right down sorry for you
but wewell hang it we dont want the smallpox you see  Look here
Ill tell you what to do  Dont you try to land by yourself or youll
smash everything to pieces  You float along down about twenty miles and
youll come to a town on the lefthand side of the river  It will be
long after sunup then and when you ask for help you tell them your
folks are all down with chills and fever  Dont be a fool again and let
people guess what is the matter  Now were trying to do you a kindness
so you just put twenty miles between us thats a good boy  It wouldnt
do any good to land yonder where the light isits only a woodyard
Say I reckon your fathers poor and Im bound to say hes in pretty
hard luck  Here Ill put a twentydollar gold piece on this board and
you get it when it floats by  I feel mighty mean to leave you but my
kingdom it wont do to fool with smallpox dont you see

Hold on Parker says the other man heres a twenty to put on the
board for me  Goodbye boy you do as Mr Parker told you and youll
be all right

Thats so my boygoodbye goodbye  If you see any runaway niggers
you get help and nab them and you can make some money by it

Goodbye sir says I I wont let no runaway niggers get by me if I
can help it

They went off and I got aboard the raft feeling bad and low because I
knowed very well I had done wrong and I see it warnt no use for me to
try to learn to do right a body that dont get STARTED right when hes
little aint got no showwhen the pinch comes there aint nothing to
back him up and keep him to his work and so he gets beat  Then I
thought a minute and says to myself hold on spose youd a done right
and give Jim up would you felt better than what you do now  No says I
Id feel badId feel just the same way I do now  Well then says I
whats the use you learning to do right when its troublesome to do right
and aint no trouble to do wrong and the wages is just the same  I was
stuck  I couldnt answer that  So I reckoned I wouldnt bother no more
about it but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time

I went into the wigwam Jim warnt there  I looked all around he warnt
anywhere  I says

Jim

Here I is Huck  Is dey out o sight yit  Dont talk loud

He was in the river under the stern oar with just his nose out  I told
him they were out of sight so he come aboard  He says

I was alistenin to all de talk en I slips into de river en was gwyne
to shove for sho if dey come aboard  Den I was gwyne to swim to de raf
agin when dey was gone  But lawsy how you did fool em Huck  Dat WUZ
de smartes dodge  I tell you chile Ispec it save ole Jimole Jim
aint going to forgit you for dat honey

Then we talked about the money  It was a pretty good raisetwenty
dollars apiece  Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now
and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free States
He said twenty mile more warnt far for the raft to go but he wished we
was already there

Towards daybreak we tied up and Jim was mighty particular about hiding
the raft good  Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles and
getting all ready to quit rafting

That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down
in a lefthand bend

I went off in the canoe to ask about it  Pretty soon I found a man out
in the river with a skiff setting a trotline  I ranged up and says

Mister is that town Cairo

Cairo no  You must be a blame fool

What town is it mister

If you want to know go and find out  If you stay here botherin around
me for about a half a minute longer youll get something you wont want

I paddled to the raft  Jim was awful disappointed but I said never
mind Cairo would be the next place I reckoned

We passed another town before daylight and I was going out again but it
was high ground so I didnt go  No high ground about Cairo Jim said
I had forgot it  We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to
the lefthand bank  I begun to suspicion something  So did Jim  I
says

Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night

He says

Doan les talk about it Huck  Po niggers cant have no luck  I
awluz spected dat rattlesnakeskin warnt done wid its work

I wish Id never seen that snakeskin JimI do wish Id never laid
eyes on it

It aint yo fault Huck you didn know  Dont you blame yoself bout
it

When it was daylight here was the clear Ohio water inshore sure enough
and outside was the old regular Muddy  So it was all up with Cairo

We talked it all over  It wouldnt do to take to the shore we couldnt
take the raft up the stream of course  There warnt no way but to wait
for dark and start back in the canoe and take the chances  So we slept
all day amongst the cottonwood thicket so as to be fresh for the work
and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone

We didnt say a word for a good while  There warnt anything to say  We
both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnakeskin so
what was the use to talk about it  It would only look like we was
finding fault and that would be bound to fetch more bad luckand keep
on fetching it too till we knowed enough to keep still

By and by we talked about what we better do and found there warnt no
way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a
canoe to go back in  We warnt going to borrow it when there warnt
anybody around the way pap would do for that might set people after us

So we shoved out after dark on the raft

Anybody that dont believe yet that its foolishness to handle a
snakeskin after all that that snakeskin done for us will believe
it now if they read on and see what more it done for us

The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore  But we
didnt see no rafts laying up so we went along during three hours and
more  Well the night got gray and ruther thick which is the next
meanest thing to fog  You cant tell the shape of the river and you
cant see no distance It got to be very late and still and then along
comes a steamboat up the river  We lit the lantern and judged she would
see it  Upstream boats didnt generly come close to us they go out and
follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs but nights like
this they bull right up the channel against the whole river

We could hear her pounding along but we didnt see her good till she was
close  She aimed right for us  Often they do that and try to see how
close they can come without touching sometimes the wheel bites off a
sweep and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs and thinks hes
mighty smart  Well here she comes and we said she was going to try and
shave us but she didnt seem to be sheering off a bit  She was a big
one and she was coming in a hurry too looking like a black cloud with
rows of glowworms around it but all of a sudden she bulged out big and
scary with a long row of wideopen furnace doors shining like redhot
teeth and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us  There
was a yell at us and a jingling of bells to stop the engines a powwow
of cussing and whistling of steamand as Jim went overboard on one side
and I on the other she come smashing straight through the raft

I divedand I aimed to find the bottom too for a thirtyfoot wheel had
got to go over me and I wanted it to have plenty of room  I could
always stay under water a minute this time I reckon I stayed under a
minute and a half  Then I bounced for the top in a hurry for I was
nearly busting  I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of
my nose and puffed a bit  Of course there was a booming current and of
course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped
them for they never cared much for raftsmen so now she was churning
along up the river out of sight in the thick weather though I could
hear her

I sung out for Jim about a dozen times but I didnt get any answer so I
grabbed a plank that touched me while I was treading water and struck
out for shore shoving it ahead of me  But I made out to see that the
drift of the current was towards the lefthand shore which meant that I
was in a crossing so I changed off and went that way

It was one of these long slanting twomile crossings so I was a good
long time in getting over  I made a safe landing and clumb up the bank
I couldnt see but a little ways but I went poking along over rough
ground for a quarter of a mile or more and then I run across a big
oldfashioned double loghouse before I noticed it  I was going to rush
by and get away but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and
barking at me and I knowed better than to move another peg




CHAPTER XVII

IN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head
out and says

Be done boys  Whos there

I says

Its me

Whos me

George Jackson sir

What do you want

I dont want nothing sir  I only want to go along by but the dogs
wont let me

What are you prowling around here this time of night forhey

I warnt prowling around sir I fell overboard off of the steamboat

Oh you did did you  Strike a light there somebody  What did you say
your name was

George Jackson sir  Im only a boy

Look here if youre telling the truth you neednt be afraidnobodyll
hurt you  But dont try to budge stand right where you are  Rouse out
Bob and Tom some of you and fetch the guns  George Jackson is there
anybody with you

No sir nobody

I heard the people stirring around in the house now and see a light
The man sung out

Snatch that light away Betsy you old foolaint you got any sense
Put it on the floor behind the front door  Bob if you and Tom are
ready take your places

All ready

Now George Jackson do you know the Shepherdsons

No sir I never heard of them

Well that may be so and it maynt  Now all ready  Step forward
George Jackson  And mind dont you hurrycome mighty slow  If theres
anybody with you let him keep backif he shows himself hell be shot
Come along now  Come slow push the door open yourselfjust enough to
squeeze in d you hear

I didnt hurry I couldnt if Id a wanted to  I took one slow step at a
time and there warnt a sound only I thought I could hear my heart  The
dogs were as still as the humans but they followed a little behind me
When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and
unbarring and unbolting  I put my hand on the door and pushed it a
little and a little more till somebody said There thats enoughput
your head in I done it but I judged they would take it off

The candle was on the floor and there they all was looking at me and
me at them for about a quarter of a minute  Three big men with guns
pointed at me which made me wince I tell you the oldest gray and
about sixty the other two thirty or moreall of them fine and handsome
and the sweetest old grayheaded lady and back of her two young women
which I couldnt see right well  The old gentleman says

There I reckon its all right  Come in

As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it
and bolted it and told the young men to come in with their guns and
they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor and
got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windows
there warnt none on the side  They held the candle and took a good
look at me and all said Why HE aint a Shepherdsonno there aint
any Shepherdson about him  Then the old man said he hoped I wouldnt
mind being searched for arms because he didnt mean no harm by itit
was only to make sure  So he didnt pry into my pockets but only felt
outside with his hands and said it was all right  He told me to make
myself easy and at home and tell all about myself but the old lady
says

Why bless you Saul the poor things as wet as he can be and dont
you reckon it may be hes hungry

True for you RachelI forgot

So the old lady says

Betsy this was a nigger woman you fly around and get him something
to eat as quick as you can poor thing and one of you girls go and wake
up Buck and tell himoh here he is himself  Buck take this little
stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of
yours thats dry

Buck looked about as old as methirteen or fourteen or along there
though he was a little bigger than me  He hadnt on anything but a
shirt and he was very frowzyheaded  He came in gaping and digging one
fist into his eyes and he was dragging a gun along with the other one
He says

Aint they no Shepherdsons around

They said no twas a false alarm

Well he says if theyd a ben some I reckon Id a got one

They all laughed and Bob says

Why Buck they might have scalped us all youve been so slow in
coming

Well nobody come after me and it aint right Im always kept down I
dont get no show

Never mind Buck my boy says the old man youll have show enough
all in good time dont you fret about that  Go long with you now and
do as your mother told you

When we got upstairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a
roundabout and pants of his and I put them on  While I was at it he
asked me what my name was but before I could tell him he started to tell
me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day
before yesterday and he asked me where Moses was when the candle went
out  I said I didnt know I hadnt heard about it before no way

Well guess he says

Howm I going to guess says I when I never heard tell of it before

But you can guess cant you  Its just as easy

WHICH candle  I says

Why any candle he says

I dont know where he was says I where was he

Why he was in the DARK  Thats where he was

Well if you knowed where he was what did you ask me for

Why blame it its a riddle dont you see  Say how long are you
going to stay here  You got to stay always  We can just have booming
timesthey dont have no school now  Do you own a dog  Ive got a
dogand hell go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in  Do
you like to comb up Sundays and all that kind of foolishness  You bet I
dont but ma she makes me  Confound these ole britches  I reckon Id
better put em on but Id ruther not its so warm  Are you all ready
All right  Come along old hoss

Cold cornpone cold cornbeef butter and buttermilkthat is what they
had for me down there and there aint nothing better that ever Ive come
across yet  Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes except the
nigger woman which was gone and the two young women  They all smoked
and talked and I eat and talked  The young women had quilts around
them and their hair down their backs  They all asked me questions and
I told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm
down at the bottom of Arkansaw and my sister Mary Ann run off and got
married and never was heard of no more and Bill went to hunt them and he
warnt heard of no more and Tom and Mort died and then there warnt
nobody but just me and pap left and he was just trimmed down to nothing
on account of his troubles so when he died I took what there was left
because the farm didnt belong to us and started up the river deck
passage and fell overboard and that was how I come to be here  So they
said I could have a home there as long as I wanted it  Then it was most
daylight and everybody went to bed and I went to bed with Buck and when
I waked up in the morning drat it all I had forgot what my name was
So I laid there about an hour trying to think and when Buck waked up I
says

Can you spell Buck

Yes he says

I bet you cant spell my name says I

I bet you what you dare I can says he

All right says I go ahead

George Jaxonthere now he says

Well says I you done it but I didnt think you could  It aint no
slouch of a name to spellright off without studying

I set it down private because somebody might want ME to spell it next
and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was used to
it

It was a mighty nice family and a mighty nice house too  I hadnt seen
no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much
style  It didnt have an iron latch on the front door nor a wooden one
with a buckskin string but a brass knob to turn the same as houses in
town There warnt no bed in the parlor nor a sign of a bed but heaps
of parlors in towns has beds in them  There was a big fireplace that was
bricked on the bottom and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring
water on them and scrubbing them with another brick sometimes they wash
them over with red waterpaint that they call Spanishbrown same as they
do in town  They had big brass dogirons that could hold up a sawlog
There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece with a picture of a
town painted on the bottom half of the glass front and a round place in
the middle of it for the sun and you could see the pendulum swinging
behind it  It was beautiful to hear that clock tick and sometimes when
one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in
good shape she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she
got tuckered out  They wouldnt took any money for her

Well there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock made
out of something like chalk and painted up gaudy  By one of the parrots
was a cat made of crockery and a crockery dog by the other and when you
pressed down on them they squeaked but didnt open their mouths nor look
different nor interested  They squeaked through underneath  There was a
couple of big wildturkeywing fans spread out behind those things  On
the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery
basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it
which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is but
they warnt real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off
and showed the white chalk or whatever it was underneath

This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth with a red and
blue spreadeagle painted on it and a painted border all around  It
come all the way from Philadelphia they said  There was some books
too piled up perfectly exact on each corner of the table  One was a
big family Bible full of pictures  One was Pilgrims Progress about a
man that left his family it didnt say why  I read considerable in it
now and then  The statements was interesting but tough  Another was
Friendships Offering full of beautiful stuff and poetry but I didnt
read the poetry  Another was Henry Clays Speeches and another was Dr
Gunns Family Medicine which told you all about what to do if a body was
sick or dead  There was a hymn book and a lot of other books  And
there was nice splitbottom chairs and perfectly sound toonot bagged
down in the middle and busted like an old basket

They had pictures hung on the wallsmainly Washingtons and Lafayettes
and battles and Highland Marys and one called Signing the
Declaration There was some that they called crayons which one of the
daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen
years old  They was different from any pictures I ever see before
blacker mostly than is common  One was a woman in a slim black dress
belted small under the armpits with bulges like a cabbage in the middle
of the sleeves and a large black scoopshovel bonnet with a black veil
and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape and very wee black
slippers like a chisel and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on
her right elbow under a weeping willow and her other hand hanging down
her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule and underneath the
picture it said Shall I Never See Thee More Alas  Another one was a
young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head
and knotted there in front of a comb like a chairback and she was
crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her
other hand with its heels up and underneath the picture it said I Shall
Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas  There was one where a young
lady was at a window looking up at the moon and tears running down her
cheeks and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax
showing on one edge of it and she was mashing a locket with a chain to
it against her mouth and underneath the picture it said And Art Thou
Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas  These was all nice pictures I reckon but
I didnt somehow seem to take to them because if ever I was down a
little they always give me the fantods  Everybody was sorry she died
because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do and a body
could see by what she had done what they had lost  But I reckoned that
with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard  She
was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took
sick and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to
live till she got it done but she never got the chance  It was a
picture of a young woman in a long white gown standing on the rail of a
bridge all ready to jump off with her hair all down her back and
looking up to the moon with the tears running down her face and she had
two arms folded across her breast and two arms stretched out in front
and two more reaching up towards the moonand the idea was to see which
pair would look best and then scratch out all the other arms but as I
was saying she died before she got her mind made up and now they kept
this picture over the head of the bed in her room and every time her
birthday come they hung flowers on it  Other times it was hid with a
little curtain  The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice
sweet face but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery
seemed to me

This young girl kept a scrapbook when she was alive and used to paste
obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the
Presbyterian Observer and write poetry after them out of her own head
It was very good poetry  This is what she wrote about a boy by the name
of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded

ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS DECD

And did young Stephen sicken And did young Stephen die And did the sad
hearts thicken And did the mourners cry

No such was not the fate of Young Stephen Dowling Bots Though sad
hearts round him thickened Twas not from sickness shots

No whoopingcough did rack his frame Nor measles drear with spots Not
these impaired the sacred name Of Stephen Dowling Bots

Despised love struck not with woe That head of curly knots Nor stomach
troubles laid him low Young Stephen Dowling Bots

O no  Then list with tearful eye Whilst I his fate do tell His soul
did from this cold world fly By falling down a well

They got him out and emptied him Alas it was too late His spirit was
gone for to sport aloft In the realms of the good and great

If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was
fourteen there aint no telling what she could a done by and by  Buck
said she could rattle off poetry like nothing  She didnt ever have to
stop to think  He said she would slap down a line and if she couldnt
find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down
another one and go ahead She warnt particular she could write about
anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful
Every time a man died or a woman died or a child died she would be on
hand with her tribute before he was cold  She called them tributes
The neighbors said it was the doctor first then Emmeline then the
undertakerthe undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once and
then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead persons name which was
Whistler  She warnt ever the same after that she never complained but
she kinder pined away and did not live long  Poor thing manys the time
I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out
her poor old scrapbook and read in it when her pictures had been
aggravating me and I had soured on her a little  I liked all that
family dead ones and all and warnt going to let anything come between
us  Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was
alive and it didnt seem right that there warnt nobody to make some
about her now she was gone so I tried to sweat out a verse or two
myself but I couldnt seem to make it go somehow  They kept Emmelines
room trim and nice and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked
to have them when she was alive and nobody ever slept there  The old
lady took care of the room herself though there was plenty of niggers
and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there mostly

Well as I was saying about the parlor there was beautiful curtains on
the windows  white with pictures painted on them of castles with vines
all down the walls and cattle coming down to drink  There was a little
old piano too that had tin pans in it I reckon and nothing was ever
so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing The Last Link is Broken and
play The Battle of Prague on it  The walls of all the rooms was
plastered and most had carpets on the floors and the whole house was
whitewashed on the outside

It was a double house and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and
floored and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day
and it was a cool comfortable place  Nothing couldnt be better  And
warnt the cooking good and just bushels of it too




CHAPTER XVIII

COL  GRANGERFORD was a gentleman you see  He was a gentleman all over
and so was his family  He was well born as the saying is and thats
worth as much in a man as it is in a horse so the Widow Douglas said
and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town
and pap he always said it too though he warnt no more quality than a
mudcat himself  Col  Grangerford was very tall and very slim and had a
darkishpaly complexion not a sign of red in it anywheres he was clean
shaved every morning all over his thin face and he had the thinnest kind
of lips and the thinnest kind of nostrils and a high nose and heavy
eyebrows and the blackest kind of eyes sunk so deep back that they
seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you as you may say  His
forehead was high and his hair was black and straight and hung to his
shoulders His hands was long and thin and every day of his life he put
on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so
white it hurt your eyes to look at it and on Sundays he wore a blue
tailcoat with brass buttons on it  He carried a mahogany cane with a
silver head to it  There warnt no frivolishness about him not a bit
and he warnt ever loud  He was as kind as he could beyou could feel
that you know and so you had confidence  Sometimes he smiled and it
was good to see but when he straightened himself up like a libertypole
and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows you
wanted to climb a tree first and find out what the matter was
afterwards  He didnt ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners
everybody was always goodmannered where he was  Everybody loved to have
him around too he was sunshine most alwaysI mean he made it seem
like good weather  When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for
half a minute and that was enough there wouldnt nothing go wrong again
for a week

When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up
out of their chairs and give them goodday and didnt set down again
till they had set down  Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the
decanter was and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him and he
held it in his hand and waited till Toms and Bobs was mixed and then
they bowed and said Our duty to you sir and madam and THEY bowed
the least bit in the world and said thank you and so they drank all
three and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the
mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers and give
it to me and Buck and we drank to the old people too

Bob was the oldest and Tom nexttall beautiful men with very broad
shoulders and brown faces and long black hair and black eyes  They
dressed in white linen from head to foot like the old gentleman and
wore broad Panama hats

Then there was Miss Charlotte she was twentyfive and tall and proud
and grand but as good as she could be when she warnt stirred up but
when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks like
her father  She was beautiful

So was her sister Miss Sophia but it was a different kind  She was
gentle and sweet like a dove and she was only twenty

Each person had their own nigger to wait on themBuck too  My nigger
had a monstrous easy time because I warnt used to having anybody do
anything for me but Bucks was on the jump most of the time

This was all there was of the family now but there used to be more
three sons they got killed and Emmeline that died

The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers
Sometimes a stack of people would come there horseback from ten or
fifteen mile around and stay five or six days and have such junketings
round about and on the river and dances and picnics in the woods
daytimes and balls at the house nights  These people was mostly
kinfolks of the family  The men brought their guns with them  It was a
handsome lot of quality I tell you

There was another clan of aristocracy around therefive or six families
mostly of the name of Shepherdson  They was as hightoned and well
born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords  The Shepherdsons
and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing which was about two
mile above our house so sometimes when I went up there with a lot of our
folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their fine horses

One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting and heard a horse
coming  We was crossing the road  Buck says

Quick  Jump for the woods

We done it and then peeped down the woods through the leaves  Pretty
soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road setting his horse
easy and looking like a soldier  He had his gun across his pommel  I
had seen him before  It was young Harney Shepherdson  I heard Bucks
gun go off at my ear and Harneys hat tumbled off from his head  He
grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid  But we
didnt wait  We started through the woods on a run  The woods warnt
thick so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet and twice I seen
Harney cover Buck with his gun and then he rode away the way he cometo
get his hat I reckon but I couldnt see  We never stopped running till
we got home  The old gentlemans eyes blazed a minutetwas pleasure
mainly I judgedthen his face sort of smoothed down and he says
kind of gentle

I dont like that shooting from behind a bush  Why didnt you step into
the road my boy

The Shepherdsons dont father  They always take advantage

Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling
his tale and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped  The two young
men looked dark but never said nothing  Miss Sophia she turned pale
but the color come back when she found the man warnt hurt

Soon as I could get Buck down by the corncribs under the trees by
ourselves I says

Did you want to kill him Buck

Well I bet I did

What did he do to you

Him  He never done nothing to me

Well then what did you want to kill him for

Why nothingonly its on account of the feud

Whats a feud

Why where was you raised  Dont you know what a feud is

Never heard of it beforetell me about it

Well says Buck a feud is this way  A man has a quarrel with another
man and kills him then that other mans brother kills HIM then the
other brothers on both sides goes for one another then the COUSINS
chip inand by and by everybodys killed off and there aint no more
feud  But its kind of slow and takes a long time

Has this one been going on long Buck

Well I should RECKON  It started thirty year ago or somers along
there  There was trouble bout something and then a lawsuit to settle
it and the suit went agin one of the men and so he up and shot the man
that won the suitwhich he would naturally do of course  Anybody
would

What was the trouble about Buckland

I reckon maybeI dont know

Well who done the shooting  Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson

Laws how do I know  It was so long ago

Dont anybody know

Oh yes pa knows I reckon and some of the other old people but they
dont know now what the row was about in the first place

Has there been many killed Buck

Yes right smart chance of funerals  But they dont always kill  Pas
got a few buckshot in him but he dont mind it cuz he dont weigh much
anyway  Bobs been carved up some with a bowie and Toms been hurt once
or twice

Has anybody been killed this year Buck

Yes we got one and they got one  Bout three months ago my cousin Bud
fourteen year old was riding through the woods on tother side of the
river and didnt have no weapon with him which was blame foolishness
and in a lonesome place he hears a horse acoming behind him and sees
old Baldy Shepherdson alinkin after him with his gun in his hand and
his white hair aflying in the wind and stead of jumping off and taking
to the brush Bud lowed he could outrun him so they had it nip and
tuck for five mile or more the old man againing all the time so at
last Bud seen it warnt any use so he stopped and faced around so as to
have the bullet holes in front you know and the old man he rode up and
shot him down  But he didnt git much chance to enjoy his luck for
inside of a week our folks laid HIM out

I reckon that old man was a coward Buck

I reckon he WARNT a coward  Not by a blame sight  There aint a
coward amongst them Shepherdsonsnot a one  And there aint no cowards
amongst the Grangerfords either  Why that old man kep up his end in a
fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords and come out
winner  They was all ahorseback he lit off of his horse and got behind
a little woodpile and kep his horse before him to stop the bullets but
the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man
and peppered away at him and he peppered away at them  Him and his
horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled but the Grangerfords had
to be FETCHED homeand one of em was dead and another died the next
day  No sir if a bodys out hunting for cowards he dont want to fool
away any time amongst them Shepherdsons becuz they dont breed any of
that KIND

Next Sunday we all went to church about three mile everybody
ahorseback The men took their guns along so did Buck and kept them
between their knees or stood them handy against the wall  The
Shepherdsons done the same  It was pretty ornery preachingall about
brotherly love and suchlike tiresomeness but everybody said it was a
good sermon and they all talked it over going home and had such a
powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and
preforeordestination and I dont know what all that it did seem to me
to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet

About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around some in their
chairs and some in their rooms and it got to be pretty dull  Buck and a
dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep  I went up to
our room and judged I would take a nap myself  I found that sweet Miss
Sophia standing in her door which was next to ours and she took me in
her room and shut the door very soft and asked me if I liked her and I
said I did and she asked me if I would do something for her and not tell
anybody and I said I would  Then she said shed forgot her Testament
and left it in the seat at church between two other books and would I
slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her and not say nothing to
nobody  I said I would So I slid out and slipped off up the road and
there warnt anybody at the church except maybe a hog or two for there
warnt any lock on the door and hogs likes a puncheon floor in
summertime because its cool  If you notice most folks dont go
to church only when theyve got to but a hog is different

Says I to myself somethings up it aint natural for a girl to be in
such a sweat about a Testament  So I give it a shake and out drops a
little piece of paper with HALFPAST TWO wrote on it with a pencil  I
ransacked it but couldnt find anything else  I couldnt make anything
out of that so I put the paper in the book again and when I got home
and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me  She
pulled me in and shut the door then she looked in the Testament till she
found the paper and as soon as she read it she looked glad and before a
body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze and said I was the
best boy in the world and not to tell anybody  She was mighty red in
the face for a minute and her eyes lighted up and it made her powerful
pretty  I was a good deal astonished but when I got my breath I asked
her what the paper was about and she asked me if I had read it and I
said no and she asked me if I could read writing and I told her no
only coarsehand and then she said the paper warnt anything but a
bookmark to keep her place and I might go and play now

I went off down to the river studying over this thing and pretty soon I
noticed that my nigger was following along behind  When we was out of
sight of the house he looked back and around a second and then comes
arunning and says

Mars Jawge if youll come down into de swamp Ill show you a whole
stack o watermoccasins

Thinks I thats mighty curious he said that yesterday  He oughter know
a body dont love watermoccasins enough to go around hunting for them
What is he up to anyway  So I says

All right trot ahead

I followed a half a mile then he struck out over the swamp and waded
ankle deep as much as another halfmile  We come to a little flat piece
of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines and
he says

You shove right in dah jist a few steps Mars Jawge dahs whah dey is
Is seed m befo I dont kyer to see em no mo

Then he slopped right along and went away and pretty soon the trees hid
him  I poked into the place aways and come to a little open patch as
big as a bedroom all hung around with vines and found a man laying there
asleepand by jings it was my old Jim

I waked him up and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him
to see me again but it warnt  He nearly cried he was so glad but he
warnt surprised  Said he swum along behind me that night and heard me
yell every time but dasnt answer because he didnt want nobody to pick
HIM up and take him into slavery again  Says he

I got hurt a little en couldnt swim fas so I wuz a considable ways
behine you towards de las when you landed I reckned I could ketch up

truth

I dont want to talk much about the next day  I reckon Ill cut it
pretty short  I waked up about dawn and was agoing to turn over and go
to sleep again when I noticed how still it wasdidnt seem to be anybody
stirring  That warnt usual  Next I noticed that Buck was up and gone
Well I gets up awondering and goes down stairsnobody around
everything as still as a mouse  Just the same outside  Thinks I what
does it mean  Down by the woodpile I comes across my Jack and says

Whats it all about

he loaded up his gun en lowed hes gwyne to fetch home a Shepherdson or
bust Well deyll be plenty un m dah I reckn en you bet you hell
fetch one ef he gits a chanst

I took up the river road as hard as I could put  By and by I begin to
hear guns a good ways off  When I came in sight of the log store and the
woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees and
brush till I got to a good place and then I clumb up into the forks of a
cottonwood that was out of reach and watched  There was a woodrank
four foot high a little ways in front of the tree and first I was going
to hide behind that but maybe it was luckier I didnt

There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open
place before the log store cussing and yelling and trying to get at a
couple of young chaps that was behind the woodrank alongside of the
steamboat landing but they couldnt come it  Every time one of them
showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at  The two
boys was squatting back to back behind the pile so they could watch both
ways

By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling  They started
riding towards the store then up gets one of the boys draws a steady
bead over the woodrank and drops one of them out of his saddle  All
the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started
to carry him to the store and that minute the two boys started on the
run  They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed
Then the men see them and jumped on their horses and took out after
them  They gained on the boys but it didnt do no good the boys had
too good a start they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree
and slipped in behind it and so they had the bulge on the men again
One of the boys was Buck and the other was a slim young chap about
nineteen years old

The men ripped around awhile and then rode away  As soon as they was
out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him  He didnt know what to
make of my voice coming out of the tree at first  He was awful
surprised  He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men
come in sight again said they was up to some devilment or other
wouldnt be gone long  I wished I was out of that tree but I dasnt
come down  Buck begun to cry and rip and lowed that him and his cousin
Joe that was the other young chap would make up for this day yet  He
said his father and his two brothers was killed and two or three of the
enemy  Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush  Buck said his
father and brothers ought to waited for their relationsthe Shepherdsons
was too strong for them  I asked him what was become of young Harney and
Miss Sophia  He said theyd got across the river and was safe  I was
glad of that but the way Buck did take on because he didnt manage to
kill Harney that day he shot at himI haint ever heard anything like
it

All of a sudden bang bang bang goes three or four gunsthe men had
slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their
horses  The boys jumped for the riverboth of them hurtand as they
swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and
singing out Kill them kill them  It made me so sick I most fell out
of the tree  I aint agoing to tell ALL that happenedit would make me
sick again if I was to do that  I wished I hadnt ever come ashore that
night to see such things  I aint ever going to get shut of themlots
of times I dream about them

I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark afraid to come down
Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods and twice I seen little
gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns so I reckoned the
trouble was still agoing on  I was mighty downhearted so I made up my
mind I wouldnt ever go anear that house again because I reckoned I was
to blame somehow I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss
Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at halfpast two and run off and I
judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way
she acted and then maybe he would a locked her up and this awful mess
wouldnt ever happened

When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a
piece and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water and
tugged at them till I got them ashore then I covered up their faces and
got away as quick as I could  I cried a little when I was covering up
Bucks face for he was mighty good to me

It was just dark now  I never went near the house but struck through
the woods and made for the swamp  Jim warnt on his island so I tramped
off in a hurry for the crick and crowded through the willows redhot to
jump aboard and get out of that awful country  The raft was gone  My
souls but I was scared  I couldnt get my breath for most a minute
Then I raised a yell  A voice not twentyfive foot from me says

Good lan is dat you honey  Doan make no noise

It was Jims voicenothing ever sounded so good before  I run along the
bank a piece and got aboard and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me he was
so glad to see me  He says

Laws bless you chile I uz right down sho yous dead agin  Jacks
been heah he say he reckn yous ben shot kase you didn come home no
mo so Is jes dis minute a startin de raf down towards de mouf er de
crick sos to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack comes
agin en tells me for certain you IS dead  Lawsy Is mighty glad to git
you back again honey

I says

All rightthats mighty good they wont find me and theyll think
Ive been killed and floated down the rivertheres something up there
that ll help them think soso dont you lose no time Jim but just
shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can

I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the
middle of the Mississippi  Then we hung up our signal lantern and
judged that we was free and safe once more  I hadnt had a bite to eat
since yesterday so Jim he got out some corndodgers and buttermilk and
pork and cabbage and greensthere aint nothing in the world so good
when its cooked rightand whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a
good time  I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds and so was
Jim to get away from the swamp  We said there warnt no home like a
raft after all  Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery but a
raft dont  You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft




CHAPTER XIX

TWO or three days and nights went by I reckon I might say they swum by
they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely  Here is the way we put
in the time  It was a monstrous big river down theresometimes a mile
and a half wide we run nights and laid up and hid daytimes soon as
night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied upnearly always in
the dead water under a towhead and then cut young cottonwoods and
willows and hid the raft with them  Then we set out the lines  Next we
slid into the river and had a swim so as to freshen up and cool off
then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep
and watched the daylight come  Not a sound anywheresperfectly still
just like the whole world was asleep only sometimes the bullfrogs
acluttering maybe  The first thing to see looking away over the water
was a kind of dull linethat was the woods on tother side you couldnt
make nothing else out then a pale place in the sky then more paleness
spreading around then the river softened up away off and warnt black
any more but gray you could see little dark spots drifting along ever
so far awaytrading scows and such things and long black streaks
rafts sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking or jumbled up voices
it was so still and sounds come so far and by and by you could see a
streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that theres
a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak
look that way and you see the mist curl up off of the water and the
east reddens up and the river and you make out a logcabin in the edge
of the woods away on the bank on tother side of the river being a
woodyard likely and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through
it anywheres then the nice breeze springs up and comes fanning you from
over there so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods
and the flowers but sometimes not that way because theyve left dead
fish laying around gars and such and they do get pretty rank and next
youve got the full day and everything smiling in the sun and the
songbirds just going it

A little smoke couldnt be noticed now so we would take some fish off of
the lines and cook up a hot breakfast  And afterwards we would watch the
lonesomeness of the river and kind of lazy along and by and by lazy off
to sleep  Wake up by and by and look to see what done it and maybe see
a steamboat coughing along upstream so far off towards the other side
you couldnt tell nothing about her only whether she was a sternwheel or
sidewheel then for about an hour there wouldnt be nothing to hear nor
nothing to seejust solid lonesomeness  Next youd see a raft sliding
by away off yonder and maybe a galoot on it chopping because theyre
most always doing it on a raft youd see the axe flash and come down
you dont hear nothing you see that axe go up again and by the time
its above the mans head then you hear the KCHUNKit had took all
that time to come over the water  So we would put in the day lazying
around listening to the stillness  Once there was a thick fog and the
rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats
wouldnt run over them  A scow or a raft went by so close we could hear
them talking and cussing and laughingheard them plain but we couldnt
see no sign of them it made you feel crawly it was like spirits
carrying on that way in the air  Jim said he believed it was spirits
but I says

No spirits wouldnt say Dern the dern fog

Soon as it was night out we shoved when we got her out to about the
middle we let her alone and let her float wherever the current wanted
her to then we lit the pipes and dangled our legs in the water and
talked about all kinds of thingswe was always naked day and night
whenever the mosquitoes would let usthe new clothes Bucks folks made
for me was too good to be comfortable and besides I didnt go much on
clothes nohow

Sometimes wed have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest
time Yonder was the banks and the islands across the water and maybe a
sparkwhich was a candle in a cabin window and sometimes on the water
you could see a spark or twoon a raft or a scow you know and maybe
you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts
Its lovely to live on a raft  We had the sky up there all speckled
with stars and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them and
discuss about whether they was made or only just happened  Jim he
allowed they was made but I allowed they happened I judged it would
have took too long to MAKE so many  Jim said the moon could a LAID them
well that looked kind of reasonable so I didnt say nothing against it
because Ive seen a frog lay most as many so of course it could be done
We used to watch the stars that fell too and see them streak down  Jim
allowed theyd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest

Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the
dark and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of
her chimbleys and they would rain down in the river and look awful
pretty then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and
her powwow shut off and leave the river still again and by and by her
waves would get to us a long time after she was gone and joggle the
raft a bit and after that you wouldnt hear nothing for you couldnt
tell how long except maybe frogs or something

After midnight the people on shore went to bed and then for two or three
hours the shores was blackno more sparks in the cabin windows  These
sparks was our clockthe first one that showed again meant morning was
coming so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away

One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to
the main shoreit was only two hundred yardsand paddled about a mile
up a crick amongst the cypress woods to see if I couldnt get some
berries Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed
the crick here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as
they could foot it  I thought I was a goner for whenever anybody was
after anybody I judged it was MEor maybe Jim  I was about to dig out
from there in a hurry but they was pretty close to me then and sung out
and begged me to save their livessaid they hadnt been doing nothing
and was being chased for itsaid there was men and dogs acoming  They
wanted to jump right in but I says

Dont you do it  I dont hear the dogs and horses yet youve got time
to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways then you
take to the water and wade down to me and get inthatll throw the dogs
off the scent

They done it and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead and
in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off
shouting We heard them come along towards the crick but couldnt see
them they seemed to stop and fool around a while then as we got
further and further away all the time we couldnt hardly hear them at
all by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the
river everything was quiet and we paddled over to the towhead and hid
in the cottonwoods and was safe

One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards and had a bald head
and very gray whiskers  He had an old batteredup slouch hat on and a
greasy blue woollen shirt and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed
into his boottops and homeknit gallusesno he only had one  He had
an old longtailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over
his arm and both of them had big fat rattylooking carpetbags

The other fellow was about thirty and dressed about as ornery  After
breakfast we all laid off and talked and the first thing that come out
was that these chaps didnt know one another

What got you into trouble says the baldhead to tother chap

Well Id been selling an article to take the tartar off the teethand
it does take it off too and generly the enamel along with itbut I
stayed about one night longer than I ought to and was just in the act of
sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town and you
told me they were coming and begged me to help you to get off  So I
told you I was expecting trouble myself and would scatter out WITH you
Thats the whole yarnwhats yourn

Well Id ben arunning a little temperance revival thar bout a week
and was the pet of the women folks big and little for I was makin it
mighty warm for the rummies I TELL you and takin as much as five or
six dollars a nightten cents a head children and niggers freeand
business agrowin all the time when somehow or another a little report
got around last night that I had a way of puttin in my time with a
private jug on the sly  A nigger rousted me out this mornin and told
me the people was getherin on the quiet with their dogs and horses and
theyd be along pretty soon and give me bout half an hours start and
then run me down if they could and if they got me theyd tar and feather
me and ride me on a rail sure  I didnt wait for no breakfastI warnt
hungry

Nobody never said anything for a while then the young man hove a sigh
and says

Alas

What re you alassin about says the baldhead

To think I should have lived to be leading such a life and be degraded
down into such company  And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with
a rag

Dern your skin aint the company good enough for you says the
baldhead pretty pert and uppish

Yes it IS good enough for me its as good as I deserve for who
fetched me so low when I was so high  I did myself  I dont blame YOU
gentlemenfar from it I dont blame anybody  I deserve it all  Let
the cold world do its worst one thing I knowtheres a grave somewhere
for me The world may go on just as its always done and take everything
from meloved ones property everything but it cant take that
Some day Ill lie down in it and forget it all and my poor broken heart
will be at rest  He went on awiping

No I know you havent  I aint blaming you gentlemen  I brought
myself downyes I did it myself  Its right I should sufferperfectly
rightI dont make any moan

Brought you down from whar  Whar was you brought down from

Ah you would not believe me the world never believeslet it pass
tis no matter  The secret of my birth

The secret of your birth  Do you mean to say

Gentlemen says the young man very solemn I will reveal it to you
for I feel I may have confidence in you  By rights I am a duke

Jims eyes bugged out when he heard that and I reckon mine did too
Then the baldhead says  No you cant mean it

Yes  My greatgrandfather eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater fled
to this country about the end of the last century to breathe the pure
air of freedom married here and died leaving a son his own father
dying about the same time  The second son of the late duke seized the
titles and estatesthe infant real duke was ignored  I am the lineal
descendant of that infantI am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater and
here am I forlorn torn from my high estate hunted of men despised by
the cold world ragged worn heartbroken and degraded to the
companionship of felons on a raft

Jim pitied him ever so much and so did I We tried to comfort him but
he said it warnt much use he couldnt be much comforted said if we was
a mind to acknowledge him that would do him more good than most anything
else so we said we would if he would tell us how  He said we ought to
bow when we spoke to him and say Your Grace or My Lord or Your
Lordshipand he wouldnt mind it if we called him plain
Bridgewater which he said was a title anyway and not a name and
one of us ought to wait on him at dinner and do any little thing for him
he wanted done

Well that was all easy so we done it  All through dinner Jim stood
around and waited on him and says Will yo Grace have some o dis or
some o dat and so on and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to
him

But the old man got pretty silent by and bydidnt have much to say and
didnt look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on
around that duke  He seemed to have something on his mind  So along in
the afternoon he says

Looky here Bilgewater he says Im nation sorry for you but you
aint the only person thats had troubles like that

No

No you aint  You aint the only person thats ben snaked down
wrongfully outn a high place

Alas

No you aint the only person thats had a secret of his birth  And
by jings HE begins to cry

Hold  What do you mean

Bilgewater kin I trust you says the old man still sort of sobbing

To the bitter death  He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it
and says That secret of your being  speak

Bilgewater I am the late Dauphin

You bet you Jim and me stared this time  Then the duke says

You are what

Yes my friend it is too trueyour eyes is lookin at this very moment
on the pore disappeared Dauphin Looy the Seventeen son of Looy the
Sixteen and Marry Antonette

You  At your age  No  You mean youre the late Charlemagne you must
be six or seven hundred years old at the very least

Trouble has done it Bilgewater trouble has done it trouble has brung
these gray hairs and this premature balditude  Yes gentlemen you see
before you in blue jeans and misery the wanderin exiled trampledon
and sufferin rightful King of France

Well he cried and took on so that me and Jim didnt know hardly what to
do we was so sorryand so glad and proud wed got him with us too  So
we set in like we done before with the duke and tried to comfort HIM
But he said it warnt no use nothing but to be dead and done with it all
could do him any good though he said it often made him feel easier and
better for a while if people treated him according to his rights and got
down on one knee to speak to him and always called him Your Majesty
and waited on him first at meals and didnt set down in his presence
till he asked them So Jim and me set to majestying him and doing this
and that and tother for him and standing up till he told us we might
set down  This done him heaps of good and so he got cheerful and
comfortable  But the duke kind of soured on him and didnt look a bit
satisfied with the way things was going still the king acted real
friendly towards him and said the dukes greatgrandfather and all the
other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by HIS father and
was allowed to come to the palace considerable but the duke stayed huffy
a good while till by and by the king says

Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this hyer raft
Bilgewater and so whats the use o your bein sour  It ll only make
things oncomfortable  It aint my fault I warnt born a duke it aint
your fault you warnt born a kingso whats the use to worry  Make the
best o things the way you find em says Ithats my motto  This aint
no bad thing that weve struck hereplenty grub and an easy lifecome
give us your hand duke and les all be friends

The duke done it and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it  It took away
all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it because it
would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft
for what you want above all things on a raft is for everybody to be
satisfied and feel right and kind towards the others

It didnt take me long to make up my mind that these liars warnt no
kings nor dukes at all but just lowdown humbugs and frauds  But I
never said nothing never let on kept it to myself its the best way
then you dont have no quarrels and dont get into no trouble  If they
wanted us to call them kings and dukes I hadnt no objections long as
it would keep peace in the family and it warnt no use to tell Jim so I
didnt tell him  If I never learnt nothing else out of pap I learnt
that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them
have their own way




CHAPTER XX

THEY asked us considerable many questions wanted to know what we covered
up the raft that way for and laid by in the daytime instead of running
was Jim a runaway nigger  Says I

Goodness sakes would a runaway nigger run SOUTH

No they allowed he wouldnt  I had to account for things some way so I
says

My folks was living in Pike County in Missouri where I was born and
they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike  Pa he lowed hed
break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben whos got a little
onehorse place on the river fortyfour mile below Orleans  Pa was
pretty poor and had some debts so when hed squared up there warnt
nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger Jim  That warnt enough
to take us fourteen hundred mile deck passage nor no other way  Well
when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day he ketched this
piece of a raft so we reckoned wed go down to Orleans on it  Pas luck
didnt hold out a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one
night and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel Jim and me
come up all right but pa was drunk and Ike was only four years old so
they never come up no more  Well for the next day or two we had
considerable trouble because people was always coming out in skiffs and
trying to take Jim away from me saying they believed he was a runaway
nigger  We dont run daytimes no more now nights they dont bother us

The duke says

Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we
want to  Ill think the thing overIll invent a plan thatll fix it
Well let it alone for today because of course we dont want to go by
that town yonder in daylightit mightnt be healthy

Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain the heat
lightning was squirting around low down in the sky and the leaves was
beginning to shiverit was going to be pretty ugly it was easy to see
that  So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam to see
what the beds was like  My bed was a straw tick better than Jims which
was a cornshuck tick theres always cobs around about in a shuck tick
and they poke into you and hurt and when you roll over the dry shucks
sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves it makes such a
rustling that you wake up  Well the duke allowed he would take my bed
but the king allowed he wouldnt  He says

I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that
a cornshuck bed warnt just fitten for me to sleep on  Your Grace ll
take the shuck bed yourself

Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute being afraid there was
going to be some more trouble amongst them so we was pretty glad when
the duke says

Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of
oppression  Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit I yield I
submit tis my fate  I am alone in the worldlet me suffer can bear
it

We got away as soon as it was good and dark  The king told us to stand
well out towards the middle of the river and not show a light till we
got a long ways below the town  We come in sight of the little bunch of
lights by and bythat was the town you knowand slid by about a half
a mile out all right  When we was threequarters of a mile below we
hoisted up our signal lantern and about ten oclock it come on to rain
and blow and thunder and lighten like everything so the king told us to
both stay on watch till the weather got better then him and the duke
crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night  It was my watch
below till twelve but I wouldnt a turned in anyway if Id had a bed
because a body dont see such a storm as that every day in the week not
by a long sight  My souls how the wind did scream along  And every
second or two thered come a glare that lit up the whitecaps for a half
a mile around and youd see the islands looking dusty through the rain
and the trees thrashing around in the wind then comes a HWHACKbum
bum bumbleumbleumbumbumbumbumand the thunder would go rumbling
and grumbling away and quitand then RIP comes another flash and
another sockdolager  The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes
but I hadnt any clothes on and didnt mind  We didnt have no trouble
about snags the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant
that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or
that and miss them

I had the middle watch you know but I was pretty sleepy by that time
so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me he was always
mighty good that way Jim was  I crawled into the wigwam but the king
and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warnt no show for
me so I laid outsideI didnt mind the rain because it was warm and
the waves warnt running so high now  About two they come up again
though and Jim was going to call me but he changed his mind because he
reckoned they warnt high enough yet to do any harm but he was mistaken
about that for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper
and washed me overboard  It most killed Jim alaughing  He was the
easiest nigger to laugh that ever was anyway

I took the watch and Jim he laid down and snored away and by and by the
storm let up for good and all and the first cabinlight that showed I
rousted him out and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day

The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast and him and
the duke played sevenup a while five cents a game  Then they got tired
of it and allowed they would lay out a campaign as they called it
The duke went down into his carpetbag and fetched up a lot of little
printed bills and read them out loud  One bill said The celebrated Dr
Armand de Montalban of Paris would lecture on the Science of
Phrenology at such and such a place on the blank day of blank at ten
cents admission and furnish charts of character at twentyfive cents
apiece  The duke said that was HIM  In another bill he was the
worldrenowned Shakespearian tragedian Garrick the Younger of Drury
Lane London  In other bills he had a lot of other names and done other
wonderful things like finding water and gold with a diviningrod
dissipating witch spells and so on  By and by he says

But the histrionic muse is the darling  Have you ever trod the boards
Royalty

No says the king

You shall then before youre three days older Fallen Grandeur says
the duke  The first good town we come to well hire a hall and do the
sword fight in Richard III and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet
How does that strike you

Im in up to the hub for anything that will pay Bilgewater but you
see I dont know nothing about playactin and haint ever seen much of
it  I was too small when pap used to have em at the palace  Do you
reckon you can learn me

Easy

All right  Im jist afreezn for something fresh anyway  Les
commence right away

So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was and
said he was used to being Romeo so the king could be Juliet

But if Juliets such a young gal duke my peeled head and my white
whiskers is goin to look oncommon odd on her maybe

No dont you worry these country jakes wont ever think of that
Besides you know youll be in costume and that makes all the
difference in the world Juliets in a balcony enjoying the moonlight
before she goes to bed and shes got on her nightgown and her ruffled
nightcap  Here are the costumes for the parts

He got out two or three curtaincalico suits which he said was meedyevil
armor for Richard III and tother chap and a long white cotton
nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match  The king was satisfied so
the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid
spreadeagle way prancing around and acting at the same time to show
how it had got to be done then he give the book to the king and told him
to get his part by heart

There was a little onehorse town about three mile down the bend and
after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run
in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim so he allowed he would
go down to the town and fix that thing  The king allowed he would go
too and see if he couldnt strike something  We was out of coffee so
Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some

When we got there there warnt nobody stirring streets empty and
perfectly dead and still like Sunday  We found a sick nigger sunning
himself in a back yard and he said everybody that warnt too young or
too sick or too old was gone to campmeeting about two mile back in the
woods  The king got the directions and allowed hed go and work that
campmeeting for all it was worth and I might go too

The duke said what he was after was a printingoffice  We found it a
little bit of a concern up over a carpenter shopcarpenters and
printers all gone to the meeting and no doors locked  It was a dirty
litteredup place and had ink marks and handbills with pictures of
horses and runaway niggers on them all over the walls  The duke shed
his coat and said he was all right now  So me and the king lit out for
the campmeeting

We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping for it was a most
awful hot day  There was as much as a thousand people there from twenty
mile around  The woods was full of teams and wagons hitched
everywheres feeding out of the wagontroughs and stomping to keep off
the flies  There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with
branches where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell and piles of
watermelons and green corn and suchlike truck

The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds only they was
bigger and held crowds of people  The benches was made out of outside
slabs of logs with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into
for legs They didnt have no backs  The preachers had high platforms to
stand on at one end of the sheds  The women had on sunbonnets and some
had linseywoolsey frocks some gingham ones and a few of the young ones
had on calico  Some of the young men was barefooted and some of the
children didnt have on any clothes but just a towlinen shirt  Some of
the old women was knitting and some of the young folks was courting on
the sly

The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn  He lined
out two lines everybody sung it and it was kind of grand to hear it
there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way then he
lined out two more for them to singand so on  The people woke up more
and more and sung louder and louder and towards the end some begun to
groan and some begun to shout  Then the preacher begun to preach and
begun in earnest too and went weaving first to one side of the platform
and then the other and then aleaning down over the front of it with
his arms and his body going all the time and shouting his words out with
all his might and every now and then he would hold up his Bible and
spread it open and kind of pass it around this way and that shouting
Its the brazen serpent in the wilderness  Look upon it and live  And
people would shout out GloryAaMEN  And so he went on and the
people groaning and crying and saying amen

Oh come to the mourners bench come black with sin AMEN come
sick and sore AMEN come lame and halt and blind AMEN come pore
and needy sunk in shame AAMEN come all thats worn and soiled and
sufferingcome with a broken spirit come with a contrite heart come
in your rags and sin and dirt the waters that cleanse is free the door
of heaven stands openoh enter in and be at rest AAMEN  GLORY
GLORY HALLELUJAH

And so on  You couldnt make out what the preacher said any more on
account of the shouting and crying  Folks got up everywheres in the
crowd and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners bench
with the tears running down their faces and when all the mourners had
got up there to the front benches in a crowd they sung and shouted and
flung themselves down on the straw just crazy and wild

Well the first I knowed the king got agoing and you could hear him
over everybody and next he went acharging up on to the platform and
the preacher he begged him to speak to the people and he done it  He
told them he was a piratebeen a pirate for thirty years out in the
Indian Oceanand his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in
a fight and he was home now to take out some fresh men and thanks to
goodness hed been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat
without a cent and he was glad of it it was the blessedest thing that
ever happened to him because he was a changed man now and happy for the
first time in his life and poor as he was he was going to start right
off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean and put in the rest of his
life trying to turn the pirates into the true path for he could do it
better than anybody else being acquainted with all pirate crews in that
ocean and though it would take him a long time to get there without
money he would get there anyway and every time he convinced a pirate he
would say to him Dont you thank me dont you give me no credit it
all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville campmeeting natural
brothers and benefactors of the race and that dear preacher there the
truest friend a pirate ever had

And then he busted into tears and so did everybody  Then somebody sings
out Take up a collection for him take up a collection  Well a half
a dozen made a jump to do it but somebody sings out Let HIM pass the
hat around  Then everybody said it the preacher too

So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes
and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so
good to the poor pirates away off there and every little while the
prettiest kind of girls with the tears running down their cheeks would
up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by and he
always done it and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or
six timesand he was invited to stay a week and everybody wanted him to
live in their houses and said theyd think it was an honor but he said
as this was the last day of the campmeeting he couldnt do no good and
besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to
work on the pirates

When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had
collected eightyseven dollars and seventyfive cents  And then he had
fetched away a threegallon jug of whisky too that he found under a
wagon when he was starting home through the woods  The king said take
it all around it laid over any day hed ever put in in the missionarying
line  He said it warnt no use talking heathens dont amount to shucks
alongside of pirates to work a campmeeting with

The duke was thinking HED been doing pretty well till the king come to
show up but after that he didnt think so so much  He had set up and
printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printingofficehorse
billsand took the money four dollars  And he had got in ten
dollars worth of advertisements for the paper which he said he would
put in for four dollars if they would pay in advanceso they done it
The price of the paper was two dollars a year but he took in three
subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in
advance they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual but he
said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as
he could afford it and was going to run it for cash  He set up a little
piece of poetry which he made himself out of his own headthree
verseskind of sweet and saddishthe name of it was Yes crush cold
world this breaking heartand he left that all set up and ready to
print in the paper and didnt charge nothing for it  Well he took in
nine dollars and a half and said hed done a pretty square days work
for it

Then he showed us another little job hed printed and hadnt charged for
because it was for us  It had a picture of a runaway nigger with a
bundle on a stick over his shoulder and  reward under it  The
reading was all about Jim and just described him to a dot  It said he
run away from St Jacques plantation forty mile below New Orleans last
winter and likely went north and whoever would catch him and send him
back he could have the reward and expenses

Now says the duke after tonight we can run in the daytime if we
want to  Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot
with a rope and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we
captured him up the river and were too poor to travel on a steamboat so
we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to
get the reward  Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim but
it wouldnt go well with the story of us being so poor  Too much like
jewelry  Ropes are the correct thingwe must preserve the unities as
we say on the boards

We all said the duke was pretty smart and there couldnt be no trouble
about running daytimes  We judged we could make miles enough that night
to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the dukes work in the
printing office was going to make in that little town then we could boom
right along if we wanted to

We laid low and kept still and never shoved out till nearly ten oclock
then we slid by pretty wide away from the town and didnt hoist our
lantern till we was clear out of sight of it

When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning he says

Huck does you reckn we gwyne to run acrost any mo kings on dis trip

No I says I reckon not

Well says he dats all right den  I doan mine one er two kings
but dats enough  Dis ones powerful drunk en de duke ain much
better

I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French so he could hear
what it was like but he said he had been in this country so long and
had so much trouble hed forgot it
