AMPHITRYON

OR

THE TWO SOSIAS

A COMEDY

    Egregiam ver laudem et spolia ampla refertis
    Una dolo Divm si fmina victa duorum est      VIRG




AMPHITRYON


Plautus the venerable father of Roman comedy who flourished during
the second Punic war left us a play on the subject of Amphitryon
which has had the honour to be deemed worthy of imitation by Moliere
and Dryden It cannot be expected that the plain blunt and
inartificial stile of so rude an age should bear any comparison with
that of authors who enjoyed the highest advantages of the polished
times to which they were an ornament But the merit of having devised
and embodied most of the comic distresses which have excited laughter
throughout so many ages is to be attributed to the ancient bard
upon whose original conception of the plot his successors have made
few and inconsiderable improvements It is true that instead of a
formal Prologus who stepped forth in the character of Mercury
and gravely detailed to the audience the plot of the play Moliere
and Dryden have introduced it in the modern more artificial method
by the dialogue of the actors in the first scene It is true also
that with great contempt of one of the unities afterwards deemed so
indispensible by the ancients Plautus introduces the birth of Hercules
into a play founded upon the intrigue which occasioned that event
Yet with all these disadvantages and that of the rude flatness of
his dialogueresting frequently for wit upon the most miserable
punsthe comic device of the two Sosias the errors into which
the malice of Mercury plunges his unlucky original the quarrel of
Alcmena with her real husband and her reconciliation with Jupiter
in his stead the final confronting of the two Amphitryos and the
astonishment of the unfortunate general at finding every proof of his
identity exhibited by his rivalare all however rudely sketched
the inventions of the Roman poet In one respect it would seem that
the jeu de theatre necessary to render the piece probable upon
the stage was better managed in the time of Plautus than in that of
Dryden and Moliere Upon a modern stage it is evidently difficult to
introduce two pair of characters so extremely alike as to make it at
all probable or even possible that the mistakes depending upon their
extreme resemblance could take place But favoured by the masks and
costume of the ancient theatre Plautus contrived to render Jupiter and
Mercury so exactly like Amphitryon and Sosia that they were obliged
to retain certain marks supposed to be invisible to the other persons
of the drama by which the audience themselves might be enabled to
distinguish the gods from the mortals whose forms they had assumed

The modern poets have treated the subject which they had from Plautus
each according to the fashion of his country and so far did the
correctness of the French stage exceed ours at that period that the
palm of the comic writing must be at once awarded to Moliere For
though Dryden had the advantage of the French authors labours from
which and from Plautus he has translated liberally the wretched
taste of the age has induced him to lard the piece with gratuitous
indelicacy He is in general coarse and vulgar where Moliere is
witty and where the Frenchman ventures upon a double meaning the
Englishman always contrives to make it a single one Yet although
inferior to Moliere and accommodated to the gross taste of the
seventeenth century Amphitryon is one of the happiest effusions
of Drydens comic muse He has enriched the plot by the intrigue of
Mercury and Phdra and the petulant interested Queen of Gipsies as
her lover terms her is no bad paramour for the God of Thieves

In the scenes of a higher cast Dryden far outstrips both the
French and Roman poet The sensation to be expressed is not that of
sentimental affection which the good father of Olympus was not capable
of feeling but love of that grosser and subordinate kind which
prompted Jupiter in his intrigues has been by none of the ancient
poets expressed in more beautiful verse than that in which Dryden has
clothed it in the scenes between Jupiter and Alcmena Even Milbourne
who afterwards attacked our author with such malignant asperity was
so sensible of the merit of Amphitryon that he addressed to the
publisher the following letter and copy of verses which Mr Malones
industry recovered from among Mr Tonsons papers

    MR TONSON Yarmouth Novemb 

Youl wonder perhaps at this from a stranger but ye reason of it
may perhaps abate somewhat of ye miracle and its this On Thursday
the twentyth instant I receivd Mr Drydens AMPHYTRIO I leave out
the Greeke termination as not so proper in my opinion in English
But to passe that I liked the play and read it over with as much of
criticisme and ill nature as ye time being about one in ye morning
and in bed would permit Going to sleep very well pleasd I could
not leave my bed in ye morning without this sacrifice to the authours
genius it was too sudden to be correct but it was very honestly
meant and is submitted to yours and Mr Ds disposall

      Hail Prince of Witts thy fumbling Age is past
    Thy youth and witt and arts renewed at last
    So on some rock the Joviall bird assays
    Her oregrown beake that marke of age to rayse
    That done through yielding air she cutts her way
    And strongly stoops againe and breaks the trembling prey
    What though prodigious thunder strippd thy brows
    Of envyd bays and the dull world allows
    Shadwell should wear themweell applaud the change
    Where nations feel it who can think it strange
    So have I seen the longeard brute aspire
    To drest commode with every smallest wire
    With nightrail hung on shoulders gravely stalke
    Like bawd attendant on Aurelias walke
    Hangt give the fop ingratefull world its will
    He wears the laurelthou deservst it still
    Still smooth as when adornd with youthful pride
    For thy dear sake the blushing virgins dyed
    When the kind gods of witt and love combined
    And with large gifts thy yielding soul refined
      Not Phbus could with gentler words pursue
    His flying Daphne not the morning dew
    Falls softer than the words of amorous Jove
    When melting dying for Alcmenes love
      Yet briske and airy too thou fillst the stage
    Unbroke by fortune undecayed by age
    French wordy witt by thine was long surpast
    Now Romes thy captive and by thee wee taste
    Of their rich dayntyes but so finely drest
    Theirs was a country meal thine a triumphant feast
      If this to thy necessityes wee ow
    O may they greater still and greater grow
    Nor blame the wish Plautus could write in chaines
    Weell blesse thy wants while wee enjoy thy pains
    Wealth makes the poet lazy nor can fame
    That gay attendant of a spritely flame
    A Dorset or a Wycherly invite
    Because they feel no pinching wants to write
      Go on endenizon the Romane slave
    Let an eternal spring adorne his grave
    His ghost would gladly all his fame submitt
    To thy strong judgment and thy piercing witt
    Purged by thy hand he speaks immortall sense
    And pleases all with modish excellence
    Nor would we have thee live on empty praise
    The while for though we cannt restore the bays
    While thou writst thusto pay thy merites due
    Weell give the claret and the pension too

Milbourne concludes by desiring to be supplied with such of our
authors writings as he had not already to be sent to Yarmouth in
Norfolk where he probably had then a living

Amphitryon was produced in the same year with Don Sebastian and
although it cannot be called altogether an original performance yet it
contains so much original writing as to shew that our authors vein
of poetry was in his advanced age distinguished by the same rapid
fluency as when he first began to write for the stage

This comedy was acted and printed in  It was very favourably
received and continued long to be what is called a stockplay

TO

THE HONOURABLE

SIR WILLIAM LEVESON GOWER

BARONET


There is one kind of virtue which is inborn in the nobility and indeed
in most of the ancient families of this nation they are not apt to
insult on the misfortunes of their countrymen But you sir I may
tell it without flattery have grafted on this natural commiseration
and raised it to a nobler virtue As you have been pleased to honour
me for a long time with some part of your esteem and your good
will so in particular since the late Revolution you have increased
the proofs of your kindness to me and not suffered the difference of
opinions which produce such hatred and enmity in the brutal part of
human kind to remove you from the settled basis of your good nature
and good sense This nobleness of yours had it been exercised on an
enemy had certainly been a point of honour and as such I might have
justly recommended it to the world but that of constancy to your
former choice and the pursuance of your first favours are virtues
not overcommon amongst Englishmen All things of honour have at
best somewhat of ostentation in them and selflove there is a pride
of doing more than is expected from us and more than others would
have done But to proceed in the same track of goodness favour and
protection is to shew that a man is acted by a thorough principle it
carries somewhat of tenderness in it which is humanity in a heroical
degree it is a kind of unmoveable goodnature a word which is
commonly despised because it is so seldom practised But after all
it is the most generous virtue opposed to the most degenerate vice
which is that of ruggedness and harshness to our fellowcreatures

It is upon this knowledge of you sir that I have chosen you with
your permission to be the patron of this poem And as since this
wonderful Revolution I have begun with the best pattern of humanity
the Earl of Leicester I shall continue to follow the same method in
all to whom I shall address and endeavour to pitch on such only as
have been pleased to own me in this ruin of my small fortune who
though they are of a contrary opinion themselves yet blame not me for
adhering to a lost cause and judging for myself what I cannot chuse
but judge so long as I am a patient sufferer and no disturber of the
government Which if it be a severe penance as a great wit has told
the world it is at least enjoined me by myself and Sancho Pana as
much fool as I was observed to discipline his body no farther than he
found he could endure the smart

You see sir I am not entertaining you like Ovid with a lamentable
epistle from Pontus I suffer no more than I can easily undergo and so
long as I enjoy my liberty which is the birthright of an Englishman
the rest shall never go near my heart The merry philosopher is more to
my humour than the melancholic and I find no disposition in myself to
cry while the mad world is daily supplying me with such occasions of
laughter The more reasonable sort of my countrymen have shewn so much
favour to this piece that they give me no doubt of their protection
for the future

As you sir have been pleased to follow the example of their goodness
in favouring me so give me leave to say that I follow yours in this
dedication to a person of a different persuasion Though I must confess
withal that I have had a former encouragement from you for this
address and the warm remembrance of your noble hospitality to me at
Trentham when some years ago I visited my friends and relations
in your country has ever since given me a violent temptation to this
boldness

It is true were this comedy wholly mine I should call it a trifle
and perhaps not think it worth your patronage but when the names of
Plautus and Moliere are joined in it that is the two greatest names
of ancient and modern comedy I must not presume so far on their
reputation to think their best and most unquestioned productions can
be termed little I will not give you the trouble of acquainting you
what I have added or altered in either of them so much it may be
for the worse but only that the difference of our stage from the
Roman and the French did so require it But I am afraid for my own
interest the world will too easily discover that more than half of
it is mine and that the rest is rather a lame imitation of their
excellencies than a just translation It is enough that the reader
know by you that I neither deserve nor desire any applause from it
if I have performed any thing it is the genius of my authors that
inspired me and if it pleased in representation let the actors share
the praise amongst themselves As for Plautus and Moliere they are
dangerous people and I am too weak a gamester to put myself into their
form of play But what has been wanting on my part has been abundantly
supplied by the excellent composition of Mr Purcell in whose person
we have at length found an Englishman equal with the best abroad At
least my opinion of him has been such since his happy and judicious
performances in the late opera and the experience I have had of
him in the setting my three songs for this Amphitryon to all
which and particularly to the composition of the pastoral dialogue
the numerous choir of fair ladies gave so just an applause on the
third day I am only sorry for my own sake that there was one star
wanting as beautiful as any in our hemisphere that young Berenice
who is misemploying all her charms on stupid country souls that can
never know the value of them and losing the triumphs which are ready
prepared for her in the court and town And yet I know not whether I
am so much a loser by her absence for I have reason to apprehend the
sharpness of her judgment if it were not allayed with the sweetness of
her nature and after all I fear she may come time enough to discover
a thousand imperfections in my play which might have passed on vulgar
understandings Be pleased to use the authority of a father over her
on my behalf enjoin her to keep her own thoughts of Amphitryon to
herself or at least not to compare him too strictly with Molieres It
is true I have an interest in this partiality of hers but withal I
plead some sort of merit for it in being so particularly as I am

    SIR

    Your most obedient

    Humble servant

FOOTNOTES

Footnote  This gentleman united in his person the ancient families
of Gower and Leveson He was second son of Sir Thomas Gower bart
and succeeded to the title and estate by the death of his nephew Sir
Edward Gower in the year before He was a keen whig and distinguished
himself both by his attachment to Monmouth and his zeal for the
Revolution but his alliance with Lawrence Earl of Rochester whose
eldest son Lord Hyde had married his daughter might smooth our
poets access to his favour since Rochester is distinguished as his
constant patron Dryden also refers to former passages of intimacy
between him and Sir William Above all we are to suppose that in
admiration of our authors poetical talents Sir William Gower was
capable of drowning every unfavourable recollection of his political
tenets Sir William Leveson Gower is ancestor of the present Marquis of
Stafford

Footnote  A noble seat in Staffordshire inhabited by Sir William
Gower from the Levesons his maternal ancestors

Footnote  Betterton having recovered the dislike to operas which
the failure of Albion and Albanius occasioned had brought out the
Prophetess of Beaumont and Fletcher shortened and altered into a
musical piece which was set by the famous Purcell Dr Burney has
sanctioned the compliment which Dryden bestows upon it There is
something in our authors turn of expression which may lead us to
infer that he was but a recent convert to the English school of music
Sir John Hawkins seems to be mistaken in placing this opera posterior
to that of Prince Arthur The dances were invented by the celebrated
Priest

the dedication to Cleomenes celebrates Jane Lady Hyde daughter to
Sir William L Gower and wife as has been noticed to Henry Lord

PROLOGUE

SPOKEN BY MRS BRACEGIRDLE


    The labouring bee when his sharp sting is gone
    Forgets his golden work and turns a drone
    Such is a satire when you take away
    That rage in which his noble vigour lay
    What gain you by not suffering him to teaze ye
    He neither can offend you now nor please ye
    The honeybag and venom lay so near            
    That both together you resolved to tear          
    And lost your pleasure to secure your fear      
    How can he show his manhood if you bind him
    To box like boys with one hand tied behind him
    This is plain levelling of wit in which
    The poor has all the advantage not the rich
    The blockhead stands excused for wanting sense
    And wits turn blockheads in their own defence
    Yet though the stages traffic is undone
    Still Julians interloping trade goes on
    Though satire on the theatre you smother
    Yet in lampoons you libel one another
    The first produces still a second jig
    You whip them out like schoolboys till they gig
    And with the same success our readers guess
    For every one still dwindles to a less
    And much good malice is so meanly drest
    That we would laugh but cannot find the jest
    If no advice your rhyming rage can stay
    Let not the ladies suffer in the fray
    Their tender sex is privileged from war
    Tis not like knights to draw upon the fair
    What fame expect you from so mean a prize
    We wear no murdering weapons but our eyes
    Our sex you know was after yours designed                      
    The last perfection of the Makers mind                          
    Heaven drew out all the gold for us and left your dross behind  
    Beauty for valours best reward he chose
    Peace after war and after toil repose
    Hence ye profane excluded from our sights        
    And charmed by day with honours vain delights    
    Go make your best of solitary nights              
    Recant betimes tis prudence to submit
    Our sex is still your overmatch in wit
    We never fail with new successful arts
    To make fine fools of you and all your parts

FOOTNOTES

a dirty livelihood by copying and dispersing lampoons at the Wits
coffeehouse He was the subject of a copy of verses which the reader
will find among those ascribed to Dryden on doubtful authority

active that the most deplorable attempt at wit or satire was
usually answered in one which was yet worse Parody and personal abuse
were the implements of this warfare which sometimes extended to

AMPHITRYON

OR THE

TWO SOSIAS




ACT I SCENE I


MERCURY and PHBUS descend in two Machines

    Phoe Know you the reason of this present summons
    Tis neither council day nor is this heaven
    What business has our Jupiter on earth
    Why more at Thebes than any other place
    And why we two of all the herd of gods
    Are chosen out to meet him in consult
    They call me God of Wisdom
    But Mars and Vulcan the two fools of heaven
    Whose wit lies in their anvil and their sword
    Know full as much as I

    Merc And Venus may know more than both of us
    For tis some petticoat affair I guess

I have discharged my duty which was to summon you Phbus we shall
know more anon when the Thunderer comes down Tis our part to obey
our father for to confess the truth we two are little better than
sons of harlots and if Jupiter had not been pleased to take a little
pains with our mothers instead of being gods we might have been a
couple of linkboys

Phoe But know you nothing farther Hermes What news in court

Merc There has been a devilish quarrel I can tell you between
Jupiter and Juno She threatened to sue him in the spiritual court for
some matrimonial omissions and he stood upon his prerogative then she
hit him in the teeth of all his bastards and your name and mine were
used with less reverence than became our godships They were both in
their cups and at last the matter grew so high that they were ready
to have thrown stars at one anothers heads

Phoe Twas happy for me that I was at my vocation driving daylight
about the world But I had rather stand my fathers thunderbolts than
my stepmothers railing

Merc When the tonguebattle was over and the championess had
harnessed her peacocks to go for Samos and hear the prayers that were
made to her

Phoe By the way her worshippers had a bad time ont she was in a
damnable humour for receiving petitions

Merc Jupiter immediately beckons me aside and charges me that
as soon as ever you had set up your horses you and I should meet him
here at Thebes Now putting the premises together as dark as it is
methinks I begin to see daylight

Phoe As plain as one of my own beams she has made him uneasy at
home and he is going to seek his diversion abroad I see heaven
itself is no privileged place for happiness if a man must carry his
wife along with him

Merc Tis neither better nor worse upon my conscience He is weary
of hunting in the spacious forest of a wife and is following his game
incognito in some little purlieu here at Thebes thats many an
honest mans case on earth too Jove help them as indeed he does to
make them cuckolds

Phoe But if so Mercury then I who am a poet must indite his
loveletter and you who are by trade a porter must convey it

Merc No more hes coming down souse upon us and hears as far as he
can see too Hes plaguy hot upon the business I know it by his hard
driving

JUPITER descends

    Jup What you are descanting upon my actions
    Much good may do you with your politics
    All subjects will be censuring their kings
    Well I confess I am in love what then

    Phoe Some mortal we presume of Cadmus blood
    Some Theban beauty some new Semele
    Or some Europa

Merc Ill say that for my father hes constant to a handsome
family he knows when they have a good smack with them and snuffs up
incense so savourily when tis offered by a fair hand

    Jup Well my familiar sons this saucy carriage
    I have deserved for he who trusts a secret
    Makes his own man his master
    I read your thoughts
    Therefore you may as safely speak as think

Merc Mine was a very homely thoughtI was considering into what
form your almightyship would be pleased to transform yourself tonight
whether you would fornicate in the shape of a bull or a ram or an
eagle or a swan what bird or beast you would please to honour by
transgressing your own laws in his likeness or in short whether you
would recreate yourself in feathers or in leather

    Phoe Any disguise to hide the king of gods

    Jup I know your malice Phbus you would say
    That when a monarch sins it should be secret
    To keep exterior shew of sanctity
    Maintain respect and cover bad example
    For kings and priests are in a manner bound
    For reverence sake to be close hypocrites

    Phoe But what necessitates you to this love
    Which you confess a crime and yet commit
    For to be secret makes not sin the less
    Tis only hidden from the vulgar view
    Maintains indeed the reverence due to princes
    But not absolves the conscience from the crime

    Jup I love because twas in the fates I should

    Phoe With reverence be it spoke a bad excuse
    Thus every wicked act in heaven or earth
    May make the same defence But what is fate
    Is it a blind contingence of events
    Or sure necessity of causes linked
    That must produce effects Or ist a power
    That orders all things by superior will
    Foresees his work and works in that foresight

    Jup Fate is what I
    By virtue of omnipotence have made it
    And power omnipotent can do no wrong
    Not to myself because I will it so
    Nor yet to men for what they are is mine
    This night I will enjoy Amphitryons wife
    For when I made her I decreed her such
    As I should please to love I wrong not him
    Whose wife she is for I reserved my right
    To have her while she pleased me that once past
    She shall be his again

Merc Heres omnipotence with a vengeance to make a man a cuckold
and yet not to do him wrong Then I find father Jupiter that when you
made fate you had the wit to contrive a holiday for yourself now and
then for you kings never enact a law but you have a kind of an eye to
your own prerogative

    Phoe If there be no such thing as right and wrong
    Of an eternal being I have done
    But if there be

    Jup Peace thou disputing fool
    Learn this If thou couldst comprehend my ways
    Then thou wert Jove not I yet thus far know
    That for the good of human kind this night
    I shall beget a future Hercules
    Who shall redress the wrongs of injured mortals
    Shall conquer monsters and reform the world

Merc Ay brother Phbus and our father made all those monsters for
Hercules to conquer and contrived all those vices on purpose for him
to reform too theres the jest ont

    Phoe Since arbitrary power will hear no reason
    Tis wisdom to be silent

Merc Why thats the point this same arbitrary power is a knockdown
argument tis but a word and a blow Now methinks our father speaks
out like an honest barefaced god as he is he lays the stress in the
right place upon absolute dominion I confess if he had been a man
he might have been a tyrant if his subjects durst have called him to
account But you brother Phbus are but a mere country gentleman
that never comes to court that are abroad all day on horseback making
visits about the world are drinking all night and in your cups
are still railing at the government O these patriots these bumpkin
patriots are a very silly sort of animal

    Jup My present purpose and design you heard
    To enjoy Amphitryons wife the fair Alcmena
    You two must be subservient to my love

Merc To Phbus No more of your grumbletonian morals brother
theres preferment coming be advised and pimp dutifully

    Jup Amphitryon the brave Theban general
    Has overcome his countrys foes in fight
    And in a single duel slain their king
    His conquering troops are eager on their march
    Returning home while their young general
    More eager to review his beauteous wife
    Posts on before winged with impetuous love
    And by tomorrows dawn will reach this town

Merc Thats but short warning father Jupiter having made no former
advances of courtship to her you have need of your omnipotence and
all your godship if you mean to be beforehand with him

    Phoe Then how are we to be employed this evening
    Times precious and these summer nights are short
    I must be early up to light the world

    Jup You shall not rise there shall be no tomorrow

    Merc Then the worlds to be at an end I find

    Phoe Or else a gap in nature of a day

    Jup A day will be well lost to busy man
    Night shall continue sleep and care shall cease
    So many men shall live and live in peace
    Whom sunshine had betrayed to envious sight
    And sight to sudden rage and rage to death
    Now I will have a night for love and me
    A long luxurious night fit for a god
    To quench and empty his immortal heat

Merc Ill lay on the womans side for all that that she shall love
longest tonight in spite of your omnipotence

    Phoe I shall be cursed by all the labouring trades
    That early rise but you must be obeyed

    Jup No matter for the cheating part of man
    They have a days sin less to answer for

    Phoe When would you have me wake

    Jup Why when Jove goes to sleep when I have finished
    Your brother Mercury shall bring you word
                               Exit PHBUS in his chariot
    Now Hermes I must take Amphitryons form
    To enjoy his wife
    Thou must be Sosia this Amphitryons slave
    Who all this night is travelling to Thebes
    To tell Alcmena of her lords approach
    And bring her joyful news of victory

    Merc But why must I be Sosia

    Jup Dull god of wit thou statue of thyself
    Thou must be Sosia to keep out Sosia
    Who by his entrance might discover Jove
    Disturb my pleasures raise unruly noise
    And so distract Alcmenas tender soul
    She would not meet my warmth when I dissolve
    Into her lap nor give down half her love

    Merc Let me alone Ill cudgel him away
    But I abhor so villainous a shape

    Jup Take it I charge thee on thy duty take it
    Nor dare to lay it down till I command
    I cannot bear a moments loss of joy

    NIGHT appears above in a chariot

    Look up the Night is in her silent chariot
    And rolling just oer Thebes Bid her drive slowly
    Or make a double turn about the world
    While I drop Jove and take Amphitryons dress
    To be the greater while I seem the less   Exit JUPITER

Merc To Night Madam Night a good even to you Fair and softly I
beseech you madam I have a word or two to you from no less a god than
Jupiter

Night O my nimblefingered god of theft what makes you here on
earth at this unseasonable hour What bankers shop is to be broke open
tonight or what clippers and coiners and conspirators have been
invoking your deity for their assistance

Merc Faith none of those enormities and yet I am still in my
vocation for you know I am a jack of all trades At a word Jupiter is
indulging his genius tonight with a certain noble sort of recreation
called wenching the truth ont is adultery is its proper name

Night Jupiter would do well to stick to his wife Juno

Merc He has been married to her above these hundred years and
thats long enough in conscience to stick to one woman

Night Shes his sister too as well as his wife thats a double tie
of affection to her

Merc Nay if he made bold with his own flesh and blood tis likely
he will not spare his neighbours

Night If I were his wife I would raise a rebellion against him for
the violation of my bed

Merc Thou art mistaken old Night his wife could raise no faction
All the deities in heaven would take the part of the cuckoldmaking
god for they are all given to the flesh most damnably Nay the very
goddesses would stickle in the cause of love tis the way to be
popular to whore and love For what dost thou think old Saturn was
deposed but that he was cold and impotent and made no court to the
fair ladies Pallas and Juno themselves as chaste as they are cried
Shame on himI say unto thee old Night woe be to the monarch that
has not the women on his side

Night Then by your rule Mercury a king who would live happily
must debauch his whole nation of women

Merc As far as his ready money will go I mean for Jupiter himself
cant please all of themBut this is beside my present commission He
has sent me to will and require you to make a swinging long night for
him for he hates to be stinted in his pleasures

Night Tell him plainly Ill rather lay down my commission What
would he make a bawd of me

Merc Poor ignorant why he meant thee for a bawd when he first
made thee What art thou good for but to be a bawd Is not daylight
better for mankind I mean as to any other use but only for love and
fornication Thou hast been a bawd too a reverend primitive original
bawd from the first hour of thy creation and all the laudable actions
of love have been committed under thy mantle Prythee for what dost
thou think that thou art worshipped

Night Why for my stars and moonshine

Merc That is for holding a candle to iniquity But if they were put
out thou wouldst be doubly worshipped by the willing bashful virgins

Night Then for my quiet and the sweetness of my sleep

Merc NoFor thy sweet waking all the night for sleep comes not
upon lovers till thou art vanished

Night But it will be against nature to make a long winters night
at midsummer

Merc Trouble not yourself for that Phbus is ordered to make a
short summers day tomorrow so in fourandtwenty hours all will be
at rights again

Night Well I am edified by your discourse and my comfort is that
whatever work is made I see nothing

Merc About your business then Put a spoke into your chariotwheels
and order the seven stars to halt while I put myself into the habit
of a servingman and dress up a false Sosia to wait upon a false
AmphitryonGood night Night

Night My service to JupiterFarewell Mercury

                           NIGHT goes backward Exit MERCURY


SCENE IIAMPHITRYONS Palace

Enter ALCMENA

    Alc Why was I married to the man I love
    For had he been indifferent to my choice
    Or had been hated absence had been pleasure
    But now I fear for my Amphitryons life
    At home in private and secure from war
    I am amidst an host of armed foes
    Sustaining all his cares pierced with his wounds
    And if he fallswhich O ye gods avert
    Am in Amphitryon slain Would I were there
    And he were here so might we change our fates
    That he might grieve for me and I might die for him

Enter PHDRA running

Phd Good news good news madam O such admirable news that if I
kept it in a moment I should burst with it

Alc Is it from the army

Phd No matter

Alc From Amphitryon

Phd No matter neither

Alc Answer me I charge thee if thy good news be any thing relating
to my lord if it be assure thyself of a reward

Phd Ay madam now you say something to the matter You know the
business of a poor waitingwoman here upon earth is to be scraping up
something against a rainy day called the day of marriage every one in
our own vocationBut what matter is it to me if my lord has routed
the enemy if I get nothing of their spoils

Alc Say is my lord victorious

Phd Why he is victorious indeed I prayed devoutly to Jupiter for
a victory by the same token that you should give me ten pieces of
gold if I brought you news of it

Alc They are thine supposing he be safe too

Phd Nay thats a new bargain for I vowed to Jupiter that then
you should give me ten pieces more but I do undertake for my lords
safety if you will please to discharge his godship Jupiter of the
debt and take it upon you to pay

Alc When he returns in safety Jupiter and I will pay your vow

Phd And I am sure I articled with Jupiter that if I brought you
news that my lord was upon return you should grant me one small favour
more that will cost you nothing

Alc Make haste thou torturer is my Amphitryon upon return

Phd Promise me that I shall be your bedfellow tonight as I have
been ever since my lords absence unless I shall be pleased to release
you of your word

Alc Thats a small request tis granted

Phd But swear by Jupiter

Alc But why by Jupiter

Phd Because hes the greatest I hate to deal with one of your
little baffling gods that can do nothing but by permission but
Jupiter can swinge you off if you swear by him and are forsworn

Alc I swear by Jupiter

Phd ThenI believe he is victorious and I know he is safe for I
looked through the keyhole and saw him knocking at the gate and I
had the conscience to let him cool his heels there

Alc And wouldst thou not open to him Oh thou traitress

Phd No I was a little wiser I left Sosias wife to let him in
for I was resolved to bring the news and make my pennyworths out of
him as time shall show

Enter JUPITER in the shape of AMPHITRYON with SOSIAS wife
BROMIA He kisses and embraces ALCMENA

    Jup O let me live for ever on those lips
    The nectar of the gods to these is tasteless
    I swear that were I Jupiter this night
    I would renounce my heaven to be Amphitryon

    Alc Then not to swear beneath Amphitryons oath
    Forgive me Juno if I am profane
    I swear I would be what I am this night
    And be Alcmena rather than be Juno

Brom Good my lord what is become of my poor bedfellow your man
Sosia you keep such a billing and cooing here to set ones mouth
a wateringwhat I say though I am a poor woman I have a husband
as well as my lady and should be as glad as she of a little honest
recreation

Phd And what have you done with your old friend and my old
sweetheart Judge Gripus has he brought me home a crammed purse that
swells with bribes if he be rich I will make him welcome like an
honourable magistrate but if he has not had the wit to sell justice
he judges no causes in my court I warrant him

    Alc My lord you tell me nothing of the battle
    Is Thebes victorious are our foes destroyed
    For now I find you safe I should be glad
    To hear you were in danger

Jup Aside A man had need be a god to stand the fury of three
talking women I think in my conscience I made their tongues of
thunder

Brom Pulling him on one side I asked the first question answer
me my lord

Phd Pulling him on the other side Peace mine is a lover and
yours but a husband and my judge is my lord too the title shall take
place and I will be answered

    Jup Sosia is safe Gripus is rich both coming
    I rode before them with a lovers haste
    Was eer poor god so worried but for my love
    I wish I were in heaven again with Juno           Aside

    Alc Then I it seems am last to be regarded

    Jup Not so my love but these obstreperous tongues
    Have snatched their answers first they will be heard
    And surely Jove would never answer prayer
    That woman made but only to be freed
    From their eternal noise Make haste to bed
    There let me tell my story in thy arms
    There in the gentle pauses of our love
    Betwixt our dyings ere we live again
    Thou shalt be told the battle and success
    Which I shall oft begin and then break off
    For love will often interrupt my tale
    And make so sweet confusion in our talk
    That thou shalt ask and I shall answer things
    That are not of a piece but patched with kisses
    And sighs and murmurs and imperfect speech
    And nonsense shall be eloquent in love

Brom To PHDHA My lord is very hot upon it this absence is a
great friend to us poor neglected wives it makes us new again

    Alc I am the fool of love and find within me
    The fondness of a bride without the fear
    My whole desires and wishes are in you

Phd Aside My ladys eyes are pinking to bedward too now is
she to look very sleepy counterfeiting yawningbut she shall ask me
leave first

    Alc Great Juno thou whose holy care presides
    Over the nuptial bed pour all thy blessings
    On this auspicious night

    Jup Juno may grudge for she may fear a rival
    In those bright eyes but Jupiter will grant
    And doubly bless this night

    Phd Aside But Jupiter should ask my leave
    first were he here in person

    Alc Bromia prepare the bed
    The tedious journey has disposed my lord
    To seek his needful rest                    Exit BROMIA

Phd Tis very true madam the poor gentleman must needs be
weary and therefore it was not ill contrived that he must lie
alone tonight to recruit himself with sleep and lay in enough for
tomorrow night when you may keep him waking

Alc To JUPITER I must confess I made a kind of promise

Phd Almost crying A kind of promise do you call it I see you
would fain be coming off I am sure you swore to me by Jupiter that
I should be your bedfellow and Ill accuse you to him too the first
prayers I make and Ill pray o purpose too that I will though I
have not prayed to him this seven years

    Jup O the malicious hilding

    Alc I did swear indeed my lord

    Jup Forswear thyself for Jupiter but laughs
    At lovers perjuries

Phd The more shame for him if he does there would be a fine god
indeed for us women to worship if he laughs when our sweethearts
cheat us of our maidenheads No no Jupiter is an honester gentleman
than you make of him

    Jup Im all on fire and would not lose this night
    To be the master of the universe

Phd Ay my lord I see you are on fire but the devil a bucket
shall be brought to quench it without my leave You may go to bed
madam but you shall see how heaven will bless your nights work if
you forswear yourselfSome fool some mere elderbrother or some
blockheadly hero Jove I beseech thee send her

    Jup Aside Now I could call my thunder to revenge me
    But that were to confess myself a god
    And then I lost my loveAlcmena come
    By heaven I have a bridegrooms fervour for thee
    As I had neer enjoyed

    Alc She has my oath                          Sighing
    And sure she may release it if she pleases

Phd Why truly madam I am not cruel in my nature to poor
distressed lovers for it may be my own case another day and
therefore if my lord pleases to consider me

Jup Any thing any thing but name thy wish and have it

Phd Ay now you say any thing any thing but you would tell me
another story tomorrow morning Look you my lord here is a hand
open to receive you know the meaning of it I am for nothing but the
ready

Jup Thou shalt have all the treasury of heaven

Phd Yes when you are Jupiter to dispose of it

Jup Aside I had forgot and shewed myself a god This love can
make a fool of Jupiter

Phd You have forgot some part of the enemies spoil I warrant you
I see a little trifling diamond upon your finger and I am proud enough
to think it would become mine too

    Jup Here take it
                 Taking a Ring off his Finger and giving it
    This is a very woman
    Her sex is avarice and she in one
    Is all her sex

Phd Ay ay tis no matter what you say of us What would you have
your money out of the treasury without paying the officers their fees
Go get you together you naughty couple till you are both weary of
worrying one another and then tomorrow morning I shall have another
fee for parting you

    PHDRA goes out before ALCMENA with a light

    Jup Why now I am indeed the lord of all
    For whats to be a god but to enjoy
    Let human kind their sovereigns leisure wait
    Love is this night my great affair of state
    Let this one night of providence be void
    All Jove for once is on himself employd
    Let unregarded altars smoke in vain
    And let my subjects praise me or complain
    Yet if betwixt my intervals of bliss
    Some amorous youth his orisons address
    His prayer is in a happy hour preferred
    And when Jove loves a lover shall be heard        Exit




ACT II


SCENE IA Night Scene of a Palace

SOSIA with a DarkLanthorn MERCURY in SOSIAS shape with a
DarkLanthorn also

Sos Was not the devil in my master to send me out this dreadful
dark night to bring the news of his victory to my lady and was not I
possessed with ten devils for going on his errand without a convoy
for the safeguard of my person Lord how am I melted into sweat with
fear I am diminished of my natural weight above two stone I shall
not bring half myself home again to my poor wife and family I have
been in an ague fit ever since shut of evening what with the fright
of trees by the highway which looked maliciously like thieves by
moonshine and what with bulrushes by the riverside that shaked like
spears and lances at me Well the greatest plague of a servingman is
to be hired to some great lord They care not what drudgery they put
upon us while they lie lolling at their ease abed and stretch their
lazy limbs in expectation of the whore which we are fetching for them

Merc Aside He is but a poor mortal that suffers this but I
who am a god am degraded to a footpimp a waiter without doors a
very civil employment for a deity

Sos The better sort of them will say Upon my honour at every
word yet ask them for our wages and they plead the privilege of their
honour and will not pay us nor let us take our privilege of the law
upon them These are a very hopeful sort of patriots to stand up as
they do for liberty and property of the subject Theres conscience
for you

Merc Aside This fellow has something of the republican spirit
in him

Sos Looking about him Stay this methinks should be our
house and I should thank the gods now for bringing me safe home but
I think I had as good let my devotions alone till I have got the
reward for my good news and then thank them once for all for if I
praise them before I am safe within doors some damned mastiff dog may
come out and worry me and then my thanks are thrown away upon them

Merc Aside Thou art a wicked rogue and wilt have thy bargain
beforehand therefore thou getst not into the house this night and
thank me accordingly as I use thee

Sos Now am I to give my lady an account of my lords victory tis
good to exercise my parts beforehand and file my tongue into eloquent
expressions to tickle her ladyships imagination

Merc Aside Good and heres the god of eloquence to judge of
thy oration

Sos Setting down his Lanthorn This lanthorn for once shall be
my lady because she is the lamp of all beauty and perfection

Merc Aside No rogue tis thy lord is the lanthorn by this
time or Jupiter is turned fumbler

Sos Then thus I make my addresses to herBows Madam my lord
has chosen me out as the most faithful though the most unworthy of
his followers to bring your ladyship this following account of our
glorious expedition Then sheO my poor Sosia In a shrill tone
how am I overjoyed to see thee She can say no lessMadam you do me
too much honour and the world will envy me this gloryWell answered
on my side And how does my lord AmphitryonMadam he always does
like a man of courage when he is called by honourThere I think I
nicked itBut when will he returnAs soon as possibly he can but
not so soon as his impatient heart could wish him with your ladyship

Merc Aside When Thebes is an university thou deservest to be
their orator

Sos But what does he do and what does he say Prythee tell me
something more of himHe always says less than he does madam and
his enemies have found it to their costWhere the devil did I learn
these elegancies and gallantries

Merc So he has all the natural endowments of a fop and only wants
the education

Sos Staring up to the sky What is the devil in the night
Shes as long as two nights The seven stars are just where they were
seven hours ago high dayhigh night I mean by my favour What has
Phbus been playing the good fellow and overslept himself that he
forgets his duty to us mortals

Merc How familiarly the rascal treats us gods but I shall make him
alter his tone immediately

    MERCURY comes nearer and stands just before him

Sos Seeing him and starting back aside How now what do my
eyes dazzle or is my dark lanthorn false to me is not that a giant
before our door or a ghost of somebody slain in the late battle If
he be tis unconscionably done to fright an honest man thus who
never drew weapon wrathfully in all my life Whatever wight he be I am
devilishly afraid thats certain but tis discretion to keep my own
counsel Ill sing that I may seem valiant

SOSIA sings and as MERCURY speaks by little and little drops
his voice

Merc What saucy companion is this that deafens us with his hoarse
voice What midnight balladsinger have we here I shall teach the
villain to leave off catterwauling

Sos I would I had courage for his sake that I might teach him to
call my singing catterwauling an illiterate rogue an enemy to the
muses and to music

Merc There is an ill savour that offends my nostrils and it wafteth
this way

Sos He has smelt me out my fear has betrayed me into this savour I
am a dead man the bloody villain is at his fee fa fum already

Merc Stand who goes there

Sos A friend

Merc What friend

Sos Why a friend to all the world that will give me leave to live
peaceably

Merc I defy peace and all its works my arms are out of exercise
they have mauled nobody these three days I long for an honourable
occasion to pound a man and lay him asleep at the first buffet

Sos Aside That would almost do me a kindness for I have been
kept waking without tipping one wink of sleep these three nights

Merc Of what quality are you fellow

Sos Why I am a man fellowCourage Sosia

Merc What kind of man

Sos Why a twolegged man what man should I be Aside I must
bear up to him he may prove as arrant a milksop as myself

Merc Thou art a coward I warrant thee do not I hear thy teeth
chatter in thy head

Sos Ay ay thats only a sign they would be snapping at thy nose
Aside Bless me what an arm and fist he has with great thumbs
too and golls and knucklebones of a very butcher

Merc Sirrah from whence came you and whither go you answer me
directly upon pain of assassination

Sos I am coming from whence I came and am going whither I
gothats directly home though this is somewhat an uncivil manner of
proceeding at the first sight of a man let me tell you

Merc Then to begin our better acquaintance let me first make you a
small present of this box o the ear Strikes him

Sos If I were as choleric a fool as you are now here would be fine
work betwixt us two but I am a little better bred than to disturb the
sleeping neighbourhood and so goodnight friend Is going

Merc Stopping him Hold sir you and I must not part so easily
once more whither are you going

Sos Why I am going as fast as I can to get out of the reach of your
clutches Let me but only knock at the door there

Merc What business have you at that door sirrah

Sos This is our house and when I am got in I will
tell you more

Merc Whose house is this sauciness that you are so
familiar with to call it ours

Sos Tis mine in the first place and next my
masters for I lie in the garret and he lies under
me

Merc Have your master and you no names sirrah

Sos His name is Amphitryon hear that and tremble

Merc What my lord general

Sos O has his name mollified you I have brought
you down a peg lower already friend

Merc And your name is

Sos Lord friend you are so very troublesomewhat should my name
be but Sosia

Merc How Sosia say you how long have you taken up that name
sirrah

Sos Heres a fine question Why I never took it up friend it was
born with me

Merc What was your name born Sosia take this remembrance for that
lie Beats him

Sos Hold friend you are so very flippant with your hands you
wont hear reason What offence has my name done you that you should
beat me for it S O S I A they are as civil honest harmless
letters as any are in the whole alphabet

Merc I have no quarrel to the name but that tis een too good for
you and tis none of yours

Sos What am not I Sosia say you

Merc No

Sos I should think you are somewhat merrily disposed if you had
not beaten me in such sober sadness You would persuade me out of my
heathen name would you

Merc Say you are Sosia again at your peril sirrah

Sos I dare say nothing but thought is free but whatever I am
called I am Amphitryons man and the first letter of my name is S
too You had best tell me that my master did not send me home to my
lady with news of his victory

Merc I say he did not

Sos Lord Lord friend one of us two is horribly given to lying
but I do not say which of us to avoid contention

Merc I say my name is Sosia and yours is not

Sos I would you could make good your words for then I should not be
beaten and you should

Merc I find you would be Sosia if you durst but if I catch you
thinking so

Sos I hope I may think I was Sosia and I can find no difference
between my former self and my present self but that I was plain Sosia
before and now I am laced Sosia

Merc Take this for being so impudent to think so Beats him

Sos Kneeling Truce a little I beseech thee I would be a
stock or a stone now by my good will and would not think at all for
selfpreservation But will you give me leave to argue the matter
fairly with you and promise me to depose that cudgel if I can prove
myself to be that man that I was before I was beaten

Merc Well proceed in safety I promise you I will not beat you

Sos In the first place then is not this town called Thebes

Merc Undoubtedly

Sos And is not this house Amphitryons

Merc Who denies it

Sos I thought you would have denied that too for all hang upon a
string Remember then that those two preliminary articles are already
granted In the next place did not the aforesaid Amphitryon beat
the Teleboans kill their king Pterelas and send a certain servant
meaning somebody that for sakesake shall be nameless to bring a
present to his wife with news of his victory and of his resolution to
return tomorrow

Merc This is all true to a very tittle but who is that certain
servant theres all the question

Sos Is it peace or war betwixt us

Merc Peace

Sos I dare not wholly trust that abominable cudgel but tis a
certain friend of yours and mine that had a certain name before he was
beaten out of it but if you are a man that depend not altogether upon
force and brutality but somewhat also upon reason now do you bring
better proofs that you are that same certain man and in order to it
answer me to certain questions

Merc I say I am Sosia Amphitryons man what reason have you to
urge against it

Sos What was your fathers name

Merc Davus who was an honest husbandman whose sisters name was
Harpage that was married and died in a foreign country

Sos So far you are right I must confess and your wifes name is

Merc Bromia a devilish shrew of her tongue and a vixen of her
hands that leads me a miserable life keeps me to hard duty abed and
beats me every morning when I have risen from her side without having
first

Sos I understand you by many a sorrowful tokenthis must be I
Aside

Merc I was once taken upon suspicion of burglary and was whipt
through Thebes and branded for my pains

Sos Right me again but if you are I as I begin to suspect that
whipping and branding might have been past over in silence for both
our credits And yet now I think ont if I am I as I am I he
cannot be I All these circumstances he might have heard but I will
now interrogate him upon some private passagesWhat was the present
that Amphitryon sent by you or me no matter which of us to his wife
Alcmena

Merc A buckle of diamonds consisting of five large stones

Sos And where are they now

Merc In a case sealed with my masters coat of arms

Sos This is prodigious I confess but yet tis nothing now I think
ont for some false brother may have revealed it to him Aside
But I have another question to ask you of somewhat that passed only
betwixt myself and meif you are Sosia what were you doing in the
heat of battle

Merc What a wise man should that has respect for his own person I
ran into our tent and hid myself amongst the baggage

Sos Aside Such another cutting answer and I must provide
myself of another nameTo him And how did you pass your time in
that same tent You need not answer to every circumstance so exactly
now you must lie a little that I may think you the more me

Merc That cunning shall not serve your turn to circumvent me out
of my name I am for plain naked truth There stood a hogshead of old
wine which my lord reserved for his own drinking

Sos Aside O the devil as sure as death he must have hid
himself in that hogshead or he could never have known that

Merc And by that hogshead upon the ground there lay the kind
inviter and provoker of good drinking

Sos Nay now I have caught you there was neither inviter nor
provoker for I was all alone

Merc A lusty gammon of

Sos Sighing Baconthat word has quite made an end of
meLet me seethis must be I in spite of me but let me view him
nearer

Walks about MERCURY with his Dark Lanthorn

Merc What are you walking about me for with your dark lanthorn

Sos No harm friend I am only surveying a parcel of earth here
that I find we two are about to bargain forHes damnable like me
thats certain Imprimis theres the patch upon my nose with a pox
to him Item A very foolish face with a long chin at end ont
Item One pair of shambling legs with two splay feet belonging to
them and summa totallis from head to foot all my bodily apparel
To MERCURY Well you are Sosia theres no denying itbut what
am I then for my mind gives me I am somebody still if I knew but who
I were

Merc When I have a mind to be Sosia no more then thou mayst be
Sosia again

Sos I have but one request more to thee that though not as Sosia
yet as a stranger I may go into that house and carry a civil message
to my lady

Merc No sirrah not being Sosia you have no message to deliver
nor no lady in this house

Sos Thou canst not be so barbarous to let me lie in the streets all
night after such a journey and such a beating and therefore I am
resolved to knock at the door in my own defence

Merc If you come near the door I recal my word and break off the
truce and then expect

Holds up his Cudgel

Sos No the devil take me if I do expect I have felt too well what
sour fruit that crabtree bears Ill rather beat it back upon the hoof
to my lord Amphitryon to see if he will acknowledge me for Sosia
if he does not then I am no longer his slave theres my freedom
dearly purchased with a sore drubbing if he does acknowledge me then
I am Sosia again So far tis tolerably well but then I shall have
a second drubbing for an unfortunate ambassador as I am and thats
intolerable Exit SOSIA

Merc Alone I have fobbed off his excellency pretty well Now
let him return and make the best of his credentials I think too I
have given Jupiter sufficient time for his consummationOh he has
taken his cue and here he comes as leisurely and as lank as if he
had emptied himself of the best part of his almightyship


SCENE II

Enter JUPITER leading ALCMENA followed by PHDRA Pages with
Torches before them

    Jup To the Pages Those torches are offensive stand aloof
    For though they bless me with thy heavenly sight
                                                       To her
    They may disclose the secret I would hide
    The Thebans must not know I have been here
    Detracting crowds would blame me that I robbed
    These happy moments from my public charge
    To consecrate to thy desired embrace
    And I could wish no witness but thyself
    For thou thyself art all I wish to please

    Alcm So long an absence and so short a stay
    What but one night one night of joy and love
    Could only pay one night of cares and fears
    And all the rest are an uncancelled sum
    Curse on this honour and this public fame
    Would you had less of both and more of love

    Jup Alcmena I must go

    Alcm Not yet my lord

    Jup Indeed I must

    Alcm Indeed you shall not go

    Jup Behold the ruddy streaks oer yonder hill
    Those are the blushes of the breaking morn
    That kindle daylight to this nether world

    Alcm No matter for the day it was but made
    To number out the hours of busy men
    Let them be busy still and still be wretched
    And take their fill of anxious drudging day
    But you and I will draw our curtains close
    Extinguish daylight and put out the sun
    Come back my lord in faith you shall retire
    You have not yet lain long enough in bed
    To warm your widowed side

Phd Aside I find my lord is an excellent schoolmaster my
lady is so willing to repeat her lesson

Merc Aside Thats a plaguy little devil what a roguish eye she
has I begin to like her strangely Shes the perquisite of my place
too for my ladys waitingwoman is the proper fees of my lords chief
gentleman I have the privilege of a god too I can view her naked
through all her clothes Let me see let me seeI have discovered
something that pleases me already

    Jup Let me not live but thou art all enjoyment
    So charming and so sweet
    That not a night but whole eternity
    Were well employed
    To love thy each perfection as it ought

    Alcm Kissing him Ill bribe you with this kiss
      to stay a while

    Jup Kissing her A bribe indeed that soon will bring me back
    But to be just I must restore your bribe
    How I could dwell for ever on those lips
    O I could kiss them pale with eagerness
    So soft by heaven and such a juicy sweet
    That ripened peaches have not half the flavour

    Alcm Ye niggard gods you make our lives too long
    You fill them with diseases wants and woes
    And only dash them with a little love
    Sprinkled by fits and with a sparing hand
    Count all our joys from childhood even to age
    They would but make a day of every year
    Take back your seventy years the stint of life
    Or else be kind and cram the quintessence
    Of seventy years into sweet seventy days
    For all the rest is flat insipid being

    Jup But yet one scruple pains me at my parting
    I love so nicely that I cannot bear
    To owe the sweets of love which I have tasted
    To the submissive duty of a wife
    Tell me and sooth my passion ere I go
    That in the kindest moments of the night
    When you gave up yourself to love and me
    You thought not of a husband but a lover

    Alcm But tell me first why you would raise a blush
    Upon my cheeks by asking such a question

    Jup I would owe nothing to a name so dull
    As husband is but to a lover all

    Alcm You should have asked me then when love and night
    And privacy had favoured your demand

    Jup I ask it now because my tenderness
    Surpasses that of husbands for their wives
    O that you loved like me then you would find
    A thousand thousand niceties in love
    The common love of sex to sex is brutal
    But love refined will fancy to itself
    Millions of gentle cares and sweet disquiets
    The being happy is not half the joy
    The manner of their happiness is all
    In me my charming mistress you behold
    A lover that disdains a lawful title
    Such as of monarchs to successive thrones
    The generous lover holds by force of arms
    And claims his crown by conquest

    Alcm Methinks you should be pleased I give you all
    A virtuous and modest wife can give

    Jup No no that very name of wife and marriage
    Is poison to the dearest sweets of love
    To please my niceness you must separate
    The lover from his mortal foethe husband
    Give to the yawning husband your cold virtue
    But all your vigorous warmth your melting sighs
    Your amorous murmurs be your lovers part

    Alcm I comprehend not what you mean my lord
    But only love me still and love me thus
    And think me such as best may please your thought

    Jup Theres mystery of love in all I say
    Farewell and when you see your husband next
    Think of your lover then

    Exeunt JUP and ALCM severally
     PHD follows her

Merc Alone Now I should follow him but love has laid a
limetwig for me and made a lame god of me Yet why should I love this
Phdra Shes interested and a jilt into the bargain Three thousand
years hence there will be a whole nation of such women in a certain
country that will be called France and theres a neighbour island
too where the men of that country will be all interest O what a
precious generation will that be which the men of the island shall
propagate out of the women of the continent

PHDRA reenters

And so much for prophecy for shes here again and I must love her in
spite of me And since I must I have this comfort that the greatest
wits are commonly the greatest cullies because neither of the sexes
can be wiser than some certain parts about them will give them leave

Phd Well Sosia and how go matters

Merc Our army is victorious

Phd And my servant judge Gripus

Merc A voluptuous gormand

Phd But has he gotten wherewithal to be voluptuous
is he wealthy

Merc He sells justice as he uses fleeces the rich
rebels and hangs up the poor

Phd Then while he has money he may make love to me Has he sent
me no token

Merc Yes a kiss and by the same token I am to give it you as a
remembrance from him

Phd How now impudence A beggarly servingman presume to kiss me

Merc Suppose I were a god and should make love to you

Phd I would first be satisfied whether you were a poor god or a
rich god

Merc Suppose I were Mercury the god of merchandise

Phd What the god of small wares and fripperies of pedlers and
pilferers

Merc How the gipsy despises me Aside

Phd I had rather you were Plutus the god of money or Jupiter in
a golden shower there was a god for us women he had the art of making
love Dost thou think that kings or gods either get mistresses by
their good faces no it is the gold and the presents they can make
there is the prerogative they have over their fair subjects

Merc All this notwithstanding I must tell you pretty Phdra I am
desperately in love with you

Phd And I must tell thee ugly Sosia thou hast not wherewithal to
be in love

Merc Yes a poor man may be in love I hope

Phd I grant a poor rogue may be in love but he can never make
love Alas Sosia thou hast neither face to invite me nor youth to
please me nor gold to bribe me and besides all this thou hast a
wife poor miserable SosiaWhat ho Bromia

Merc O thou merciless creature why dost thou conjure up that sprite
of a wife

Phd To rid myself of that devil of a poor lover Since you are so
lovingly disposed Ill put you together to exercise your fury upon
your own wedlockWhat Bromia I say make haste here is a vessel of
yours full freighted that is going off without paying duties

Merc Since thou wilt not let me steal custom she shall have all the
cargo I have gotten in the wars but thou mightst have lent me a little
creek to smuggle in

Phd Why what have you gotten good gentleman soldier besides a
legion of Snaps her fingers

Merc When the enemy was routed I had the plundering of a tent

Phd That is to say a house of canvas with moveables of
strawMake haste Bromia

Merc But it was the generals own tent

Phd You durst not fight I am certain and therefore came last in
when the rich plunder was gone beforehandWill you come Bromia

Merc Prythee do not call so loudA great goblet that holds a
gallon

Phd Of what was that goblet made answer quickly for I am just
calling very loudBro

Merc Of beaten gold Now call aloud if thou dost not like the
metal

Phd Bromia Very softly

Merc That struts in this fashion with his arms akimbo like a city
magistrate and a great bouncing belly like a hostess with child of a
kilderkin of wine Now what say you to that present Phdra

Phd Why I am considering

Merc What I prythee

Phd Why how to divide the business equally to take the gift and
refuse the giver thou art so damnably ugly and so old

Merc Now the devil take Jupiter for confining me to this ungodly
shape today Aside but Gripus is as old and as ugly too

Phd But Gripus is a person of quality and my ladys uncle and if
he marries me I shall take place of my ladyHark your wife she has
sent her tongue before her I hear the thunderclap already there is a
storm approaching

Merc Yes of thy brewing I thank thee for it O how I should hate
thee now if I could leave loving thee

Phd Not a word of the dear golden goblet as you hope foryou know
what Sosia

Merc You give me hope then

Phd Not absolutely hope neither but gold is a great cordial in
love matters and the more you apply of it the betterAside I
am honest that is certain but when I weigh my honesty against the
goblet I am not quite resolved on which side the scale will turn
Exit PHD

Merc Aloud Farewell Phdra remember me to my wife and tell
her

Enter BROMIA

Brom Tell her what traitor that you are going away without seeing
her

Merc That I am doing my duty and following my master

Brom Umphso brisk too your master did his duty to my lady
before he parted He could leave his army in the lurch and come
galloping home at midnight to have a lick at the honeypot and steal
tobed as quietly as any mouse I warrant you My master knew what
belonged to a married life but you sirrahyou trenchercarrying
rascalyou worse than dunghillcock that stood clapping your wings
and crowing without doors when you should have been at roost you
villain

Merc Hold your peace dame Partlet and leave your cackling my
master charged me to stand centry without doors

Brom My master I dare swear thou beliest him my master is more
a gentleman than to lay such an unreasonable command upon a poor
distressed married couple and after such an absence too No there is
no comparison between my master and thee thou sneaksby

Merc No more than there is betwixt my lady and you Bromia You and
I have had our time in a civil way spouse and much good love has been
betwixt us but we have been married fifteen years I take it and that
hoighty toighty business ought in conscience to be over

Brom Marry come up my saucy companion I am neither old nor ugly
enough to have that said to me

Merc But will you hear reason Bromia my lord and my lady are yet
in a manner bride and bridegroom they are in honeymoon still do but
think in decency what a jest it would be to the family to see two
venerable old married people lying snug in a bed together and sighing
out fine tender things to one another

Brom How now traitor darest thou maintain that I am past the age
of having fine things said to me

Merc Not so my dear but certainly I am past the age of saying them

Brom Thou deservest not to be yoked with a woman of honour as I am
thou perjured villain

Merc Ay you are too much a woman of honour to my sorrow many a
poor husband would be glad to compound for less honour in his wife and
more quiet Prythee be but honest and continent in thy tongue and do
thy worst with every thing else about thee

Brom Thou wouldst have a woman of the town wouldst thou to be
always speaking my husband fair to make him digest his cuckoldom
more easily wouldst thou be a wittol with a vengeance to thee I am
resolved Ill scour thy hide for that word

    Holds up her ladle at him

Merc Thou wilt not strike thy lord and husband wilt thou

Brom Since thou wilt none of the meat tis but justice to give thee
the bastings of the ladle

    She courses him about

Merc Running about Was ever poor deity so henpecked as I am
nay then tis time to charm her asleep with my enchanted rod before I
am disgraced or ravished

    Plucks out his Caduceus and strikes her
        upon the shoulder with it

Brom What art thou rebelling against thy anointed wife Ill make
theehow nowWhat has the rogue bewitched me I grow dull and
stupid on the suddenI can neither stir hand nor footI am just like
himI have lost the use of all mymembersYawningI cant so
much as wag my tongueneither and thats the last living part about
awoman Falls down

MERCURY alone

Lord what have I suffered for being but a counterfeit married man one
day If ever I come to this house as a husband againthenand yet
that then was a lie too for while I am in love with this young gipsy
Phdra I must return But lie thou there thou type of Juno thou that
wantest nothing of her tongue but the immortality If Jupiter ever let
thee set foot in heaven Juno will have a rattling second of thee and
there will never be a fair day in heaven or earth after it

    For two such tongues will break the poles asunder
    And hourly scolding make perpetual thunder
                                        Exit MERCURY



ACT III


SCENE IBefore AMPHITRYONS Palace

AMPHITRYON and SOSIA

Amph Now sirrah follow me into the house thou shalt be convinced
at thy own cost villain What horrible lies hast thou told me such
improbabilities such stuff such nonsensethat the monster with
two long horns that frighted the great king and the devil at the
stonecutters are truths to these

Sos I am but a slave and you are master and a poor man is always
to lie when a rich man is pleased to contradict him but as sure as
this is our house

Amph So sure tis thy place of executionThou art not made for
lying neither

Sos Thats certain for all my neighbours say I have an honest face
or else they would never call me cuckold as they do

Amph I mean thou hast not wit enough to make a lie that will hang
together thou hast set up a trade that thou hast not stock enough to
manage O that I had but a crabtree cudgel for thy sake

Sos How a cudgel said you the devil take Jupiter for inventing
that hardhearted merciless knobby wood

Amph The bitterness is yet to come thou hast had but a half dose of
it

Sos I was never good at swallowing physic and my stomach wambles
at the very thought of it But if I must have a second beating in
conscience let me strip first that I may show you the black and blue
streaks upon my sides and shoulders I am sure I suffered them in your
service

Amph To what purpose wouldst thou show them

Sos Why to the purpose that you may not strike me upon the sore
places and that as he beat me the last night crossways so you would
please to beat me longways to make clean work ont that at least my
skin may look like chequerwork

Amph This request is too reasonable to be refused But that all
things may be done in order tell me over again the same story with
all the circumstances of thy commission that a blow may follow in due
form for every lie To repetition rogue to repetition

Sos No it shall be all a lie if you please and Ill eat my words
to save my shoulders

Amph Ay sirrah now you find you are to be disproved but tis too
late To repetition rogue to repetition

Sos With all my heart to any repetition but the cudgel But
would you be pleased to answer me one civil question Am I to use
complaisance to you as to a great person that will have all things
said your own way or am I to tell you the naked truth alone without
the ceremony of a farther beating

Amph Nothing but the truth and the whole truth so help thee
cudgel

Sos Thats a damned conclusion of a sentence but since it must be
soback and sides at your own perilI set out from the port in an
unlucky hour the dusky canopy of night enveloping the hemisphere

Amph Strikes him Imprimis for fustiannow proceed

Sos I stand corrected In plain prose thenI went darkling and
whistling to keep myself from being afraid mumbling curses betwixt my
teeth for being sent at such an unnatural time of night

Amph How sirrah cursing and swearing against your lord and master
take Going to strike

Sos Hold sirpray consider if this be not unreasonable to strike
me for telling the whole truth when you commanded me Ill fall into
my old dogtrot of lying again if this must come of plain dealing

Amph To avoid impertinences make an end of your journey and come to
the housewhat found you there a gods name

Sos I came thither in no gods name at all but in the devils name
I found before the door a swinging fellow with all my shapes and
features and accoutred also in my habit

Amph Who was that fellow

Sos Who should it be but another Sosia a certain kind of other me
who knew all my unfortunate commission precisely to a word as well as
I Sosia as being sent by yourself from the port upon the same errand
to Alcmena

Amph What gross absurdities are these

Sos O Lord O Lord what absurditiesas plain as any packstaff
That other me had posted himself there before me meYou wont give
a man leave to speak poetically now or else I would say that I was
arrived at the door just before I came thither

Amph This must either be a dream or drunkenness or madness in thee
Leave your buffooning and lying I am not in humour to bear it sirrah

Sos I would you should know I scorn a lie and am a man of honour
in every thing but just fighting I tell you once again in plain
sincerity and simplicity of heart that before last night I never
took myself but for one single individual Sosia but coming to our
door I found myself I know not how divided and as it were split
into two Sosias

Amph Leave buffooning I see you would make me laugh but you play
the fool scurvily

Sos That may be but if I am a fool I am not the only fool in this
company

Amph How now impudence I shall

Sos Be not in wrath sir I meant not you I cannot possibly be
the only fool for if I am one fool I must certainly be two fools
because as I told you I am double

Amph That one should be two is very probable

Sos Have you not seen a sixpence split into two halves by some
ingenious schoolboy which bore on either side the impression of the
monarchs face Now as those moieties were two threepences and yet
in effect but one sixpence

Amph No more of your villainous tropes and figures

Sos Nay if an orator must be disarmed of his similitudes

Amph A man had need of patience to endure this gibberish be brief
and come to a conclusion

Sos What would you have sir I came thither but the tother I was
before me for that there was two Is is as certain as that I have
two eyes in this head of mine This I that am here was weary the
tother I was fresh this I was peaceable and tother I was a
hectoring bully I

Amph And thou expectst I should believe thee

Sos No I am not so unreasonable for I could never have believed it
myself if I had not been well beaten into it but a cudgel you know
is a convincing argument in a brawny fist What shall I say but that
I was compelled at last to acknowledge myself I found that he was
very I without fraud cozen or deceit Besides I viewed myself as
in a mirror from head to foot he was handsome of a noble presence a
charming air loose and free in all his motions and saw he was so much
I that I should have reason to be better satisfied with my own person
if his hands had not been a little of the heaviest

Amph Once again to a conclusion Say you passed by him and entered
into the house

Sos I am a friend to truth and say no such thing he defended the
door and I could not enter

Amph How not enter

Sos Why how should I enter unless I were a spirit to glide by
him and shoot myself through locks and bolts and twoinch boards

Amph O coward Didst thou not attempt to pass

Sos Yes and was repulsed and beaten for my pains

Amph Who beat thee

Sos I beat me

Amph Didst thou beat thyself

Sos I dont mean I here but the absent Me beat me here present

Amph Theres no end of this intricate piece of nonsense

Sos Tis only nonsense because I speak it who am a poor fellow
but it would be sense and substantial sense if a great man said it
that was backed with a title and the eloquence of ten thousand pounds
ayear

Amph No more but let us enterHold my Alcmena is coming out and
has prevented me how strangely will she be surprised to see me here so
unexpectedly

Enter ALCMENA and PHDRA

Alcm To PHD Make haste after me to the temple that we may
thank the gods for this glorious success which Amphitryon has had
against the rebelsO heaven

                                                  Seeing him

    Amph Those heavens and all the blessed inhabitants
                                                Saluting her
    Grant that the sweet rewarder of my pains
    May still be kind as on our nuptial night

    Alcm So soon returned

    Amph So soon returned Is this thy welcome home
                                               Stepping back
    So soon returned says I am come unwished
    This is no language of desiring love
    Love reckons hours for months and days for years
    And every little absence is an age

    Alcm What says my lord

    Amph No my Alcmena no
    True love by its impatience measures time
    And the dear object never comes too soon

    Alcm Nor ever came you so nor ever shall
    But you yourself are changed from what you were
    Palled in desires and surfeited of bliss
    Not so I met you at your last return
    When yesternight I flew into your arms
    And melted in your warm embrace

    Amph Hows this

    Alcm Did not my soul even sparkle at my eyes
    And shoot itself into your muchloved bosom
    Did I not tremble with excess of joy
    Nay agonize with pleasure at your sight
    With such inimitable proofs of passion
    As no false love could feign

    Amph Whats this you tell me

    Alcm Far short of truth by heaven
    And you returned those proofs with usury
    And left me with a sigh at break of day
    Have you forgot

    Amph Or have you dreamt Alcmena
    Perhaps some kind revealing deity
    Has whispered in your sleep the pleasing news
    Of my return and you believed it real
    Perhaps too in your dream you used me kindly
    And my preventing image reaped the joys
    You meant awake to me

    Alcm Some melancholy vapour sure has seized
    Your brain Amphitryon and disturbed your sense
    Or yesternight is not so long a time
    But yet you might remember and not force
    An honest blush into my glowing cheeks
    For that which lawful marriage makes no crime

    Amph I thank you for my melancholy vapour

    Alcm Tis but a just requital for my dream

Phd I find my master took too much of the creature last night
Aside and now is angling for a quarrel that no more may be
expected from him tonight when he has no assets

    In the mean time AMPH and ALC
     walk by themselves and frown at each other as they meet

Amph You dare not justify it to my face

Alcm Not what

Amph That I returned before this hour

Alcm You dare not sure deny you came last night And staid till
break of day

Amph O impudenceWhy Sosia

Sos Nay I say nothing for all things here may go by enchantment
as they did with me for aught I know

Alcm Speak Phdrawas he here

Phd You know madam I am but a chambermaid and by my place I
am to forget all that was done over night in lovemattersunless my
master please to rub up my memory with another diamond

    Amph Now in the name of all the gods Alcmena
    A little recollect your scattered thoughts
    And weigh what you have said

    Alcm I weighed it well Amphitryon ere I spoke
    And she and Bromia all the slaves and servants
    Can witness they beheld you when you came
    If other proof were wanting tell me how
    I came to know your fight your victory
    The death of Pterelas in single combat
    And farther from whose hands I had a jewel
    The spoils of him you slew

    Amph This is amazing
    Have I already given you those diamonds
    The present I reserved

    Alcm Tis an odd question
    You see I wear them look

Amph Now answer Sosia

Sos Yes now I can answer with a safe conscience as to that point
all the rest may be art magic but as for the diamonds here they are
under safe custody

Alcm Then what are these upon my arm To SOSIA

Sos Flints or pebbles or some such trumpery of enchanted stones

Phd They say the proof of a true diamond is to glitter in the
dark I think my master had best take my lady into some bycorner and
try whose diamond will sparkle best

Sos Yet now I think ont madam did not a certain friend of mine
present them to you

Alcm What friend

Sos Why another Sosia one that made himself Sosia in my despite
and also unsosiated me

Amph Sirrah leave your nauseous nonsense break open the seal and
take out the diamonds

Sos More words than one to a bargain sir I I thank youthats no
part of prudence for me to commit burglary upon the seals Do you look
first upon the signet and tell me in your conscience whether the
seals be not as firm as when you clapt the wax upon them

Amph The signature is firm Looking

Sos Then take the signature into your own custody and open it for
I will have nothing done at my proper peril Giving him the Casket

Amph O heavens heres nothing but an empty space the nest where
they were laid

    Breaking open the Seal

Sos Then if the birds are flown the faults not mine Here has
been fine conjuring work or else the jewel knowing to whom it should
be given took occasion to steal out by a natural instinct and tied
itself to that pretty arm

Amph Can this be possible

Sos Yes very possible You my lord Amphitryon may have brought
forth another You my lord Amphitryon as well as I Sosia have
brought forth another Me Sosia and our diamonds may have procreated
these diamonds and so we are all three double

Phd If this be true I hope my goblet has gigged another golden
goblet and then they may carry double upon all four Aside

Alcm My lord I have stood silent out of wonder What you could
wonder at

    Amph A chilling sweat a damp of jealousy
    Hangs on my brows and clams upon my limbs
    I fear and yet I must be satisfied
    And to be satisfied I must dissemble            Aside

    Alcm Why muse you so and murmur to yourself
    If you repent your bounty take it back

    Amph Not so but if you please relate what past
    At our last interview

    Alcm That question would infer you were not here

    Amph I say not so
    I only would refresh my memory
    And have my reasons to desire the story

Phd So this is as good sport for me as an examination of a great
belly before a magistrate

    Alcm The story is not long you know I met you
    Kissed you and pressed you close within my arms
    With all the tenderness of wifely love

    Amph I could have spared that kindness       Aside
    And what did I

    Alcm You strained me with a masculine embrace
    As you would squeeze my soul out

    Amph Did I so

    Alcm You did

    Amph Confound those arms that were so kind   Aside
    Proceed proceed                              To her

Alcm You would not stay to sup but much complaining of your
drowsiness and want of natural rest

    Amph Made haste to bed Ha wast not so Go on
    Aside And stab me with each syllable thou speakst

    Phd So now tis coming now tis coming

    Alcm I have no more to say

    Amph Why went we not to bed

    Alcm Why not
    Is it a crime for husband and for wife
    To go to bed my lord

    Amph Perfidious woman

    Alcm Ungrateful man

    Amph She justifies it too

    Alcm I need not justify Of what am I accused

    Amph Of all that prodigality of kindness
    Given to another and usurped from me
    So bless me Heaven if since my first departure
    I ever set my foot upon this threshold
    So am I innocent of all those joys
    And dry of those embraces

    Alcm Then I it seems am false

    Amph As surely false as what thou sayst is true

    Alcm I have betrayed my honour and my love
    And am a foul adultress

    Amph What thou art
    Thou standst condemned to be by thy relation

    Alcm Go thou unworthy man for ever go
    No more my husband go thou base impostor
    Who takst a vile pretence to taint my fame
    And not content to leave wouldst ruin me
    Enjoy thy wished divorce I will not plead
    My innocence of this pretended crime
    I need not Spit thy venom do thy worst
    But know the more thou wouldst expose my virtue
    Like purest linen laid in open air
    Twill bleach the more and whiten to the view

    Amph Tis well thou art prepared for thy divorce
    For know thou too that after this affront
    This foul indignity done to my honour
    Divorcement is but petty reparation
    But since thou hast with impudence affirmed
    My false return and bribed my slaves to vouch it
    The truth shall in the face of Thebes be cleared
    Thy uncle the companion of my voyage
    And all the crew of seamen shall be brought
    Who were embarked and came with me to land
    Nor parted till I reached this cursed door
    So shall this vision of my late return
    Stand a detected lie and woe to those
    Who thus betrayed my honour

    Sos Sir shall I wait on you

    Amph No I will go alone Expect me here

                                             Exit AMPHITRYON

    Phd Please you that I                To ALCMENA

    Alcm Oh nothing now can please me
    Darkness and solitude and sighs and tears
    And all the inseparable train of grief
    Attend my steps for ever               Exit ALCMENA

Sos What if I should lie now and say we have been here before I
never saw any good that came of telling truth Aside

Phd He makes no more advances to me I begin a little to suspect
that my gold goblet will prove but copper Aside

Sos Yes tis resolved I will lie abominably against the light of
my own conscience For suppose the other Sosia has been here perhaps
that strong dog has not only beaten me but also has been predominant
upon my wife and most carnally misused her Now by asking certain
questions of her with a sidewind I may come to understand how
squares go and whether my nuptial bed be violated Aside

Phd Most certainly he has learned impudence of his master and will
deny his being here but that shall not serve his turn to cheat me of
my present AsideWhy Sosia What in a brown study

Sos A little cogitabund or so concerning this dismal revolution
in our family

Phd But that should not make you neglect your duty to me your
mistress

Sos Pretty soul I would thou wert upon condition that old Bromia
were six foot under ground

Phd What is all your hot courtship to me dwindled into a poor
unprofitable wish You may remember I did not bid you absolutely
despair

Sos No for all things yet may be accommodated in an amicable
manner betwixt my master and my lady

Phd I mean to the business betwixt you and me

Sos Why I hope we two never quarrelled

Phd Must I remember you of a certain promise that you made me at
our last parting

Sos Oh when I went to the army that I should still be praising thy
beauty to judge Gripus and keep up his affections to thee

Phd No I mean the business betwixt you and me this morningthat
you promised me

Sos That I promised theeI find it now That strong dog my brother
Sosia has been here before me and made love to her Aside

Phd You are considering whether or no you should keep your
promise

Sos That I should keep my promiseThe truth ont is shes
anotherguess morsel than old Bromia Aside

Phd And I had rather you should break it in a manner and as it
were and in some sense

Sos In a manner and as it were and in some sense thou saystI
find the strong dog has only tickled up her imagination and not
enjoyed her so that with my own limbs I may perform the sweetness
of his function with her AsideNo sweet creature the promise
shall not be broken but what I have undertaken I will perform like a
man of honour

Phd Then you remember the preliminaries of the present

Sos Yes yes in gross I do remember something but this disturbance
of the family has somewhat stupified my memory Some pretty quelque
chose I warrant thee some acceptable toy of small value

Phd You may call a gold goblet a toy but I put a greater value
upon your presents

Sos A gold goblet sayst thou Yes now I think ont it was a kind
of a gold goblet as a gratuity after consummation

Phd No no I had rather make sure of one bribe beforehand than be
promised ten gratuities

Sos Yes now I remember it was in some sense a gold goblet by
way of earnest and it contained

Phd One large

Sos How one large

Phd Gallon

Sos No that was somewhat too large in conscience It was
not a whole gallon but it may contain reasonably speaking one
largethimblefull but gallons and thimblefulls are so like that
in speaking I might easily mistake them

Phd Is it come to thisOut traitor

Sos I had been a traitor indeed to have betrayed thee to the
swallowing of a gallon but a thimblefull of cordial water is easily
sipt off and then this same goblet is so very light too that it will
be no burden to carry it about with thee in thy pocket

Phd O apostate to thy love O perjured villain

Enter BROMIA

What are you here Bromia I was telling him his own I was giving
him a rattle for his treacheries to you his love You see I can be a
friend upon occasion

Brom Ay chicken I never doubted of thy kindness but for this
fugitivethis rebelthis miscreant

Sos A kind welcome to an absent lover as I have been

Brom Ay and a kind greeting you gave me at your return when you
used me so barbarously this morning

Sos The tother Sosia has been with her too and has used her
barbarously barbarouslythat is to say uncivilly and uncivillyI
am afraid that means too civilly Aside

Phd You had best deny you were here this morning And by the same
token

Sos Nay no more tokens for Heavens sake dear PhdraNow must I
ponder with myself a little whether it be better for me to have been
here or not to have been here this morning Aside

Enter a Servant

Serv Phdra my lords without and will not enter till he has first
spoken with you Exit Serv

Phd To him in private Oh that I could stay to help worry
thee for this abuse but the best ont is I leave thee in good
handsFarewell ThimbleTo him Bromia Exit PHDRA

Brom No you did not beat me and put me into a swoon and deprive
me of the natural use of my tongue for a long half hour you did not
beat me down with your little wandbut I shall teach you to use your
rod another timeI shall

Sos Put her into a swoon with my little wand and so forth Thats
more than ever I could do These are terrible circumstances that some
Sosia or other has been here Now if he has literally beaten her
gramercy brother Sosia he has but done what I would have done if I
had durst But I am afraid it was only a damned lovefigure and that
the wand that laid her asleep might signify the peacemaker Aside

Brom Now you are snuffling up on a cold scent for some pitiful
excuse I know you twenty to one but you will plead a drunkenness
you are used to be potvaliant

Sos I was pumping and I thank her she has invented for meYes
Bromia I must confess I was exalted and possibly I might scour upon
thee or perhaps be a little more familiar with thy person by the way
of kindness than if I had been sober but prythee inform me what I
did that I may consider what satisfaction I am to make thee

Brom Are you there at your dogtricks You would be forgetting
would you like a drunken bully that affronts over night and when
he is called to account the next morning remembers nothing of the
quarrel and asks pardon to avoid fighting

Sos By Bacchus I was overtaken but I should be loth that I
committed any folly with thee

Brom I am sure I kept myself awake all night that I did in
expectation of your coming Crying

Sos But what amends did I make thee when I came

Brom You know well enough to my sorrow but that you play the
hypocrite

Sos I warrant I was monstrous kind to thee

Brom Yes monstrous kind indeed You never said a truer word for
when I came to kiss you you pulled away your mouth and turned your
cheek to me

Sos Good

Brom How good Heres fine impudence He justifies

Sos Yes I do justify that I turned my cheek like a prudent
person that my breath might not offend thee for now I remember I
had eaten garlick

Brom Ay you remember and forget just as it makes for you or
against you but to mend the matter you never spoke one civil word to
me but stood like a stock without sense or motion

Sos Yet better Aside

Brom After which I lovingly invited you to take your place in your
nuptial bed as the laws of matrimony oblige you and you inhumanly
refused me

Sos Ay theres the main point of the business Art thou morally
certain that I refused thee Look me now in the face and say I did
not commit matrimony with thee

Brom I wonder how thou canst look me in the face after that
refusal

Sos Say it once again that I did not feloniously come to bed to
thee

Brom No thou cold traitor thou knowst thou didst not

Sos Best of alltwas discreetly done of me to abstain

Brom What do you insult upon me too

Sos No I do not insult upon youbut

Brom But what How was it discreetly done then ha

Sos Because it is the received opinion of physicians that nothing
but puling chits and boobyfools are procreated in drunkenness

Brom A received opinion snivelguts Ill be judged by all the
married women of this town if any one of them has received it The
devil take the physicians for meddling in our matters If a husband
will be ruled by them there are five weeks of abstinence in dogdays
too for fear a child that was got in August should be born just nine
months after and be bleareyed like a May kitten

Sos Let the physicians alone they are honest men whatever the
world says of them But for a certain reason that I best know I am
glad that matter ended so fairly and peaceably betwixt us

Brom Yes twas very fair and peaceably to strike a woman down and
beat her most outrageously

Sos Ist possible that I drubbed thee

Brom I find your drift you would fain be provoking me to a new
trial now but ifaith you shall bring me to no more handyblows I
shall make bold to trust to my tongue hereafter You never durst have
offered to hold up a finger against me till you went a trooping

Sos Then I am a conqueror and I laud my own courage this renown I
have atchieved by soldiership and stratagem Know your duty spouse
henceforward to your supreme commander Strutting

Enter JUPITER and PHDRA attended by Musicians and Dancers

Phd Indeed I wondered at your quick return

    Jup Even so almighty love will have it Phdra
    And the stern goddess of sweetbitter cares
    Who bows our necks beneath her brazen yoke
    I would have manned my heart and held it out
    But when I thought of what I had possessed
    Those joys that never end but to begin
    O I am all on fire to make my peace
    And die Jove knows as much as I can die
    Till I am reconciled

    Phd I fear twill be in vain

    Jup Tis difficult
    But nothing is impossible to love
    To love like mine for I have proved his force
    And my Alcmena too has felt his dart
    If I submit theres hope

Phd Tis possible I may solicit for you

Jup But wilt thou promise me to do thy best

Phd Nay I promise nothingunless you begin to promise first
Curtsying

Jup I will not be ungrateful

Phd Well Ill try to bring her to the window you shall have a
fair shot at her if you can bring her down you are a good marksman

    Jup Thats all I ask
    And I will so reward thee gentle Phdra

Phd What with catsguts and rosin This Solla is but a lamentable
empty sound

Jup Then theres a sound will please thee better

    Throwing her a purse

    Phd Ay theres something of melody in this sound
    I could dance all day to the music of Chink Chink

    Jup Go Sosia round our Thebes
    To Polidas to Tranio and to Gripus
    Companions of our war invite them all
    To join their prayers to smooth Alcmenas brow
    And with a solemn feast to crown the day

Sos Taking JUPITER about the knees Let me embrace you sir
JUPITER pushes him away Nay you must give me leave to express my
gratitude I have not eaten to say eating nor drunk to say drinking
never since our villainous encamping so near the enemy It is true I
escaped the bloodyflux because I had so little in my bowels to come
out and I durst let nothing go in conscience because I had nothing
to swallow in the room ont

Jup You Bromia see that all things be prepared With that
magnificence as if some god Were guest or master here

Sos Or rather as much as if twenty gods were to be guests or
masters here

Brom That you may eat for today and tomorrow

Sos Or rather again for today and yesterday and as many months
backward as I am indebted to my own belly

    Jup Away both of youExeunt SOSIA and BROMIA severally
    Now I have packed him hence thou other Sosia
    Who though thou art not present hearst my voice

SONG

I

    Celia that I once was blest
    Is now the torment of my breast
    Since to curse me you bereave me
    Of the pleasures I possest
    Cruel creature to deceive me
    First to love and then to leave me

II

    Had you the bliss refused to grant
    Then I had never known the want
    But possessing once the blessing
    Is the cause of my complaint
    Once possessing is but tasting
    Tis no bliss that is not lasting

III

    Celia now is mine no more
    But I am hers and must adore
    Nor to leave her will endeavour
    Charms that captived me before
    No unkindness can dissever
    Love thats true is love for ever

Jup O stay

Merc Shes gone and seemed to frown at parting

    Jup Follow and thou shalt see her soon appeased
    For I who made her know her inward state
    No woman once wellpleased can throughly hate
    I gave them beauty to subdue the strong
    A mighty empire but it lasts not long
    I gave them pride to make mankind their slave
    But in exchange to men I flattery gave
    The offending lover when he lowest lies
    Submits to conquer and but kneels to rise




ACT IVSCENE I


Jupiter following ALCMENA MERCURY and PHDRA

    Jup O stay my dear Alcmena hear me speak

    Alcm No I would fly thee to the ridge of earth
    And leap the precipice to scape thy sight

    Jup For pity

    Alcm Leave me thou ungrateful man

    Jup I cannot leave you no but like a ghost
    Whom your unkindness murdered will I haunt you

    Alcm Once more be gone Im odious to myself
    For having loved thee once

    Jup Hate not the best and fairest of your kind
    Nor can you hate your lover though you would
    Your tears that fall so gently are but grief
    There may be anger but there must be love
    The dove that murmurs at her mates neglect
    But counterfeits a coyness to be courted

    Alcm Courtship from thee and after such affronts

    Jup Is this that everlasting love you vowed
    Last night when I was circled in your arms
    Remember what you swore

    Alcm Think what thou wert and who could swear too much
    Think what thou art and that unswears it all

    Jup Can you forsake me for so small a fault
    Twas but a jest perhaps too far pursued
    Twas but at most a trial of your faith
    How you could bear unkindness
    Twas but to get a reconciling kiss
    A wanton stratagem of love

    Alcm See how he doubles like a hunted hare
    A jest and then a trial and a bait
    All stuff and daubing

    Jup Think me jealous then

    Alcm O that I could for thats a noble crime
    And which a lover can with ease forgive
    Tis the high pulse of passion in a fever
    A sickly draught but shews a burning thirst
    Thine was a surfeit not a jealousy
    And in that loathing of thy fullgorged love
    Thou sawst the nauseous object with disdain

    Jup O think not that for you are ever new
    Your fruits of love are like eternal spring
    In happy climes where some are in the bud
    Some green and ripening some while others fall

    Alcm Ay now you tell me this
    When roused desires and fresh recruits of force
    Enable languished love to take the field
    But never hope to be received again
    You would again deny you were received
    And brand my spotless fame

    Jup I will not dare to justify my crime
    But only point you where to lay the blame
    Impute it to the husband not the lover

    Alcm How vainly would the sophister divide
    And make the husband and the lover two

    Jup Yes tis the husband is the guilty wretch
    His insolence forgot the sweets of love
    And deeming them his due despised the feast
    Not so the famished lover could forget
    He knew he had been there and had been blest
    With all that hope could wish or sense can bear

    Alcm Husband and lover both alike I hate

    Jup And I confess I have deserved that hate
    Too charming fair I kneel for your forgiveness    Kneeling
    I beg by those fair eyes
    Which gave me wounds that time can never cure
    Receive my sorrows and restore my joys

    Alcm Unkind and cruel I can speak no more

    Jup O give it vent Alcmena give it vent
    I merit your reproach I would be cursed
    Let your tongue curse me while your heart forgives

    Alcm Can I forget such usage

    Jup Can you hate me

    Alcm Ill do my best for sure I ought to hate you

    Jup That word was only hatched upon your tongue
    It came not from your heart But try again
    And if once more you can but sayI hate you
    My sword shall do you justice

    Alcm ThenI hate you

    Jup Then you pronounce the sentence of my death

    Alcm I hate you much but yetI love you more

    Jup To prove that love then say that you forgive me
    For there remains but this alternative
    Resolve to pardon or to punish me

    Alcm Alas what I resolve appears too plain
    In saying that I cannot hate I pardon

    Jup But whats a pardon worth without a seal
    Permit me in this transport of my joy   Kisses her hand

    Alcm Forbear I am offended with myself

    Putting him gently away with her hand

    That I have shewn this weaknessLet me go
    Where I may blush alone    Going and looking back on him
    But come not you
    Lest I should spoil you with excess of fondness
    And let you love again                     Exit ALCMENA

    Jup Forbidding me to follow she invites me
    This is the mould of which I made the sex
    I gave them but one tongue to say us nay
    And two kind eyes to grantBe sure that none
    Approach to interrupt our privacy              To MERC

                                Exit JUPITER after ALCMENA

MERCURY and PHDRA remain

Merc Your lady has made the challenge of reconciliation to my lord
heres a fair example for us two Phdra

Phd No example at all Sosia for my lady had the diamonds
beforehand and I have none of the gold goblet

Merc The goblet shall be forthcoming if thou wilt give me weight
for weight

Phd Yes and measure for measure too Sosia that is for a
thimblefull of gold a thimblefull of love

Merc What think you now Phdra Heres a weighty argument of love
for you

Pulling out the Goblet in a case from under his Cloak

Phd Now Jupiter of his mercy let me kiss thee O thou dear metal
Taking it in both hands

Merc And Venus of her mercy let me kiss thee dear dear Phdra

Phd Not so fast Sosia theres a damned proverb in your
wayMany things happen betwixt the cup and the lip you know

Merc Why thou wilt not cheat me of my goblet

Phd Yes as sure as you would cheat me of my maidenhead I am
yet but just even with you for the last trick you played me And
besides this is but a bare retaining fee you must give me another
before the cause is opened

Merc Shall I not come to your bedside tonight

Phd No nor tomorrow night neither but this shall be my
sweetheart in your place tis a better bedfellow and will keep me
warmer in cold weather

                                         Exit PHDRA

MERCURY alone

Merc Now whats the god of wit in a womans hand This very goblet
I stole from Gripus and he got it out of bribes too But this is the
common fate of illgotten goods that as they came in by covetousness
they go out by whoring

Enter AMPHITRYON

Oh heres Amphitryon again but Ill manage him above in the balcony

                                        Exit MERCURY

    Amph Not one of those I looked for to be found
    As some enchantment hid them from my sight
    Perhaps as Sosia says tis witchcraft all
    Seals may be opened diamonds may be stolen
    But how I came in person yesterday
    And gave that present to Alcmenas hands
    That which I never gave nor ever came
    O theres the rock on which my reason splits
    Would that were all I fear my honour too
    Ill try her once againshe may be mad
    A wretched remedy but all I have
    To keep me from despair

Merc From the Balcony aside This is no very charitable action
of a god to use him ill who has never offended me but my planet
disposes me to malice and when we great persons do but a little
mischief the world has a good bargain of us

Amph How now what means the locking up of my doors at this time of
day Knocks

Merc Softly friend softly you knock as loud and as saucily as
a lords footman that was sent before him to warn the family of his
honours visit Sure you think the doors have no feeling What the
devil are you that rap with such authority

Amph Look out and see tis I

Merc You what you

Amph No more I say but open

Merc Ill know to whom first

Amph I am one that can command the doors open

Merc Then you had best command them and try whether they will obey
you

Amph Dost thou not know me

Merc Prythee how should I know thee Dost thou take me for a
conjurer

Amph Whats this midsummermoon Is all the world gone a
maddingWhy Sosia

Merc Thats my name indeed didst thou think I had forgot it

Amph Dost thou see me

Merc Why dost thou pretend to go invisible If thou hast any
business here dispatch it quickly I have no leisure to throw away
upon such prattling companions

Amph Thy companion slave How darest thou use this insolent
language to thy master

Merc How Thou my master By what title I never had any other
master but Amphitryon

Amph Well and for whom dost thou take me

Merc For some rogue or other but what rogue I know not

Amph Dost thou not know me for Amphitryon slave

Merc How should I know thee when I see thou dost not know thyself
Thou Amphitryon In what tavern hast thou been and how many bottles
did thy business to metamorphose thee into my lord

Amph I will so drub thee for this insolence

Merc How now impudence are you threatening your betters I should
bring you to condign punishment but that I have a great respect for
the good wine though I find it in a fools noddle

Amph What none to let me in Why Phdra Bromia

Merc Peace fellow if my wife hears thee we are both undone At a
word Phdra and Bromia are very busy one in making a caudle for my
lady and the other in heating napkins to rub down my lord when he
rises from bed

Amph Amazement seizes me

Merc At what art thou amazed My master and my lady had a falling
out and are retired without seconds to decide the quarrel If thou
wert not a meddlesome fool thou wouldst not be thrusting thy nose into
other peoples matters Get thee about thy business if thou hast any
for Ill hear no more of thee

                         Exit MERCURY from above

    Amph Braved by my slave dishonoured by my wife
    To what a desperate plunge am I reduced
    If this be true the villain saysBut why
    That feeble if It must be true she owns it
    Now whether to conceal or blaze the affront
    One way I spread my infamy abroad
    And tother hide a burning coal within
    That preys upon my vitals I can fix
    On nothing but on vengeance

Enter SOSIA POLIDAS GRIPUS and TRANIO

Grip Yonder he is walking hastily to and fro before his door like
a citizen clapping his sides before his shop in a frosty morning tis
to catch a stomach I believe

Sos I begin to be afraid that he has more stomach to my sides
and shoulders than to his own victuals How he shakes his head and
stamps and what strides he fetches Hes in one of his damned moods
again I dont like the looks of him

Amph Oh my mannerly fairspoken obedient slave are you there I
can reach you now without climbing Now we shall try whos drunk and
whos sober

Sos Why this is as it should be I was somewhat suspicious that you
were in a pestilent humour Yes we will have a crash at the bottle
when your lordship pleases I have summoned them you see and they are
notable topers especially judge Gripus

Grip Yes faith I never refuse my glass in a good quarrel

Amph To SOS Why thou insolent villain Ill teach a slave how
to use his master thus

Sos Heres a fine business towards I am sure I ran as fast as ever
my legs could carry me to call them nay you may trust my diligence
in all affairs belonging to the belly

Grip He has been very faithful to his commission Ill bear him
witness

Amph How can you be witness where you were not presentThe
balcony sirrah the balcony

Sos Why to my best remembrance you never invited the balcony

Amph What nonsense dost thou plead for an excuse of thy foul
language and thy base replies

Sos You fright a man out of his senses first and blame him
afterwards for talking nonsense But it is better for me to talk
nonsense than for some to do nonsense I will say that whateer comes
ont Pray sir let all things be done decently what I hope when a
man is to be hanged he is not trussed upon the gallows like a dumb
dog without telling him wherefore

Amph By your pardon gentlemen I have no longer patience to forbear
him

Sos Justice justiceMy Lord Gripus as you are a true magistrate
protect me Heres a process of beating going forward without sentence
given

Grip My Lord Amphitryon this must not be let me first understand
the demerits of the criminal

Sos Hold you to that point I beseech your honour as you
commiserate the case of a poor innocent malefactor

Amph To shut the door against me in my very face to deny me
entrance to brave me from the balcony to laugh at me to threaten
me what proofs of innocence call you these but if I punish not this
insolence

    Is going to beat him and is held by POLIDAS
     and TRANIO

I beg you let me go

Sos I charge you in the kings name hold him fast for you see
hes bloodily disposed

Grip Now what hast thou to say for thyself Sosia

Sos I say in the first place be sure you hold him gentlemen for
I shall never plead worth one farthing while I am bodily afraid

Pol Speak boldly I warrant thee

Sos Then if I may speak boldly under my lords favour I do not
say he lies neither no I am too well bred for that but his lordship
fibs most abominably

Amph Do you hear his impudence yet will you let me go

Sos No impudence at all my lord for how could I naturally
speaking be in the balcony and affronting you when at the same time
I was in every street of Thebes inviting these gentlemen to dinner

Grip Hold a littleHow long since was it that he spoke to you from
the said balcony

Amph Just now not a minute before he brought you hither

Sos Now speak my witnesses

Grip I can answer for him for this last half hour

Pol And I

Tran And I

Sos Now judge equitably gentlemen whether I was not a civil
wellbred person to tell my lord he fibs only

Amph Who gave you that order to invite them

Sos He that best mightyourself By the same token you bid old
Bromia provide an twere for a god and I put in for a brace or a
leashno now I think ont it was for ten couple of gods to make
sure of plenty

Amph When did I give thee this pretended commission

Sos Why you gave me this pretended commission when you were just
ready to give my lady the fiddles and a dance in order as I suppose
to your second bedding

Amph Where in what place did I give this order

Sos Here in this place in the presence of this very door and of
that balcony and if they could speak they would both justify it

Amph O heaven These accidents are so surprising the more I think
of them the more I am lost in my imagination

Grip Nay he has told us some passages as he came along that seem
to surpass the power of nature

Sos What think you now my lord of a certain twinbrother of
mine called Sosia Tis a sly youth pray heaven you have not just
such another relation within doors called Amphitryon It may be it
was he that put upon me in your likeness and perhaps he may have
put something upon your lordship too that may weigh heavy upon the
forehead

Amph To those who hold him Let me go Sosia may be innocent and
I will not hurt him Open the door Ill resolve my doubts immediately

Sos The door is peremptory that it will not be opened without keys
and my brother on the inside is in possession and will not part with
them

Amph Then tis manifest that I am affrontedBreak open the door
there

Grip Stir not a man of you to his assistance

Amph Dost thou take part with my adulteress too because she is thy
niece

Grip I take part with nothing but the law and to break the doors
open is to break the law

Amph Do thou command them then

Grip I command nothing without my warrant and my clerk is not here
to take his fees for drawing it

Amph Aside The devil take all justicebrokers I curse him too
when I have been hunting him all over the town to be my witness But
Ill bring soldiers to force open the doors by my own commission
Exit AMPH

Sos Pox o these forms of law to defeat a man of a dinner when
hes sharp set Tis against the privilege of a freeborn stomach and
is no less than subversion of fundamentals JUPITER above in the
Balcony

Jup Oh my friends I am sorry I have made you wait so long you are
welcome and the door shall be opened to you immediately

                                      Exit JUPITER

Grip Was not that Amphitryon

Sos Why who should it be else

Grip In all appearance it was he but how got be thither

Pol In such a trice too

Tran And after he had just left us

Grip And so much altered for the better in his humour

Sos Heres such a company of foolish questions when a mans hungry
You had best stay dinner till he has proved himself to be Amphitryon
in form of law but Ill make short work of that business for Ill
take mine oath tis he

Grip I should be glad it were

Sos How glad it were with your damned interrogatories when you
ought to be thankful that so it is

Grip Aside That I may see my mistress Phdra and present her
with my great gold goblet

Sos If this be not the true Amphitryon I wish I may be kept without
doors fasting and biting my own fingers for want of victuals and
thats a dreadful imprecation I am for the inviting and eating and
treating Amphitryon I am sure tis he that is my lawfully begotten
lord and if you had an ounce of true justice in you you ought to
have laid hold on the other Amphitryon and committed him for a rogue
and an impostor and a vagabond The Door is opened

Merc From within Enter quickly masters The passage on the
right hand leads to the gallery where my lord expects you for I am
called another way

    GRIPUS TRANIO and POLIDAS go into the House

Sos I should know that voice by a secret instinct tis a tongue
of my family and belongs to my brother Sosia it must be so for it
carries a cudgelling kind of sound in itBut put the worst Let me
weigh this matter wisely Heres a beating and a bellyfull against
no beating and no bellyfull The beating is bad but the dinner is
good Now not to be beaten is but negatively good but not to fill
my belly is positively bad Upon the whole matter my final resolution
is to take the good and the bad as they come together

    Is entering MERCURY meets him at the Door

Merc Whither now ye kitchenscum From whence this impudence to
enter here without permission

Sos Most illustrious sir my ticket is my hunger Show the full
bowels of your compassion to the empty bowels of my famine

Merc Were you not charged to return no more Ill cut you into
quarters and hang you upon the shambles

Sos Youll get but little credit by me Alas sir I am but mere
carrion Brave Sosia compassionate coward Sosia and beat not thyself
in beating me

Merc Who gave you that privilege sirrah to assume my name have
you not been sufficiently warned of it and received part of punishment
already

Sos May it please you sir the name is big enough for both of us
and we may use it in common like a strumpet Witness heaven that I
would have obeyed you and quitted my title to the name but wherever
I come the malicious world will call me Sosia in spite of me I
am sensible there are two Amphitryons and why may there not be two
Sosias Let those two cut one anothers throats at their own pleasure
but you and I will be wiser by my consent and hold good intelligence
together

Merc No no two Sosias would but make two fools

Sos Then let me be the fool and be you the prudent person and
chuse for yourself some wiser name Or you shall be the eldest brother
and Ill be content to be the younger though I lose my inheritance

Merc I tell thee I am the only son of our family

Sos Ah Then let me be your bastard brother and the son of a whore
I hope thats but reasonable

Merc No thou shall not disgrace my father for there are few
bastards nowadays worth owning

Sos Ah poor Sosia what will become of thee

Merc Yet again profanely using my proper name

Sos I did not mean myself I was thinking of another Sosia a poor
fellow that was once of my acquaintance unfortunately banished out of
doors when dinner was just coming upon the table

Enter PHDRA

Phd Sosia you and I mustBless me what have we here a couple of
you or do I see double

Sos I would fain bring it about that I might make one of them but
hes unreasonable and will needs incorporate me and swallow me whole
into himself If he would be content to be but oneandahalf twould
never grieve me

Merc Tis a perverse rascal I kick him and cudgel him to no
purpose for still hes obstinate to stick to me and I can never beat
him out of my resemblance

Phd Which of you two is Sosia for tother must be the devil

Sos You had best ask him that has played the devil with my back and
sides

Merc You had best ask himwho gave you the gold goblet

Phd No thats already given but he shall be my Sosia that will
give me such another

Merc I find you have been interloping sirrah

Sos No indeed sir I only promised her a gold thimble which was
as much as comes to my proportion of being Sosia

Phd This is no Sosia for my money beat him away tother Sosia he
grows insufferable

Sos Aside Would I were valiant that I might beat him away and
succeed him at the dinner for a pragmatical son of a whore as he is

Merc Whats that you are muttering betwixt your teeth of a son of a
whore sirrah

Sos I am sure I meant you no offence for if I am not Sosia I am
the son of a whore for aught I know and if you are Sosia you may be
the son of a whore for aught you know

Merc Whatever I am I will be Sosia as long as I please and
whenever you visit me you shall be sure of the civility of the cudgel

Sos If you will promise to beat me into the house you may begin
when you please with me but to be beaten out of the house at
dinnertime flesh and blood can never bear it

     MERCURY beats him about and SOSIA is still making towards the
     Door but MERCURY gets betwixt and at length drives him off the
     Stage

Phd In the name of wonder what are you that are Sosia and are
not Sosia

Merc If thou wouldst know more of me my person is freely at thy
disposing

Phd Then I dispose of it to you again for tis so ugly tis not
for my use

Merc I can be ugly or handsome as I please go to bed old and
rise young I have so many suits of persons by me I can shift them
when I will

Phd You are a fool then to put on your worst clothes when you
come awooing

Merc Go to ask no more questions I am for thy turn for I know thy
heart and see all thou hast about thee

Phd Then you can see my backside too theres a bargain for you

Merc In thy right pocketlet me see three love letters from judge
Gripus written to the bottom on three sides full of fustian passion
and hearty nonsense as also in the same pocket a letter of thine
intended to him consisting of nine lines and a half scrawled and
false spelled to show thou art a woman and full of fraudulence and
equivocations and shoeinghorns of love to him to promise much and
mean nothing to show over and above that thou art a mere woman

Phd Is the devil in you to see all this Now for heavens sake
do not look in tother pocket

Merc Nay theres nothing there but a little godly prayerbook and
a bawdy lampoon and

Phd Giving a great frisk Look no farther I beseech you

Merc And a silver spoon

Phd Shrieking Ah

Merc Which you purloined last night from Bromia

Phd Keep my counsel or I am undone for ever

                       Holding up her hands to him

Merc No Ill mortify thee now I have an handle to thy iniquity if
thou wilt not love me

Phd Well if youll promise me to be secret I will love you
because indeed I dare do no other

Merc Tis a good girl I will be secret and further I will be
assisting to thee in thy filching for thou and I were born under the
same planet

Phd And we shall come to the same end too Im afraid

Merc No no since thou hast wit enough already to cozen a judge
thou needst never fear hanging

Phd And will you make yourself a younger man and be handsome too
and rich for you that know hearts must needs know that I shall
never be constant to such an ugly old Sosia

Merc Thou shalt know more of that another time in the mean while
here is a cast of my office for thee

     He stamps upon the ground some Dancers come from underground
     and others from the sides of the Stage a Song and a fantastic
     Dance


MERCURYS SONG TO PHDRA

    Fair Iris I love and hourly I die
    But not for a lip nor a languishing eye
    Shes fickle and false and there we agree
    For I am as false and as fickle as she
    We neither believe what either can say
    And neither believing we neither betray

    Tis civil to swear and say things of course
    We mean not the taking for better for worse
    When present we love when absent agree
    I think not of Iris nor Iris of me
    The legend of love no couple can find
    So easy to part or so equally joined

After the Dance

Phd This power of yours makes me suspect you for little better than
a god but if you are one for more certainty tell me what I am just
now thinking

Merc Why thou art thinkinglet me see for thou art a woman and
your minds are so variable that it is very hard even for a god to
know thembut to satisfy thee thou art wishing now for the same
power I have exercised that thou mightst stamp like me and have more
singers come up for another song

Phd Gad I think the devils in you Then I do stamp in somebodys
name but I know not whose Stamps Come up gentlefolks from
below and sing me a pastoral dialogue where the woman may have the
better of the man as we always have in lovematters New Singers
come up and sing a Song


A PASTORAL DIALOGUE BETWIXT THYRSIS AND IRIS

    Thyrsis Fair Iris and her swain
      Were in a shady bower
    Where Thyrsis long in vain
      Had sought the shepherds hour
    At length his hand advancing upon her snowy breast
      He said O kiss me longer
      And longer yet and longer
                      If you will make me blest

    Iris An easy yielding maid
      By trusting is undone
    Our sex is oft betrayd
      By granting love too soon
    If you desire to gain me your sufferings to redress
      Prepare to love me longer
      And longer yet and longer
                      Before you shall possess

    Thyrsis The little care you show
      Of all my sorrows past
    Makes death appear too slow
      And life too long to last
    Fair Iris kiss me kindly in pity of my fate
      And kindly still and kindly
                            Before it be too late

    Iris You fondly court your bliss
      And no advances make
    Tis not for maids to kiss
      But tis for men to take
    So you may kiss me kindly and I will not rebel
      And kindly still and kindly
                        But kiss me not and tell


A RONDEAU

    Chorus Thus at the height we love and live
      And fear not to be poor
    We give and give and give and give
      Till we can give no more
    But what today will take away
      Tomorrow will restore
    Thus at the height we love and live
      And fear not to be poor

Phd Adieu I leave you to pay the music Hope well
Mr Planet there is a better heaven in store for you
I say no more but you can guess

    Merc alone Such bargainloves as I with Phdra treat
    Are all the leagues and friendships of the great
    All seek their ends and each would other cheat
    They only seem to hate and seem to love
    But interest is the point on which they move
    Their friends are foes and foes are friends again
    And in their turns are knaves and honest men
    Our iron age is grown an age of gold
    Tis who bids most for all men will be sold       Exit




ACT V SCENE I


Enter GRIPUS and PHDRA GRIPUS has the Goblet in his hand

Phd You will not be so base to take it from me

Grip Tis my proper chattel and Ill seize my own in whatever
hands I find it

Phd You know I only showed it you to provoke your generosity that
you might outbid your rival with a better present

Grip My rival is a thief and Ill indite you for a receiver of
stolen goods

Phd Thou hidebound lover

Grip Thou very mercenary mistress

Phd Thou most mercenary magistrate

Grip Thou seller of thyself

Phd Thou seller of other people thou weathercock of government
that when the wind blows for the subject pointest to privilege and
when it changes for the sovereign veerest to prerogative

Grip Will you compound and take it as my present

Phd No but Ill send thy rival to force it from thee

Grip When a thief is rival to his judge the hangman will soon
decide the difference

                                       Exit PHDRA

Enter MERCURY with two Swords

Merc Bowing Save your good lordship

Grip From an impertinent coxcomb I am out of humour and am in
haste leave me

Merc Tis my duty to attend on your lordship and to ease you of
that undecent burden

Grip Gold was never any burden to one of my profession

Merc By your lordships permission Phdra has sent me to take it
from you

Grip What by violence

Merc still bowing No but by your honours permission I am
to restore it to her and persuade your lordship to renounce your
pretensions to her

Grip Tell her flatly I will neither do one nor tother

Merc O my good lord I dare pass my word for your free consent to
bothWill your honour be pleased to take your choice of one of
these

Grip Why these are swords what have I to do with them

Merc Only to take your choice of one of them which your lordship
pleases and leave the other to your most obedient servant

Grip What one of these ungodly weapons Take notice Ill lay you
by the heels sirrah this has the appearance of an unlawful bloody
challenge

Merc You magistrates are pleased to call it so my lord but with
us swordmen it is an honourable invitation to the cutting of one
anothers throats

Grip Be answered I have no throat to cut The law shall decide our
controversy

Merc By your permission my lord it must be dispatched this way

Grip Ill see thee hanged before I give thee any such permission to
dispatch me into another world

Merc At the least my lord you have no occasion to complain of
my want of respect to you You will neither restore the goblet nor
renounce Phdra I offer you the combat you refuse it all this is
done in the forms of honour It follows that I am to affront cudgel
you or kick you at my own arbitrement and I suppose you are too
honourable not to approve of my proceeding

Grip Here is a new sort of process that was never heard of in any
of our courts

Merc This my good lord is law in shorthand without your long
preambles and tedious repetitions that signify nothing but to squeeze
the subject therefore with your lordships favour I begin

    Fillips him under the chin

Grip What is this for

Merc To give you an occasion of returning me a box o the ear that
so all things may proceed methodically

Grip I put in no answer but suffer a nonsuit

Merc No my lord for the costs and charges are to be paid will you
please to restore the cup

Grip I told thee no

Merc Then from your chin I must ascend to your lordships ears

Grip Oh oh oh ohWilt thou never leave lugging me by the ears

Merc Not till your lordship will be pleased to hear
reason Pulling again

Grip Take the cup and the devil give thee joy ont

Merc Still holding him And your lordship will farther be
graciously pleased to release all claims titles and actions
whatsoever to Phdra you must give me leave to add one small
memento for that too Pulling him again

Grip I renounce her I release her

Enter PHDRA

Merc To her Phdra my lord has been pleased to be very
gracious without pushing matters to extremity

Phd I overheard it all but give me livery and seisin of the
goblet in the first place

Merc There is an act of oblivion should be passed too

Phd Let him begin to remember quarrels when he dares now I have
him under my girdle Ill cap verses with him to the end of the chapter

Enter AMPHITRYON and Guards

Amph To GRIPUS At the last I have got possession without your
lordships warrantPhdra tell Alcmena I am here

Phd Ill carry no such lying message you are not here and you
cannot be here for to my knowledge you are above with my lady in
the chamber

Amph All of a piece and all witchcraftAnswer me precisely dost
thou not know me for Amphitryon

Phd Answer me first did you give me a diamond and a purse of gold

Amph Thou knowest I did not

Phd Then by the same token I know you are not the true
Amphitryon if you are he I am sure I left you in bed with your own
wife Now you had best stretch out a leg and feel about for a fair
lady

Amph Ill undo this enchantment with my sword and kill the
sorcererCome up gentlemen and follow me To the Guards

Phd Ill save you the labour and call him down to confront you if
you dare attend him Exit PHDRA

Merc Aside Now the spell is ended and Jupiter can enchant
no more or else Amphitryon had not entered so easily GRIPUS is
stealing offWhither now Gripus I have business for you if you
offer to stir you know what follows

Enter JUPITER followed by TRANIO and POLIDAS

    Jup Who dares to play the master in my house
    What noise is this that calls me from above
    Invades my soft recess and privacy
    And like a tide breaks in upon my love

    Amph O heavens whats this I see

    Tran What prodigy

    Pol How two Amphitryons

    Grip I have beheld the appearance of two suns
    But still the false was dimmer than the true
    Here both shine out alike

    Amph This is a sight that like the gorgons head
    Runs through my limbs and stiffens me to stone
    I need no more inquire into my fate
    For what I see resolves my doubts too plain

    Tran Two drops of water cannot be more like

    Pol They are two very sames

Merc Our Jupiter is a great comedian he counterfeits most
admirably sure his priests have copied their hypocrisy from their
master Aside

    Amph Now I am gathered back into myself
    My heart beats high and pushes out the blood
                                           Drawing his sword
    To give me just revenge on this impostor
    If you are brave assist menot one stirs
                                               To the Guards
    What are all bribed to take the enchanters part
    Tis true the work is mine and thus

     Going to rush upon JUPITER and is held by TRANIO and
     POLIDAS

    Pol It must not be

    Jup Give him his way I dare the madmans worst
    But still take notice that it looks not like
    The true Amphitryon to fly out at first
    To brutal force it shews he doubts his cause
    Who dares not trust his reason to defend it

    Amph Thou base usurper of my name and bed   Struggling

    No less than thy hearts blood can wash away
    The affronts I have sustained

    Tran We must not suffer
    So strange a duel as Amphitryon
    To fight against himself

    Pol Nor think we wrong you when we hold your hands
    We know our duty to our general
    We know the ties of friendship to our friend
    But who that friend or who that general is
    Without more certain proofs betwixt you two
    Is hard to be distinguished by our reason
    Impossible by sight

    Amph I know it and have satisfied myself
    I am the true Amphitryon

    Jup See again
    He shuns the certain proofs and dares not stand
    Impartial judgment and award of right
    But since Alcmenas honour is concerned
    Whom more than heaven and all the world I love
    This I propose as equal to us both
    Tranio and Polidas be you assistants
    The guards be ready to secure the impostor
    When once so proved for public punishment
    And Gripus be thou umpire of the cause

Amph I am content let him proceed to examination

Grip On whose side would you please that I should give the sentence
Aside to MERC

Merc Follow thy conscience for once but not to make a custom of
it neither nor to leave an evil precedent of uprightness to future
judges AsideTis a good thing to have a magistrate under
correction your old fornicating judge dares never give sentence
against him that knows his haunts

Pol Your lordship knows I was master of Amphitryons ship and
desire to know of him what passed in private betwixt us two at his
landing when he was just ready to engage the enemy

Grip Let the true Amphitryon answer first

Jup and Amph together My lord I told him

Grip Peace both of youTis a plain case they are both true
for they both speak together but for more certainty let the false
Amphitryon speak first

Merc Now they are both silent

Grip Then tis plain on the other side that they are both false
Amphitryons

Merc Which Amphitryon shall speak first

Grip Let the cholerick Amphitryon speak and let the peaceable hold
his peace

Amph To Polid You may remember that I whispered you not to
part from the stern one single moment

Polid You did so

Grip No more words then I proceed to sentence

Jup Twas I that whispered him and he may remember I gave him this
reason for it that if our men were beaten I might secure my own
retreat

Polid You did so

Grip Now again he is as true as the other

Tran You know I was paymaster what directions did
you give me the night before the battle

Grip To which of the yous art thou speaking

Merc It should be a double u but they have no such letter in their
tongue Aside

Amph I ordered you to take particular care of the great bag

Grip Why this is demonstration

Jup The bag that I recommended to you was of tygersskin and
marked Beta

Grip In sadness I think they are both jugglers here is nothing
and here is nothing and then hiccius doccius and they are both here
again

Tran You peaceable Amphitryon what money was there in that bag

Jup The sum in gross amounted just to fifty Attick talents

Tran To a farthing

Grip Paugh Obvious obvious

Amph Two thousand pieces of gold were tied up in a handkerchief by
themselves

Tran I remember it

Grip Then it is dubious again

Jup But the rest was not all silver for there were just four
thousand brass halfpence

Grip Being but brass the proof is inconsiderable if they had been
silver it had gone on your side

Amph Death and hell you will not persuade me that I did not kill
Pterelas To JUPITER

Jup Nor you me that I did not enjoy Alcmena

    Amph That last was poison to me            Aside
    Yet theres one proof thou canst not counterfeit
    In killing Pterelas I had a wound
    Full in the brawny part of my right arm
    Where still the scar remainsnow blush impostor
    For this thou canst not show
      Bares his arm and shows the scar which they all look on

Omnes This is the true Amphitryon

Jup May your lordship please

Grip No sirrah it does not please me hold your tongue I charge
you for the case is manifest

Jup By your favour then this shall speak for me

    Bares his arm and shows it

Tran Tis just in the same muscle

Polid Of the same length and breadth and the scar of the same
blueish colour

Grip To Jup Did not I charge you not to speak twas plain
enough before and now you have puzzled it again

Amph Good gods how can this be

Grip For certain there was but one Pterelas and he must have been
in the plot against himself too for he was killed first by one of
them and then rose again out of respect to the other Amphitryon to be
killed twice over

Enter ALCMENA PHDRA and BROMIA

    Alcm No more of this it sounds impossible

    Turning to PHDRA and BROMIA

    That two should be so like no difference found

    Phd Youll find it true

    Alcm Then wheres Alcmenas honour and her fame
    Farewell my needless fear it cannot be
    This is a case too nice for vulgar sight
    But let me come my heart will guide my eyes
    To point and tremble to its proper choice

                          Seeing AMPHITRYON goes to him

    There neither was nor is but one Amphitryon
    And I am only his
                                Goes to take him by the hand

    Amph Away adultress
                                   Pushing her away from him

    Jup My gentle love my treasure and my joy
    Follow no more that false and foolish fire
    That would mislead thy fame to sure destruction
    Look on thy better husband and thy friend
    Who will not leave thee liable to scorn
    But vindicate thy honour from that wretch
    Who would by base aspersions blot thy virtue

    Alcm Going to him who embraces her
    I was indeed mistaken thou art he
    Thy words thy thoughts thy soul is all Amphitryon
    The impostor has thy features not thy mind
    The face might have deceived me in my choice
    Thy kindness is a guide that cannot err

    Amph What in my presence to prefer the villain
    O execrable cheatI break the truce
    And will no more attend your vain decisions
    To this and to the gods Ill trust my cause
                Is rushing upon JUPITER and is held again

    Jup Poor man how I contemn those idle threats
    Were I disposed thou mightst as safely meet
    The thunder launched from the red arm of JoveNor
    Jove need blush to be Alcmenas champion
    But in the face of Thebes she shall be cleared
    And what I am and what thou art be known
    Attend and I will bring convincing proofs

    Amph Thou wouldst elude my justice and escape
    But I will follow thee through earth and seas
    Nor hell shall hide thee from my just revenge

    Jup Ill spare thy pains It shall be quickly seen
    Betwixt us two who seeks and who avoids
    Come in my friendsand thou who seemst Amphitryon
    That all who are in doubt may know the true

     JUPITER reenters the house with him AMPHITRYON ALCMENA
     POLIDAS TRANIO and Guards

    Merc Thou Gripus and you Bromia stay with Phdra
                    To GRIPUS and BROMIA
                     who are following
    Let their affairs alone and mind we ours
    Amphitryons rival shall appear a god
    But know beforehand I am Mercury
    Who want not heaven while Phdra is on earth

Brom But ant please your lordship is my fellow Phdra to be
exalted into the heavens and made a star

Phd When that comes to pass if you look up anights I shall
remember old kindness and vouchsafe to twinkle on you

     Enter SOSIA peeping about him and seeing MERCURY is
     starting back

Sos Here he is again and theres no passing by him into the house
unless I were a sprite to glide in through the keyhole I am to be a
vagabond I find

Merc Sosia come back

Sos No I thank you you may whistle me long enough a beaten dog
has always the wit to avoid his master

Merc I permit thee to be Sosia again

Sos Tis an unfortunate name and I abandon it he that has an itch
to be beaten let him take it up for SosiaWhat have I said now I
mean for me for I neither am nor will be Sosia

Merc But thou mayst be so in safety for I have acknowledged myself
to be god Mercury

Sos You may be a god for aught I know but the devil take me if
ever I worship you for an unmerciful deity as you are

Merc You ought to take it for an honour to be drubbed by the hand of
a divinity

Sos I am your most humble servant good Mr God but by the faith of
a mortal I could well have spared the honour that you did me But how
shall I be sure that you will never assume my shape again

Merc Because I am weary of wearing so villainous an outside

Sos Well well as villainous as it is heres old Bromia will be
contented with it

Brom Yes now I am sure that I may chastise you safely and that
theres no god lurking under your appearance

Sos Ay but you had best take heed how you attempt it for as
Mercury has turned himself into me so I may take the toy into my head
and turn myself into Mercury that I may swinge you off condignly

Merc In the mean time be all my witnesses that I take Phdra for
my wife of the left hand that is in the nature of a lawful concubine

Phd You shall pardon me for believing you for all you are a god
for you have a terrible ill name below and I am afraid youll get a
footman instead of a priest to marry us

Merc But heres Gripus shall draw up articles betwixt us

Phd But hes damnably used to false conveyancing Well be it so
for my counsel shall overlook them before I signCome on Gripus
that I may have him under black and white

Here GRIPUS gets ready pen ink and paper

Merc With all my heart that I may have thee under black and white
hereafter

Phd To GRIPUS Begin beginHeads of articles to be made c
betwixt Mercury god of thieves

Merc And Phdra queen of gypsiesImprimis I promise to buy
and settle upon her an estate containing nine thousand acres of land
in any part of Boeotia to her own liking

Phd Provided always that no part of the said nine thousand acres
shall be upon or adjoining to Mount Parnassus for I will not be
fobbed off with a poetical estate

Merc Memorandum that she be always constant to me and admit of no
other lover

Phd Memorandum unless it be a lover that offers more and that the
constancy shall not exceed the settlement

Merc Item that she shall keep no male servants in her house
Item no rival lapdog for a bedfellow Item that she shall never
pray to any of the gods

Phd What would you have me an atheist

Merc No devotion to any hedeity good Phdra

Brom Heres no provision made for children yet

Phd Well remembered Bromia I bargain that my eldest son shall be
a hero and my eldest daughter a kings mistress

Merc That is to say a blockhead and a harlot Phdra

Phd Thats true but who dares call them so Then for the younger
childrenBut now I think ont well have no more but Mass and Miss
for the rest would be but chargeable and a burden to the nation

Merc Yes yes the second shall be a false prophet he shall have
wit enough to set up a new religion and too much wit to die a martyr
for it

Phd O what had I forgot theres pinmoney and alimony and
separate maintenance and a thousand things more to be considered that
are all to be tacked to this act of settlement

Sos I am a fool I must confess but yet I can see as far into a
millstone as the best of you I have observed that you womenwits
are commonly so quick upon the scent that you often overrun it
now I would ask of Madam Phdra that in case Mr Heaven there should
be pleased to break these articles in what court of judicature she
intends to sue him

Phd The fool has hit upontGods and great men are never to be
sued for they can always plead privilege of peerage and therefore
for once monsieur Ill take your word for as long as you love me
youll be sure to keep it and in the mean time I shall be gaining
experience how to manage some rich cully for no woman ever made her
fortune by a wit

     It thunders and the company within doors AMPHITRYON ALCMENA
     POLIDAS and TRANIO all come running out and join with the
     rest who were on the stage before

    Amph Sure tis some god he vanished from our sight
    And told us we should see him soon return

    Alcm I know not what to hope nor what to fear
    A simple error is a real crime
    And unconsenting innocence is lost

A second peal of Thunder After which JUPITER appears in a Machine

    Jup Look up Amphitryon and behold above
    The impostor god the rival of thy love
    In thy own shape see Jupiter appear
    And let that sight secure thy jealous fear
    Disgrace and infamy are turned to boast
    No fame in Joves concurrence can be lost
    What he enjoys he sanctifies from vice
    And by partaking stamps into a price
    Tis I who ought to murmur at my fate
    Forced by my love my godhead to translate
    When on no other terms I could possess
    But by thy form thy features and thy dress
    To thee were given the blessings that I sought
    Which else not all the bribes of heaven had bought
    Then take into thy arms thy envied love
    And in his own despite triumph oer Jove

Merc Amphitryon and Alcmena both stand mute and know not how to
take it Aside

Sos Our sovereign lord Jupiter is a sly companion he knows how to
gild a bitter pill Aside

    Jup From this auspicious night shall rise an heir
    Great like his sire and like his mother fair
    Wrongs to redress and tyrants to disseize
    Born for a world that wants a Hercules
    Monsters and monstermen he shall engage
    And toil and struggle through an impious age
    Peace to his labours shall at length succeed        
    And murmuring men unwilling to be freed            
    Shall be compelled to happiness by need            
                           JUPITER is carried back to Heaven

Omnes We all congratulate Amphitryon

Merc Keep your congratulations to yourselves gentlemen Tis a nice
point let me tell you that and the less thats said of it the better
Upon the whole matter if Amphitryon takes the favour of Jupiter in
patience as from a god hes a good heathen

Sos I must take a little extraordinary pains tonight that my
spouse may come even with her lady and produce a squire to attend on
young Hercules when he goes out to seek adventures that when his
master kills a man he may stand ready to pick his pockets and piously
relieve his aged parentsAh Bromia Bromia if thou hadst been as
handsome and as young as PhdraI say no more but somebody might
have made his fortunes as well as his master and never the worse man
neither

    For let the wicked world say what they please
    The fair wife makes her husband live at ease
    The lover keeps him too and but receives
    Like Jove the remnants that Amphitryon leaves
    Tis true the lady has enough in store
    To satisfy those two and eke two more
    In fine the man who weighs the matter fully
    Would rather be the cuckold than the cully     Exeunt




EPILOGUE

SPOKEN BY PHDRA


    Im thinking and it almost makes me mad
    How sweet a time those heathen ladies had
    Idolatry was even their Gods own trade
    They worshipped the fine creatures they had made
    Cupid was chief of all the deities
    And love was all the fashion in the skies
    When the sweet nymph held up the lily hand
    Jove was her humble servant at command
    The treasury of heaven was neer so bare
    But still there was a pension for the fair
    In all his reign adultery was no sin
    For Jove the good example did begin
    Mark too when he usurped the husbands name
    How civilly he saved the ladys fame
    The secret joys of love he wisely hid
    But you sirs boast of more than eer you did
    You teaze your cuckolds to their face torment em
    But Jove gave his new honours to content him
    And in the kind remembrance of the fair
    On each exalted son bestowed a star
    For these good deeds as by the date appears
    His godship flourished full two thousand years
    At last when he and all his priests grew old  
    The ladies grew in their devotion cold         
    And that false worship would no longer hold    
    Severity of life did next begin
    And always does when we no more can sin
    That doctrine too so hard in practice lies
    That the next age may see another rise
    Then pagan gods may once again succeed        
    And Jove or Mars be ready at our need       
    To get young godlings and so mend our breed

KING ARTHUR


The Seventeenth century was still familiar with

      Whateer resounds
    In fable or romance of Uthers son
    Begirt with British and Armoric knights

Fired by the splendid fictions which romancers had raised on the
basis of Geoffrey of Monmouth and the Welsh traditions Milton had
designed the exploits of King Arthur for the subject of his lofty epic
strain What we have lost in his abandoning the theme can only be
estimated by the enthusiastic tone into which he always swells when
he touches upon the shores of old romance The sublime glow of his
imagination which delighted in painting what was beyond the reach
of human experience the dignity of his language formed to express
the sentiments of heroes and of immortals his powers of describing
alike the beautiful and terrible above all the justice with which
he conceived and assigned to each supernatural agent a character as
decidedly peculiar as lesser poets have given to their human actors
would have sent him forth to encounter such a subject with gigantic
might Whoever has ventured undeterred by their magnitude upon the
old romances of Lancelot du Lac Sir Tristrem and others founded
on the achievements of the Knights of the Round Table cannot but
remember a thousand striking Gothic incidents worthy subjects of the
pen of Milton What would he not have made of the adventure of the
Ruinous Chapel the Perilous Manor the Forbidden Seat the Dolorous
Wound and many others susceptible of being described in the most
sublime poetry Even when that sun had set Arthur had yet another
chance for immortality for Dryden repeatedly expressed his intention
to found an epic poem upon his history Our poet it may be guessed
was too much in the trammels of French criticism to have ventured
upon a style of composition allied to the Gothic romance His poem
would probably have been formed upon the model of the ancients which
although more classical and correct might have wanted the force
which reality of painting and description never fails to give to epic
narrative Arthur in such a poem would like Rinaldo have reminded
us of Achilles and the sameness of a copy would have been substituted
for the spirit of a characteristic original But had Dryden executed
his intended plan we should have found picturesque narrative
detailed in the most manly and majestic verse and interspersed with
lessons teaching us to know human life maxims proper to guide it
and sentiments which ought to adorn it In the Knights Tale and in
Drydens other narrative poems we see enough to induce us to regret
the sordid negligence or avarice which withheld from him the means
of decent support while employed upon the promised task But Arthur
as a sort of counterpoise to his extravagant reputation during the
middle ages was doomed in the seventeenth century to be reluctantly
abandoned by Milton and Dryden and to be celebrated by the pen of
Blackmore

It is probable that when Dryden abandoned all thoughts of a larger
work he adapted the intended subject to the following opera and
converted the Genii of the kingdoms by whom the supernatural
machinery of the epic was to have been conducted into the lighter and
simpler device of airy and earthy spirits whose idea the Rosicrucian
philosophy had long rendered popular and familiar There is no attempt
to avail himself of any fragments of Arthurs romantic renown He
is not in this drama the formidable possessor of Excalibar and
the superior of the chivalry of the Round Table nor is Merlin the
fiendborn necromancer of whom antiquity related and believed so
many wonders They are the prince and magician of a beautiful fairy
tale the story of which abstracted from the poetry might have been
written by Madame DAunois At the same time the obvious advantages of
an appeal to the ancient prejudices which our author has neglected
are supplied from the funds of his own genius The incidents being
intended more for the purpose of displaying machinery and introducing
music and dances than with any reference to the rules of the drama
are abundantly fantastic and extravagant but the poet has supported
them with wonderful address The blindness of Emmeline and the
innocence with which she expresses her conception of visible objects
gives her character an interest often wanting in what may be called the
heroine of a play whose perfections generally raise her so far beyond
mere mortal excellence as to render superfluous all human sympathy
The scene in which Emmeline recovers her sight when well represented
never fails to excite the most pleasing testimony of interest and
applause The machinery is simple and well managed the language and
ministry of Grimbald the fierce earthy dmon are painted with some
touches which arise even to sublimity The conception of Philidel a
fallen angel retaining some of the hue of heaven who is touched with
repentance and not without hope of being finally received is an idea
so far as I know altogether original Klopstock has since introduced
a similar character into sacred poetry The principal incident
in King Arthur is copied in almost every circumstance from the
adventures of Rinaldo in the haunted grove on Mount Olivet which
makes also the subject of an Italian opera

From what is mentioned in the authors preface we may conceive
the disadvantages under which King Arthur was finally brought
forward It was written originally for the conclusion of the reign
of Charles II and the political masque of Albion and Albanius was
often rehearsed before him as the prologue to King Arthur We may
therefore conclude that the piece as originally written had a
strong political tendency and probably abounded with these ingenious
parallels by which Dryden with dexterity far exceeding that of every
other writer could draw from remote or distant events a moral
directly applicable to those of his own time But the Revolution
while it ruined our authors prospects imposed a cautious restraint
upon his muse and therefore as he himself states he was obliged to
deprive his play of many beauties not to offend the present times or
displease a government by which he had hitherto been protected or at
least endured Thus our author was obliged to convert an ingenious
and probably highly poetical political drama into a mere fairy tale
as totally divested as possible of any meaning beyond extravagant
adventure How much the drama must have suffered in this transformation
is easy to judge from the spirit with which all Drydens political
pieces are composed and from recollecting with what reluctance he must
have gone through alterations that were to deprive the play of what
was intended to have been its principal merit This is the disadvantage
of which the poet had already complained

     How can he show his manhood when you bind him To box like boys
     with one hand tied behind him This is plain levelling of wit in
     which The poor has all the advantage not the rich

    The blockhead stands excused for want of sense
    And wits turn blockheads in their own defence

    Prologue to Amphitryon

Under all these disadvantages King Arthur was received with great
applause at its first appearance was often repeated and continues to
be occasionally represented being the only one of Drydens numerous
plays which has retained possession of the stage Some part of its
success was doubtless owing to the music of which Dr Burney gives the
following account in his History of Music

Of the music in King Arthur I shall say but little as it has
been lately revived well performed and printed If ever it could
with truth be said of a composer that he had devanc son siecle
Purcell is entitled to that praise as there are movements in many of
his works which a century has not injured particularly the duet in
King Arthur Two Daughters of this Aged Stream and Fairest Isle
all Isles excelling which contain not a single passage that the
best composers of the present times if it presented itself to their
imagination would reject vol iii p 

The dances which were composed by the famous Priest did not disgrace
the music and poetry and the company according to Downes were well
rewarded for the time and expence they had bestowed on King Arthur

This opera was acted and printed in

TO THE

MARQUIS OF HALIFAX

                                   


MY LORD

This poem was the last piece of service which I had the honour to do
for my gracious master King Charles II and though he lived not to
see the performance of it on the stage yet the Prologue to it which
was the opera of Albion and Albanius was often practised before him
at Whitehall and encouraged by his royal approbation It was indeed
a time which was proper for triumph when he had overcome all those
difficulties which for some years had perplexed his peaceful reign
but when he had just restored his people to their senses and made
the latter end of his government of a piece with the happy beginning
of it he was on the sudden snatched away from the blessings and
acclamations of his subjects who arrived so late to the knowledge of
him that they had but just time enough to desire him longer before
they were to part with him for ever Peace be with the ashes of so
good a king Let his human frailties be forgotten and his clemency
and moderation the inherent virtues of his family be remembered with
a grateful veneration by three kingdoms through which he spread the
blessings of them And as your lordship held a principal place in his
esteem and perhaps the first in his affection during his latter
troubles the success which accompanied those prudent counsels cannot
but reflect an honour on those few who managed them and wrought out
by their faithfulness and diligence the public safety I might dilate
on the difficulties which attended that undertaking the temper of
the people the power arts and interest of the contrary party but
those are all of them invidious topicsthey are too green in our
remembrance and he who touches on them Incedit per ignes suppositos
cineri doleso But without reproaching one side to praise another I
may justly recommend to both those wholesome counsels which wisely
administered and as well executed were the means of preventing a
civil war and of extinguishing a growing fire which was just ready
to have broken forth among us So many wives who have yet their
husbands in their arms so many parents who have not the number of
their children lessened so many villages towns and cities whose
inhabitants are not decreased their property violated or their wealth
diminishedare yet owing to the sober conduct and happy results of
your advice If a true account may be expected by future ages from the
present your lordship will be delivered over to posterity in a fairer
character than I have given and be read not in the preface of a play
whose author is not vain enough to promise immortality to others or
to hope it for himself but in many pages of a chronicle filled with
praises of your administration For if writers be just to the memory
of King Charles II they cannot deny him to have been an exact knower
of mankind and a perfect distinguisher of their talents It is true
his necessities often forced him to vary his counsellors and councils
and sometimes to employ such persons in the management of his affairs
who were rather fit for his present purpose than satisfactory to his
judgment but where it was choice in him not compulsion he was master
of too much good sense to delight in heavy conversation and whatever
his favourites of state might be yet those of his affection were men
of wit He was easy with these and complied only with the former
But in the latter part of his life which certainly required to be most
cautiously managed his secret thoughts were communicated but to few
and those selected of that sort who were amici omnium horarum able
to advise him in a serious consult where his honour and safety were
concerned and afterwards capable of entertaining him with pleasant
discourse as well as profitable In this maturest part of his age
when he had been long seasoned with difficulties and dangers and was
grown to a niceness in his choice as being satisfied how few could
be trustedand of those who could be trusted how few could serve
himhe confined himself to a small number of bosom friends amongst
whom the world is much mistaken if your lordship was not first

If the rewards which you received for those services were only honours
it rather shewed the necessities of the times than any want of
kindness in your royal master and as the splendour of your fortune
stood not in need of being supported by the Crown so likewise in
being satisfied without other recompence you showed yourself to
be above a mercenary interest and strengthened that power which
bestowed those titles on you which truly speaking were marks of
acknowledgement more than favour

But as a skilful pilot will not be tempted out to sea in suspected
weather so have you wisely chosen to withdraw yourself from public
business when the face of heaven grew troubled and the frequent
shifting of the winds foreshewed a storm There are times and seasons
when the best patriots are willing to withdraw their hands from the
commonwealth as Phocion in his latter days was observed to decline
the management of affairs or as Cicero to draw the similitude more
home left the pulpit for Tusculum and the praise of oratory for the
sweet enjoyments of a private life and in the happiness of those
retirements has more obliged posterity by his moral precepts than he
did the republic in quelling the conspiracy of Catiline What prudent
man would not rather follow the example of his retreat than stay
like Cato with a stubborn unseasonable virtue to oppose the torrent
of the people and at last be driven from the marketplace by a riot
of a multitude uncapable of counsel and deaf to eloquence There
is likewise a portion of our lives which every wise man may justly
reserve to his own peculiar use and that without defrauding his native
country A Roman soldier was allowed to plead the merit of his services
for his dismission at such an age and there was but one exception to
that rule which was an invasion from the Gauls How far that may work
with your lordship I am not certain but I hope it is not coming to
the trial

In the mean time while the nation is secured from foreign attempts by
so powerful a fleet and we enjoy not only the happiness but even the
ornaments of peace in the divertisement of the town I humbly offer
you this trifle which if it succeed upon the stage is like to be the
chiefest entertainment of our ladies and gentlemen this summer When I
wrote it seven years ago I employed some reading about it to inform
myself out of Beda Bochartus and other authors concerning the rites
and customs of the heathen Saxons as I also used the little skill I
have in poetry to adorn it But not to offend the present times
nor a government which has hitherto protected me I have been obliged
so much to alter the first design and take away so many beauties from
the writing that it is now no more what it was formerly than the
present ship of the Royal Sovereign after so often taking down and
altering is the vessel it was at the first building There is nothing
better than what I intended but the music which has since arrived
to a greater perfection in England than ever formerly especially
passing through the artful hands of Mr Purcell who has composed it
with so great a genius that he has nothing to fear but an ignorant
illjudging audience But the numbers of poetry and vocal music are
sometimes so contrary that in many places I have been obliged to
cramp my verses and make them rugged to the reader that they may
be harmonious to the hearer of which I have no reason to repent me
because these sorts of entertainments are principally designed for
the ear and eye and therefore in reason my art on this occasion
ought to be subservient to his And besides I flatter myself with
an imagination that a judicious audience will easily distinguish
betwixt the songs wherein I have complied with him and those in which
I have followed the rules of poetry in the sound and cadence of the
words Notwithstanding all these disadvantages there is somewhat still
remaining of the first spirit with which I wrote it and though I can
only speak by guess of what pleased my first and best patroness the
Duchess of Monmouth in the reading yet I will venture my opinion by
the knowledge I have long had of her Graces excellent judgment and
true taste of poetry that the parts of the airy and earthy spirits
and that fairy kind of writing which depends only upon the force of
imagination were the grounds of her liking the poem and afterwards of
her recommending it to the Queen I have likewise had the satisfaction
to hear that her majesty has graciously been pleased to peruse the
manuscript of this opera and given it her royal approbation Poets
who subsist not but on the favour of sovereign princes and of great
persons may have leave to be a little vain and boast of their
patronage who encourage the genius that animates them and therefore
I will again presume to guess that her majesty was not displeased to
find in this poem the praises of her native country and the heroic
actions of so famous a predecessor in the government of Great Britain
as King Arthur

All this my lord I must confess looks with a kind of insinuation
that I present you with somewhat not unworthy your protection but
I may easily mistake the favour of her majesty for her judgment I
think I cannot be deceived in thus addressing to your lordship whom
I have had the honour to know at that distance which becomes me for
so many years It is true that formerly I have shadowed some part
of your virtues under another name but the character though short
and imperfect was so true that it broke through the fable and was
discovered by its native light What I pretend by this dedication
is an honour which I do myself to posterity by acquainting them that
I have been conversant with the first persons of the age in which I
lived and thereby perpetuate my prose when my verses may possibly be
forgotten or obscured by the fame of future poets Which ambition
amongst my other faults and imperfections be pleased to pardon in

    MY LORD

    Your Lordships most obedient servant

    JOHN DRYDEN

FOOTNOTES

Footnote  We have often occasion in these notes to mention the
Marquis of Halifax He was originally Sir George Saville Baronet
but being early characterized by unmatched dexterity in political
intrigue he successively attained the rank of Viscount Earl and in
 Marquis of Halifax He acted alternately for the people against
the Crown and for the Crown against the people for he delighted in
nice and delicate strokes of policy and in balancing by a slight but
wellapplied exertion the sinking against the rising faction Hence
he was accounted the head of the little faction called Trimmers and
hence his counsels became particularly acceptable to Charles II whose
administration he guided as Lord Privy Seal during the last years of
that monarchs life The king had no mind that the highflying tories
should attain an absolute predominance for he feared his brother
who had placed himself at their head and he loved Monmouth who
was the object of their most violent hatred Still less could he be
supposed to favour the whigs whose ranks contained many determined
republicans A minister therefore whose ingenious and versatile
councils could enable him to check the triumph of the tories without
too much encouraging the whigs was a treasure to himand just
such a minister was Halifax Our author therefore dedicates to him
with great propriety a piece written for Charles when Halifax was
his favourite minister and the subjects of eulogium are chosen with
Drydens usual felicity Some allowance must doubtless be made for
the indispensible obligation which compelled a dedicator to view the
conduct of his patron on the favourable side Such an unfortunate wight
cannot be reasonably tied down to uniformity of sentiment in different
addresses The character of Drydens immediate patron was always his
cue for praise if he stood forward against a predominant party he
was necessarily Cato the most virtuous of men if he yielded to the
torrent he was Phocion or Cicero and Cato was a fool to him With
the few grains of allowance which his situation required Drydens
praise of Halifax is an honest panegyric It is certain his wisdom
prevented a civil war in the last years of the reign of Charles and
indirectly led the way to a bloodless revolution The age in which
he lived was therefore so far indebted to him as our author has
elegantly said for the lives of husbands and of children for property
unviolated and wealth undiminished Nor does the present owe him
less for when is it that a government erected by a party successful
in civil dissention does not far exceed their just and even their
original pretensions The parties had each founded their plea and their
pretensions upon sacred and integral parts of the constitution as the
contending factions of the Jews occupied the one the temple and the
other the palace of Jerusalem In a civil war one bulwark or other
must have fallen with the party which it sheltered and it was only the
Revolution of  which leaving both whig and tory in full strength
compelled them mutually to respect the constitutional vantageground
assumed by each other

Footnote  Lord Halifax was unquestionably a man of wit and we have
some tolerable bon mots of his handed down by his contemporaries
Burnet says The liveliness of his imagination was always too hard
for his judgment A severe jest was preferred by him to all arguments
whatever and he was endless in consultations for when after much
discourse a point was settled if he could find a new jest to make
even that which was suggested by himself ridiculous he could not
hold but would study to raise the credit of his wit though it made
others call his judgment in question We may not perhaps refine
too far in supposing that the bishop was not always able to estimate
the policy of this subtle statesman It was more frequently his wish
to avoid taking decisive steps than to recommend them and what could
more effectually retard violent councils than the conduct remarked by
Burnet or what argument would have weighed with Charles II like a
keen jest

Footnote  The Roman veterans were dismissed after twenty years
service a regulation equally politic and humane In  a French
invasion in behalf of King James appeared not improbable

Footnote  We cannot trace the result of this study any where but
in the song of the Saxon priests and it did not surely require much
reading to glean up the names of the Saxon deities which are almost
the only traits of national manners exhibited through the drama

PROLOGUE

SPOKEN BY MR BETTERTON


    Sure theres a dearth of wit in this dull town
    When silly plays so savourily go down
    As when clipped money passes tis a sign
    A nation is not overstocked with coin
    Happy is he who in his own defence
    Can write just level to your humble sense
    Who higher than your pitch can never go
    And doubtless he must creep who writes below
    So have I seen in hall of knight or lord
    A weak arm throw on a long shovelboard
    He barely lays his piece bar rubs and knocks
    Secured by weakness not to reach the box
    A feeble poet will his business do                      
    Who straining all he can comes up to you              
    For if you like yourselves you like him too           
    An ape his own dear image will embrace
    An ugly beau adores a hatchet face
    So some of you on pure instinct of nature
    Are led by kind to admire your fellow creature
    In fear of which our house has sent this day
    To insure our newbuilt vessel called a play
    No sooner named than one cries outThese stagers
    Come in good time to make more work for wagers
    The town divides if it will take or no                 
    The courtiers bet the cits the merchants too          
    A sign they have but little else to do                  
    Bets at the first were fooltraps where the wise
    Like spiders lay in ambush for the flies
    But now theyre grown a common trade for all            
    And actions by the newbook rise and fall               
    Wits cheats and fops are free of wagerhall          
    One policy as far as Lyons carries
    Another nearer home sets up for Paris
    Our bets at last would even to Rome extend
    But that the pope has proved our trusty friend
    Indeed it were a bargain worth our money
    Could we insure another Ottoboni
    Among the rest there are a sharping set
    That pray for us and yet against us bet
    Sure heaven itself is at a loss to know
    If these would have their prayers be heard or no
    For in great stakes we piously suppose
    Men pray but very faintly they may lose
    Leave off these wagers for in conscience speaking
    The city needs not your new tricks for breaking
    And if you gallants lose to all appearing
    Youll want an equipage for volunteering
    While thus no spark of honour left within ye
    When you should draw the sword you draw the guinea

FOOTNOTES

Footnote  The ancient game of shovelboard was played by sliding
pieces of money along a smooth table something on the principle of
billiards The allusion seems to be the same as if a modern poet had
said that a feeble player at billiards runs no risk of pocketing his
own ball The reader will find a variety of passages concerning this
pastime in the notes of the various commentators upon a passage in the
Merry Wives of Windsor where Slender enumerates among the contents
of his pocket when picked by Pistol two Edward shovelboards that
is two broad shillings of Edward VI used for playing at this game In
some old halls the shovelboard table is still preserved and sometimes
used

Footnote  Cardinal Ottoboni a Venetian by birth succeeded to the
tiara on the death of Innocent XI and assumed the name of Alexander
VIII He was like his predecessor an enemy to France and maintained
the privileges of the Holy See both in the point of the regale and
in refusing to grant bulls to those French bishops who had signed the
formulary of  by which the Pope was declared fallible and subject
to the decrees of a general council His death took place during the
congress of  It was therefore a recent event when this play was
first represented and the disposition of his successor towards the
French or Imperial Courts was matter of anxious speculation to the
politicians of the day

    Are weighing now within the scales of Heaven

    Con In ten set battles have we driven back
    These heathen Saxons and regained our earth
    As earth recovers from an ebbing tide
    Her halfdrowned face and lifts it oer the waves
    From Severns bank even to this barren down
    Our foremost men have pressed their fainty rear
    And not one Saxon face has been beheld
    But all their backs and shoulders have been stuck
    With foul dishonest wounds now here indeed
    Because they have no farther ground they stand

    Aur Well have we chose a happy day for fight
    For every man in course of time has found
    Some days are lucky some unfortunate

    Alb But why this day more lucky than the rest

    Con Because this day
    Is sacred to the patron of our isle
    A christian and a soldiers annual feast

Alb Oh now I understand you This is St George of Cappadocias
day Well it may be so but faith I was ignorant We soldiers seldom
examine the rubrick and now and then a saint may happen to slip by us
but if he be a gentleman saint he will forgive us

Con Oswald undoubtedly will fight it bravely

Aur And it behoves him well tis his last stake But what manner of
man is this Oswald Have you ever seen him To ALBANACT

Alb Never but once and that was to my cost too I followed him too
close and to say the truth somewhat uncivilly upon a rout but he
turned upon me as quick and as round as a chafed boar and gave me two
licks across the face to put me in mind of my Christianity

Con I know him well hes free and openhearted

Aur His countrys character that speaks a German

    Con Revengeful rugged violently brave
    And once resolved is never to be moved

    Alb Yes hes a valiant dog pox on him

    Con This was the character he then maintained
    When in my court he sought my daughters love
    My fair blind Emmeline

Alb I cannot blame him for courting the heiress of Cornwall All
heiresses are beautiful and as blind as she is he would have had no
blind bargain of her

    Aur For that defeat in love he raised this war
    For royal Arthur reigned within her heart
    Ere Oswald moved his suit

    Con Ay now Aurelius you have named a man
    One whom besides the homage that I owe
    As Cornwalls duke to his imperial crown
    I would have chosen out from all mankind
    To be my sovereign lord

    Aur His worth divides him from the crowd of kings
    So born without desert to be so born
    Men set aloft to be the scourge of heaven
    And with long arms to lash the underworld

    Con Arthur is all thats excellent in Oswald
    And void of all his faults In battle brave
    But still serene in all the stormy war
    Like heaven above the clouds and after fight
    As merciful and kind to vanquished foes
    As a forgiving God But see hes here
    And praise is dumb before him

Enter King ARTHUR reading a letter with Attendants

    Arth Reading Go on auspicious prince the stars are kind
    Unfold thy banners to the willing wind
    While I with airy legions help thy arms
    Confronting art with art and charms with charms
    So Merlin writes nor can we doubt the event
                                         
    To CONON

    With Heaven and you to friends Oh noble Conon
    You taught my tender hands the trade of war
    And now again you helm your hoary head
    And under double weight of age and arms
    Assert your countrys freedom and my crown

    Con No more my son

    Arth Most happy in that name
    Your Emmeline to Oswalds vows refused
    You made my plighted bride
    Your charming daughter who like Love born blind
    Unaiming hits with surest archery
    And innocently kills

    Con Remember son
    You are a general other wars require you
    For see the Saxon gross begins to move

    Arth Their infantry embattled square and close
    March firmly on to fill the middle space
    Covered by their advancing cavalry
    By Heaven tis beauteous horror
    The noble Oswald has provoked my envy

Enter EMMELINE led by MATILDA

    Ha now my beauteous Emmeline appears
    A new but oh a softer flame inspires me
    Even rage and vengeance slumber at her sight

    Con Haste your farewell Ill cheer my troops and wait ye
                                                  Exit CONON

    Em O father father I am sure youre here
    Because I see your voice

    Arth No thou mistakst thy hearing for thy sight
    Hes gone my Emmeline
    And I but stay to gaze on those fair eyes
    Which cannot view the conquest they have made
    Oh starlike night dark only to thyself
    But full of glory as those lamps of heaven
    That see not when they shine

    Em What is this heaven and stars and night and day
    To which you thus compare my eyes and me
    I understand you when you say you love
    For when my father clasps my hand in his
    Thats cold and I can feel it hard and wrinkled
    But when you grasp it then I sigh and pant
    And something smarts and tickles at my heart

    Arth Oh artless love where the soul moves the tongue
    And only nature speaks what nature thinks
    Had she but eyes

    Em Just now you said I had
    I see them I have two

    Arth But neither see

    Em Im sure they hear you then
    What can your eyes do more

    Arth They view your beauties

    Em Do not I see You have a face like mine
    Two hands and two round pretty rising breasts
    That heave like mine

    Arth But you describe a woman
    Nor is it sight but touching with your hands

    Em Then tis my hand that sees and thats all one
    For is not seeing touching with your eyes

    Arth No for I see at distance where I touch not

    Em If you can see so far and yet not touch
    I fear you see my naked legs and feet
    Quite through my clothes Pray do not see so well

    Arth Fear not sweet innocence
    I view the lovely features of your face
    Your lips carnation your darkshaded eyebrows
    Black eyes and snowwhite forehead all the colours
    That make your beauty and produce my love

    Em Nay then you do not love on equal terms
    I love you dearly without all these helps
    I cannot see your lips carnation
    Your shaded eyebrows nor your milkwhite eyes

    Arth You still mistake

    Em Indeed I thought you had a nose and eyes
    And such a face as mine have not men faces

    Arth Oh none like yours so excellently fair

    Em Then would I had no face for I would be
    Just such a one as you

    Arth Alas tis vain to instruct your innocence
    You have no notion of light or colours
                                       Trumpet sounds within

    Em Why is not that a trumpet

    Arth Yes

    Em I knew it
    And I can tell you how the sound ont looks
    It looks as if it had an angry fighting face

    Arth Tis now indeed a sharp unpleasant sound
    Because it calls me hence from her I love
    To meet ten thousand foes

    Em How do so many men eer come to meet
    This devil trumpet vexes them and then
    They feel about for one anothers faces
    And so they meet and kill

    Arth Ill tell you all when we have gained the field
    One kiss of your fair hand the pledge of conquest
    And so a short farewell

     Kisses her Hand and Exit with AURELIUS ALBANACT and
     Attendants

    Em My heart and vows go with him to the fight
    May every foe be that which they call blind
    And none of all their swords have eyes to find him
    But lead me nearer to the trumpets face
    For that brave sound upholds my fainting heart
    And while I hear methinks I fight my part
                                        Exit led by MATILDA



     SCENE IIA Place of Heathen Worship The Three Saxon Gods
     WODEN THOR and FREYA placed on Pedestals An Altar

Enter OSWALD and OSMOND

    Osm Tis time to hasten our mysterious rites
    Because your army waits you

    Osw Thor Freya Woden all ye Saxon powers
                   Making three Bows before the three Images

    Hear and revenge my father Hengists death

    Osm Father of gods and men great Woden hear
    Mount thy hot courser drive amidst thy foes
    Lift high thy thundering arm let every blow
    Dash out a misbelieving Britons brains

    Osw Father of gods and men great Woden hear
    Give conquest to thy Saxon race and me

    Osm Thor Freya Woden hear and spell your Saxons
    With sacred Runick rhymes from death in battle
    Edge their bright swords and blunt the Britons darts
    No more great prince for see my trusty fiend
    Who all the night has winged the dusky air

GRINBALD a fierce earthy Spirit arises

    What news my Grimbald

    Grim I have played my part
    For I have steeled the fools that are to die
    Six fools so prodigal of life and soul
    That for their country they devote their lives
    A sacrifice to mother Earth and Woden


    Osm Tis well but are we sure of victory

    Grim Why askest thou me
    Inspect their entrails draw from thence thy guess
    Blood we must have without it we are dumb

    Osm Say wheres thy fellowservant Philidel
    Why comes not he

    Grim For hes a puling spirit
    Why didst thou chuse a tender airy form
    Unequal to the mighty work of mischief
    His make is flitting soft and yielding atoms
    He trembles at the yawning gulph of hell
    Nor dares approach the flame lest he should singe
    His gaudy silken wings
    He sighs when he should plunge a soul in sulphur
    As with compassion touched of foolish men

    Osm What a halfdevil is he
    His errand was to draw the lowland damps
    And noisome vapours from the foggy fens
    Then breathe the baleful stench with all his force
    Full on the faces of our christened foes

    Grim Accordingly he drained those marshy grounds
    And bagged them in a blue pestiferous cloud
    Which when he should have blown the frighted elf
    Espied the redcross banners of their host
    And said he durst not add to his damnation

    Osm Ill punish him at leisure
    Call in the victims to propitiate hell

    Grim Thats my kind master I shall breakfast on them

     GRIMBALD goes to the Door and reenters with six Saxons in
     White with Swords in their Hands They range themselves three
     and three in opposition to each other The rest of the Stage is
     filled with Priests and Singers

    Woden first to thee

    Vers The lot is cast and Tanfan pleased

    Chor Of mortal cares you shall be eased

    Vers  I call ye all
    To Wodens hall
    Your temples round
    With ivy bound
    In goblets crowned
    And plenteous bowls of burnished gold
    Where you shall laugh
    And dance and quaff
    The juice that makes the Britons bold
            The six Saxons are led off by the Priests in order
             to be sacrificed

    Osw Ambitious fools we are
    And yet ambition is a godlike fault
    Or rather tis no fault in souls born great
    Who dare extend their glory by their deeds
    Now Britany prepare to change thy state
    And from this day begin thy Saxon date
                                                       Exeunt

     A Battle supposed to be given behind the Scenes with Drums
     Trumpets and Military Shouts and Excursions after which the
     Britons expressing their joy for the Victory sing this Song of
     triumph

    Come if you dare our trumpets sound
    Come if you dare the foes rebound
    We come we come we come we come
    Says the double double double beat of the thundering drum

      Now they charge on amain
      Now they rally again
    The gods from above the mad labour behold
    And pity mankind that will perish for gold

    The fainting Saxons quit their ground
    Their trumpets languish in the sound
    They fly they fly they fly they fly
    Victoria Victoria the bold Britons cry

      Now the victorys won
      To the plunder we run
    We return to our lasses like fortunate traders
    Triumphant with spoils of the vanquished invaders
                                                        Exeunt




ACT II SCENE I


Enter PHILIDEL

    Phil Alas for pity of this bloody field
    Piteous it needs must be when I a spirit
    Can have so soft a sense of human woes
    Ah for so many souls as but this morn
    Were clothed with flesh and warmed with vital blood
    But naked now or shirted but with air

MERLIN with Spirits descends to PHILIDEL in a Chariot drawn by
Dragons

    Mer What art thou spirit of what name or order
    For I have viewed thee in my magic glass
    Making thy moan among the midnight wolves
    That bay the silent moon speak I conjure thee
    Tis Merlin bids thee at whose awful wand
    The pale ghost quivers and the grim fiend gasps

    Phil An airy shape the tenderest of my kind
    The last seduced and least deformed of hell
    Halfwhite and shuffled in the crowd I fell
    Desirous to repent and loth to sin
    Awkward in mischief piteous of mankind
    My name is Philidel my lot in air
    Where next beneath the moon and nearest heaven
    I soar and have a glimpse to be received
    For which the swarthy dmons envy me

    Mer Thy business here

    Phil To shun the Saxon wizards dire commands
    Osmond the awfullest name next thine below
    Cause I refused to hurl a noisome fog
    On christened heads the hue and cry of hell
    Is raised against me for a fugitive sprite

    Mer Osmond shall know a greater power protects thee
    But follow thou the whispers of thy soul
    That draw thee nearer heaven
    And as thy place is nearest to the sky
    The rays will reach thee first and bleach thy soot

    Phil In hope of that I spread my azure wings
    And wishing stillfor yet I dare not pray
    I bask in daylight and behold with joy
    My scum work outward and my rust wear off

    Mer Why tis my hopeful devil Now mark me Philidel
    I will employ thee for thy future good
    Thou knowst in spite of valiant Oswalds arms
    Or Osmonds powerful spells the field is ours

    Phil Oh master hasten
    Thy dread commands for Grimbald is at hand
    Osmonds fierce fiend I snuff his earthy scent
    The conquering Britons he misleads to rivers
    Or dreadful downfals of unheeded rocks
    Where many fall that neer shall rise again

    Mer Be that thy care to stand by falls of brooks
    And trembling bogs that bear a greensward show
    Warn off the bold pursuers from the chace
    No more they come and we divide the task
    But lest fierce Grimbalds ponderous bulk oppress
    Thy tender flitting air Ill leave my band
    Of spirits with united strength to aid thee
    And force with force repel

SCENE IIA Pavilion

Enter EMMELINE led by MATILDA

    Em No news of my dear love or of my father

    Mat None madam since the gaining of the battle
    Great Arthur is a royal conqueror now
    And well deserves your love

    Em But now I fear
    Hell be too great to love poor silly me
    If he be dead or never come again
    I mean to die But theres a greater doubt
    Since I neer saw him here
    How shall I meet him in another world

    Mat I have heard something how two bodies meet
    But how souls join I know not

    Em I should find him
    For surely I have seen him in my sleep
    And then methought he put his mouth to mine
    And eat a thousand kisses on my lips
    Sure by his kissing I could find him out
    Among a thousand angels in the sky

    Mat But what a kind of man do you suppose him

    Em He must be made of the most precious things
    And I believe his mouth and eyes and cheeks
    And nose and all his face are made of gold

    Mat Heaven bless us madam what a face you make him
    If it be yellow he must have the jaundice
    And thats a bad disease

    Em Why then do lovers give a thing so bad
    As gold to women whom so well they love

    Mat Because that bad thing gold buys all good things

    Em Yet I must know him better Of all colours
    Tell me which is the purest and the softest

    Mat They say tis black

    Em Why then since gold is hard and yet is precious
    His face must all be made of soft black gold

    Mat But madam

    Em No more I have learned enough for once

    Mat Here are a crew of Kentish lads and lasses
    Would entertain ye till your lords return
    With songs and dances to divert your cares

    Em O bring them in
    For though I cannot see the songs I love them
    And love they tell me is a dance of hearts

Enter Shepherds and Shepherdesses

 Shepherd sings

    How blest are shepherds how happy their lasses
      While drums and trumpets are sounding alarms
    Over our lowly sheds all the storm passes
      And when we die tis in each others arms
    All the day on our herds and flocks employing
    All the night on our flutes and in enjoying

    Chor All the day c

    Bright nymphs of Britain with graces attended
      Let not your days without pleasure expire
    Honours but empty and when youth is ended
      All men will praise you but none will desire
    Let not youth fly away without contenting
    Age will come time enough for your repenting

    Chor Let not youth c
       Here the Men offer their Flutes to the Women which they refuse

 Shepherdess

      Shepherd shepherd leave decoying
        Pipes are sweet a summers day
      But a little after toying
        Women have the shot to pay
      Here are marriagevows for signing
        Set their marks that cannot write
      After that without repining
        Play and welcome day and night
            Here the Women give the Men Contracts which they accept

    Chor    Come shepherds lead up a lively measure
    of all  The cares of wedlock are cares of pleasure
    But whether marriage bring joy or sorrow
    Make sure of this day and hang tomorrow

    Osw We are your guards

    Mat Ah me we are betrayed tis Oswalds voice

    Em Let them not see our voices and then they cannot find us

    Offi How sits the conquest on great Arthurs brow

    Alb As when the lover with the king is mixt
    He puts the gain of Britain in a scale
    Which weighing with the loss of Emmeline
    He thinks hes scarce a saver
                                               Trumpet within

    Offi Hark a trumpet

    Companions of a war with common interest
    Against the bordering Picts but times are changed

    Osw And I am sorry that those times are changed
    For else we now might meet on terms as friendly

    Arth If so we meet not now the faults your own
    For you have wronged me much

    Osw Oh you would tell me
    I called more Saxons in to enlarge my bounds
    If those be wrongs the war has well redressed ye

    Arth Mistake me not I count not war a wrong
    War is the trade of kings that fight for empire
    And better be a lion than a sheep

    Osw In what then have I wronged ye

    Arth In my love

    Osw Even loves an empire too the noble soul
    Like kings is covetous of single sway

    Arth I blame ye not for loving Emmeline
    But since the soul is free and love is choice
    You should have made a conquest of her mind
    And not have forced her person by a rape

    Osw Whether by force or stratagem we gain
    Still gaining is our end in war or love
    Her minds the jewel in her body locked
    If I would gain the gem and want the key
    It follows I must seize the cabinet
    But to secure your fear her honour is untouched

    Arth Was honour ever safe in brutal hands
    So safe are lambs within the lions paw
    Ungriped and played with till fierce hunger calls
    Then nature shews itself the closehid nails
    Are stretched and opened to the panting prey
    But if indeed you are so cold a lover

    Osw Not cold but honourable

    Arth Then restore her
    That done I shall believe you honourable

    Osw Thinkst thou I will forego a victors right

    Arth Say rather of an impious ravisher
    That castle were it walled with adamant
    Can hide thy head but till tomorrows dawn

    Osw And ere tomorrow I may be a god
    If Emmeline be kind but kind or cruel
    I tell thee Arthur but to see this day
    That heavenly face though not to have her mine
    I would give up a hundred years of life
    And bid fate cut tomorrow

    Arth It soon will come and thou repent too late
    Which to prevent Ill bribe thee to be honest
    Thy noble head accustomed to a crown
    Shall wear it still nor shall thy hand forget
    The scepters use from Medways pleasing stream
    To Severns roar be thine
    In short restore my love and share my kingdom

    Osw Not though you spread my sway from Thames to Tyber
    Such gifts might bribe a king but not a lover

    Arth Then prythee give me back my kingly word
    Passed for thy safe return and let this hour
    In single combat hand to hand decide
    The fate of empire and of Emmeline

    Osw Not that I fear do I decline this combat
    And not decline it neither but defer
    When Emmeline has been my prize as long
    As she was thine I dare thee to the duel

    Arth I named your utmost term of lifetomorrow

    Osw You are not fate

    Arth But fate is in this arm
    You might have made a merit of your theft

    Osw Ha theft your guards can tell I stole her not

    Arth Had I been present

    Osw Had you been present she had been mine more nobly

    Arth There lies your way

    Osw My way lies where I please
    Expect for Oswalds magic cannot fail
    A long tomorrow ere your arms prevail
    Or if I fall make room ye blessed above
    For one who was undone and died for love
                                   Exit OSWALD and his Party

    Arth There may be one black minute ere tomorrow
    For who can tell what power and lust and charms
    May do this nightTo arms with speed to arms
                                                        Exeunt




ACT III SCENE I


Enter ARTHUR CONON and AURELIUS

    Con Furl up our colours and unbrace our drums
    Dislodge betimes and quit this fatal coast

    Arth Have we forgot to conquer

    Aur Cast off hope
    The embattled legions of fire air and earth
    Are banded for our foes
    For going to discover with the dawn
    Yon southern hill which promised to the sight
    A rise more easy to attack the fort
    Scarce had we stept on the forbidden ground
    When the woods shook the trees stood bristling up
    A living trembling nodded through the leaves

    Arth Poplars and aspenboughs a panic fright

    Con We thought so too and doubled still our pace
    But strait a rumbling sound like bellowing winds
    Rose and grew loud confused with howls of wolves
    And grunts of bears and dreadful hiss of snakes
    Shrieks more than human globes of hail poured down
    An armed winter and inverted day

    Arth Dreadful indeed

    Aur Count then our labours lost
    For other way lies none to mount the cliff
    Unless we borrow wings and sail through air

    Arth Now I perceive a danger worthy me
    Tis Osmonds work a band of hellhired slaves
    Be mine the hazard mine shall be the fame

     ARTHUR is going out but is met by MERLIN who takes him by
     the hand and brings him back

Enter MERLIN

    Mer Hold sir and wait heavens time the attempts too dangerous
    Theres not a tree in that enchanted grove
    Buts numbered out and given by tale to fiends
    And under every leaf a spirit couched
    But by what method to dissolve these charms
    Is yet unknown to me

    Aur Hadst thou been herefor what can thwart thy skill
    Nor Emmeline had been the boast of Oswald
    Nor I forewarned been wanting to her guard

    Con Her darkened eyes had seen the light of heaven
    That was thy promise too and this the time

    Mer Nor has my aid been absent though unseen
    With friendly guides in your benighted maze
    Nor Emmeline shall longer want the sun

    Arth Is there an end of woes

    Mer There is and sudden
    I have employed a subtle airy sprite
    To explore the passage and prepare my way
    Myself mean time will view the magic wood
    To learn whereon depends its force

    Con But Emmeline

    Mer Fear not This vial shall restore her sight

    Arth Oh might I hopeand whats impossible
    To Merlins artto be myself the bearer
    That with the light of heaven she may discern
    Her lover first

    Mer Tis wondrous hazardous
    Yet I foresee the event tis fortunate
    Ill bear ye safe and bring ye back unharmed
    Then lose not precious time but follow me
                              Exeunt MERLIN leading ARTHUR


SCENE IIA Deep Wood

Enter PHILIDEL

    Phil I left all safe behind
    For in the hindmost quarter of the wood
    My former lord grim Osmond walks the round
    Calls oer the names and schools the tardy sprites
    His absence gives me more security
    At every walk I passed I drew a spell
    So that if any fiend abhorring heaven
    There sets his foot it roots him to the ground
    Now could I but discover Emmeline
    My task were fairly done
                   Walking about and prying betwixt the Trees

    Phil Ah mighty Grimbald
    Who would not fear when seized in thy strong gripe
    But hear me Oh renowned Oh worthy fiend

    Grim Away with fulsome flattery

    When but for thee the Christian had been swallowed
    In quaking bogs and living sent to hell

    Phil Ay then I was seduced by Merlins art
    And half persuaded by his soothing tales
    To hope for heaven as if eternal doom
    Could be reversed and undecreed for me
    But I am now set right

    Grim Oh still thou thinkst to fly a fool to mark

    Phil I fled from Merlin free as air that bore me
    To unfold to Osmond all his deep designs

    Grim I believe nothing Oh thou fond impostor
    When wert thou last in hell Is not thy name
    Forgot and blotted from the infernal roll
    But since thou sayest thy errand was to Osmond
    To Osmond shalt thou go march know thy driver

    Phil Kneeling Oh spare me Grimbald and Ill be thy slave
    Tempt hermits for thee in their holy cells
    And virgins in their dreams

    Grim Canst thou a devil hope to cheat a devil
    A spy why thats a name abhorred in hell
    Haste forward forward or Ill goad thee on
    With iron spurs

    Phil But use me kindly then
    Pull not so hard to hurt my airy limbs
    Ill follow thee unforced look theres thy way

    Grim Ay theres thy way indeed but for more surety

    Grim within Oh help me help me Philidel

    Phil Why whats the matter

    Loose me and I will free thee

    Phil What to a spy a name abhorred in hell

    Grim Do not insultOh Oh I grow to ground
    The fiery net draws closer on my limbs

    Phil Thou shalt not have the ease to curse in torments
    Be dumb for one half hourso long my charm
    Can keep thee silentand there lie
    Till Osmond breaks thy chain
                              PHILIDEL unbinds his own Fetters

Enter to him MERLIN with a Vial in his Hand and ARTHUR

    Mer Well hast thou wrought thy safety with thy wit

     some of the Water over her eyes out of the Vial

    Phil Thus thus I infuse

    Em Ha What was that Who spoke

    Makes me not see by seeing

    Mat Tis the sun

    Em The sun tis sure a God if that be heaven

    Arth Beauty like yours commands and man was made
    But a more boisterous and a stronger slave
    To you the best delights of human kind

    Em But are you mine Is there an end of war
    Are all those trumpets dead themselves at last
    That used to kill men with their thundering sounds

    Arth The sum of war is undecided yet
    And many a breathing body must be cold
    Ere you are free

    Em How came you hither then

    Arth By Merlins art to snatch a shortlived bliss
    To feed my famished love upon your eyes
    One moment and depart

    Em O moment worth
    Whole ages past and all that are to come
    Let lovesick Oswald now unpitied mourn
    Let Osmond mutter charms to sprites in vain
    To make me love him all shall not change my soul

    Arth Ha Does the enchanter practise hell upon you
    Is he my rival too

    Em Yes but I hate him
    For when he spoke through my shut eyes I saw him
    His voice lookd ugly and breathed brimstone on me
    And then I first was glad that I was blind
    Not to behold damnation

    Phil This time is left me to congratulate
    Your newborn eyes and tell you what you gain
    By sight restored and viewing him you love
    Appear ye airy forms

            Airy Spirits appear in the shapes of Men and Women
    Man sings Oh sight the mother of desires
    What charming objects dost thou yield
      Tis sweet when tedious night expires
    To see the rosy morning gild
      The mountaintops and paint the field
    But when Clarinda comes in sight
    She makes the summers day more bright
    And when she goes away tis night

    Chor When fair Clarinda comes in sight c

    Wom sings Tis sweet the blushing morn to view
    And plains adorned with pearly dew
    But such cheap delights to see
      Heaven and nature
      Give each creature
    They have eyes as well as we
      This is the joy all joys above
        To see to see
        That only she
    That only she we love

    Chor This is the joy all joys above c

    Man sings And if we may discover
    What charms both nymph and lover
      Tis when the fair at mercy lies
    With kind and amorous anguish
    To sigh to look to languish
      On each others eyes

    Chorus of all Men and Women
      And if we may discover c

    Phil Break off your music for our foes are near
                                                Spirits vanish

Enter MERLIN

    And greedy of revenge is hasting home

    Arth Oh take my love with us or leave me here

    Merl I cannot for shes held by charms too strong
    Which with the enchanted grove must be destroyed
    Till when my art is vainBut fear not Emmeline
    The enchanter has no power on innocence

    Em To Arth Farewell since we must part When you are gone
    Ill look into my glass just where you looked
    To find your face again
    If tis not there Ill think on you so long
    My heart shall make your picture for my eyes

    Arth Whereer I go my soul shall stay with thee
    Tis but my shadow that I take away
    True love is never happy but by halves
    An April sunshine that by fits appears
    It smiles by moments but it mourns by years
                      Exeunt ARTHUR and MERLIN at one door

Enter OSMOND at the other door who gazes on EMMELINE and she
on him

    Em Matilda save me from this ugly thing
    This foe to sight speak dost thou know him

    Mat Too well tis Oswalds friend the great magician

    Em It cannot be a man hes so unlike the man I love

    Osm Aside Death to my eyes she sees

    Em I wish I could not but Ill close my sight
    And shut out all I canIt will not be
    Winking I see thee still thy odious image
    Stares full into my soul and there infects the room
    My Arthur should possess

    Osm Aside I find too late
    That Merlin and her lover have been here
    If I was fired before when she was blind
    Her eyes dart lightning now she must be mine

    Em I prythee dreadful thing tell me thy business here
    And if thou canst reform that odious face
    Look not so grim upon me

    Osm My name is Osmond and my business love

    Em Thou hast a grisly lookforbidding what thou askest
    If I durst tell thee so

    Osm My penthouse eyebrows and my shaggy beard
    Offend your sight but these are manly signs
    Faint white and red abuse your expectations
    Be woman know your sex and love full pleasures

    Em Love from a monster fiend

    Osm Come you must love or you must suffer love
    No coyness none for I am master here

    Em And when did Oswald give away his power
    That thou presumst to rule Be sure Ill tell him
    For as I am his prisoner he is mine

    Osm Why then thou art a captive to a captive
    Oerlaboured with the fight opprest with thirst
    That Oswald whom you mentioned called for drink
    I mixt a sleepy potion in his bowl
    Which he and his fool friend quaffed greedily
    The happy dose wrought the desired effect
    Then to a dungeons depth I sent both bound
    Where stowed with snakes and adders now they lodge
    Two planks their beds slippery with ooze and slime
    The rats brush oer their faces with their tails
    And croaking paddocks crawl upon their limbs
    Since when the garrison depends on me
    Now know you are my slave

    Mat He strikes a horror through my blood

    Em I freeze as if his impious art had fixed
    My feet to earth

    Osm But love shall thaw ye
    Ill show his force in countries caked with ice
    Where the pale polestar in the north of heaven
    Sits high and on the frosty winter broods
    Yet there love reigns For proof this magic wand
    Shall change the mildness of sweet Britains clime
    To Iceland and the farthest Thules frost
    Where the proud god disdaining winters bounds
    Oerleaps the fences of eternal snow
    And with his warmth supplies the distant sun

     OSMOND strikes the Ground with his Wand The Scene changes to a
     Prospect of Winter in Frozen Countries

CUPID descends

    Cup    What ho thou Genius of the Clime what ho
    sings  Lyst thou asleep beneath those hills of snow
    Stretch out thy lazy limbs awake awake
    And winter from thy furry mantle shake

GENIUS Arises

    Genius What power art thou who from below
    Hast made me rise unwillingly and slow
    From beds of everlasting snow
    Seest thou not how stiff and wondrous old
    Far unfit to bear the bitter cold
    I can scarcely move or draw my breath
    Let me let me freeze again to death

    Cupid Thou doating fool forbear forbear
    What dost thou dream of freezing here
    At Loves appearing all the sky clearing
      The stormy winds their fury spare
    Winter subduing and spring renewing
      My beams create a more glorious year
    Thou doating fool forbear forbear
    What dost thou dream of freezing here

    Genius Great Love I know thee now
    Eldest of the gods art thou
    Heaven and earth by thee were made
      Human nature
      Is thy creature
    Every where thou art obeyed

    Cupid No part of my dominion shall be waste
      To spread my sway and sing my praise
      Even here I will a people raise
    Of kind embracing lovers and embraced

     Cupid waves his Wand upon which the Scene opens and discovers a
     prospect of Ice and Snow to the end of the Stage

Singers and Dancers Men and Women appear

    Man See see we assemble
      Thy revels to hold
      Though quivring with cold
    We chatter and tremble

    Cupid Tis I tis I tis I that have warmed ye
      In spite of cold weather
      Ive brought you together
    Tis I tis I tis I that have armed ye

    Chor Tis Love tis Love tis Love that has warmed us
      In spite of cold weather
      He brought us together
    Tis Love tis Love tis Love that has armed us

    Cupid Sound a parley ye fair and surrender
    Set yourselves and your lovers at ease
      Hes a grateful offender
      Who pleasure dare seize
    But the whining pretender
      Is sure to displease


II

    Since the fruit of desire is possessing
      Tis unmanly to sigh and complain
    When we kneel for redressing
      We move your disdain
    Love was made for a blessing
      And not for a pain

A Dance after which the Singers and Dancers depart

    Em I could be pleased with any one but thee
    Who entertained my sight with such gay shows
    As men and women moving here and there
    That coursing one another in their steps
    Have made their feet a tune

    Osm What coying it again
    No more but make me happy to my gust
    That is without your struggling

    Em From my sight
    Thou all thy devils in one thou darst not force me

    Osm You teach me well I find you would be ravished
    Ill give you that excuse your sex desires
               He begins to lay hold on her and they struggle

    Grim Within O help me master help me

    Osm Whos that my Grimbald Come and help thou me
    For tis thy work to assist a ravisher

    Grim Within I cannot stir I am spellcaught by Philidel
    And pursed within a net
    With a huge heavy weight of holy words
    Laid on my head that keeps me down from rising

    Osm Ill read them backwards and release thy bonds
    Mean time go in
                                          To EMMELINE
    Prepare yourself and ease my drudgery
    But if you will not fairly be enjoyed
    A little honest force is well employed
                                          Exit OSMOND

    Em Heaven be my guard I have no other friend
    Heaven ever present to thy suppliants aid
    Protect and pity innocence betrayed
         Exeunt EMMELINE and MATILDA

Enter GRIMBALD who meets him

    Grim Not so fast master danger threatens thee
    Theres a black cloud descending from above
    Full of heavens venom bursting oer thy head

    Osm Malicious fiend thou liest for I am fenced
    By millions of thy fellows in my grove
    I bade thee when I freed thee from the charm
    Run scouting through the wood from tree to tree
    And look if all my devils were on duty
    Hadst thou performed thy charge thou tardy sprite
    Thou wouldst have known no danger threatened me

    Grim When did a devil fail in diligence
    Poor mortal thou thyself art overseen
    I have been there and thence I bring this news
    Thy fatal foe great Arthur is at hand
    Merlin has taken his time when thou wert absent
    To observe thy characters their force and nature
    And counterwork thy spells

    Osm The devil take Merlin
    Ill cast them all anew and instantly
    All of another mould be thou at hand
    Their composition was before of horror
    Now they shall be of blandishment and love
    Seducing hopes soft pity tender moans
    Art shall meet art and when they think to win
    The fools shall find their labour to begin
                                      Exeunt OSM and GRIMB

    Arth Doubt me not

    Merl Yet in prevention
    Of what may come Ill leave my Philidel
    To watch thy steps and with him leave my wand
    The touch of which no earthy fiend can bear
    In whateer shape transformed but must lay down
    His borrowed figure and confess the devil
    Once more farewell and prosper             Exit MERLIN

    Arth walking No danger yet I see no walls of fire
    No city of the fiends with forms obscene
    To grin from far on flaming battlements
    This is indeed the grove I should destroy
    But wheres the horror sure the prophet erred
    Hark music and the warbling notes of birds Soft Music
    Hell entertains me like some welcome guest
    More wonders yet yet all delightful too
    A silver current to forbid my passage
    And yet to invite me stands a golden bridge
    Perhaps a trap for my unwary feet
    To sink and whelm me underneath the waves
    With fire or water let him wage his war
    Or all the elements at once Ill on

     As he is going to the Bridge two Syrens arise from the water
     They shew themselves to the waist and sing

     Syren O pass not on but stay
      And waste the joyous day
      With us in gentle play
    Unbend to love unbend thee
      O lay thy sword aside
      And other arms provide
    For other wars attend thee
      And sweeter to be tried

    Chor For other wars c

    Both sing Two daughters of this aged stream are we
    And both our seagreen locks have combd for thee
    Come bathe with us an hour or two
    Come naked in for we are so
    What danger from a naked foe
    Come bathe with us come bathe and share
    What pleasures in the floods appear
    Well beat the waters till they bound
    And circle round around around
    And circle round around

    Arth A lazy pleasure trickles through my veins
    Here could I stay and well be cozened here
    But honour callsis honour in such haste
    Can it not bait at such a pleasing inn
    No for the more I look the more I long
    Farewell ye fair illusions I must leave ye
    While I have power to say that I must leave ye
    Farewell with half my soul I stagger off
    How dear this flying victory has cost
    When if I stay to struggle I am lost

     As he is going forward Nymphs and Sylvans come out from behind
     the Trees A Bass and two Trebles sing the following Song to a
     Minuet

Dance with a Song all with Branches in their Hands

    Song How happy the lover
      How easy his chain
      How pleasing his pain
    How sweet to discover
      He sighs not in vain
    For love every creature
    Is formed by his nature
    No joys are above
    The pleasures of love

The Dance continues with the same measure played alone


II

    In vain are our graces
      In vain are your eyes
      If love you despise
    When age furrows faces
    Tis time to be wise
    Then use the short blessing
    That flies in possessing
    No joys are above
    The pleasures of love

    Arth And what are the fantastic fairy joys
    To love like mine false joys false welcomes all
    Be gone ye Sylvan trippers of the green
    Fly after night and overtake the moon
                  Here the Dancers Singers and Syrens vanish
    This goodly tree seems queen of all the grove
    The ringlets round her trunk declare her guilty
    Of many midnightsabbaths revelled here
    Her will I first attempt

     ARTHUR strikes at the Tree and cuts it Blood spouts out of it
     a groan follows then a shriek

    Good heavens what monstrous prodigies are these
    Blood follows from my blow the wounded rind
    Spouts on my sword and sanguine dies the plain
      He strikes again The Voice of EMMELINE from behind

    Em from behind Forbear if thou hast pity ah forbear
    These groans proceed not from a senseless plant
    No spouts of blood run welling from a tree

    Arth Speak what thou art I charge thee speak thy being
    Thou that hast made my curdled blood run back
    My heart heave up my hair to rise in bristles
    And scarcely left a voice to ask thy name
         EMMEL breaks out of the Tree shewing her Arm bloody

    Em Whom thou hast hurt unkind and cruel see
    Look on this blood tis fatal still to me
    To bear thy wounds my heart has felt them first

    Arth Tis she amazement roots me to the ground

    Em By cruel charms dragged from my peaceful bower
    Fierce Osmond closed me in this bleeding bark
    And bid me stand exposed to the bleak winds
    And winter storms and heavens inclemency
    Bound to the fate of this hellhaunted grove
    So that whatever sword or sounding axe
    Shall violate this plant must pierce my flesh
    And when that falls I die

    Arth If this be true
    O never nevertobeended charm
    At least by meyet all may be illusion
    Break up ye thickening fogs and filmy mists
    All that belie my sight and cheat my sense
    For reason still pronounces tis not she
    And thus resolved
                      Lifts up his sword as going to strike

    Em Do strike barbarian strike
    And strew my mangled limbs with every stroke
    Wound me and doubly kill me with unkindness
    That by thy hand I fell

    Arth What shall I do ye powers

    Em Lay down thy vengeful sword tis fatal here
    What need of arms where no defence is made
    A lovesick virgin panting with desire
    No conscious eye to intrude on our delights
    For this thou hast the Syrens songs despised
    For this thy faithful passion I reward
    Haste then to take me longing to thy arms

    Arth O love O Merlin whom should I believe

    Em Believe thyself thy youth thy love and me
    They only they who please themselves are wise
    Disarm thy hand that mine may meet it bare

    Arth By thy leave reason here I throw thee off
    Thou load of life If thou wert made for souls
    Then souls should have been made without their bodies
    If falling for the first created fair
    Was Adams faultgreat grandsire I forgive thee
    Eden was lost as all thy sons would lose it
                                  Going towards EMM
                                   and pulling off his Gauntlet

Enter PHILIDEL running

    Phil Hold poor deluded mortal hold thy hand
    Which if thou givst is plighted to a fiend
    For proof behold the virtue of this wand
    The infernal paint shall vanish from her face
    And hell shall stand revealed

     Strikes EMMELINE with a Wand who straight descends PHILIDEL
     runs to the Descent and pulls up GRIMBALD and binds him

    Now see to whose embraces thou wert falling
    Behold the maiden modesty of Grimbald
    The grossest earthiest ugliest fiend in hell

    Arth Horror seizes me
    To think what headlong ruin I have tempted

    Phil Haste to thy work a noble stroke or two
    Ends all the charms and disenchants the grove
    Ill hold thy mistress bound

    Arth Then heres for earnest

     Strikes twice or thrice and the Tree falls or sinks A Peal of
     Thunder immediately follows with dreadful Howlings

    Tis finished and the dusk that yet remains
    Is but the native horror of the wood
    But I must lose no time the pass is free
    The unroosted fiends have quitted this abode
    On yon proud towers before this day be done
    My glittering banners shall be waved against the setting sun
                                                  Exit ARTHUR

    Phil Come on my surly slave come stalk along
    And stamp a madmans pace and drag thy chain

    Grim Ill champ and foam upon it till the blue venom
    Work upward to thy hands and loose their hold

    Phil Knowst thou this powerful wand tis lifted up
    A second stroke would send thee to the centre
    Benumbed and dead as far as souls can die

    Grim I would thou wouldst to rid me of my sense
    I shall be whooped through hell at my return
    Inglorious from the mischief I designed

    Phil And therefore since thou loathst etherial light
    The morning sun shall beat on thy black brows
    The breath thou drawst shall be of upper air
    Hostile to thee and to thy earthy make
    So light so thin that thou shalt starve for want
    Of thy gross food till gasping thou shalt lie
    And blow it back all sooty to the sky
                Exit PHILIDEL dragging GRIMBALD after him




ACT V SCENE I


Enter OSMOND as affrighted

    Osm Grimbald made prisoner and my grove destroyed
    Now what can save meHark the drums and trumpets
                                     Drums and Trumpets within
    Arthur is marching onward to the fort
    I have but one recourse and thats to Oswald
    But will he fight for me whom I have injured
    No not for me but for himself he must
    Ill urge him with the last necessity
    Better give up my mistress than my life
    His force is much unequal to his rival
    True but Ill help him with my utmost art
    And try to unravel fate                              Exit

Enter ARTHUR CONON AURELIUS ALBANACT and Soldiers

    Con Now there remains but this one labour more
    And if we have the hearts of trueborn Britons
    The forcing of the castle crowns the day

    Aur The works are weak the garrison but thin
    Dispirited with frequent overthrows
    Already wavering on their illmanned walls

    Alb They shift their places oft and sculk from war
    Sure signs of pale despair and easy rout
    It shews they place their confidence in magic
    And when their devils fail their hearts are dead

    Arth Then where you see them clustering most in motion
    And staggering in their ranks there press them home
    For thats a coward heapHows this a sally

Enter OSWALD GUILLAMAR and Soldiers on the other side

    Beyond my hopes to meet them on the square

    Osw Brave Britons hold and thou their famous chief
                                                     Advancing
    Attend what Saxon Oswald will propose
    He owns your victory but whether owing
    To valour or to fortune that he doubts
    If Arthur dares ascribe it to the first
    And singled from a crowd will tempt a conquest
    This Oswald offers let our troops retire
    And hand to hand let us decide our strife
    This if refused bear witness earth and heaven
    Thou stealst a crown and mistress undeserved

    Arth Ill not usurp thy title of a robber
    Nor will upbraid thee that before I proffered
    This single combat which thou didst avoid
    So glad I am on any terms to meet thee
    And not discourage thy repenting shame
    As once neas my famed ancestor
    Betwixt the Trojan and Rutilian bands
    Fought for a crown and bright Lavinias bed
    So will I meet thee hand to hand opposed
    My auguring mind assures the same success
    To his Men Hence out of view If I am slain or yield
    Renounce me Britons for a recreant knight
    And let the Saxon peacefully enjoy
    His former footing on our famous isle
    To ratify these terms I swear

    Osw You need not
    Your honour is of force without your oath
    I only add that if I fall or yield
    Yours be the crown and Emmeline

    Arth Thats two crowns
    No more we keep the looking heavens and sun
    Too long in expectation of our arms
                                  Both Armies go off the Stage

     They fight with Spunges in their Hands dipt in blood after
     some equal passes and closing they appear both wounded ARTHUR

     Sword out of his Hand and exit OSWALD pursues ARTHUR MERLIN
     enters and gives ARTHUR his Sword and exit they close and
     ARTHUR in the Fall disarms OSWALD

    Arth Confess thyself oercome and ask thy life

    Osw Tis not worth asking when tis in thy power

    Arth Then take it as my gift

    Osw A wretched gift
    With loss of empire liberty and love

     A concert of Trumpets within proclaiming ARTHURS Victory
     while they sound ARTHUR and OSWALD seem to confer

    Tis too much bounty to a vanquished foe
    Yet not enough to make me fortunate

    Arth Thy life thy liberty thy honour safe
    Lead back thy Saxons to their ancient Elbe
    I would restore thee fruitful Kent the gift
    Of Vortigern for Hengists illbought aid
    But that my Britons brook no foreign power
    To lord it in a land sacred to freedom
    And of its rights tenacious to the last

    Osw Nor more than thou hast offered would I take
    I would refuse all Britain held in homage
    And own no other masters but the gods

     Enter on one side MERLIN EMMELINE and MATILDA CONON
     AURELIUS ALBANACT with British Soldiers bearing King ARTHURS
     Standard displayed On the other side GUILLAMAR and OSMOND
     with Saxon Soldiers dragging their Colours on the Ground

      ARTH going to EMM and embracing her
    Arth At length at length I have thee in my arms
    Though our malevolent stars have struggled hard
    And held us long asunder

    Em We are so fitted for each others hearts
    That heaven had erred in making of a third
    To get betwixt and intercept our loves

    Osw Were there but this this only sight to see
    The price of Britain should not buy my stay

    Mer Take hence that monster of ingratitude
    Him who betrayed his master bear him hence
    And in that loathsome dungeon plunge him deep
    Where he plunged noble Oswald

    Osm That indeed is fittest for me
    For there I shall be near my kindred friends
    And spare my Grimbalds pains to bear me to them
                                                Is carried off

    Mer To ARTH For this days palm and for thy former acts
    Thy Britain freed and foreign force expelled
    Thou Arthur hast acquired a future fame
    And of three Christian worthies art the first
    And now at once to treat thy sight and soul
    Behold what rolling ages shall produce
    The wealth the loves the glories of our isle
    Which yet like golden ore unripe in beds
    Expect the warm indulgency of heaven
    To call them forth to light
    To OSM Nor thou brave Saxon prince disdain our triumphs

     British Ocean in a Storm OLUS in a Cloud above Four Winds
     hanging c

OLUS singing

    Ye blustering brethren of the skies
      Whose breath has ruffled all the watry plain
    Retire and let Britannia rise
      In triumph oer the main
        Serene and calm and void of fear
        The Queen of Islands must appear
        Serene and calm as when the spring
        The newcreated world began
        And birds on boughs did softly sing
        Their peaceful homage paid to man
        While Eurus did his blasts forbear
        In favour of the tender year
        Retreat rude winds retreat
        To hollow rocks your stormy seat
        There swell your lungs and vainly vainly threat

     OLUS ascends and the four Winds fly off The SCENE opens and
     discovers a calm Sea to the end of the House An Island arises
     to a soft Tune BRITANNIA seated in the Island with Fishermen
     at her Feet c The Tune changes the Fishermen come ashore and
     dance a while after which PAN and a NEREID come on the Stage
     and sing

PAN and NEREID sing

    Round thy coasts fair nymph of Britain
      For thy guard our waters flow
    Proteus all his herds admitting
      On thy greens to graze below
    Foreign lands thy fishes tasting
    Learn from thee luxurious fasting

                Song of three parts

    For folded flocks on fruitful plains
    The shepherds and the farmers gains
      Fair Britain all the world outvies
    And Pan as in Arcadia reigns
      Where pleasure mixt with profit lies

    Though Jasons fleece was famed of old
    The British wool is growing gold
      No mines can more of wealth supply
    It keeps the peasant from the cold
    And takes for kings the Tyrian dye

     The last Stanza sung over again betwixt PAN and the Nereid After
     which the former dance is varied and goes on

Enter COMUS with three Peasants who sing the following Song in Parts

    Com Your hay it is mowd and your corn is reaped
    Your barns will be full and your hovels heaped
      Come my boys come
      Come my boys come
    And merrily roar out harvest home
      Harvest home
      Harvest home
    And merrily roar out harvest home

    Chor Come my boys come c

     Man We ha cheated the parson well cheat him again
    For why should a blockhead ha one in ten
      One in ten
      One in ten
    For why should a blockhead ha one in ten

     Man For prating so long like a booklearned sot
    Till pudding and dumpling burn to pot Burn to pot
    Burn to pot
    Till pudding and dumpling burn to pot

    Chor Burn to pot c

     Man Well toss off our ale till we cannot stand
    And hoigh for the honour of old England
      Old England
      Old England
    And hoigh for the honour of old England

    Chor Old England c
                     The Dance varied into a round Countrydance

Enter VENUS

    Venus Fairest isle all isles excelling
      Seat of pleasures and of loves
    Venus here will chuse her dwelling
      And forsake her Cyprian groves

    Cupid from his favourite nation
       Care and envy will remove
    Jealousy that poisons passion
       And despair that dies for love

    Gentle murmurs sweet complaining
       Sighs that blow the fire of love
    Soft repulses kind disdaining
       Shall be all the pains you prove

    Every swain shall pay his duty
       Grateful every nymph shall prove
    And as these excel in beauty
       Those shall be renowned for love


SONG BY MR HOWE

    She You say Tis love creates the pain
    Of which so sadly you complain
    And yet would fain engage my heart
    In that uneasy cruel part
    But how alas think you that I
    Can bear the wound of which you die

    He Tis not my passion makes my care
    But your indifference gives despair
    The lusty sun begets no spring
    Till gentle showers assistance bring
    So love that scorches and destroys
    Till kindness aids can cause no joys

    She Love has a thousand ways to please
    But more to rob us of our ease
    For wakeful nights and careful days
    Some hours of pleasure he repays
    But absence soon or jealous fears
    Oerflow the joys with flood of tears

    He By vain and senseless forms betrayed
    Harmless loves the offender made
    While we no other pains endure
    Than those that we ourselves procure
    But one soft moment makes amends
    For all the torment that attends

Chorus of both

    Let us love let us love and to happiness haste
    Age and wisdom come too fast
    Youth for loving was designed

    He alone Ill be constant youll be kind

    She alone Youll be constant Ill be kind

    Both Heaven can give no greater blessing
    Than faithful love and kind possessing

     After the Dialogue a Warlike Concert The SCENE opens above and
     discovers the Order of the Garter

Enter HONOUR attended by Heroes

    Merl These who last entered are our valiant Britons
    Who shall by sea and land repel our foes
    Now look above and in heavens high abyss
    Behold what fame attends those future heroes
    Honour who leads them to that steepy height
    In her immortal song shall tell the rest

HONOUR sings

    St George the patron of our isle
       A soldier and a saint
    On that auspicious order smile
       Which love and arms will plant

    Our natives not alone appear
      To court this martial prize
    But foreign kings adopted here
      Their crowns at home despise

    Our sovereign high in awful state
      His honours shall bestow
    And see his sceptered subjects wait
      On his commands below
                           A full Chorus of the whole Song After
                            which the grand Dance

    Arth To MERL Wisely you have whateer will please revealed
    What would displease as wisely have concealed
    Triumphs of war and peace at full ye show
    But swiftly turn the pages of our woe
    Rest we contented with our present state
    Tis anxious to enquire of future fate
    That race of heroes is enough alone
    For all unseen disasters to atone
    Let us make haste betimes to reap our share
    And not resign them all the praise of war
    But set the example and their souls inflame
    To copy out their great forefathers name    Exeunt omnes





EPILOGUE

SPOKEN BY MRS BRACEGIRDLE


    Ive had today a dozen billetdoux
    From fops and wits and cits and Bowstreet beaux
    Some from Whitehall but from the Temple more
    A CoventGarden porter brought me four
    I have not yet read all But without feigning
    We maids can make shrewd guesses at your meaning
    What if to shew your styles I read them here  
    Methinks I hear one cry O Lord forbear       
    No madam no by heaven thats too severe    
    Well then be safe
    But swear henceforwards to renounce all writing   
    And take this solemn oath of my inditing        
    As you love ease and hate campaigns and fighting 
    Yet faith tis just to make some few examples
    What if I shewd you one or two for samples
      Heres one desires my ladyship to meet
                                                 Pulls out one
    At the kind couch above in BridgesStreet
    Oh sharping knave that would haveyou know what
    For a poor sneaking treat of chocolate
      Now in the name of luck Ill break this open
                                             Pulls out another
    Because I dreamt last night I had a token
    The superscription is exceeding pretty
    To the desire of all the town and city
    Now gallants you must know this precious fop
    Is foreman of a haberdashers shop
    One who devoutly cheats demure in carriage
    And courts me to the holy bands of marriage
    But with a civil innuendo too
    My overplus of love shall be for you
      Madam I swear your looks are so divine
                                                         Reads
    When I set up your face shall be my sign
    Though times are hardto show how I adore you
    Heres my whole heart and halfaguinea for you
    But have a care of beaux theyre false my honey
    And which is worse have not a rag of money
      See how maliciously the rogue would wrong ye
    But I know better things of some among ye
    My wisest way will be to keep the stage
    And trust to the goodnature of the age
    And he that likes the music and the play
    Shall be my favourite gallant today

FOOTNOTES

Footnote  In imitation of the blind man who said that red
resembled the sound of a trumpet

Footnote  One virtue ascribed by Odinn to the Runick characters
was to blunt the weapons of an enemy

Footnote  In this Ode is contained all the use which our poet
made of his knowledge of the Saxon manners gleaned from Bede and
Bochart It is certain that the Saxons like the other Northmen
used the horrible superstition of human sacrifices Woden Freya or
Frigga his wife and Thor the god of war were worshipped by the Saxons
with probably the same attributes ascribed to them as in Denmark and
Sweden The casting of lots is mentioned by Alfred in his version of
Bede pluton mid tanum they cast lots with twigs Much and most
extensive learning has been displayed on the subject by Mr Turner in
the fourth volume of his AngloSaxon History

Footnote  This long stage direction contains an attempt to render
interesting what is necessarily ridiculous With all the assistance
of bloody spunges a stage combat must be always a ludicrous
representation of a real one We are content in old plays to let it
pass as a hieroglyphic which conveys to us the authors meaning
but modern dramatists would do well to obscure their combats if the
termination is to be a bloody one

Footnote  The Nine Worthies were equally divided among three
religions namely Three Pagans Hector Pompey and Alexander the
Great three Jews Joshua David and Judas Machabus and three
Christians Arthur Charlemagne and Godfrey of Boulogne

Footnote  In this passage Drydens discontent with the existing
circumstances glances out It is probable that much was here omitted
or altered which would have adorned the termination of the piece
had it been represented to Charles II as originally designed by the
author

Footnote  With a slight alteration in spelling a modern poet would
have written BondStreet beaux A billetdoux from BowStreet would
be now more alarming than flattering




CLEOMENES

THE

SPARTAN HERO

A

TRAGEDY

TO WHICH IS PREFIXED

THE LIFE OF CLEOMENES

BY MR THOMAS CREECH


His armis ill quoque tutus in AulJUV Sat iv




CLEOMENES


There has been occasion to remark that Dryden seldom avails himself
of national peculiarities or national costume in sketching his
dramatic personages the present tragedy forms however a remarkable
exception to this general observation Cleomenes the last of the
Spartans is designed not only as a hero but as a Lacedemonian and
is a just picture of that extraordinary race of men whose virtues
were comprized in patriotism and whose whole passions centered in
a thirst for military glory This character Dryden has drawn with
admirable spirit and precision It was indeed peculiarly suited to his
genius for although sometimes deficient in the pathos and natural
expression of violent passion by which Otway and even Southerne
could affect the passions of an audience he never fails in expressing
in the most noble language the sentiments of that stoical philosophy
which considers sufferings rather as subjects of moral reflection
than of natural feeling Yet lest a character so invulnerable to
the shafts of adversity so much the totus teres atque rotundus of
the poet should fail to interest the audience for we seldom pity
those who shew no symptoms of feeling their own sorrows Dryden has
softened the character of his Spartan hero by the influence of those
chaste and tender domestic affections which thrive best in bosoms
rendered by nature or philosophy inaccessible to selfish feeling The
haughty and unbending spirit the love of war and thirst of honour
proper to the Lacedemonian and inculcated by the whole train of his
education complete the character of Cleomenes The same spirit which
animates the father is finely represented as descending upon the son
Cleonidas is a model of a Spartan youth and every slight expression
which he uses tends to bring out that celebrated character The idea
of this spirited boy seems to be taken from the excellent character
of Hengo in the Bonduca of Beaumont and Fletcher whom Cleonidas
resembles in the manner of his death and in his previous sufferings
by hunger as well as in his premature courage and emulation of his
fathers military glory The wife and mother of Cleomenes seem
to be sketched after those of Coriolanus the former exhibiting a
mild and gentle disposition the latter the highsouled magnanimity
of a Spartan matron Of the other characters little need be said
Ptolemy is a silly tyrant Sosibius a wily minister and Cleanthes a
friend and confident such as tyrants ministers and confidents in
tragedies usually are Judging from his first appearance the author
seems to have intended Pantheus as a character somewhat in contrast to
that of Cleomenes but he soon tires of the task of discrimination
and Pantheus sinks into a mere assistant Cassandra is not sketched
with any peculiar care her snares are of a nature not very perilous
to Spartan virtue for her manners are too openly licentious Such
however as are fond of tracing the ideas of poets to those who have
written before them may consider Cassandrain her pride her love
and her alternate schemes for saving and destroying Cleomenesas
furnishing the original hint of the much more highly finished character
of Zara in Congreves Mourning Bride

The conduct of the piece being calculated to evince the Spartan
virtue patience and courage contains a long train of hopes
disappointed seducing temptations resisted sufferings patiently
endured and finally closed by a voluntary death There is no
particular object to which the attention of the audience is fixed as
that upon which the conclusion of the piece necessarily depends The
liberation of Cleomenes from his Egyptian bondage is doubtless the
consummation concerning which the poet meant that we should be anxious
but this event might be brought about in so many different ways and
if accomplished brings Cleomenes so little nearer to the restoration
of Spartan liberty that it is perhaps insufficient to excite that
strong concentrated and vivid interest which the plot of a drama
ought properly to inspire The mind is distracted among the various
possibilities by which the desired catastrophe might be accomplished
and feels a consciousness that even were Cleomenes dismissed with full
sails from the port of Alexandria it would be rather the beginning
than the winding up of his history For these reasons the plot seems
more deficient in interest than might have been expected from the
spirited delineation of the principal character

It appears that Dryden was unable from illness to put the finishing
strokes to Cleomenes That task he committed to Southerne now his
intimate friend and who as may be easily imagined felt himself
much honoured by the task imposed upon him The half of the fifth
act was that upon which Southerne exercised this power of revisal and
finishing for that it amounted to no more will I think be obvious
to any who takes the trouble to compare that act with those which
precede it The rabblescene introduced as the poet himself tells
us to gratify the more barbarous part of his audience is indeed
deplorably bad

The play when presented to the theatre met with unexpected opposition
from the government then directed by Queen Mary in the absence of
her husband This was not very surprising considering the subject
of the play and Drydens wellknown principles The history of an
exiled monarch soliciting in the court of an ally aid to relieve his
country from a foreign yoke and to restore him to the throne of his
fathers with the account of a popular insurrection undertaken for the
same purposes were delicate themes during the reign of William III
at least when the pen of Dryden was to be employed in them whose
wellknown skill at adapting an ancient story to a modern moral had
so often been exercised in the cause of the house of Stuart Besides
he had already given offence by his prologue to the Prophetess
when revived which contains some familiar metaphorical sneers as
Cibber calls them at the Irish war the female regency and even the
Revolution itself This prologue had been forbidden and a similar
exertion of authority was deemed fit in the case of Cleomenes
Accordingly before the inoffensive nature of the piece could be
explained the court took alarm at the subject in the abstract and
the performance of the piece was prohibited by the Chamberlain It
appears the exertions of Lord Rochester the maternal uncle of Queen
Mary and of his family had been sufficiently powerful to guarantee
the harmless nature of the play and to procure a recal of the mandate
by which the acting of the piece and the consequent profits of the
author had been for some time suspended

When the play was performed our author had the satisfaction to see the
first character admirably represented by the wellknown Mrs Barry to
whom he has paid in the preface the splendid compliment of saying
that she had gained by her performance a reputation beyond any woman
he had ever seen on the theatre If this expression as Cibber
seems to think be a little overstretched it at least serves to prove
to us that the play was well received for otherwise the intercourse
of civility between the author and performers is generally very slender

Cleomenes was acted and published in 


FOOTNOTES

Footnote  The whole passage is so very fine that I think I may
venture to extract it from this beautiful and forgotten tragedy

    The Tragedy of Bonduca act v

This extract is perhaps longer than necessary but independently of
its extreme beauty it serves to justify the observation in the text
that Dryden had the recollection of Hengo strongly in his memory while
composing the character of Cleonidas Both are extenuated by hunger
and both killed insidiously by a cowardly enemy and the reader will
discover more minute resemblances to the very dialogue of Beaumont and
Fletcher on perusing p  and pp   I do Dryden no injury in
ascribing a decided superiority to the more ancient dramatists

Footnote  This fact is ascertained by the following passage in the
Dedication of Southernes play called the Wifes Excuse to the
Honourable Thomas Wharton

These sir are capital objections against me but they hit very few
faults nor have they mortified me into a despair of pleasing the more
reasonable part of mankind If Mr Drydens judgment goes for any thing
I have it on my side for speaking of this play he has publicly said
the town was kind to Sir Anthony Love I needed them only to be just
to this and to prove there was more than friendship in his opinion
upon the credit of this play with him falling sick last summer he
bequeathed to my care the half of the last act of his tragedy of
Cleomenes which when it comes into the world you will find to be
so considerable a trust that all the town will pardon me for defending
this play that preferred me to it If modesty be sometimes a weakness
what I say can hardly be a crime in a fair English trial both parties
are allowed to be heard and without this vanity of mentioning Mr
Dryden I had lost the best evidence of my cause

I cannot but remark a material difference between this quotation as
here quoted from the vo edition of Southernes Plays  and as
quoted by Mr Malone who reads the fifth act instead of the
half of the fifth act

Footnote  Motteux in the Gentlemans Journal has announced the
prohibition of Cleomenes and its removal in a remarkable passage
quoted by Mr Malone

I was in hopes to have given you in this letter an account of the
acting of Drydens Cleomenes it was to have appeared upon the stage
on Saturday last and you need not doubt but that the town was big with
the expectation of the performance but orders came from her Majesty to
hinder its being acted so that none can tell when it shall be played

I told you in my last says the same writer in the following month
that none could tell when Mr Drydens Cleomenes would appear Since
that time the innocence and merit of the play have raised it several
eminent advocates who have prevailed to have it acted and you need
not doubt but it has been with great applause

Footnote  Cibber has thus described Mrs Barry at the time when she
was honoured by this high compliment from Dryden

Mrs Barry was then in  in possession of almost all the chief
parts in tragedy With what skill she gave life to them you may judge
from the words of Dryden in his preface to Cleomenes I perfectly
remember her acting that part and however unnecessary it may seem
to give my judgement after Drydens I cannot help saying I do not
only close with his opinion but will venture to add that though
Dryden has been dead these thirtyeight years the same compliment to
this hour may be due to her excellence And though she was then not a
little past her youth she was not till that time fully arrived to her
maturity of power and judgment From whence I would observe that the
short life of beauty is not long enough to form a complete actress
In men the delicacy of person is not so absolutely necessary nor
the decline of it so soon taken notice of The fame Mrs Barry arrived
at is a particular proof of the difficulty there is in judging with
certainty from their first trials whether young people will ever make
any great figure in a theatre There was it seems so little hope of
Mrs Barry at her first setting out that she was at the end of the
first year discharged the company among others that were thought to
be a useless expence to it I take it for granted that the objection
to Mrs Barry at that time must have been a defective ear or some
unskilful dissonance in her manner of pronouncing But where there is
a proper voice and person with the addition of a good understanding
experience tells us that such defect is not always invincible of
which not only Mrs Barry but the late Mrs Oldfield are eminent
instancesMrs Barry in characters of greatness had a presence of
elevated dignity her mien and motion superb and gracefully majestic
her voice full clear and strong so that no violence of passion
could be too much for her and when distress or tenderness possessed
her she subsided into the most affecting melody and softness In
the art of exciting pity she had a power beyond all the actresses I
have yet seen or what your imagination can conceive Of the former
of these two great excellencies she gave the most delightful proofs
in almost all the heroic plays of Dryden and Lee and of the latter
in the softer passions of Otways Monimia and Belvidera In scenes of
anger defiance or resentment while she was impetuous and terrible
she poured out the sentiment with an enchanting harmony and it was
this particular excellence for which Dryden made her the aboverecited
compliment upon her acting Cassandra in his Cleomenes But here I
am apt to think his partiality for that character may have tempted
his judgment to let it pass for her masterpiece when he could not
but know there are several other characters in which her action might
have given her a fairer pretence to the praise he has bestowed upon
her for Cassandra for in no part of that is there the least ground
for compassion as in Monimia nor equal cause for admiration as in
the nobler love of Cleopatra or the tempestuous jealousy of Roxana
Twas in these lights I thought Mrs Barry shone with a much brighter
excellence than in Cassandra She was the first person whose merit
was distinguished by the indulgence of having an annual benefitplay
which was granted to her alone if I mistake not first in King Jamess
time and which became not common to others till the division of
this company after the death of King Williams Queen Mary This great
actress died of a fever towards the latter end of Queen Anne the year
I have forgot but perhaps you will recollect it by an expression
that fell from her in blank verse in her last hours when she was
delirious viz

    Ha ha and so they make us lords by dozens

And yet says Antony Aston in his curious Supplement to Cibbers
work this fine creature was not handsome her mouth opening most
on the right side which she strove to draw tother way and at times
composing her face as if sitting to have her picture drawn Mrs Barry
was middlesized and had darkish hair light eyes dark eyebrows and
was indifferently plump She had a manner of drawing out her words
which became her but not Mrs Bradshaw and Mrs Porter her successors
Neither she nor any of the actresses of those times had any tone in
their speech so much lately in use In tragedy she was solemn and
august in free comedy alert easy and genteel pleasant in her face
and action filling the stage with variety of gesture She was woman to
Lady Shelton of Norfolk my godmother when Lord Rochester took her
on the stage where for some time they could make nothing of her She
could neither sing nor dance no not in a countrydanceMALONE Vol

TO

THE RIGHT HONOURABLE

THE EARL OF ROCHESTER

KNIGHT OF THE MOST NOBLE ORDER OF THE GARTER c


It is enough for your lordship to be conscious to yourself of having
performed a just and honourable action in redeeming this play from
the persecution of my enemies but it would be ingratitude in me not
to publish it to the world That it has appeared on the stage is
principally owing to you that it has succeeded is the approbation of
your judgment by that of the public It is just the inversion of an act
of parliament Your lordship first signed it and then it was passed
amongst the Lords and Commons The children of old men are generally
observed to be shortlived and of a weakly constitution How this may
prove I know not but hitherto it has promised well and if it survive
to posterity it will carry the noble fame of its patron along with
it or rather it will be carried by yours to afterages Ariosto in
his Voyage of Astolpho to the Moon has given us a fine allegory of
two swans who when Time had thrown the writings of many poets into
the river of oblivion were ever in a readiness to secure the best
and bear them aloft into the temple of immortality Whether this
poem be of that number is left to the judgment of the swan who has
preserved it and though I can claim little from his justice I may
presume to value myself upon his charity It will be told me that I
have mistaken the Italian poet who means only that some excellent
writers almost as few in number as the swans have rescued the memory
of their patrons from forgetfulness and time when a vast multitude of
crows and vultures that is bad scribblers parasites and flatterers
oppressed by the weight of the names which they endeavoured to redeem
were forced to let them fall into Lethe where they were lost for ever
If it be thus my lord the table would be turned upon me but I should
only fail in my vain attempt for either some immortal swan will be
more capable of sustaining such a weight or you who have so long been
conversant in the management of great affairs are able with your pen
to do justice to yourself and at the same time to give the nation
a clearer and more faithful insight into those transactions wherein
you have worthily sustained so great a part for to your experience
in state affairs you have also joined no vulgar erudition which all
your modesty is not able to conceal for to understand critically the
delicacies of Horace is a height to which few of our noblemen have
arrived and that this is your deserved commendation I am a living
evidence as far at least as I can be allowed a competent judge on
that subject Your affection to that admirable Ode which Horace writes
to his Mecnas and which I had the honour to inscribe to you is not
the only proof of this assertion You may please to remember that
in the late happy conversation which I had with your lordship at a
noble relations of yours you took me aside and pleased yourself
with repeating to me one of the most beautiful pieces in that author
It was the Ode to Barine wherein you were so particularly affected
with that elegant expression Juvenumque prodis publica cura There
is indeed the virtue of a whole poem in those words that curiosa
felicitas which Petronius so justly ascribes to our author The
barbarity of our language is not able to reach it yet when I have
leisure I mean to try how near I can raise my English to his Latin
though in the mean time I cannot but imagine to myself with what
scorn his sacred manes would look on so lame a translation as I could
make His recalcitrat undique tutus might more easily be applied to
me than he himself applied it to Augustus Csar I ought to reckon
that day as very fortunate to me and distinguish it as the ancients
did with a whiter stone because it furnished me with an occasion
of reading my Cleomenes to a beautiful assembly of ladies where
your lordships three fair daughters were pleased to grace it with
their presence and if I may have leave to single out any one in
particular there was your admirable daughterinlaw shining not
like a star but a constellation of herself a more true and brighter
Berenice Then it was that whether out of your own partiality and
indulgence to my writings or out of complaisance to the fair company
who gave the first good omen to my success by their approbation your
lordship was pleased to add your own and afterwards to represent
it to the queen as wholly innocent of those crimes which were laid
unjustly to its charge Neither am I to forget my charming patroness
though she will not allow my public address to her in a dedication but
protects me unseen like my guardianangel and shuns my gratitude
like a fairy who is bountiful by stealth and conceals the giver when
she bestows the gift but my Lady Silvius has been juster to me
and pointed out the goddess at whose altar I was to pay my sacrifice
and thanksoffering and had she been silent yet my Lord Chamberlain
himself in restoring my play without any alteration avowed to me
that I had the most earnest solicitress as well as the fairest and
that nothing could be refused to my Lady Hyde

These favours my lord received from yourself and your noble family
have encouraged me to this dedication wherein I not only give you
back a play which had you not redeemed it had not been mine but
also at the same time dedicate to you the unworthy author with my
inviolable faith and how mean soever my utmost service and I shall
be proud to hold my dependance on you in chief as I do part of my
small fortune in Wiltshire Your goodness has not been wanting to me
during the reign of my two masters and even from a bare treasury my
success has been contrary to that of Mr Cowley and Gideons fleece has
then been moistened when all the ground has been dry about it
Such and so many provocations of this nature have concurred to my
invading of your modesty with this address I am sensible that it is
in a manner forced upon you but your lordship has been the aggressor
in this quarrel by so many favours which you were not weary of
conferring on me though at the same time I own the ambition on my
side to be ever esteemed

    Your Lordships most thankful

    And most obedient Servant

PREFACE


It is now seven or eight years since I designed to write this play of
Cleomenes and my Lord Falkland whose name I cannot mention
without honour for the many favours I have received from him is
pleased to witness for me that in a French book which I presented
him about that time there were the names of many subjects that I had
thought on for the stage amongst which this tragedy was one This
was out of my remembrance but my lord on the occasion of stopping
my play took the opportunity of doing me a good office at court by
representing it as it was a piece long ago designed which being
judiciously treated I thought was capable of moving compassion on the
stage The success has justified my opinion and that at a time when
the world is running mad after Farce the extremity of bad poetry or
rather the judgment that is fallen upon dramatic writing Were I in the
humour I have sufficient cause to expose it in its true colours but
having for once escaped I will forbear my satire and only be thankful
for my deliverance A great part of my good fortune I must confess
is owing to the justice which was done me in the performance I can
scarcely refrain from giving every one of the actors their particular
commendations but none of them will be offended if I say what the
town has generally granted that Mrs Barry always excellent has in
this tragedy excelled herself and gained a reputation beyond any
woman whom I have ever seen on the theatre After all it was a bold
attempt of mine to write upon a single plot unmixed with comedy
which though it be the natural and true way yet is not to the genius
of the nation Yet to gratify the barbarous party of my audience I
gave them a short rabblescene because the mob as they call them
are represented by Plutarch and Polybius with the same character of
baseness and cowardice which are here described in the last attempt of
Cleomenes They may thank me if they please for this indulgence
for no French poet would have allowed them any more than a bare
relation of that scene which debases a tragedy to show upon the stage

For the rest some of the mechanic rules of unity are observed and
others are neglected The action is but one which is the death of
Cleomenes and every scene in the play is tending to the accomplishment
of the main design The place is likewise one for it is all in the
compass of Alexandria and the port of that city The time might easily
have been reduced into the space of twentyfour hours if I would have
omitted the scene of famine in the fifth act but it pleased me to try
how Spartans could endure it and besides gave me the occasion of
writing that other scene betwixt Cleomenes and his suspected friend
and in such a case it is better to trespass on a rule than leave out
a beauty

As for other objections I never heard any worth answering and least
of all that foolish one which is raised against me by the sparks for
Cleomenes not accepting the favours of Cassandra They would not have
refused a fair lady I grant they would not but let them grant me
that they are not heroes and so much for the point of honour A
man might have pleaded an excuse for himself if he had been false
to an old wife for the sake of a young mistress but Cleora was in
the flower of her age and it was yet but honeymoon with Cleomenes
and so much for nature Some have told me that many of the fair sex
complain for want of tender scenes and soft expressions of love I
will endeavour to make them some amends if I write again and my next
hero shall be no Spartan

I know it will be here expected that I should write somewhat
concerning the forbidding of my play but the less I say of it the
better And besides I was so little concerned at it that had it not
been on consideration of the actors who were to suffer on my account
I should not have been at all solicitous whether it were played or
no Nobody can imagine that in my declining age I write willingly
or that I am desirous of exposing at this time of day the small
reputation which I have gotten on the theatre The subsistence which I
had from the former government is lost and the reward I have from the
stage is so little that it is not worth my labour

As for the reasons which were given for suspending the play it seems
they were so illfounded that my Lord Chamberlain no sooner took the
pains to read it but they vanished and my copy was restored to me
without the least alteration by his lordship It is printed as it was
acted and I dare assure you that here is no parallel to be found
it is neither compliment nor satire but a plain story more strictly
followed than any which has appeared upon the stage It is true it had
been garbled before by the superiors of the playhouse and I cannot
reasonably blame them for their caution because they are answerable
for any thing that is publicly represented and their zeal for the
government is such that they had rather lose the best poetry in the
world than give the least suspicion of their loyalty The short is
that they were diligent enough to make sure work and to geld it so
clearly in some places that they took away the very manhood of it I
can only apply to them what Cassandra says somewhere in the play to
Ptolemy

    To be so nice in my concerns for you
    To doubt where doubts are not to be too fearful
    To raise a bugbear shadow of a danger
    And then be frighted though it cannot reach you

But since it concerns me to be as circumspect as they are I have
given leave to my bookseller to print the life of Cleomenes as
it is elegantly and faithfully translated out of Plutarch by my
learned friend Mr Creech to whom the world has been indebted for
his excellent version of Lucretius and I particularly obliged in his
translation of Horace We daily expect Manilius from him an author
worthy only of such hands which having formerly revealed the secrets
of nature to us here on earth is now discovering to us her palace in
the skies and if I might be allowed to say it giving light to the
stars of heaven

    Erg vivida vis animi pervicit et extra
    Processit long flammantia moenia mundi


But to return to Plutarch you will find him particularly fond of
Cleomenes his character who as he was the last of the Spartan heroes
so he was in my opinion the greatest Even his enemy Polybius
though engaged in the contrary faction yet speaks honourably of him
and especially of his last action in Egypt This author is also made
English and will shortly be published for the common benefit

What I have added to the story is chiefly the love of Agathoclea the
kings mistress whose name I have changed into Cassandra only for
the better sound as I have also the name of Nicagoras into that of
Cnus for the same reason Cratesicla Pantheus and Sosybius are to
be found in the story with the same characters which they have in the
tragedy There is likewise mention made of the son of Cleomenes who
had resolution enough to throw himself headlong from a tower when he
had heard of his fathers ill success And for Cleora whom I make the
second wife of Cleomenes for giatis was dead before you will find a
hint of her in Plutarch for he tells us that after the loss of the
battle at Sellasia he returned to Sparta and entering his own house
was there attended by a freeborn woman of Megalopolis

The picture of Ptolemy Philopater is given by the forementioned
authors to the full Both agree that he was an original of his kind a
lazy effeminate cowardly cruel and luxurious prince managed by his
favourite and imposed on by his mistress The son of Sosybius whom I
call Cleanthes was a friend to Cleomenes but Plutarch says he at
length forsook him I have given him a fairer character and made it
only a seeming treachery which he practised If any be so curious to
enquire what became of Cassandra whose fortune was left in suspence at
the conclusion of the play I must first inform them that after the
death of Cleomenes the hero of my poem I was obliged by the laws of
the drama to let fall the curtain immediately because the action was
then concluded But Polybius tells us that she survived Ptolemy who
reigned about twentyseven years that with her brother Agathocles
she governed Egypt in the minority of his son Ptolemy Epiphanes and
that finally for oppressing of the people both the brother and
sister were slain in a popular insurrection

There is nothing remaining but my thanks to the town in general
and to the fair ladies in particular for their kind reception of my
play And though I cannot retract what I said before that I was not
much concerned in my own particular for the embargo which was laid
upon it yet I think myself obliged at the same time to render my
acknowledgments to those honourable persons who were instrumental
in the freeing it for as it was from a principle of nobleness in
them that they would not suffer one to want who was grown old in
their service so it is from a principle of another sort that I have
learned to possess my soul in patience and not to be much disquieted
with any disappointment of this nature

     The following verses were sent me by a young gentleman under
     twenty years of age whose modesty would have concealed his name
     but I learned it from another hand and have taken the boldness
     to subscribe it without his leave I presume that on the reading
     of them nobody can blame me for making Cleonidas speak above his
     youth when you see an Englishman so far surpassing my Spartan


TO MR DRYDEN ON HIS CLEOMENES

    Has youth then lost its great prerogative
    And does the soul alone for age survive
    Like embryos sleeping in their seeds seem nought
    Till friendly time does ripen it to thought
    Judgment experience that before was theirs
    But fancy wantons still in younger spheres
    Played with some loose and scattered beams of light
    And revelled in an anarchy of wit
    Both youth and age unequally did charm
    As much too cold was this as that too warm
    But you have reconciled their differing praise
    By fixing both to your immortal bays
    Where Fancy mounts but Judgment holds the reins
    Not checks but guides you to harmonious strains
    Tis harmony indeed tis all unite
    Like finished nature and divided light
    Like the vast order and its numerous throng      
    Crowded to their Almighty Makers song            
    Where heaven and earth seem but one single tongue 
    O wondrous man where have you learned the art
    To charm our reason while you wound the heart
    Far more than Spartan morals to inspire
    While your great accents kindle Spartan fire
    Thus metals heated to the artists will
    Receive the impression of a nobler skill
    Your hero formed so regularly good
    So nicely patient in his want of food
    That it no more th undress of death appears
    While the rich garment of your sense it wears
    So just a husband father son and friend
    Great in his life but greater in his end
    That sure like Xenophon you meant to shew     
    Not what they are but what they ought to do   
    At once a poet and instructor too             
    The parts so managed as if each were thine     
    Thou drawst both ore and metal from the mine   
    And to be seen thou makst even vice to shine 
    As if like Siams transmigrating god
    A single life in each you made abode
    And the whole business of the tedious round
    To copy patterns which in each you found
    Sure you have gained from heaven Promethean fire
    To form then kindle souls into desire
    Else why successive starts of hopes and fears
    A martial warmth first raised then quenched with tears
    Unless this truth shines clearly through the whole
    Sense rules the world but you command the soul

Footnote  The enemies of Dryden imputing to him the pitiful
jealousy of which they were probably themselves conscious pretended
that envious of the reputation which Creech acquired by his
translation of Lucretius Dryden insidiously pushed him on to attempt
a version of Horace a task for which he was totally unfit and by
which he forfeited all the credit he had gained The accusation is thus
stated by Tom Brown and may serve for a specimen of the underbred
petulance in which he indulges

Bays I have a certain profound stratagem still behind my Sacra
Anchora I call it which is only to be made use of upon extraordinary
occasions and which I was never forced to employ but once in my time
and is as follows When any young author has been so fortunate in his
first undertaking as to win himself the applause of all the world so
that tis impossible for one to ruin his reputation without running
the hazard of having his throat cut by all sort of company I am as
forward as the best of them all to commend his ingenuity to extol his
parts and promise him a copy of verses before his book if he honours
the world with a second edition

Crites Very good

Bays At the same time I privately feel his pulse and examine the
nature and inclination of the beast If he chances to be a little
saturnine like myself I set him upon a gay undertaking where tis
the devil and all of ill luck if he does not shipwreck all his former
credit But if he proves a man of a brisk and jolly temper I persuade
him of all loves to make an experiment of his abilities upon some
serious solemn subject tell him if ever he expects to be saved he
must out of hand do justice to the Psalms and Canticles which work
hes as incapable to manage egad as little David was to fight in
Sauls armour Thus gentlemen by engaging the author in a province
where he has not stock enough to carry on the plantation I never fail
one way or other to compass my designs and at longrun to defeat my
competitor

Crites Why Mr Bays this is like enjoining a painter that has a
good fancy at drawing of Saracens heads and grotesque figures only
to draw you a Venus or an Adonis where he must certainly miscarry
Now I am apt to fancy you trepanned the honest translator of Lucretius
with this profound piece of policy Come confess the truth man did
you not

Bays You could not have guessed better Mr Crites if you had dived
into my diaphragma for the secret It was not in my power you must
know either to suppress the work or to discommend it because to
give the gentleman his due it was performed beyond all expectation
and what was a mighty matter it suited as pat as might be with the
philosophy of the town that was then in fashion Now to undermine
and ruin him to all intents and purposes I took these measures I
flatter hug and caress him like an Achitophel as I was after the
strangest manner imaginable profess all the respect and friendship in
the world for him tell him that providence had certainly reserved him
for working miracles in poetry and that I had some ancient prophecies
by me at home which declared him to be the very person that was to
deliver the immortal writers of former ages out of that Algerine
captivity they had so long laboured under

Crites Well for daubing and wheedling Ill let thee loose to any
poet in Christendom

Bays That if by his mighty feat he could form those Irish atoms
of Lucretius into so regular and welldisciplined an army could
raise such harmony out of a dull unmusical philosopher how glorious
and exalted would his attempts be upon Horace or what might we not
expect from so advantageous so promising an undertaking And so
gentlemen with the help of a little incense and flattery I so cajoled
this sops crow that he presently dropt his Epicurean cheese out of
his mouth to sing one of his unmusical illturned Odes of Horace
I persuaded this Welch courser to leave his ragged unaccessible
precipices where there was no coming after him to try his strength
and feet upon good plain ground where an English vinegar horse I
knew would easily distance him The Reasons of Mr Bayes changing his
Religion considered in a Dialogue

Shields or whoever wrote Creechs Life in the collection to which
Theophilus Cibber gave his name has not only adopted this tale of
scandal but has added that the great contempt expressed by Dryden for
the translation of Horace gave the author a shock from which he never
recovered and in short occasioned his falling into lowspirits and
finally committing suicide The passage to which this note refers is
sufficient to clear our author from so gross and scandalous a reproach
It shews that after the publication of Creechs Horace he continued
in the most public manner not only to speak kindly and respectfully
of the translator but to stimulate him to new exertions It is hence
evident that no breach of friendship took place between them on this
occasion far less could Dryden have driven him to despair by harshness
or contempt The inference that Dryden urged Creech to attempt Horace
because he foresaw his failure seems the unfounded deduction of
calumny and envy In the dedication to the Translation of Horace which
is addressed to our author Creech himself bears the following strong
testimony to the liberality of Drydens sentiments

Tis you sir that have advanced our dramatic to its height and
showed that epic poetry is not confined to Italy and Greece That you
are honoured by the best and envied by others proclaims excellency
and worth for true honour is built only upon perfection and envy as
it is as sharp sighted so tis as soaring as an eagle and who ever
saw it stoop at a sparrow or a wren and that candour and goodness have
the greatest share in your composition I dare appeal to every one whom
you have any way favoured with your conversation these so fill your
mind that there is no room left for pride or any disobliging quality
This appears from the encouragement you are ready to give any tolerable
attempts and reach out a helping hand to all those who endeavour to
climb that height where you are already seated Even this owes its
completion to those smiles which you condescended to bestow upon some
parts of it and now ventures to appear a second time where at first
it found a favourable entertainment

The reader will observe that this dedication is prefixed to the
second edition of the Translation of Horace a circumstance which
confutes the assertion that Dryden ridiculed the work and indeed the
whole of a tale so malignantly invented by slander and repeated by
credulity

poem on astronomy to which Dryden refers

THE

LIFE OF CLEOMENES

TRANSLATED FROM PLUTARCH

BY

MR THOMAS CREECH


Thus fell Agis His brother Archidamus was too quick for Leonidas and
saved himself by a timely retreat But his wife then newly brought to
bed the tyrant forced her from her own house and compelled her to
marry his son Cleomenes though at that time too young for a wife for
he was unwilling that any one else should have her she being heiress
to her father Gylippuss great estate for person the finest woman in
all Greece very goodnatured of an exemplary life and therefore
they say she did all she could that she might not be compelled to
this match

Being thus married to Cleomenes she hated Leonidas but to the youth
she showed herself a kind and obliging wife He as soon as they came
together began to love her very much and the constant kindness
that she still retained for the memory of Agis wrought somewhat of
concern in the young man for him so that he would often enquire of
her concerning what had passed and attentively listen to the story of
Agiss designs Now Cleomenes had a generous and great soul he was
as temperate and moderate in his pleasures as Agis but not so very
cautious circumspect and gentle a spur of passion always galled him
and his eagerness to pursue that which he thought good and just was
violent and heady To make men willing to obey he conceived to be the
best discipline but likewise to break the stubborn and force them to
be better was in his opinion commendable and brave This disposition
made him dislike the management of the city The citizens lay
dissolved in supine idleness and pleasures the king minded nothing
designing if nobody gave him any disturbance to waste his time in
ease and riot the public was neglected and each man intent upon his
private gain It was dangerous now Agis was killed to mention the
exercising and training of their youth and to set up for the ancient
bravery and equality was treason against the state It is said also
that Cleomenes whilst a boy studied philosophy under Sphrus the
Borysthenite who coming to Sparta was very diligent in instructing
the youth Sphrus was one of the chief of Zeno the Citieans scholars
and it is likely that he admired the manly temper of Cleomenes and
inflamed his generous ambition The ancient Leonidas as story saith
being asked What manner of poet he thought Tyrtus replied An
excellent one to whet the courages of youth for being filled with
fury by his poems they daringly ventured on any danger Now the Stoic
philosophy is a dangerous incentive to hot and fiery dispositions but
being mixed with a grave and cautious temper is very good to fix and
settle the resolutions

Upon the death of his father Leonidas he succeeded and observing
the citizens of all sorts to be debauched the rich neglecting the
public and intent on their own gain and pleasure and the poor being
cramped in their private fortunes grown inactive cowards and not
inclinable to the Spartan institution and way of breeding that he
had only the name of King and the Ephori all the power was resolved
to change the present posture of affairs He had a friend whose name
was Xenares his lover such an affection the Spartans express by the
word empneithai him he sounded and of him he would commonly enquire
What manner of king Agis was by what means and by what assistance
he began and pursued his designs Xenares at first willingly complied
with his request and told him the whole story with all the particular
circumstances of the actions But when he observed Cleomenes to be
extremely affected at the relation and more than ordinarily moved at
Agiss new model of the government and begging a repetition of the
story he at first severely chid him told him he was frantic and at
last left off all sort of familiarity and conversation with him yet he
never told any man the cause of their disagreement but would only say
Cleomenes knew very well Cleomenes finding Xenares averse to his
designs and thinking all others to be of the same opinion consulted
with none but contrived the whole business by himself And considering
that it would be easier to bring about an alteration when the city was
at war than when in peace he engaged the commonwealth in a quarrel
with the Achans who had given them fair occasions to complain for
Aratus a man of the greatest power amongst all the Achans designed
from the very beginning to bring all the Peloponnesians into one
common body And to effect this he undertook many expeditions and ran
through a long course of policy for he thought this the only means to
make them an equal match for their foreign enemies All the rest agreed
to his proposals only the Lacedmonians the Eleans and as many of
the Arcadians as inclined to the Spartan interest refused Therefore
as soon as Leonidas was dead he fell upon the Arcadians and wasted
those especially that bordered on Achaia by this means designing to
try the inclinations of the Spartans and despising Cleomenes as a
youth and of no experience in affairs of state or war Upon this the
Ephori sent Cleomenes to surprise the Athenum dedicated to Minerva
near Belbina which is a pass of Laconia and was then under the
jurisdiction of the Megalopolitans Cleomenes possessed himself of
the place and fortified it at which action Aratus shewed no public
resentment but marched by night to surprise Tegea and Orchomenium The
design failed for those that were to betray the cities into his hands
doubted the success so Aratus retreated imagining that his design
had been undiscovered But Cleomenes wrote a jeering letter to him
and desired to know as from a friend whither he intended to march
at night And Aratus answering That having understood his design to
fortify Belbina he resolved to march thither to oppose him Cleomenes
returned That he believed it but desired him to give an account if
it stood with his convenience why he carried those torches and ladders
with him

Aratus laughing at the jeer and asking what manner of youth this was
Democrites a Spartan exile replied If you have any designs upon
the Lacedmonians begin before this young eagles talons are grown
Presently after this Cleomenes being in Arcadia with a few horse and
 foot the Ephori fearing to engage in the war commanded him
home but upon his retreat Aratus taking Caphu they commissioned him
again In this expedition he took Methudrium and spoiled the country
of the Argives and the Achans to stop his victory and secure
their friends sent  foot and  horse against him under the
command of Aristomachus Cleomenes faced them at Palantium and offered
battle but Aratus being dashed at his bravery would not suffer the
general to engage but retreated being cursed by the Achans and
hooted at and scorned by the Spartans who were not above  for
a coward Cleomenes encouraged by this success began to vaunt among
the citizens a sentence of one of their ancient kings who said The
Spartans seldom enquired how many their enemies were but where they
were After this marching to the assistance of the Eleans upon
whom the Achans warred and about Lycum falling upon the enemy in
their retreat he routed their whole army taking a great number of
captives and leaving many dead upon the place so that it was commonly
reported amongst the Greeks that Aratus was slain But Aratus making
the best advantage of the opportunity presently after the defeat
marched to Mantina and before any body suspected it took the city
and put a new garrison into it Upon this the Lacedmonians being quite
discouraged and opposing Cleomeness design of carrying on the war he
was eager to send for Archidamus Agiss brother from Messena for he
of the other family had a right to the kingdom and beside Cleomenes
thought that the power of the Ephori would be abated when the kingly
state was filled up and equally poised between the two families But
those that were concerned in the murder of Agis understanding the
design and fearing that upon Archidamuss return they should be
called to an account received him coming privately into town waited
on him and presently after murdered him but whether Cleomenes was
against it as Phylarchus imagines or whether he was persuaded by his
friends and winked at the contrivance is uncertain however they
were most blamed as having forced his consent But he still resolving
to newmodel the state bribed the Ephori to make him general and won
the affections of many others by means of his mother Cratesiclea who
spared no cost and was very zealous to promote the same interest and
though of herself she had no inclination to marry yet for her sons
sake she wedded one of the chiefest citizens for wealth and power
Cleomenes marching forth with the army now under his command took
Leuctra a place belonging to Megalopolis and the Achans quickly
facing him with a good body of men commanded by Aratus in a battle
under the very walls of the city some part of his army was routed but
Aratus commanding the Achans not to pass a deep hollow and stopping
the pursuit Lydiadas the Megalopolitan fretting at the orders
encouraging the horse which he led and pursuing the routed enemy fell
into a place full of vines hedges and ditches and being forced to
break his ranks was put into a great disorder Cleomenes observing the
advantage commanded the Tarentines and Cretans to engage him by whom
after a brave dispute he was routed and slain The Lacedmonians
thus encouraged with a great shout fell upon the Achans and routed
their whole army Of the slain which were very many some Cleomenes
delivered upon articles but the body of Lydiadas he commanded to be
brought to him and then putting on it a purple robe and a crown upon
its head sent a convoy with it to the gates of Megalopolis This
Lydiadas was the man that resigned his crown restored liberty to the
citizens and joined the city to the Achan interest Cleomenes being
very much raised by this success and persuaded that if matters were
wholly at his disposal he should quickly be too hard for the Achans
he taught Megistones his mothers husband that it was expedient for
the state to shake off the power of the Ephori and to put all their
wealth into one common stock for the whole body that Sparta being
restored to its old equality might be raised up to be mistress of all
Greece Megistones liked the design and engaged two or three more of
his friends About that time one of the Ephori sleeping in Pasiphaes
temple dreamed a very surprising dream for he thought he saw the
four chairs removed out of the place where the Ephori used to sit and
hear causes and one only set there and whilst he wondered he heard
a voice out of the temple saying This is best for Sparta The
person telling Cleomenes this dream he was a little troubled at first
fearing that he used this as a trick to sift him upon some suspicion
of his design but when he was satisfied that the relater spoke truth
he took heart again and taking with him those whom he thought would be
against his model he took Era and Alca two cities of the Achans
furnished Orchomenium with provisions besieged Mantina and with long
marches so harassed the Lacedmonians that many of them desired to be
left in Arcadia and he satisfied their request With the mercenaries
he marched to Sparta and by the way communicated his design to those
whom he thought fittest for his purpose and marched slowly that he
might catch the Ephori at supper When he was come near the city he
sent Eurycleidas to the Sussitium the eating place of the Ephori
under pretence of carrying some message from him from the army
Threicion Phbis and two of those who were bred with Cleomenes
whom they call Samothrac followed with a few soldiers and whilst
Eurycleidas was delivering his message to the Ephori they ran upon
them with their drawn swords and slew them Agesilaus as soon as he
was run through fell and lay as dead but in a little time he rose
silently conveyed himself out of the room and crept undiscovered into
a little house which was the temple of Fear and which always used
to be shut but was then by chance open being got in he shut the
door and lay close the other four were killed and above ten more
that came to their assistance To those that were quiet they did no
harm stopt none that fled the city and spared Agesilaus who came out
of the temple the next day The Lacedmonians have not only temples
dedicated to Fear but also to Death Laughter and the like passions
Now they worship Fear not as they do those deities which they dread
esteeming it hurtful but thinking their policy is chiefly kept up by
law and therefore the Ephori Aristotle is my author when they
enter upon their government make proclamation to the people that they
should shave their whiskers and be obedient to the laws that they
might not be forced to be severe using this trivial particular in my
opinion to accustom their youth to obedience even in the smallest
matters And the ancients I think did not imagine fortitude to be
plain fearlessness but a cautious fear of infamy and disgrace for
those that shew most fear towards the laws are most bold against their
enemies and those are least afraid of any danger who are most afraid
of a just reproach Therefore he said well

    A reverence still attends on fear

And Homer

    Feared you shall be dear uncle and revered

And again

    In silence fearing those that bore the sway

For it is very commonly seen that men reverence those whom they fear
and therefore the Lacedmonians placed the temple of Fear by the
Sussitium of the Ephori having raised their power to almost absolute
monarchy

The next day Cleomenes proscribed eighty of the citizens whom he
thought necessary to banish and removed all the seats of the Ephori
except one in which he himself designed to sit and hear causes and
calling the citizens together he made an apology for his proceedings
saying That by Lycurgus the senate was joined to the kings and that
that model of government had continued a long time and needed no other
sort of magistrates to give it perfection But afterward in the long
war with the Messenians when the kings being to command the army
had no time to attend civil causes they chose some of their friends
and left them to determine the suits of the citizens in their stead
These were called Ephori and at first behaved themselves as servants
to the kings but afterward by degrees they appropriated the power to
themselves and erected a distinct sort of magistracy An evidence of
the truth of this may be taken from the usual behaviour of the kings
who upon the first and second message of the Ephori refuse to go
but upon the third readily attend them and Asteropus the first that
raised the Ephori to that height of power lived a great many years
after their institution therefore whilst they modestly contained
themselves within their own proper sphere it was better to bear with
them than to make a disturbance But that an upstart introduced power
should so far destroy the old model of government as to banish some
kings murder others without hearing their defence and threaten those
who desired to see the best and most divine constitution restored in
Sparta was insufferable therefore if it had been possible for him
without bloodshed to have freed Lacedmon from those foreign plagues
luxury vanity debts and usury and from those more ancient evils
poverty and riches he should have thought himself the happiest king in
the world having like an expert physician cured the diseases of his
country without pain But now in this necessity Lycurguss example
favoured his proceedings who being neither king nor magistrate
but a private man and aiming at the kingdom came armed into the
marketplace and for fear of the king Carileus fled to the altar
but he being a good man and a lover of his country readily consented
to Lycurguss project and admitted an alteration in the state
Thus by his own actions Lycurgus showed that it was difficult to
correct the government without force and fear in using which he
said he would be so moderate as never to desire their assistance
but either to terrify or ruin the enemies of Spartas happiness and
safety He commanded that all the land should be left in common
and private claims laid aside that debtors should be discharged of
their debts and a strict search made who were foreigners and who
not that the true Spartans recovering their courage might defend
the city by their arms and that we may no longer see Laconia for
want of a sufficient number to secure it wasted by the tolians and
Illyrians Then he himself first with his fatherinlaw Megistones
and his friends brought all their wealth into one public stock and
all the other citizens followed the example The land was divided
and every one that he had banished had a share assigned him for
he promised to restore all as soon as things were settled and in
quiet and compleating the common number of citizens out of the best
and most agreeable of the neighbouring inhabitants he raised a body
of four thousand men and instead of a spear taught them to use a
sarissa a long pike with both hands and to carry their shields by
a string fastened round their arms and not by a handle as before
After this he began to consult about the exercising and breeding of
the youth many particulars of which Sphrus being then at Sparta
directed and in a short time the schools of exercise and their
Sussitia common eating places recovered their ancient decency
and order a few out of necessity but the most voluntarily applying
themselves to that generous and Laconic way of living Besides that
the name of monarch might give them no jealousy he made Eucleidas
his brother partner in the throne and that was the only time that
Sparta had two kings of the same family Then understanding that the
Achans and Aratus imagined that this change had disturbed and shaken
his affairs and that he would not venture out of Sparta and leave
the city now unsettled by so great an alteration he thought it great
and serviceable to his designs to convince his enemies that he was
eagerly desirous of a war and therefore making an incursion into
the territories of Megalopolis he wasted the country very much and
got a considerable booty And at last taking those that used to act
in the public solemnities travelling from Messena and building a
theatre in the enemys country and setting a prize of L  value
he sat spectator a whole day not that he either desired or needed
such a divertisement but as it were insulting over his enemies and
that by thus manifestly despising them he might show that he had
more than conquered the Achans For that alone of all the Greek
or kings armies had no stageplayers no jugglers no dancing or
singing women attending it but was free from all sorts of looseness
wantonness and foppery the young men being for the most part upon
duty and the old men teaching them at leisure time to apply themselves
to their usual drollery and to rally one another facetiously after
the Laconic fashion the advantages of which I have discovered in the
life of Lycurgus He himself instructed all by his example he was a
living pattern of temperance before every bodys eyes and his course
of living was neither more stately nor more expensive than any of the
commons And this was a considerable advantage to him in his designs
on Greece for men when they waited upon other kings did not so
much admire their wealth costly furniture and numerous attendance
as they hated their pride and state their difficulty of access and
scornful commanding answers to their petitions But when they came to
Cleomenes who was both really a king and bore that title and saw
no purple no robes of state upon him no chairs and couches about
him for his ease and that he did not receive petitions and return
answers after a long delay by a number of messengers waiters or by
bills but that he rose and came forward to meet those that came to
wait upon him stayed talked freely and graciously with all that had
business they were extremely taken won to his service and professed
that he alone was the true son of Hercules His common everydays
meal was in a mean room very sparing and after the Laconic manner
and when he entertained ambassadors or strangers two more beds were
added and a little better dinner provided by his servants but no
fricasees no dainties only the dishes were larger and the wine
more plentiful for he reproved one of his friends for entertaining
some strangers with nothing but pulse and black broth such diet as
they usually had in their Phiditia saying that upon such occasions
and when they treat strangers it was not requisite to be too exact
Laconians After supper a stand was brought in with a brass vessel
full of wine two silver pots which held almost a quart a piece a
few silver cups of which he that pleased might drink but no liquor
was forced on any of the guests There was no music nor was any
required for he entertained the company sometimes asking questions
sometimes telling stories and his discourse was neither too grave
and unpleasantly serious nor vain and abusive but merrily facetious
for he thought those ways of catching men by gifts and presents which
other kings use to be mean and inartificial and it seemed to him to
be the most glorious method and most suitable to a king to win the
affections of those that came near him by pleasant discourse and
unaffected conversation for a friend and mercenary differ only in
this that the one is made by conversation and agreeableness of humour
and the other by reward The Mantinans were the first that obliged
him for getting by night into the city and driving out the Achan
garrison they put themselves under his protection he restored them
their polity and laws and the same day marched to Tegea and a little
while after fetching a compass through Arcadia he made a descent upon
Pher in Achaia intending to force Aratus to a battle or bring him
into disrepute for refusing to engage and suffering him to waste the
country Hyperbatus at that time commanded the army but Aratus had all
the power amongst the Achans The Achans marching forth with their
whole strength and encamping in Dume about Hecatombum Cleomenes
came up and thinking it not advisable to pitch between Dume a city
of the enemys and the camp of the Achans he boldly dared the
Achans and forced them to a battle and routing the phalanx slew
a great many in the fight and took many prisoners thence marching
to Lagon and driving out the Achan garrison he restored the city
to the Elans The affairs of the Achans being in this desperate
condition Aratus who was wont to continue in his government above
a year refused the command though they entreated and urged him to
accept it and this was ill done when the storm was high to put the
power out of his own hands and set another to the helm Cleomenes
at first proposed fair and easy conditions by his ambassadors to the
Achans but afterwards he sent others and required the chief command
to be settled upon him and in other matters he promised to agree to
reasonable terms and to restore their captives and their country
The Achans were willing to come to an agreement upon those terms
and invited Cleomenes to Lerna where an assembly was to be held
but it happened that Cleomenes hastily marching on and unseasonably
drinking water brought up abundance of blood and lost his voice
therefore being unable to continue his march he sent the chiefest
of the captives to the Achans and putting off the meeting for some
time retired to Lacedmon This ruined the affairs of Greece which
was just then ready to recover itself out of its disasters and avoid
the insulting and covetousness of the Macedonians for Aratus whether
fearing or distrusting Cleomenes or envying his unlookedfor success
or thinking it a disgrace for him who had commanded thirtythree
years to have a young man succeed to all his glory and his power and
be head of that government which he had been raising and settling so
many years he first endeavoured to keep the Achans from closing with
Cleomenes but when they would not hearken to him fearing Cleomeness
daring spirit and thinking the Lacedmonians proposals to be very
reasonable who designed only to reduce Peloponnesus to its old model
he took his last refuge in an action which was unbecoming any of
the Greeks most dishonourable to him and most unworthy his former
bravery and exploits for he called Antigonus into Greece and filled
Peloponnesus with Macedonians whom he himself when a youth having
beaten their garrison out of the castle of Corinth had driven from the
same country beside he declared himself an enemy to all kings and
hath left many dishonourable stories of this same Antigonus in those
commentaries which he wrote and though he declares that he suffered
considerable losses and underwent great dangers that he might free
Athens from the power of the Macedonians yet afterward he brought
the very same men armed into his own country and his own house even
to the womens apartment He would not endure that one of the family
of Hercules and king of Sparta and one that had reformed the polity
of his country as it were a disordered harmony and tuned it to the
plain Doric measure of Lycurgus to be stiled head of the Triccans
and Sicyonians and whilst he fled the pulse and short coat and
which were his chief accusations against Cleomenes the extirpation
of wealth and reformation of poverty he basely subjected himself
together with Achaia to the diadem and purple to the imperious
commands of the Macedonians and their Satrap That he might not
seem to be under Cleomenes he sacrificed the Antigonea sacrifices
in honour of Antigonus and sung Pans himself with a garland on his
head to the honour of a rotten consumptive Macedonian I write this
not out of any design to disgrace Aratus for in many things he shewed
himself vigorous for the Grecian interest and a great man but out
of pity to the weakness of human nature which in such a person so
excellent and so many ways disposed to virtue cannot attain to a
state irreprehensible

The Achans meeting again at Argos and Cleomenes descending from
Tegea there were great hopes that all differences would be composed
But Aratus Antigonus and he having already agreed upon the chief
articles of their league fearing that Cleomenes would carry all before
him and either win or force the multitude to comply with his demands
proposed that having three hundred hostages put into his hands he
should come alone into the town or bring his army to the place of
exercise called Cillarabion without the city and treat there

Cleomenes hearing this said that he was unjustly dealt with for they
ought to have told him so plainly at first and not now he was come
even to their doors show their jealousy and deny him admission And
writing an epistle to the Achans about the same subject the greatest
part of which was an accusation of Aratus and Aratus on the other
side ripping up his faults to the assembly he hastily dislodged
and sent a trumpeter to denounce war against the Achans but not
to Argos but to gium as Aratus delivers that he might not give
them notice enough to make provision for their defence Upon this
the Achans were mightily disturbed the common people expecting a
division of the land and a release from their debts and the chief
men being on many accounts displeased with Aratus and some angry
and at odds with him as the occasion of the Macedonians descent
on Peloponnesus Encouraged by these misunderstandings Cleomenes
invades Acha and first took Pellene by surprise and beat out the
Achan garrison and afterwards brought over Pheneon and Pentelon
to his side Now the Achans suspecting some treacherous designs at
Corinth and Sicyon sent their horse and mercenaries out of Argos to
have an eye upon those cities and they themselves went to Argos to
celebrate the Nemean games Cleomenes advertised of this march and
hoping as it afterwards fell out that upon an unexpected advance
to the city now busied in the solemnity of the games and thronged
with numerous spectators he should raise a considerable terror and
confusion amongst them by night he marched with his army to the
walls and taking the quarter of the town called Aspis which lies
above the theatre a place well fortified and hard to be approached
he so terrified them that none offered to resist but agreed to accept
a garrison to give twenty citizens for hostages and to assist the
Lacedmonians and that he should have the chief command This action
considerably increased his reputation and his power for the antient
Spartan kings though they many ways endeavoured to effect it could
never bring Argos to be stedfastly and sincerely theirs And Pyrrhus
a most experienced captain and brave soldier though he entered the
city by force could not keep possession but was slain himself with
a considerable part of his army Therefore they admired the dispatch
and contrivance of Cleomenes and those that before derided him for
saying that he imitated Solon and Lycurgus in releasing the people
from their debts and in equally dividing the wealth of the citizens
were now persuaded that he was the cause of the desirable alterations
in the Spartan commonwealth For before they were very low in the
world and so unable to secure their own that the tolians invading
Laconia brought away fifty thousand slaves so that one of the elder
Spartans is reported to have said that they had done Laconia a
kindness by unburdening it and yet a little while after applying
themselves to their own customs and antient institutions they gave
notable instances of courage and obedience as if they had been under
the eye of Lycurgus himself and quickly raised Sparta to be head of
all Greece and recovered Peloponnesus to themselves Whilst Argos
was taken and Cleon and Philius sided with Cleomenes Aratus was at
Corinth searching after some who were reported to favour the Spartan
interest The news being brought to him disturbed him very much
for he perceived the city inclining to Cleomenes and the Achans
willing to be at ease therefore he called all the citizens into the
common hall and as it were undesignedly retreating to the gate he
mounted his horse that stood ready there and fled to Sicyon and the
Corinthians made such haste to Cleomenes at Argos that as Aratus
says striving who should be first there they spoiled all their
horses and Cleomenes was very angry with the Corinthians for letting
Aratus escape And Megistones came from Cleomenes to him desiring
him to deliver up the castle of Corinth which was then garrisoned
by the Achans and offered him a considerable sum of money and
that he answered that matters were not now in his power but he
in theirs Thus Aratus himself writes But Cleomenes marching from
Argos and taking in the Trzenians Epidaurians and Hermioneans came
to Corinth and blocked up the castle which the Achans would not
surrender and sending for Aratuss friends and stewards committed
his house and estate to their care and management and sent Tritimallus
the Messenian to him a second time desiring that the castle might
be equally garrisoned by the Spartans and Achans and promising to
Aratus himself double the pension that he received from king Ptolemy
but Aratus refusing the conditions and sending his own son with other
hostages to Antigonus and persuading the Achans to make a decree
for delivering the castle into Antigonuss hands Cleomenes invaded
the territory of the Sicyonians and by a decree of the Corinthians
seized on all Aratuss estate In the mean time Antigonus with a
great army passed Gerania and Cleomenes thinking it more advisable
to fortify and garrison not the Isthmus but the mountains called
Onia and by a long siege and skirmishes to weary the Macedonians
than to venture a set battle put his design in execution which very
much distressed Antigonus for he had not brought victuals sufficient
for his army nor was it easy to force a way through whilst Cleomenes
guarded the pass He attempted by night to pass through Lechum but
failed and lost some men so that Cleomenes and his army were mightily
encouraged and so flushed with the victory that they went merrily to
supper and Antigonus was very much dejected being reduced to those
miserable straits At last he designed to march to the promontory
Herum and thence transport his army in boats to Sicyon which would
take up a great deal of time and be very chargeable The same time
about evening some of Aratuss friends came from Argos by sea and
invited him to return for the Argives would revolt from Cleomenes
Aristotle was the man that wrought the revolt and he had no hard task
to persuade the common people for they were all angry with Cleomenes
for not releasing them from their debts as they expected Upon this
advertisement Aratus with fifteen hundred of Antigonuss soldiers
sailed to Epidaurus but Aristotle not staying for his coming drew
out the citizens and fought against the garrison of the castle and
Timoxenus with the Achans from Sicyon came to his assistance
Cleomenes heard the news about the second watch of the night and
sending for Megistones angrily commanded him to go and set things
right at Argos This Megistones was the man who passed his word for
the Argives loyalty and persuaded him not to banish the suspected
This Megistones he dispatched with two thousand soldiers and observed
Antigonus himself and encouraged the Corinthians pretending
that there was no great matter in the stirs at Argos but only a
little disturbance raised by a few inconsiderable persons But when
Megistones entering Argos was slain and the garrison could scarce
hold out and frequent messengers came to Cleomenes for succours
hefearing lest the enemy having taken Argos should shut up the
passes and securely waste Laconia and besiege Sparta itself which
he had left without forceshe dislodged from Corinth and presently
lost that city for Antigonus entered it and garrisoned the town He
turned aside from his direct march and assaulting the wall of Argos
endeavoured to break in and having cleared a way under the quarter
called Aspis he joined the garrison which still held out against the
Achans some parts of the city he scaled and took and his Cretan
archers cleared the streets But when he saw Antigonus with his
phalanx descending from the mountains into the plain and the horse on
all sides entering the city he thought it impossible to maintain his
post and therefore with all his men made a safe retreat behind the
wall having in a short time raised himself to a considerable height
and in one march made himself master of almost all Peloponnesus and
lost all again in as short a time for some of his allies presently
forsook him and others not long after put themselves under Antigonuss
protection His army thus defeated as he was leading back the relicks
of his forces some from Lacedmon met him in the evening at Tegea and
brought him news of as great a misfortune as that which he had lately
suffered and that was the death of his wife whom he doated on so
much that when he was most prosperous he would ever now and then make
a step to Sparta to visit his beloved giatis

This news afflicted him extremely and he grieved as a young man would
do for the loss of a very beautiful and excellent wife yet his passion
did not debase the greatness of his mind but keeping his usual
voice his countenance and his habit he gave necessary orders to his
captains and took care to secure the Tegeans The next day he retired
to Sparta and having at home with his mother and children bewailed
the loss and finished his mourning he presently appeared about the
public affairs of the state Now Ptolemy the king of Egypt promised
him assistance but demanded his mother and children for hostages
This for some considerable time he was ashamed to discover to his
mother and though he often went to her on purpose and was just upon
the discourse yet still refrained and kept it to himself so that she
began to suspect somewhat and asked his friends Whether Cleomenes
had somewhat to say to her which he was afraid to speak At last
Cleomenes venturing to tell her she laughed heartily and said Was
this the thing that you had often a mind to tell me and was afraid
Why do you not put me on shipboard and send this carcase where it
may be most serviceable to Sparta before age wastes it unprofitably
here Therefore all things being provided for the voyage they went
to Tnarus on foot and the army waited on them Cratesiclea when
she was ready to go on board took Cleomenes aside into Neptunes
temple and embracing him who was very much dejected and extremely
discomposed she said thus Go to king of Sparta when we are without
door let none see us weep or show any passion below the honour and
dignity of Sparta for that alone is in our own power as for success
or disappointments those wait on us as the Deity decrees Having
said thus and composed her countenance she went to the ship with her
little grandson and bade the pilot put presently out to sea When
she came to Egypt and understood that Ptolemy entertained proposals
and overtures of peace from Antigonus and that Cleomenes though the
Achans invited and urged him to an agreement was afraid for her
sake to come to any without Ptolemys consent she wrote to him
advising him to do that which was most becoming and most profitable
for Sparta and not for the sake of an old woman and a little child
always stand in fear of Ptolemy This character she maintained in her
misfortunes Antigonus having taken Tegea and plundered Orchomenum and
Mantina Cleomenes was shut up within the narrow bounds of Laconia
and made such of the Helots as could pay five Attick pounds free of
Sparta and by that means got together  talents and arming 
after the Macedonian fashion that he might make a body fit to oppose
Antigonuss Leucaspid white shields he undertook a very surprising
enterprize Megalopolis was at that time a city of itself as big and
as powerful as Sparta and had the forces of the Achans and Antigonus
encamping on its sides and it was chiefly the Megalopolitans doing
that Antigonus was called in to assist the Achans Cleomenes having
a design upon this city no action was ever more sudden and more
unexpected ordered his men to take five days provision and so marched
to Sellasia as if he intended to spoil the country of the Argives but
from thence making a descent into the territories of Megalopolis and
refreshing his army about Rhtium he marched through Helicon directly
to the city When he was not far off the town he sent Pantheus with
two regiments to surprise the Mesopyrgion the quarter between the
two towers which he understood to be the most unguarded quarter of
the Megalopolitans fortifications and with the rest of his forces
he followed leisurely Pantheus not only surprised that place but
finding a great part of the wall without guards he pulled down some
places and demolished others and killed all the defenders that he
found Whilst he was thus busied Cleomenes came up to him and was got
with his army within the city before the Megalopolitans knew of the
surprise At last as soon as it was discovered some left the town
immediately taking with them what money they had ready some armed
and engaged the enemy and though they were not able to beat them out
yet they gave their citizens time and opportunity safely to retire
so that there were not above  persons left in the town all the
rest flying with their wives and children and escaping to Messena
A great number of those that armed and fought the enemy were saved
and very few taken amongst whom were Lysandridas and Thearidas two
men of great power and reputation amongst the Megalopolitans and
therefore the soldiers as soon as they were taken brought them to
Cleomenes And Lysandridas as soon as he saw Cleomenes afar off
cried outNow king of Sparta it is in your power by doing a
most kingly and braver action than you have already performed to
purchase a considerable glory And Cleomenes guessing at his meaning
repliedWhat do you say Lysandridas sure you will not advise me to
restore your city to you again It is that which I mean Lysandridas
replied and I advise you not to ruin so brave a city but to fill
it with faithful and stedfast friends and allies by restoring their
country to the Megalopolitans and being the saviour of so considerable
a people Cleomenes paused a while and then saidIt is very hard
to trust so far in these matters but with us let profit always yield
to glory Having said this he sent the two men to Messena with a
trumpeter from himself offering the Megalopolitans their city again
if they would forsake the Achan interest and be on his side Though
Cleomenes made these kind and obliging proposals yet Philopmen would
not suffer them to break their league with the Achans and accusing
Cleomenes to the people as if his design was not to restore the city
but to take the citizens too he forced Thearidas and Lysandridas to
leave Messena

This was that Philopmen who was afterward chief of the Achans and
a man of the greatest reputation amongst the Greeks as I have made it
appear in his own Life This news coming to Cleomenes though he had
before taken such strict care that the city should not be plundered
yet then being in a fury and put out of all patience he rifled
them of all their coin plate and jewels and sent their statues
and pictures to Sparta and demolishing a great part of the city he
marched away for fear of Antigonus and the Achans but they never
stirred for they were in gium at a council of war Aratus mounted
the desk wept a long while and held his mantle before his face and
at last the company being amazed and commanding him to speak he
saidMegalopolis is ruined by Cleomenes The assembly was presently
dissolved the Achans being extremely surprised at the suddenness
and greatness of the loss and Antigonus intending to send speedy
succours when he found his army to gather very slowly out of their
winterquarters he sent them orders to continue there still and he
himself marched to Argos with a considerable body of men The second
enterprize of Cleomenes seemed to be carried on by extreme boldness
and unaccountable madness but yet in Polybiuss opinion was done
upon mature deliberation and exact foresight for knowing very well
that the Macedonians were dispersed into their winter quarters and
that Antigonus with his friends and a few mercenaries about him
wintered in Argos upon these considerations he invaded the country of
the Argives hoping to shame Antigonus to a battle upon unequal terms
or else if he did not dare to fight to bring him into disrepute with
the Achans And this accordingly happened for Cleomenes wasting
plundering and spoiling the whole country the Argives vexed at the
loss run in troops to the palace of the king and clamoured that he
should either fight or surrender his command to better and braver
men But Antigonus as became an experienced captain accounting it
dishonourable foolishly to hazard his army and quit his security
not to be abused and railed at by the rabble would not march out
against Cleomenes but stood fixed to the designs which he had laid
Cleomenes in the mean time brought his army up to the very walls
and having uncontrouledly spoiled the country and insulted over his
enemies drew off again A little while after being advertised that
Antigonus designed for Tegea and thence to make an incursion into
Laconia he hastily marched with his army another way and appeared
early in the morning before Argos and wasted the fields about it
the corn he did not cut down with reapinghooks and scythes as men
usually do but beat it down with staves made like scymeters and with
a great deal of contempt and wanton scorn he spoiled the fields and
wasted the country in his march yet when his soldiers would have set
Cyllabris the school of exercise on fire he hindered the attempt
reflecting upon serious consideration that the outrages committed at
Megalopolis were the effects of his passion rather than his wisdom
He pretended to make such little account of and so much to despise
Antigonus who first retired to Argos and afterward placed garrisons
on all the mountains round about that he sent a trumpeter to desire
the keys of Herum Junos temple that he might sacrifice to the
goddess Thus with a scoff and bitter reflection on Antigonus and
having sacrificed to the goddess under the walls of the temple that
was shut he marched to Phlius and from thence driving out those
that garrisoned Hologountum he marched down to Orchomenum And these
enterprizes not only encouraged the citizens but made him appear to
the very enemies to be an experienced captain and very worthy of
command for with the strength of one city not only to fight the
power of the Macedonians and all the Peloponnesians not only to
preserve Laconia from being spoiled but to waste the enemys country
and to take so many and such considerable cities is an argument of
no common bravery He that first said That money was the sinews of
affairs seemed chiefly in that saying to respect war and Demades
when the Athenians voted that a navy should be made ready but had no
money said They should make bread before they thought of sailing
and the old Archidamus in the beginning of the Peloponnesian war
when the allies desired that each partys share of contributions for
the war should be determined is reported to have said War cannot be
kept to a set diet For as wellbreathed wrestlers do in time weary
and tire out the most active and skilful combatant so Antigonus
coming to the war with a great stock of wealth wearied out Cleomenes
whose poverty made it difficult for him either to provide pay for the
mercenaries or provisions for the citizens For in all other respects
the time favoured Cleomenes for Antigonuss affairs at home began
to be disturbed for the Barbarians wasted and overran Macedonia
whilst he was absent and at that time a vast army of the Illyrians
came down to be freed from whose outrages the Macedonians sent for
Antigonus and the letters had almost been brought to him before the
battle was fought upon the receipt of which he presently dislodged
and left the Achans affairs to themselves But fortune that loves to
determine the greatest affairs by a minute in this conjuncture showed
such an exact niceness of time that immediately after the battle in
Sellasia was over and Cleomenes had lost his army and his city the
messengers reached Antigonus And this made Cleomeness misfortune
more to be pitied for if he had forborne fighting two days longer
there had been no need of hazarding a battle since upon the departure
of the Macedonians he might have had what conditions he pleased from
the Achans But now as I hinted before for want of money being
necessitated to rely wholly on his arms he was forced with 
this is Polybiuss account to engage  and approving himself
an excellent commander in this difficulty his citizens showing an
extraordinary courage and his mercenaries bravery enough he was
overborne by the different way of fighting and the weight of the armed
phalanx Besides Phylarchus affirms that the treachery of some about
him was the chief cause of Cleomeness ruin For Antigonus gave orders
that the Illyrians and Acharnanians should march round by a secret way
and encompass the other wing which Eucleidas Cleomeness brother
commanded and then drew out the rest of his forces to the battle And
Cleomenes from a convenient rising viewing his order and not seeing
any of the Illyrians and Acharnanians began to suspect that Antigonus
had sent them upon some such design and calling for Damoteles who was
to inspect and to provide against ambushes commanded him carefully to
look after and discover the enemys designs upon his rear

But Damoteles for some say Antigonus had bribed him telling him that
he should not be solicitous about that matter for all was well enough
but mind and fight those that met him in the front he was satisfied
and advanced against Antigonus and by the vigorous charge of his
Spartans made the Macedonian phalanx give ground and pressed upon
them with great advantage about half a mile but then making a stand
and seeing the danger which the surrounded wing commanded by his
brother Eucleidas was in he cried out Thou art lost dear brother
thou art lost thou brave example to our Spartan youth and theme of
our matrons songs

Eucleidass wing being thus cut in pieces and the conquerors from
that part falling upon his battle he perceived his soldiers to be
disordered and unable to maintain the fight and therefore provided
for his own safety When he came into the city he advised those
citizens that he met to receive Antigonus and as for himself he
said which should appear most advantageous to Sparta whether his life
or death that he would chuse Seeing the women running out to those
that fled with him taking their arms and bringing drink to them he
entered into his own house and his servant who was a freeborn woman
taken from Megalopolis after his wifes death offering as she used
to do to make necessary provision for him returning from the battle
though he was very thirsty he refused to drink and though very weary
to sit down but armed as he was he clapped his arm sideway to a
pillar and leaning his forehead upon his elbow he rested his body a
little while and ran over in his thoughts what course he should take
and then with his friends went presently to Gythium where finding
ships fitted for the purpose they embarked Antigonus taking the
city treated the Lacedmonians courteously and neither affronting
nor ruining the dignity of Sparta but permitting them to enjoy their
own laws and polity and sacrificing to the gods dislodged the third
day for he heard that there was a great war kindled in Macedonia and
that the country was spoiled by the Barbarians besides he grew sick
of a consumption and continual defluxion on the lungs yet he still
kept up that he might return and free his own country and fall more
gloriously upon an heap of slaughtered barbarians As Phylarchus says
and it is probable he broke a vein by shouting in the battle In the
plays it was said that after the victory he cried out for joy O
fine day and presently bringing up abundance of blood fell into a
fever and died in a short time And thus much concerning Antigonus

Cleomenes sailing from Cyther touched at another island called
gialia whence as he was about to depart from Cyrene one of
his friends Therycion by name a man of an haughty spirit in all
enterprizes and high and boasting in his talk came privately to him
and said thus Sir death in battle which is the most glorious we
have let go though all heard us say that Antigonus should never tread
over the king of Sparta unless dead and now that which is next in
bravery and glory is presented to us Whither do we madly sail flying
that which is near and seeking that which is far removed For if it
is not dishonourable for the race of Hercules to serve the successors
of Philip and Alexander we shall save a long voyage by delivering
ourselves up to Antigonus who probably surpasseth Ptolemy as much as
the Macedonians do the Egyptians but if we think it mean to submit to
those whose arms have conquered us why should we choose him for our
lord by whom we have not yet been beaten Is it that instead of one
we might appear meaner than two whilst we fly Antigonus and flatter
Ptolemy Or is it for your mothers sake that you retreat to Egypt
It will indeed be a very fine and very desirable sight for her to be
shown her son by Ptolemys women now changed from a prince into an
exile and a slave Are we not still masters of our own swords And
whilst we have Laconia in view shall we not here free ourselves from
this disgraceful misery and clear ourselves to those who at Sellasia
died for the honour and defence of Sparta Or shall we sit lazily in
Egypt enquiring what news from Sparta and whom Antigonus hath been
pleased to make governor of LacedmonThus spoke Therycion and this
was Cleomeness replyBy seeking death you coward the most easy
and most ready refuge you fancy that you shall appear courageous and
brave though this flight is baser than thy former Better men than we
have given way to their enemies having been betrayed by fortune or
oppressed by multitudes but he that sinks under labour or afflictions
the opinions or reproaches of men is overcome by his own effeminacy
and softness for a voluntary death ought not to be chosen as a relief
from action but as an exemplary action itself and it is base either
to live or die only to ourselves That death to which you now invite
us is proposed only as a release from our present miseries but
carries nothing of bravery or profit in it And I think it becomes
both me and you not to despair of our country but when there are
no hopes of that left those that have an inclination may quickly
dieTo this Therycion returned no answer but as soon as he could
get out of Cleomeness company went toward the shore and ran himself
through But Cleomenes sailed from gialia landed in Lybia and being
honourably conducted through the kings country came to Alexandria
When he was first brought to Ptolemy no more than common civilities
and usual ceremonies were paid him but when upon trial he found
him a man of deep sense and great reason and that his plain laconic
way of conversation carried a free pleasantness with it that he did
nothing unbecoming the greatness of his birth nor bent under fortune
and appeared a more faithful counsellor than those who made it their
business to please and flatter he was ashamed and repented that he
had neglected so great a man and suffered Antigonus to get so much
power and reputation by ruining him Therefore he heaped up honours and
kindnesses on Cleomenes and gave him hopes that he would furnish him
with an army and a navy to recover Greece and reinstate him in his
throne Besides he allowed him a yearly pension of fourandtwenty
talents a little part of which sum supplied his and his friends
thrifty temperance and the rest was employed in doing good offices to
and in relieving the necessities of those that fled Greece and retired
into Egypt

But the elder Ptolemy dying before Cleomeness affairs had received
a full dispatch and the successor being a loose voluptuous and
effeminate prince under the power of his pleasures and his women his
business was neglected for the king was so besotted with his women and
his wine that balls music and dancing were the only employments
of his most busy and serious hours and the greatest affairs of state
were managed by Agathoclea the kings mistress her mother and the
pimp Oinanthes Therefore at the first they seemed to stand in need
of Cleomenes for Ptolemy being afraid of his brother Magas who
by his mothers means had a great interest among the soldiers took
Cleomenes into his cabinet council and acquainted him with the design
of taking off his brother He though all were for it declared his
opinion to the contrary saying The king if it were possible should
have more brothers for the better security and management of his
affairs And Sosibius the greatest favourite replying That they
were not secure of the mercenaries whilst Magas was alive Cleomenes
returned That he need not trouble himself about that matter for
amongst the mercenaries there were above three thousand Peloponnesians
who were his fast friends and whom he could command at any time
with his nod This discourse made Cleomenes for the present to be
looked upon as a man of integrity and power but afterwards Ptolemys
weakness increasing his fear as it usually happens where there is
no judgment and wisdom at the bottom placing his security in jealousy
and suspicion rendered Cleomenes suspected to the courtiers as having
too much interest with the mercenaries and many had this saying in
their mouths That he was a lion amidst a flock of sheep for such
he seemed to be in the court slily overlooking and taking notice of
the management of affairs therefore when he desired a navy and an
army from the king his petition was rejected But when he understood
that Antigonus was dead that the Achans were engaged in a war with
the tolians and that the affairs of Peloponnessus being now in very
great distraction and distress required and invited his assistance
he desired leave to depart only with his friends but could not obtain
that the king not so much as hearing his petition being shut up
amongst his women and wasting his hours in debauchery and frolics But
Sosibius the chief minister of state thought that Cleomenes being
detained against his will would grow ungovernable and dangerous and
yet it was not safe to let him go being an aspiring daring man and
well acquainted with the diseases and weakness of the kingdom for no
presents no gifts could win him to compliance But as the ox Apis
though revelling in all possible plenty and delight yet desires to
live as nature would provide for him to be at liberty and frisk about
the fields and can scarce endure to be under the priests keeping so
he could not brook their courtship and tender entertainment but like
Achilles

Whilst there his heart did waste with secret grief And he was eager
for the noisy wars

His affairs standing in this condition Nicagoras the Messenian
came to Alexandria a man that deeply hated Cleomenes yet pretended
to be his friend for he had formerly sold Cleomenes a fair estate
but never received the money because Cleomenes was either unable
as it may be or else by reason of his engagement in the wars and
other distractions had no time to pay him Cleomenes seeing him
landing for he was then walking upon the key kindly saluted him
and asked What business brought him to Egypt Nicagoras returned
his compliment and told him That he came to bring some excellent
warhorses to the king And Cleomenes with a smile subjoined I
wish you had rather brought pimps whores and pathics for those now
are the kings chief delight Nicagoras at the present smiled at
the conceit but a few days after he put Cleomenes in mind of the
estate that he had bought of him and desired his money protesting
that he would not have troubled him if his merchandize had turned
to that account which he thought it would Cleomenes replied That
he had not a penny left of all that had been given him at which
answer Nicagoras being nettled told Sosibius Cleomenes scoff upon
the king He caressed him for the discovery but desiring to have
some greater reason to excite the king against Cleomenes persuaded
Nicagoras to leave a letter written against Cleomenes importing
that he had a design if he could have gotten ships and soldiers
to surprise Cyrene Nicagoras wrote such a letter and left Egypt
Four days after Sosibius brought the letter to Ptolemy pretending
it was just then delivered him and with a bitter invective excited
the fury of the youth Upon this it was agreed that Cleomenes should
be invited into a large apartment and treated as formerly but not
suffered to go out again This usage was grievous to Cleomenes and by
this unlucky accident his hopes for the future seemed to be quite
dashed Ptolemy the son of Chrysermas a favourite of the kings
always carried himself fairly towards Cleomenes they contracted a near
acquaintance and would talk freely together about the state He at
Cleomeness desire came to him had some discourse with him upon a few
and inconsiderable subjects to avoid suspicion and made some excuses
for the king but as he went out again not knowing that Cleomenes
followed him to the door he very severely reprimanded the keepers
for their carelessness in looking after so great and so furious a
wild beast This Cleomenes himself heard and retiring before Ptolemy
perceived it told his friends what he had heard Upon this they cast
off all their former hopes and determined for violent proceedings
resolving to be revenged on Ptolemy for his base and unjust dealing to
have satisfaction for the affronts to die as it became Spartans and
not stay till like fatted sacrifices they were butchered for it was
both grievous and dishonourable for Cleomenes who had scorned to come
to terms with Antigonus a brave warrior and a man of action to wait
an effeminate kings leisure till he should lay aside his fiddle and
end his dance and then kill him These courses being resolved on and
Ptolemy happening at the same time to make a progress to Canopus they
first spread abroad a report that his freedom was ordered by the king
and it being the kings custom to send presents and an entertainment
to those whom he would free Cleomeness friends made that provision
and sent it into the prison thereby deceiving the keepers who thought
it had been sent by the king for he sacrificed and gave them large
portions and with a crown upon his head feasted and made merry with
his friends It is said that he began the action sooner than he
designed having understood that a servant of one of the accomplices
lay abroad with a mistress that he loved This made him afraid of a
discovery and therefore as soon as it was full noon and all the
keepers drunk and fast asleep he put on his coat and opening the seam
on his right shoulder with his sword drawn in his hand he issued
forth together with his friends provided in the same manner making
thirteen in all One of them by name Hippotas was lame he followed
the first onset very well but when afterwards he perceived that they
were more slow in their advances for his sake he desired them to run
him through and not ruin their enterprise by staying for an useless
unprofitable man By chance an Alexandrian was then riding by the door
him they threw off and setting Hippotas on horseback ran through the
narrow lanes and proclaimed liberty to the people but they it seems
had courage enough to praise and admire Cleomeness daring but not one
had the heart to follow and assist him Three of them fell on Ptolemy
the son of Chrysermas as he was coming out of the palace and killed
him another Ptolemy the lieutenant of the city advancing against
them in a chariot they set upon dispersed his guards and attendants
and pulling him out of the chariot killed him upon the place Then
they made toward the castle designing to break open the prison and
take the prisoners to their assistance but the keepers were too quick
for them and secured the passages Being baffled in this attempt
Cleomenes with his company roamed about the city none joining with
them but all retreating from and flying his approach therefore
despairing of success and saying to his friends That it was no
wonder that women ruled over those men that fled liberty he excited
them all to die as bravely as became his followers and men of their
glorious performances This said Hippotas was first as he desired
run through by one of the young men and then each of them readily and
resolutely fell upon his own sword except Pantheus that Pantheus that
first surprised Megalopolis This man being a very handsome person
and a better companion than any of the youth the king loved and bade
him when he had seen him and the rest fallen die by their example
Pantheus walked over them as they lay and pricked every one with his
dagger to try whether any was alive when he pricked Cleomenes in
the leg and saw him turn upon his back he kissed him sat down by
him and when he was quite dead covered his carcase and then killed
himself upon his body

Thus fell Cleomenes that great brave man after he had been king of
Sparta sixteen years The news of their fall being noised through the
city Cratesiclea though a woman of a great spirit could not bear up
against the insupportable weight of this affliction but embracing
Cleomeness children made grievous lamentations but the eldest boy
none suspecting such a spirit in a child threw himself headlong from
the top of the house he was bruised very much but not killed by the
fall and was taken up crying and expressing his resentment for not
being permitted to destroy himself Ptolemy as soon as an account of
the action was brought him gave order that Cleomeness body should
be flayed and hung up that his children mother and the women that
were with her should be killed Among those was Pantheuss wife a
very fair woman and of a stately carriage who had been but newly
married and suffered these disasters in the height of her love Her
parents would not let her embark with Pantheus presently after they
were married though she eagerly desired it but shut her up and kept
her by violence at home yet a few days after she got a horse and a
little money and escaping by night made speed to Tnarus where
she embarked for Egypt came to her husband and with him cheerfully
endured to live in a foreign country She led Cratesiclea as she was
going with the soldiers to execution held up her train and begged her
to be courageous who of herself was not in the least afraid of death
and desired nothing else but only to be killed before the children
When they were come to the place of execution the children were first
killed before Cratesicleas eyes and afterwards she herself with
only these words in her mouth O children whither are you gone But
Pantheuss wife girding her garments close to her and being a strong
woman without any noise or lamentation looked after every one that
was slain and wound them up as well as her present circumstances would
permit and after all were killed dressing herself bound her clothes
close about her and suffering none to come near or be an eye witness
of her fall beside the executioner she courageously submitted to the
stroke and wanted nobody to look after or wind her up after she was
dead Thus in her death the modesty of her mind appeared and set
the guard upon her body which she always kept when alive and she in
the declining age of the Spartans shewed that women were no unequal
rivals of the men and was an instance of such a courage as would not
sneak to the affronts of fortune A few days after those that watched
the hanging body of Cleomenes saw a very great snake winding about
his head and covering his face so that no bird of prey should fly at
it This made the king superstitiously afraid and set the women upon
several lustrations as if he had been an extraordinary man and one
beloved by the gods that had been slain And the Alexandrians made
processions to the place and gave Cleomenes the title of Hero and
the Son of the gods till the philosophers satisfied them by saying
That as oxen breed bees putrefying horses breed hornets and beetles
rise from the carcases of dead asses so the humours and juices of
the marrow of a mans body coagulating produce serpents And this
the antients observing appropriated a serpent rather than any other
creature to heroes




PROLOGUE

SPOKEN BY MR MOUNTFORD


    I think or hope at least the coast is clear
    That none but men of wit and sense are here
    That our BearGarden friends are all away
    Who bounce with hands and feet and cry Play Play
    Who to save coachhire trudge along the street
    Then print our matted seats with dirty feet
    Who while we speak make love to orangewenches
    And between acts stand strutting on the benches
    Where got a cockhorse making vile grimaces
    They to the boxes show their booby faces
    A MerryAndrew such a mob will serve
    And treat them with such wit as they deserve
    Let them go people Ireland where theres need
    Of such new planters to repair the breed
    Or to Virginia or Jamaica steer
    But have a care of some French privateer
    For if they should become the prize of battle
    Theyll take them black and white for Irish cattle
    Arise true judges in your own defence
    Controul these foplings and declare for sense
    For should the fools prevail they stop not there
    But make their next descent upon the fair
    Then rise ye fair for it concerns you most
    That fools no longer should your favours boast
    Tis time you should renounce them for we find
    They plead a senseless claim to womankind
    Such squires are only fit for countrytowns
    To stink of ale and dust a stand with clowns
    Who to be chosen for the lands protectors
    Tope and get drunk before their wise electors
    Let not farce lovers your weak choice upbraid
    But turn them over to the chambermaid
    Or if they come to see our tragic scenes
    Instruct them what a Spartan hero means
    Teach them how manly passions ought to move
    For such as cannot think can never love
    And since they needs will judge the poets art
    Point them with fescues to each shining part
    Our author hopes in you but still in pain
    He fears your charms will be employed in vain
    You can make fools of wits we find each hour
    But to make wits of fools is past your power

CLEOMENES

THE

SPARTAN HERO




ACT I


SCENE IThe SeaPort of Alexandria

Enter CLEOMENES

    Cleom Dejected no it never shall be said
    That fate had power upon a Spartan soul
    My mind on its own centre stands unmoved
    And stable as the fabric of the world
    Propt on itself still I am Cleomenes
    I fought the battle bravely which I lost
    And lost it but to Macedonians
    The successors of those who conquered Asia
    Twas for a cause too such a cause I fought
    Unbounded empire hung upon my sword
    Greece like a lovely heifer stood in view
    To see the rival bulls each other gore
    But wished the conquest mine
    I fled and yet I languish not in exile
    But here in Egypt whet my blunted horns
    And meditate new fights and chew my loss
    Ah why ye gods must Cleomenes wait
    On this effeminate luxurious court
    For tardy helps of base Egyptian bands
    Why have not I whose individual mind
    Would ask a nation of such souls to inform it
    Why have not I ten thousand hands to fight
    It all myself and make the work my own

Enter CRATESICLEA CLEORA and CLEONIDAS

    Crat Is this well done or like the king of Sparta
    Or like my son to waste your time in tears
    What have you done that you avoid mankind
    And sculk in corners like a guilty slave

    Cleor We have been seeking you my dearest lord
    Through all the shady walks and dark retreats
    Of secret care that false deluding friend
    That only sooths and keeps you company
    To prey upon your last remains of life

    Cleom Ive heard you                           Sighs

    Crat Hear her still she tells you true
    This melancholy flatters but unmans you
    What is it else but penury of soul
    A lazy frost a numbness of the mind
    That locks up all the vigour to attempt
    By barely cryingtis impossible

    Cleom You both mistake meThat I grieve tis true
    But tis a grief of fury not despair
    And if a manly drop or two fall down
    It scalds along my cheeks like the green wood
    That sputtering in the flame works outward into tears

    Cleor Why would you leave me then and be alone
    Indeed it was a churlish kind of sorrow
    Indeed it was to engross it all yourself
    And not permit me to endure my share
    Think you because I am of tender mould
    I cannot suffer and partake your burdens
    Alas I suffer more by not partaking

    Cleom My wife my mother O Im so divided
    That I grieve most for both and love both most
    Two twining vines about this elm whose fall
    Must shortlyvery shortly crush you both
    And yet I will not go to ground
    Without a noble ruin round my trunk
    The forest shall be shaken when I sink
    And all the neighbouring trees
    Shall groan and fall beneath my vast destruction

    Crat Thats something yet an earnest of an action
    Another groan or two and all goes well

    Cleom Well I will live

    Crat Thou shalt

    Cleom Ill try at least

    Crat Do not go back and beat off what thou saidst

    Cleon Peace peace good grandmother he lives already
    And conquers too in saying he will try
    Nay if the king of Sparta says hell dot
    I ask no more than that
    For tis below a king to tell a lie

    Cleor But wheres the means

    Cleon The means is in the daring
    Had my own mother lived and asked that question
    I should have thought my father had begot me
    Without her help as Pallas sprung from Jove

    Cleor Thinkst thou he can defend us all alone

    Cleon No for I mean to help him

    Cleom Thats my boy my hopeful lions whelp
                                          Takes and kisses him

    Cleor So Hector hugged his young Astyanax
    Went out to fight and never saw him more

    Cleon But why did not Astyanax go with Hector

    Crat Because he was a child and could not go

    Cleon Was he a Spartan child

    Cleor Oh no a Trojan

    Cleon Theres it a Trojan child But grant me this
    There are no Spartan children we are born men
    And though you say I have but fifteen years
    We Spartans take ten strides before our age
    And start beyond dull nature

    Cleom Let me but live to shadow this young plant
    From blights and storms hell soon shoot up a hero
    He must I got him in the pride of conquest
    For coming back from my first maiden battle
    Wherein I made the great Aratus fly
    And added all his laurels to my brow
    I well remember that I spurred it hard
    And like a meteor shot before my troops
    To reach my love that night I was bridegroom
    Or scarce had lost that name and stealing home
    According to my countrys modest use
    I found my giatis just undrest
    Wearying the gods with vows for my return
    My transport was so great I could not stay
    But kissed and took her trembling in my arms
    And in that fury of my love I stampt
    This image of my soul

Enter PANTHEUS

    What my Pantheus
    Where hast thou been this long long year of hours

    Panth Where I have past a merry mornings walk
    With the best company

    Cleom With whom

    Panth Why with myself in laughing at the world
    Making a farce of life where knaves and fools
    And madmen thats all human kind were actors

    Cleom And what part acted you

    Panth As little as I could and daily would have less
    So please the gods for thats a wise mans part

    Cleom Would I could share thy balmy even temper
    And milkiness of blood

    Panth You may

    Cleom As how

    Panth By but forgetting you have been a king

    Cleom Then must I rust in Egypt never more
    Appear in arms and be the chief of Greece
    Now by yon blue palace
    The mansion of my great forefather Hercules
    I would lose oer again Sellasias field
    Rather than fight behind
    When proud Aratus led the Grecian van

    Cleon What when the lively trumpets sound a charge
    The word of battle may be Hercules
    And after our great grandsires name Aratus
    CriesCleomenes bring you up the rear

    Panth If fortune takes not off this boy betimes
    Hell make mad work and elbow all his neighbours

    Cleon My neighbours Little Elbow all the world
    And push off kings like counters from the board
    To place myself the foremost

    Panth What wilt thou be young cockeril when thy spurs
    Are grown to sharpness

    Cleon Why Ill be a Spartan
    For if I said a king I should say less
    I mean a Spartan while I live on earth
    But when in heaven Ill stand next Hercules
    And thrust between my father and the god

    Cleor Do you not view my lord
    As in a glass your darling fault ambition
    Reflected in your son

    Cleom My virtue rather
    I love to see him sparkle out betimes
    For twas my flame that lighted up his soul
    Im pleased with my own work Jove was not more
    With infant nature when his spacious hand
    Had rounded this huge ball of earth and seas
    To give it the first push and see it roll
    Along the vast abyss

    Cleon My mother would have had my youth brought up
    To spin with girls in Sparta

    Crat Well said my boy yet Hercules they say
    Took up the distaff once

    Cleon Yes when he had been conquered by a woman

    Panth To CLEOM One thing I have forgot which may import you
    Youll suddenly hear news from Greece

    Cleom Thou wert
    Indeed forgetful not to tell me that
    For from my first arrival on this coast
    This fatal Egypt where I fled for refuge
    In three long months I have not heard from Greece
    What makes thee think I shall have news so soon

    Panth As walking on the beach I saw a ship
    Just entering in the port and on the deck
    Stood Cnus

    Cleom Cnus saidst thou

    Panth Yes our Cnus the rich Messenian lord
    I saw and knew him but amidst the shouts
    Of mariners and busy care to sling
    His horses soon ashore he saw not me

    Cleom Then shall I hear of thee once more dear country
    I fear too soon shall hear how proud Antigonus
    Led oer Eurotas banks his conquering troops
    And first to wondering Sparta shewed a king
    A king that was not hers
    Then I shall hear of sacrilege and murders
    And fires and rapes on matrons and on maids

    Panth Such news we must expect

    Cleom O happy ghosts
    Of those that fell in the last fatal fight
    And lived not to survive their countrys loss
    Base as I was I should have fallen there too
    But first have raised a mountain of the dead
    To choke their way to Sparta

    Panth Thus I knew
    Your blood would boil and therefore I delayed
    So long to tell you Cnus was arrived

    Cleom Go
    My mother my Cleora and my boy
                                    Stroking CLEON
    Your ears would be polluted with such ills
    Which I must try to mollify before
    They reach your tender hearing

    Cleor I obey you
    But let not grief disorder you too much
    For what you lost
    For me while I have you and you are kind
    I ask no more of heaven

    Cleon I go too
    Because my king and father bids me go
    Else I have sternness in my soul enough
    To hear of murders rapes and sacrilege
    For those are soldiers work and I would hear them
    To spur me to revenge
      Exeunt CRAT CLEORA and CLEON

    Panth Hes here already
    Now bear it like yourself

    Cleom Im armed against it

Enter CNUS salutes CLEOMENES

    Cn I heard sir you were refuged in this court
    And come to beg a favour

    Cleom Good a favour
    Sure thou mistakest me for a king of Egypt
    And thinkst I govern here

    Cn Youre Cleomenes

    Cleom No thanks to heaven for that I should have died
    And then I had not been this Cleomenes

    Panth You promised patience sir

    Cleom Thou art a scurvy monitor I am patient
    Do I foam at lips
    Or stare at eyes Methinks I am wondrous patient
    Now thou shalt see how I can swallow gall
    I prythee gentle Cnus tell the story  Speaking softly
    Of ruined Sparta leave no circumstance
    Untold of all their woes and I will hear thee
    As unconcerned as if thou toldst a tale
    Of ruined Troy I prythee tell us how
    The victors robbed the shrines polluted temples
    Ransacked each wealthy houseNo spare me that
    Poor honest Sparta had no wealth to lose
    But Raises his voice when thou comst to tell of matrons ravished
    And virgins forced then raise thy voice
    And let me hear their howlings
    And dreadful shrieks as in the act of rape

    Panth Again you are distempered

    Cleom Softly Peace I am not
    I was but teaching him to grace his tale
    With decent horror

    Cn Your sick imagination feigns all this
    Now hear a truth and wonder

    Cleom Has not the conqueror been at Sparta

    Cn Yes

    Cleom Nay then I know what follows victory

    Panth You interrupt as if you would not know

    Cn Thenif you will imaginethink some king
    Who loved his people took a peaceful progress
    To some far distant place of his dominions
    Smiled on his subjects as he rode in triumph
    And strewed his plenty wheresoeer he passed
    Nay raise your thoughts yet higherthink some deity
    Some better Ceres drawn along the sky
    By gentle dragons scattered as she flew
    Her fruitful grains upon the teeming ground
    And bade new harvests rise

    Cleom Do we dream Pantheus

    Panth No sure we are awake but tis he dreams

    Cn The soldiers marched as in procession slow
    And entered Sparta like a choir of priests
    As if they feared to tread on holy ground
    No noise was heard no voice but of the crier
    Proclaiming peace and liberty to Sparta
    At that a peal of loud applause rang out
    And thinned the air till even the birds fell down
    Upon the shouters heads the shops flew open
    And all the busy trades renewed their tasks
    No law was changed no custom was controuled
    That had Lycurgus lived or you returned
    So Sparta would have shown

    Panth If this be true

    Cleom If this indeed be true
    Then farewell Sparta

    Cn Hear me out
    He reaped no fruit of conquest but their blessings
    Nor staid three days in Sparta summoned thence
    With sudden news that a barbarian host
    Was entered Macedonia
    And like a mighty deluge rolling on
    Swept all before them Thus alarmed he left us
    Marched homeward met and fought them nay and lived
    To say the field is mine

    Panth Died of his wounds

    Cn Not so but straining loud his feeble voice
    To animate his soldiers broke a vein
    And in a purple vomit poured his soul

    Panth O blessed blessed Cnus for this happy news
                                               Embraces CNUS

    Cleom O wretch O born to all misfortunes cursed
    Cursed Cleomenes

    Panth Hows thisAre these the thanks you pay the gods
    Who freed your Sparta and removed by death
    Your only fatal foe

    Cleom O blind Pantheus
    Canst thou not find that had I but deferred
    Sellasias fight three days but three short days
    Fate then had fought my battle with Antigonus
    And I not fighting had been still a king

    Panth Thats true but that you knew not when you fought

    Cleom Why therefore once again cursed Cleomenes
    Tis not to be endured
    That fate of empires and the fall of kings
    Should turn on flying hours and catch of moments

    Panth Now by my soul tis lazy wickedness
    To rail at heaven and not to help yourself
    Heavens but too kind in offering you the means
    Your fate once more is laid upon the anvil
    Now pluck up all the Spartan in your soul
    Now stretch at every stroke and hammer out
    A new and nobler fortune
    Else may the peaceful ground restore the dead
    And give up old Antigonus again

    Cleom I thank thee thou hast added flame to fury
    The Spartan genius shall once more be roused
    Our household gods that droop upon our hearths
    Each from his venerable face shall brush
    The Macedonian soot and shine again

    Panth Now you confess the Spartan

    Cleom Haste Pantheus
    I struggle like the priestess with a god
    With that oppressing god that works her soul
    Haste to Cleanthes my Egyptian friend
    That only man that Egypt ever made
    Hes my Lucina Say my friendship wants him
    To help me bring to light a manly birth
    Which to the wondering world I shall disclose
    Or if he fail me perish in my throes             Exeunt




ACT IISCENE I


Enter CLEOMENES CLEANTHES and PANTHEUS

    Cleom The king sent for me sayst thou and to council

    Clean And I was coming to you on that message
    Just when I met Pantheus

    Panth Good omen sir of some intended good
    Your fortune mends she reconciles apace
    When Egypt makes the advances

    Cleom Rise a prophet
    For since his fathers death this Ptolemy
    Has minded me no more
    Than boys their last years gewgaws
    Petition on petition prayer on prayer
    For aid or free dismission all unanswered
    As Cleomenes were not worth his thought
    Or he that god which Epicurus dreamt
    Disclaiming care and lolling on a cloud

    Panth At length it seems it pleases him to wake

    Clean Yes for himself not you hes drenched too deep
    To wake on any call but his own danger
    My father his wise pilot has observed
    The face of heaven and sees a gathering storm
    I know not from what quarter but it threatens
    And while it threats he wants such hands as yours
    But when tis oer the thoughtless king returns
    To native sloth shifts sides and slumbers on

    Panth Sure hell remember to reward those hands
    That helped him from the plunge

    Clean You dream Pantheus
    Of former times when gratitude was virtue
    Reward him Yes like sops snake the wretch
    That warmed him in his bosom We are tools
    Vile abject things created for his use
    As beasts for men as oxen draw the yoke
    And then are sacrificed

    Cleom I would not use him so

    Clean You are not Ptolemy
    Nor is he Cleomenes

    Cleom Ill press him home
    To give me my dispatch few ships will serve
    To bear my little band and me to Greece
    I will not ask him one of his Egyptians
    No let him keep them all for slaves and stallions
    Fit only to beget their successors

    Clean Excepting one Egyptianthats myself

    Cleom Thou needst not be excepted thou art only
    Misplanted in a base degenerate soil
    But Nature when she made thee meant a Spartan

    Panth Then if your father will but second us

    Clean I dare not promise for him but Ill try
    He loves me love and interest sometimes
    May make a statesman honest

    Cleom For the king
    I know hell not refuse us for he dares not
    A coward is the kindest animal
    Tis the most giving creature in a fright

    Clean Say the most promising and there you hit him

    Cleom Well Ill attack him on the shaking side
    That next his fearful heart

Enter CNUS

    Cn I come to mind you of the late request
    You would not hear Be pleased to engage this lord
    And then it may succeed

    Cleom What wouldst thou Cnus

    Cn I brought along
    Some horses of the best Thessalian breed
    Highspirited and strong and made for war
    These I would sell the king

    Cleom Mistaken man
    Thou shouldst have brought him whores and catamites
    Such merchandise is fit for such a monarch

    Clean Wouldst thou bring horses here to shame our men
    Those very words of spirited and war
    Are treason in our clime

    Cleom From the king downward if there be a downward
    From Ptolemy to any of his slaves
    No true Egyptian ever knew in horses
    The far side from the near

    Clean Cleomenes told thee true Thou shouldst have brought
    A soft pad strumpet for our monarchs use
    Though thanked be hell we want not one at home
    Our masters mistress she that governs all
    Tis well ye powers ye made us but Egyptians
    You could not have imposed
    On any other people such a load
    As an effeminate tyrant and a woman

    Cleom Sell me thy horses and at my return
    When I have got from conquered Greece the pelf
    That noble Sparta scorns Ill pay their value

    Cn Just as you paid me for the fair estate
    I sold you there                                    Aside

    Cleom Whats that you mutter

    Cn Nothing Thats what his hopes are worth
                                          Aside Exit CNUS

    Panth I fear hes gone away dissatisfied

    Clean Ill make it upThose horses I present you
    Youll put them to the use that nature meant them

    Cleom I burden you too much

    Clean If you refuse you burden me much more
    A trifle this
    A singing eunuchs price a pandars fee
    Exceeds this sum at court
    The king expects us

    Cleom Come after us Pantheus
    And bring my boy Cleonidas along
    Ill shew his youth this base luxurious court
    Just as in sober Sparta we expose
    Our drunken Helots only with design
    To wean our children from the vice of wine         Exeunt


SCENE IIThe Apartment of CASSANDRA

Enter King PTOLEMY SOSIBIUS with papers after him

    Ptol No more of business

    Sosib Sir the council waits you

    Ptol Council Whats that a pack of bearded slaves
    Grave faces saucy tongues and knavish hearts
    That never speak one word but selfs at bottom
    The scavengers that sweep state nuisances
    And are themselves the greatestIll no council

    Sosib Remember you appointed them this day

    Ptol I had forgot twas my Cassandras birthday

    Sosib Your brother Magas grows more dangerous daily
    And has the soldiers hearts

    Ptol Ill cut him off

    Sosib Not so soon done as said The Spartan king
    Was summoned for advice and waits without

    Ptol His business is to wait

    Sosib Be pleased to sign these papers they are all
    Of great concern

    Ptol My pleasure is of more
    How could I curse my name of Ptolemy
    For tis so long it asks an hour to write it
    By Heaven Ill change it into Jove or Mars
    Or any other civil monosyllable
    That will not tire my hand

    Sosib These are for common good         Shewing papers

    Ptol I am glad of that
    Those shall be sure to wait

    Sosib Orders to pay the soldiers ripe for mutiny
    They may revolt

    Ptol To whom

    Sosib The man you fear
    Your brother Magas

    Ptol Thats indeed the danger
    Give me the physic let me swallow quick
    Theres Ptolemy for that Now not one more
    For every minute I expect Cassandra
    To call me to the music
    If she should find me at this rare employment
    Of signing out her treasures

    Sosib The rest are only grants to her you love
    And places for her friends

    Ptol Ill sign them all were every one a province
    Thou knowst her humour not to brook denial
    And then a quarrel on her birthday too
    Would be of ill presage                 Signs more papers

Enter CASSANDRA and Women

    Cas I heard you waited but youll pardon me
    I was no sooner dressed

    Ptol Thus I begin my homage to the day  Kisses her hand
    That brought me forth a mistress and am proud
    To be your foremost slave

    Cas Our little entertainment waits not worth
    A longer ceremony please to grace it

     The Scene opens and discovers CASSANDRAS Apartment
     Musicians and Dancers PTOLEMY leads in CASSANDRA SOSIBIUS

     CLEOMENES and CLEANTHES on one side of the stage where they
     stand


SONG

    No no poor suffering heart no change endeavour
    Chuse to sustain the smart rather than leave her
    My ravished eyes behold such charms about her
    I can die with her but not live without her
    One tender sigh of hers to see me languish
    Will more than pay the price of my past anguish
    Beware O cruel fair how you smile on me
    Twas a kind look of yours that has undone me

    Love has in store for me one happy minute
    And she will end my pain who did begin it
    Then no day void of bliss of pleasure leaving
    Ages shall slide away without perceiving
    Cupid shall guard the door the more to please us
    And keep out Time and Death when they would seize us
    Time and Death shall depart and say in flying
    Love has found out a way to live by dying

    Cleom To CLEAN Is this the council of the Egyptian king
    And am I called upon the grave debate
    To judge of trilling notes and tripping feet

    Clean Tis of a piece with all the rest of Ptolemy
    A singing and a dancing government
    O Egypt Egypt thou art grown the lees
    Of all the world the slime of thy own Nile
    Sure we had neither human sires nor mothers
    The sun and Nile begot us Were so cowardly
    And yet so proud so many gods we have
    And yet not one

    Cleom No morethey seem to gaze on me with wonder

    Clean And well they may to see a man in Egypt
                               King CASSANDRA and SOSIBIUS
                                rise and come forward

    Ptol Welcome royal stranger
    Not only to my court but to my bosom

    Cleom I heard you sent for me but on what business
    Am yet to learn

    Ptol The greatest in the world to see the man
    Whom even his foes extol his friends adore
    And all mankind admire

    Cleom Say rather sir
    A man forsaken of his better stars
    A banished prince the shadow of a king

    Ptol My fathers friend

    Cleom I must not think so vainly of myself
    To be what you have said lest it upbraid you
    To let your fathers friend for three long months
    Thus dance attendance for a word of audience

    Cas Now by my soul tis nobly urged He speaks
    As if he were in Sparta on his throne
    Not asking aid but granting
    How little looks our pageant prince to him
    This is the only king I ever saw                    Aside

    Cleom By all the gods when I have stood repulsed
    Before your gates and could not gain admittance
    I have not sighed so much for my own sorrows
    As I have blushed for your ungenerous usage

    Clean Not a word Ptolemy
    Ashamed by all thats good to be miscalled
    A king when this is present                        Aside

    Cleom Think you tis nothing
    For me to beg that I constrain my temper
    To sue for aid which you should first have offered
    Believe me Ptolemy a noble soul
    Does much that asks He gives you power to oblige him
    Know sir theres a proud modesty in merit
    Averse from begging and resolved to pay
    Ten times the gift it asks

    Ptol I have been to blame
    And you have justly taxed my long neglect
    I am young and am a lover and how far
    Fair eyes may make even kings forgetful look
    And read my best excuse

    Clean O miracle He blushes
    The first red virtue I have ever seen
    Upon that face                                      Aside

    Cas I am sorry sir youve made me your excuse
    As if I stood betwixt the good you meant
    And intercepted every royal grace
    Now in my own defence I must solicit
    All his concerns as mine
    And if my eyes have power he should not sue
    In vain nor linger with a long delay

    Ptol Well Ill consider

    Cas Say that word again
    And Ill consider too

    Ptol Prythee be satisfied he shall be aided
    Or Ill no more be king

    Clean When wert thou oneFor shame for shame ye gods
    That eer you put it in a strumpets power
    To do so good a deed                                Aside

    Cleom I am a Spartan madam scarce of words
    We have but just enough to speak our meaning
    Be thanked thats all I could have said to Jove
    Had Jove like you restored me to my crown

    Sosib To CLEOM The gods have given you sir the speedy means
    To satisfy your debt of gratitude

    Cleom Oh make me happy tell me how this sword
    This and my heart are all thats left me now
    Can be employed to serve the crown of Egypt

    Clean Well said father thou art a true statesman
    So much for so much is the way at court             Aside

    Sosib My king has in the camp a younger brother
    Valiant they say but very popular
    He gets too far into the soldiers grace
    And inches out my master

    Cleom Is the king
    Assured of this by any overtact
    Or any close conspiracy revealed

    Ptol He has it in his power to be a traitor
    And thats enough

    Sosib He has it in his will too
    Else why this ostentation of his virtues
    His bounty valour and his temperance
    Why are they thus exposed to public view
    But as a Venus set beside a monster
    To make an odious comparison
    As if his brother wanted what he boasts

    Ptol Whats to be done with him

    Cas There needs no more I think but to contrive
    With secrecy and safety to dispatch him

    Clean I thank thee that thou hast not cozened me
    In this advice for two good deeds together
    Had been too much in conscience for thy calling     Aside

    Ptol He dies thats out of doubt

    Cleom Your brother sir

    Ptol Why do you ask that question

    Cleom Because I had a brother
    Oh grief to say I had and have not now
    Wise valiant temperate and in short a Spartan
    Had all the virtues which your counsellor
    Imputed to your brother as his crimes
    He loved me well so well he could but die
    To shew he loved me better than his life
    He lost it for me in Sellasias field
    And went the greatest ghost of all our name
    That ever had a brother or a king

    Sosib Wipe off the tears that stand upon your eyes
    Good nature works too far Kings have no brothers
    What men call such are rivals of their crowns
    Yours timed his death so as to merit grief
    Who knows but he laid in by that last action
    The means to have betrayed you had he lived

    Cleom I would say something but I curb my passion
    Because thou art the father to my friend
    To you sir this If you condemn your brother    To PTOL
    Only because hes bounteous great and brave
    Know you condemn those virtues own you want them
    Had you a thousand brothers such as he
    You ought to shew you are above them all
    By daring to reward and cherish them
    As bucklers of your crown in time of war
    And in soft peace the jewels that adorn it

    Cas I stand corrected sir he ought to live

    Ptol I think so too

    Sosib I do not wish his death
    Howeer I seemed to give that rugged counsel

    Clean Well said again father Comply comply
    Follow the sun true shadow                         Aside

    Sosib I only wish my master may be safe
    But there are mercenaries in the army
    Three thousand Greeks the flower of all our troops
    Like wolves indeed among Egyptian lambs
    If these revoltI do not say they will
    But if your brother please to take the crown
    And be not good enough to let you reign
    Those Greeks whereer they go will turn the scale

    Ptol What think you Cleomenes

    Cleom He says true

    Ptol Then Magas must not live

    Cleom That does not follow
    Fear not those mercenaries they are mine
    Devoted to my interest commanded by my nod
    They are my limbs of war and I their soul
    Were they in arms against you at your gates
    High in their rage and fixed upon the spoil
    Should I sayHoldnay should I only frown
    They could not bear my eyes but awed and mastered
    Like lions to their keepers would couch and fawn
    And disobey their hunger

    Ptol Wondrous man                         Embraces him
    How I admire thy virtue

    Cas And his genius
    Some are born kings
    Made up of three parts fire so full of heaven
    It sparkles at their eyes Inferior souls
    Know them as soon as seen by sure instinct
    To be their lords and naturally worship
    The secret god within them

    Sosib Sir I humbly beg
    A word in private                                 To PTOL

    Ptol Madam

    Cas You may go

    Sosib Cleanthes follow me
         Exeunt PTOL SOSIB CLEAN

Enter CLEONIDAS

    Cleon Pantheus brought me hither to attend you

    Cleom And thou art welcome but thou comest too late

    Cas Your page of honour

    Cleon The mistake is easy in such a court as this
    Where princes look like pages

    Cleom Tis my son

    Cas I must have leave to love you royal youth
    Above all nations I adore a Greek
    And of all Greeks a Spartan              Looking on CLEOM

    Cleom What he is
    And what I am are owing to your favour

    Cas To CLEON Shall I not be your mistress
                                              Looking on CLEOM

    Cleon No for I would not get Egyptians

    Cas For what sir do you take us

    Cleon For what you are
    When the gods moulded up the paste of man
    Some of their dough was left upon their hands
    For want of souls and so they made Egyptians
    They were intended for four feet and when
    They come to run before our noble Spartans
    Theyll curse the gods for the two legs they owed them

    Cas Then since you will not let me be your mistress
    Would I had been your mother       Looking still on CLEOM

    Cleon So would not I
    For then I had not been all Spartan

    Cas Aside He answers not my glances stupid man
    My tender looks my languishing regards
    Are like misaiming arrows lost in air
    And miss the flying prey

     While she walks CLEOM and CLEON are looking on a picture
     hanging on the side of the Scenes She takes out a pocketglass
     and looks in it

    These eyes I thank the gods
    Are still the same The diamonds are not dimmed
    Nor is their lustre lost in Ptolemy
    Small boast Alas Ptolemy has no soul
    Tis what he wants I love in Cleomenes
    Perhaps he dares not think I would be loved
    Then must I make the advance and making lose
    The vast prerogative our sex enjoys
    Of being courted firstCourted To what
    To our own wishes Theres the point but still
    To speak our wishes firstforbid it pride
    Forbid it modestyTrue they forbid it
    But nature does not When we are athirst
    Or hungry will imperious nature stay
    Not eat nor drink before tis bid fall on
    Well sex if this must be
    That I must not invite I may at least be suffered
    To lay some kind occasion in his way
    That if he dare but speak he may succeed

     She turns round to them and observes what they are doing
     CLEOM turns and meets her CLEON looks still on the picture

    Cleon I durst not have presumed to interrupt
    Your private thoughts

    Cas They wholly were employed in serving you
    But durst not and presume are words of fear
    I thought they were not in your Spartan tongue
    For my sake banish them
    On what were you so earnestly employed
    You would not look this way

    Cleom A picture madam

    Cas View it again tis worth a second sight
    Your son observes it stillTwere well to help
    My lovers understanding     Goes with him to the Picture

    Know you this piece young prince

    Cleon Some battle I believe and in that thought
    I gaze with such delight

    Cleom Some rape I guess

    Cas Thats near the true design and yet mistaken
    Tis Paris bearing from your Spartan shore
    The beauteous Helen How do you approve it

    Cleom Not in the least for tis a scurvy piece

    Cas And yet tis known to be Apelles hand
    The style is his you grant he was a master

    Cleom Tis scurvy still because it represents
    A base dishonest act to violate
    All hospitable rites to force away
    His benefactors wifeUngrateful villain
    And so the gods the avenging gods have judged

    Cleon Was he a Spartan king that suffered this
    Sure he revenged the rape

    Cleom He did my boy
    And slew the ravisher

    Cas Look better sir youll find it was no rape
    Mark well that Helen in her lovers arms
    Can you not see she but affects to strive
    She heaves not up her hands to heaven for help
    But hugs the kind companion of her flight
    See how her tender fingers strain his sides
    Tis an embrace a grasping of desire
    A very belt of love that girds his waist
    She looks as if she did not fear to fall
    But only lose her lover if she fell
    Observe her eyes how slow they seem to roll
    Their wishing looks and languish on his face
    Observe the whole design and you would swear
    She ravished Paris and not Paris her

    Cleom Sparta has not to boast of such a woman
    Nor Troy to thank her for her illplaced love

    Cas But Paris had As for the war that followed
    Twas but a fable of a Grecian wit
    To raise the valour of his countrymen
    For Menelaus was an honest wretch
    A tame good man that never durst resent
    A mere convenient husband dull and slavish
    By nature meant the thing the lovers made him

    Cleom His goodness aggravates their crime the more
    Had Menelaus used his Helen ill
    Had he been jealous or distrusted both
    I would allow a grain or two for love
    And plead in their excuse

    Cas There was their safety that he was not jealous
    What would you more of him he was a fool
    And put the happy means into their hands

    Cleom I cannot much commend my countryman

    Cas Indeed my lord your countryman was dull
    That did not understand so plain a courtship
    Have Spartans eyes for nothing not to see
    So manifest a passion

    Cleom Yes too well                            Aside
    Madam your goodness interests you too much
    In Helens cause I have no more to urge
    But that she was a wife that word a wife
    In spite of all your eloquence condemns her

    Cas You argue justly therefore twas a crime
    But had she been a mistress not a wife
    Her love had been a virtue to forsake
    The nauseous bed of a loathed fulsome king
    And fly into a sprightly lovers arms
    Her love had been a merit to her Paris
    To leave her country and whats more her kingdom
    With a poor fugitive prince to sail away
    And bear her wealth along to make him happy

    Cleom You put your picture in the fairest light
    But both the lovers broke their plighted vows
    He to Oenone she to Menelaus

    Cas The gods that made two fools had done more justly
    To have matched Menelaus with Oenone
    Think better of my picture it deserves
    A second thought it speaks the Helen speaks

    Cleon It speaks Egyptian then a base dishonest tongue

    Cas You are too young to understand her language
                                                      To CLEON
    Do not thank me                                  To CLEOM
    Till I have brought your business to perfection
    Doubt not my kindness nothing shall be wanting
    To make your voyage happy

    Cleom I only fear the excess of your full bounty
    To give me more than what my wants require
                                     Exeunt CLEOM and CLEON

    Cas Meaning perhaps my person and my love
    I would not think it so and yet I fear
    And while I fear his voyage shall be hindered
    No breath of wind
      Can stir to waft him hence unless I please
      I am the goddess that commands the seas
      In vain he vows at any other shrine
      My heart is in his hands his fates in mine
                                                Exit CASSANDRA




ACT III


SCENE IThe Kings Apartment

     A Table set PTOLEMY SOSIBIUS CASSANDRA sitting PTOLEMY at
     the upper end CASSANDRA sitting on the one side SOSIBIUS on
     the other

    Ptol I must confess twas obvious

    Sosib He said he could command them with his nod
    Can he do this with mercenaries raised
    Not at his charge but yours by you maintained
    What could he more had they been Spartans born

    Cas What would you hence infer

    Sosib What you observed
    Some are born kings and so is Cleomenes

    Cas A great soul dares not call himself a villain
    He has that interest and will use it nobly
    To serve and not to ruin his protector

    Sosib Is Egypts safety and the kings and yours
    Fit to be trusted on a bare suppose
    That he is honest Honest let him be
    But on his own experiment not ours
    Man is but man unconstant still and various
    Theres no tomorrow in him like today
    Perhaps the atoms rolling in his brain
    Make him think honestly this present hour
    The next a swarm of base ungrateful thoughts
    May mount aloft and wheres our Egypt then
    Who would trust chance since all men have the seeds
    Of good and ill which should work upward first

    Cas All men then you are one and by that rule
    Your wicked atoms may be working now
    To give bad counsel that you still may govern

    Sosib I would the king would govern

    Cas Because you think I have too much command

    Ptol Would you would rule me both by turns in quiet
    And let me take my ease

    Cas Then my turns first

    Sosib Our masters safety in sound reason ought
    To be preferred to both

    Ptol So thinks Cassandra too

    Cas No court Sosibius and cast Cassandra off

    Ptol What have I said or done
    To merit this unkindness
    Tell me but what you think of Cleomenes
    And be my oracle

    Cas I know him grateful

    Sosib To know him grateful is enough for Jove

    Cas And therefore not too much for me in Egypt
    I say I know him honest

    Ptol Then I know it
    Now may Sosibius speak

    Cas He may but not to contradict my knowledge

    Sosib Then I concur to let him go for Greece
    And wish our Egypt fairly rid of him
    For as our Apis though in temples fed
    And under golden roofs yet loaths his food
    Because restrained and longs to roam in meads
    Among the milkymothers of the herd
    So Cleomenes kept by force in Egypt
    Is sullen at our feasts abhors our dainties
    And longs to change them for his Spartan broth
    He may be dangerous here then send him hence
    With aid enough to conquer all he lost
    And make him formidable to mankind

    Cas He may be formidable then to us
    That thou wouldst say

    Sosib No for you know him grateful

    Cas Would thou wouldst learn to speak without a double
    Thou Delphian statesman                             Rises

    Sosib Would I could know your wishes that I might
    I would but smooth their way and make them easy   Bowing

    Cas Good old man                               Smiling
    A little over zealous but wellmeaning
    My wishes are the honour of my king
    That Ptolemy may keep his royal word
    And I my promise to procure this aid
    If to be mistress signifies command
    Let this be done if not the king may find
    Another beauty worthier of his bed
    And I another lover less ungrateful

    Ptol Let Egypt sink before that fatal day
    No we are one Cassandra we are one
    Or I am nothing thou art Ptolemy

    Cas Now you deserve to be the first of kings
    Because you rank yourself the first of lovers
    What can I do to show Cassandra grateful
    Nothing but this
    To be so nice in my concerns for you
    To doubt where doubts are not to be too fearful
    To raise a bugbear shadow of a danger
    And then be frighted though it cannot reach you

    Sosib Be pleased to name your apprehensions madam

    Cas Plain souls like mine judge others by themselves
    Therefore I hold our Cleomenes honest
    But since tis possible though barely so
    That he may prove ungrateful
    I would have pledges given us of his faith
    His wife his mother and his son be left
    As hostages in Egypt

    Sosib Admirable
    Some god inspired you with this prudent counsel

    Ptol I thought so too but that I durst not speak

    Sosib Leave me to manage this

    Cas My best Sosibius
    But do it surely by the easiest means
    Infuse it gently do not pour it down
    Let him not think he stands suspected here
    And least of all by me

    Sosib He shall not madam
    Now sir the illumination feast attends you
    For Apis has appeared

    Ptol Why then I must be formal
    Go to the temple
    Come my fair Cassandra
    That I may have an object worth my worship          Aside

    Cas The God that I adore is in my breast
    This is the temple this the sacrifice
    But to the powers divine we make appeal
    With great devotion and with little zeal
                                        Exeunt PTOL and CAS

    Sosib Solus Yes yes it shall be done but not her way
    Call in my son CleanthesThis Cassandra
    Is our enchanting syren she that sings
    Our Ptolemy into secure destruction
    In vain I counsel him to avoid his ruin
    These womencharmers oh they have a devil
    Too strong to dispossessCall in my son
                                              Goes to the door

Enter CLEANTHES

    Cleanthes are you Cleomenes friend
    Or only seem you such

    Clean To seem to be and not be what I seem
    Are things my honest nature understands not

    Sosib But you must love your king and country more

    Clean Yes when I have a king and country
    That can deserve my love
    Egypt as Egypt is deserves it not
    A people baser than the beasts they worship
    Below their potherb gods that grow in gardens
    The king

    Sosib Go to young man whateer he be
    I must not hear my master vilified

    Clean Why did you name him then Were I at prayers
    And even for you whom as my soul I love
    If Ptolemy should come across my thoughts
    A curse would follow where I meant a blessing

    Sosib Tis well tis well I am so fond a father
    Those words were death in any other mouth
    I know too much of you you love the Spartan
    Beyond your king and country

    Clean Tis a truth
    So noble I would own it to the gods
    And they be proud to hear it

    Sosib Confess you love him better than your father

    Clean No but I love him equal with my father

    Sosib Say better and say true
    If we were opposite and one must fall
    Whom wouldst thou save

    Clean Neither for both would die
    Before I could resolve

    Sosib If I command thee
    To break thy friendship with him wouldst thou

    Clean No

    Sosib Why then thou hast confessed thou lovest him more

    Clean Not so for should he bid me disobey
    Or not love you thus would I answer him
    As I have answered you

    Sosib Ungrateful boy

    Clean You bid me tell you true and this is my reward

    Sosib Go from my sight

    Clean I will but would not go
    Without your blessing

    Sosib O so well I love thee
    That I could curse thee for not loving me
    Stay I would send thee on a message to him
    But that I fear thy faith

    Clean You wrong my piety

    Sosib It much concerns my interest which is thine
    Wouldst thou deliver what I have to say
    Wouldst thou induce his reason to comply

    Clean Both granting your proposals honourable
    If not employ some mercenary tongue
    The court affords you storeand spare my virtue

    Sosib I would have Cleomenes sent away
    With royal aid

    Clean You promised him he should

    Sosib And would have thee persuade him to this voyage

    Clean A welcome errand Oh my dear dear father

    Sosib But on my terms mark that my terms Cleanthes

    Clean I feared the statesman in you

    Sosib I would have Egypt safe thats all my interest
    And therefore he must leave behind for pawns
    His mother wife and son

    Clean Tis clogging of a gift tis base mean counsel
    I hope you gave it not

    Sosib No twas Cassandra
    But she would have that odium cast on me
    I am her beast of burden and must bear it

    Clean I never can bely so good a father
    But this Ill do
    The message shall be faithfully delivered
    And all the strumpet stand exposed to shame

    Sosib Thou hitst my meaning but he must be secret
    Must seem to take the favour as from her
    And lay the hardship of the terms on me

    Clean He shall

    Sosib And thou wilt gild this bitter pill
    For theres no other way to go from hence
    But leaving these behind

    Clean A beam of thought comes glancing on my soul
                                                         Aside
    Ill undertake it
    The pledges shall be left

    Sosib My best Cleanthes                   Embraces him
    But haste and lose no time

    Clean Im all on fire to serve my friend and father
                                                Exit CLEANTHES

    Sosib Alone This Cleomenes ought to be dispatched
    Dispatched the safest way he ought to die
    Not that I hate his virtue but I fear it
    The mistress drives my counsels to the leeward
    Now I must edge upon a point of wind
    And make slow way recovering more and more
    Till I can bring my vessel safe ashore         Exit SOSIB


     SCENE IIOf a Temple with Illuminations An Altar APIS
     painted above Priests and Choristers

     PTOLEMY CASSANDRA Courtiers men and women all decently
     placed Musick Instrumental and Vocal Then PTOLEMY taking
     CASSANDRA by the hand advances to the Altar of APIS bowing
     thrice and gives the High Priest a purse Soft Musick all the
     while PTOLEMY and CASSANDRA are adoring and speaking

    Ptol Soul of the universe and source of life
    Immortal Apis thou thrice holy fire
    Hear Egypts vows and mine If as we dream
    Egyptian earth impregnated with flame
    Sprung the first man
    Preserve thy primitive plantation here
    Then for myself thy type and thy vicegerent
    Roll from my loins a long descent of kings
    Mixed of Cassandras kindly blood and mine
    Mine be she only and I only hers
    And when I shall resolve again to thee
    May she survive me and be queen of Egypt
    Hear this and firm it with some happy omen
       An Augury portending good success arises from the Altar

    Omnes Apis be praised for this auspicious omen
                     PTOLEMY bowing retires and seems pleased

    Cas Kneels Great power of Love who spreadst thy gentle fire
    Through human hearts art every where adored
    Accept these vows in show to Apis paid
    And make his altar thine hear not that wretch
    Because his prayers were not addressed to thee
    Or only hear his last that I may reign
    Make Cleomenes mine and mine alone
    Give us a flight secure a safe arrival
    And crown our wishes in each others arms
    Hear this and firm it with some happy omen
                A bad omen arises from the flames of the Altar

    Omnes Avert this omen Apis

    Cas Rises Accursed be thou grasseating foddered god
    Accursed thy temple more accursed thy priests
    The gods are theirs not ours and when we pray
    For happy omens we their price must pay
    In vain at shrines the ungiving suppliant stands
    This tis to make a vow with empty hands
    Fat offerings are the priesthoods only care
    They take the money and heaven hears the prayer
    Without a bribe their oracles are mute
    And their instructed gods refuse the suit
                 Exit CASSANDRA in a fury King and Attendants

SCENE IIIThe Port of Alexandria

Enter CLEOMENES and CLEANTHES

    Cleom The propositions are unjust and hard
    And if I swallow them tis as we take
    The wrath of heaven
    We must have patience for they will be gods
    And give us no account of what we suffer

    Clean My father much abhors this middle way
    Betwixt a gift and sale of courtesy
    But tis the mistress she that seemed so kind
    Tis she that bears so hard a hand upon you
    She that would half oblige and half affront

    Cleom Let her be what she is thats curse enough
    But such a wife a mother and a son
    Oh sure ye gods when ye made this vile Egypt
    Ye little thought they should be mortgaged here
    My only comfort
    Is that I trust these precious pawns with thee
    For thou art so religiously a friend
    That I would sooner leave them in thy hands
    Than if I had security from heaven
    And all the gods to answer for their safety

    Clean Yes yes they shall be safe
    And thou shall have a pledge
    As strong as friendship can make over to thee
    Deny me not for I must go with thee
    And share what fate allots for thee in Greece
                                CLEOMENES looks discontentedly

    Nay cast not on me that forbidding frown
    But let me be their pawn as they are thine
    So I shall have thee wholly to myself
    And be thy wife thy mother and thy son
    As thou art all to me

    Cleom Oh friend              Sighs and wipes his eyes

    Clean What wouldst thou say my better part

    Cleom No more but this that thou art too unkind
    When even in kindness thou wouldst overcome

    Clean Let me be proud and pardon thou my pride
    Base worthless Egypt has no other pawn
    To counterbalance these but only me
    Twas on such terms alone I durst propose it
    Shalt thou leave these
    And I not leave a father whom I love
    Come come it must be so
    Well give each other all we have besides
    And then we shall be evenHere they are
    I leave thee Break those tender ties of nature
    As gently as thou canst they must be broken
                                                Going returns
    But when thou seest Cassandra curb thy spleen
    Seem to receive the kindness as from her
    And if thou thinkst I love thee for my sake
    Remembering me strive to forget my father     Exit CLEAN

Enter CLEORA CRATESICLEA and CLEONIDAS

    Cleom But how can I sustain to tell them this
                                             Walking from them
    Even in the gentlest terms
    There are not words in any tongue so soft
    As I would use the gods must have a new one
    If they would have me speak

    Crat How king of Sparta When your fortune smiles
    A glorious sunshine and a gloomy soul
    The gods love chearfulness when they are kind
    They think their gifts despised and thrown away
    On sullen thankless hearts

    Cleor I hear my dearest lord that we shall go

    Cleom Go

    Cleon What a mournful echo makes my father
    By Mars he stifles go upon his tongue
    And kills the joyful sound he speaks so low
    That heaven must listen if it hear his thanks

    Cleom Yes I shall go but how

    Cleor With Egypts aid

    Cleon With his own soul and sword a thousand strong
    And worth ten Egypts and their ten thousand gods

    Crat Theres something more in this than what we guess
    Some secret anguish rolls within his breast
    That shakes him like an earthquake which he presses
    And will not give it vent I know him well
    He blushes and would speak and wants a voice
    And stares and gapes like a forbidden ghost
    Till he be spoke to firstTell me my son

    Cleom Mother I willAnd yet I cannot neither  Aside
    Mother that word has struck me dumb again
    For how can I say mother and propound
    To leave her here behind who gave me life
    Mother and wife and son the names that nature
    Most loves to speak are banished from my mouth

    Cleor Tell us my love the king has changed his mind
    And has refused us leave for we can bear it
    Egypt is Greece to me while you are here

    Cleom Oh I would speak But oh you speak so kindly
    That you forbid my speech You call me love

    Cleor Was that too kind a word

    Cleom It was to me I am a mere barbarian
    A brute a stock for I have no relations
    Or shortly shall have none

    Cleor Then we must die

    Cleon We must and welcome death

    Crat To save his life

    Cleom The gods forbid that you should die for me
    No you may live but I must die thrice over
    For I must leave you here or must not go
    These are the hard conditions offered me

    Crat Then Egypt would have pledges Is this all

    Cleom Yes and a mighty all Tis all I have
    But I propose it not remember that

    Crat I do and therefore I propose it first
    To save this virtuous shame this good confusion
    That would not let you speak

    Cleom Oh I could almost think you love me not
    You granted me so quick so willingly
    What Ibear witness heavenwas slow to ask
    And would be loth to have

    Cleor I cannot leave you

    Cleom I was but wishing thou wouldst draw me back
    And now I cannot go

    Crat Are you turned woman
    No more of this fond stuff

    Cleon Shall I be left to gather rust in Egypt
    A glue of sloth to stick to my young pinions
    And mar their flight habitual cowardice
    No I must learn my stubborn trade of war
    From you alone and envy you betimes

    Cleom But the conditions Oh these hard conditions
    That such a spirit must be left behind
    Untaught unfashioned by a fathers hands
    A spirit fit to start into an empire
    And look the world to law

    Crat No more debating for I see the pinch
    He must be left and so must she and I
    For we are but your softnesses my son
    The incumbrances and luggage of the war
    Fight for us and redeem us if you please
    For there we are your clogs of virtue here
    The spurs of your return

    Cleom I thank you mother
    Once more you have erected me to man
    And set me upright with my face to heaven
    The woman and the boy be yours awhile
    The war be mine alone

    Crat There spoke the Spartan king Think not on us

    Cleom I wonnot

    Cleor Not in prayers

    Cleon In prayers Thats poor
    As if the gods were thoughtless of their work
    Think on us when you fight and when you make
    A lusty stroke cry outThats for my boy

    Crat Dispose this mouldering carcase as you please
    Ere lingering age or sickness wear it out
    Unprofitable then for Spartas good
    Be chearful fight it well and all the rest
    Leave to the gods and fortune

    Cleom If they fail me
    Theirs be the fault for fate is theirs alone
    My virtue fame and honour are my own             Exeunt




ACT IV


SCENE IAn Antechamber of CASSANDRAS Lodging

Enter PTOLEMY SOSIBIUS CNUS and CASSANDRA

    Sosib So soit works now mistress sit you fast Aside

    Ptol Humph whores and catamites
    Were those his words

    Cn Upon my life they were

    Ptol Whom should he mean by those unmannered terms
    Cassandra can you guess

    Cas Twas kindly asked

    Ptol A foulmouthed villain

    Sosib So I should have thought
    But that this lady knows him good and grateful

    Cn Madam I stand suspected without cause
    And but I fear revenge from this great man
    I could say more

    Cas I thought he was concerned

    Sosib Who I

    Cas Speak boldly Grecian I protect thee

    Cn Cleanthes then was present and he added

Enter CLEANTHES

    But he appears in time to hear his charge

    Sosib My dear dear son                          Aside
    I fear thy lavish tongue has ruined thee
    What can I do to save thee

    Cas Well proceed

    Cn Can you deny my lord that you were present
    When Cleomenes taxed the court and king
    With brutal vices

    Clean I remember somewhat
    Of certain horses which he could not buy
    And saw thee go away dissatisfied
    Which to prevent I meant to purchase them
    The rest I heard not nor believe he spoke

    Cas Cleanthes added farther that thou saidst

    Ptol And we would know ere tortures force it from thee

    Sosib Now comes the fatal stroke                 Aside

    Cn He added farther

    Clean No thou addest it all
    And I demand the combat

    Ptol Let him speak

    Sosib Think first Cleanthes Think before you hazard
    Your life and honour in this bold appeal
    Somewhat you might have said nay more you ought
    Since I commanded you to be a spy
    On Cleomenes acts and close designs

    Clean The good old liar would preserve my life
    And I must steer his course                         Aside
    I thinkI farther added                To the King

    Ptol Tis forgiven
    So wholly pardoned that I will not hear it
    Good spies are useful and must be encouraged
    But what must next be done with Cleomenes

    Sosib Dispatch him as the source of all your fears
    Observe the mounting billows of the main
    Blown by the winds into a raging storm
    Brush off those winds and the high waves return
    Into their quiet first created calm
    Such is the rage of busy blustering crowds
    Fomented by the ambition of the great
    Cut off the causes and the effect will cease
    And all the moving madness fall to peace

    Ptol Let him be seized in order to his death
    I am in haste you know it for my progress
    A thousand pleasures wait me at Canopus
    And this poor trifling business of one life
    Encumbers allCassandra are you ready
    We will be seen like Isis and Osiris
    Drawn in one chariot for admiring eyes
    To worship as we pass

    Cas A word in privateCnus attend without    Exit

     CASSANDRA leads the King to a corner of the Stage Sosibius
     takes his Son to the other

    Sosib To Clean Now I am twice your father by preserving
    The life I gave you which your folly hazarded
    Break off all friendship with that Spartan king
    Or never see me more His fates resolved
    Nor can you stem the tide avoid his ruins
    Reply not but obey

    Clean I know my duty                            Bowing

    Sosib Thou overjoyest me Follow well talk farther
                                     Exeunt SOSIB and CLEAN

    Cas What think you of Sosibius and his son

    Ptol As of two creatures zealous for my service

    Cas Oh heavens that I should love this king so well
    But that I doatWhat can I see in him
    But dull good nature and simplicity
    Well well my little dear I find the gods
    Have given me here no business of my own
    But made me just your drudge to love and save you

    Ptol Protest I thought them honest are they not

    Cas Ye gods why did you make this man your image
    And made him but an imageYoull forgive me
    I love you so that I am forced to rail
    You saw no close conveyance of the game
    Betwixt the crafty sire and cunning son
    How slily one invented an excuse
    And tother took it up as dexterously

    Ptol Why sure Cleanthes was his fathers spy

    Cas Yes over you but not on Cleomenes
    I fear you are betrayed and the gods blind you
    To make your ruin sure

    Ptol As how Cassandra

    Cas When you are absent

    Ptol Well

    Cas Tis in their power

    Ptol To murder Cleomenes

    Cas If they please
    Or else to set him free and join with Magas

    Ptol I will not to Canopus

    Cas Yes you must

    Ptol But how shall I be safe and take this journey

    Cas Leave that to me

    Ptol But you must go along

    Cas No I must stay here in order to your safety
    To watch the growth of danger and prevent it
    This cruel absence I must undergo
    Or else I love you not

    Ptol Since I must go
    Ill cheat them of a day and come before
    My time for love of thee

    Cas To sum up all
    For we are both in haste
    Intrust your royal signet in my hands

    Ptol Joined with Sosibius

    Cas Would you trust a statesman
    Before your own dear heart You love him better
    You naughty man in faith you do and now I think ont
    I will not have your signet By this kiss
    And this and this I will not

    Ptol By all three thou shalt
                          Gives her the Signet from his Finger

    But kill this Cleomenes quickly hes dangerous

    Cas Hes in safe hands with me

    Ptol One more embrace

    Cas There take it and now go
    Thus for your good I thrust you from my arms

    Ptol Farewell my love                    Exit PTOLEMY

    Cas FarewellI hope for ever
    Now Cleomenes I will sound thy soul
    For life and death depend upon thy choice
    But for that easy wretch him I comtemn
    Hard state of lovers subject to our laws
    Fools we must have or else we cannot sway
    For none but fools will womankind obey
    If they prove stubborn and resist our will
    We exercise our power and use them ill
    The passive slave that whines adores and dies
    Sometimes we pity but we still despise
    But when we doat the selfsame fate we prove
    Fools at the best but double fools in love
    We rage at first with illdissembled scorn
    Then falling from our height more basely mourn
    And man the insulting tyrant takes his turn
    Leaves us to weep for our neglected charms
    And hugs another mistress in his arms
    And that which humbles our proud sex the most
    Of all our slighted favours makes his boast
                                                Exit CASSANDRA

Enter CLEOMENES

    Cleom Her words her every look confess she loves me
    And therefore she detains these hostages
    As pawns of my return to her and Egypt
    Thus far tis plain and obviousBut the picture
    That Helen Theres the riddle of her love
    For what I see or only think I see
    Is like a glimpse of moonshine streaked with red
    A shuffled sullen and uncertain light
    That dances through the clouds and shuts again
    Then ware a rising tempest on the main

Enter CASSANDRA

    Cas I would but cannot speak
    The shame that should to womankind belong
    Flown from my bosom hovers on my tongue            Aside

    Cleom Tis rarely seen that gods from heaven descend
    But for some kind some charitable end
    And yet your troubled looks ill news import
    Stops or delays but thats no news at court
    Theres somewhat which your pity would disguise

    Cas Would you could read that somewhat in my eyes
    But as you are a Spartan and a king
    Undaunted hear whatever news I bring
    The favourite hates you Cnus has betrayed
    The bitter truths that our loose court upbraid
    Your friend was set upon you for a spy
    And on his witness you are doomed to die

    Cleom I have been plunged already twice in woes
    And the third time above the waves I rose
    Still I have strength to steer me into port
    And shun the secret quicksands of the court
    But when my friend who should expecting stand
    On the bare beach to lend his helping hand
    When he defends the unhospitable shore
    And drives me thence I sink for evermore
    But tis impossible his faith is tried
    The man who had defamed him thus had lied

    Cas Well I forgive your blunt Laconic way
    It shall be seen it shall this very day
    Who would preserve your life and who betray
    The king incensed the favourite your foe
    Yet on the same conditions you may go
    Your wife your son your mother left behind
    What think you now

    Cleom Tis to be wonderous kind

    Cas Suppose I add a farther bounty yet

    Cleom It could but make your favours over weight

    Cas What if I went myself to waft you oer
    And left you when I saw you safe ashore
    For I should leave you if you thought it fit
    Not to do more than honour would permit
    Can I do less to show you I am kind
    To comfort you for those you left behind

    Cleom The world would think you kinder than you ought

    Cas Why should I care what base Egyptians thought

    Cleom Immoderate gifts oppress me not relieve
    Nor dare I take what ruins you to give

    Cas Leave me to judge of that I could prescribe
    An easy way of giving back my bribe
    Why would you force me farther than my part
    Look on my eyes and you may read my heart
                                    Looks on her as by stealth
    Oh there you met me with a guilty glance
    Now tis too late to plead your ignorance

    Cleom I am so much below and you above
    What can I say

    Cas But one kind wordI love

    Cleom As far as gratitude that love can pay

    Cas Oh stop not there for thats but half the way
    Would you to one poor narrow word confine
    Your passion when I put no bounds to mine

    Cleom Cleora

    Cas Now you speak too soon forbear
    Nothing can please me that begins with her

    Cleom I must begin where nature void of art
    Directs my tonguewith her who rules my heart

    Cas Let us together sail before the wind
    And leave that dull domestic drudge behind

    Cleom What to expose her helpless innocence
    To the wild fury of an injured prince

    Cas A vain surmise their talents would agree  
    The gods have made your noble mind for me         
    And her insipid soul for Ptolemy                  
    A heavy lump of earth without desire
    A heap of ashes that oerlays your fire

    Cleom Virtue you must allow her though a foe

    Cas No more than what I would to ice and snow
    Yet those have seeds of heat her shivering blood
    Makes her at best but impotently good
    But neither I can save you if you stay
    Nor save myself unless I go away
    For if I stay behind and set you free
    The fury of the king would fall on me

    Cleom Then to prevent your fate I must not go
    Death is my choice since heaven will have it so

    Cas Heaven would preserve your life and so would I
    But you are obstinately bent to die

    Cleom Some men are made of such a leaky mould
    That their filled vessels can no fortune hold
    Poured in it sinks away and leaves them dry
    Of that unsusceptible make am I
    Yet think not fair one I your charms despise
    My hearts insensible but not my eyes
    Respect and gratitude are all my store
    And those I give my love was given before

    Cas Thus break false merchants with an honest show
    Rich to themselves but bankrupts where they owe

    Cleom If at this awful distance I remain
    Better be too devout than too profane

    Cas Flattery such alms the priesthood give the poor
    They bless and send them empty from the door
    Know you that Death stands ready at the gate
    That I forbid him and suspend your fate
    The kings short absence leaves me absolute
    When he returns the inevitable ill
    Is past my power and may be past my will
    Unhappy man prevent thy destiny
    Speak one kind word to save thy life and me

    Cleom Be answered and expect no more reply

    Cas Disdain has swelled him up and choked his breath
    Sullen and dumb and obstinate to death
    No signs of pity in his face appear
    Look if the ungrateful creature shed one tear
    Crammed with his pride he leaves no room within
    For sighs to issue out or love to enter in
                                                 He turns away
    What dost thou turn thy face in my despite
    Am I a toad a monster to thy sight
    Farewell fond pity then As thou from me
    So thy good fortune turns her face from thee
    Left scorned and loathed and all without relief
    Revenge succeeds to love and rage to grief
    Tempests and whirlwinds through my bosom move  
    Heave up and madly mount my soul above         
    The reach of pity or the bounds of love     
    Approach and seize the traitor

Enter Guards

    Cleom Now I can speak thy kindness kept me dumb
    For that I could not answer The false Syren
    No longer hiding her uncomely parts
    Struts on the waves and shews the brute below

    Cas Stop that foul mouth Behold this royal signet
    The warrant of his death           Guards go to seize him

    Cleom Stand back ye slaves         He draws his Sword
    And put me not to stain a Spartan sword
    With base Egyptian blood
        He advances upon them they retire with signs of fear

    Cas Fall onBehold a noble beast at bay
    And the vile huntsmen shrinkMore aid Who waits

Enter CLEANTHES

    Now sir what brings you here

    Clean My zeal to serve you

    Cas That shall be tried disarm him

    Clean Cleomenes
    Deliver me your sword

    Cleom Hows this Cleanthes

    Clean It must be so

    Cleom Is this a friends advice
    To give me up defenceless to a crowd
    Whom armed I could resist

    Clean Must he die madam
    Or be reserved for further punishment
    At Ptolemys return

    Cas Why ask you that

    Clean Because his destiny for aught I find
    Depends on you Think first and then command

    Cas Know then that his last thread is on the distaff
    And I can cut it now

    Clean And are resolved

    Cas I only said I can and I can save
    Disarm and hurt him not

    Clean Once more your sword

    Cleom Stand off those villainsthough I fear them not
    Yet cowards are offensive to my sight
    Nor shall they see me do an act that looks
    Below the courage of a Spartan king

    Cas Cleanthes may I trust your faith

    Clean You may

    Cas Be gone and wait my call Exeunt Guards

    Cleom Cleanthes Still my friend for such I hold thee
    Though this bad woman says thou art my spy
    I cannot give a greater proof than this
    That I believe her not                Gives him his Sword
    If thou art false
    Tis in thy power to show it safely now
    And compass that by treason which in arms
    Nor thou nor any man alive can force
    Remember still I gave it to a friend
    For life and death are equal in themselves
    That which would cast the balance is thy falsehood
    To make my death more wretched

    Clean Then you may think me that which you call false
    But duty to my father

    Cleom Say no more
    I would not curse thee for thou wert my friend
    I think thee still as honest as thou couldst
    Impenetrably good but like Achilles
    Thou hadst a soft Egyptian heel undipt
    And that has made thee mortal

    Cas Cleanthes thou hast well approved thy faith
    And as this palace is thy government
    On utmost peril of thy life secure him
    One farther word                                Whispers

                    Exit CLEAN looking concernedly on CLEOM

    Cleom So guilty as thou art and canst thou look
    On him thou hast betrayedGo take thy hire
    Which thou hast dearly purchased and be great

    Cas For you brave sir as you have given my hopes
    But air to feed on air shall be your food
    No bread shall enter these forbidden doors
    Thin hungry diet I confess but still
    The liker Spartan fare Keen appetites
    And quick digestion wait on you and yours

    Cleom O mix not innocence and guilt together
    What love have they refused or how offended
    Be just though you are cruel or be kind
    And punish me alone

    Cas There nature works
    Then there Ill stab thee in thy tender part
                                       Shrieks of Women within

    Cleom What dismal cries are those

    Cas Nothing a trifling sum of misery
    Newadded to the foot of thy account
    Thy wife is seized by force and borne away
    Farewell I dare not trust thy vengeance further     Exit

    Running to the Door he is stopt by Guards with drawn Swords

    Cleom CleoraThere stands death but no Cleora
    I would find both together

Enter CRATESICLEA CLEONIDAS and PANTHEUS with Blood on his Hands

    Crat Oh king of Sparta

    Cleom Peace mother peace
    I have had news from hell before you
    Cleoras gone to death Is there a door
    A casement or a rift within these walls
    That can let loose my body to her rescue

    Panth All closed nothing but heaven above is open

    Cleom Nay thats closed too the gods are deaf to prayers
    Hush then the irrevocable dooms gone forth
    And prayers lag after but can neer oertake
    Let us talk forward of our woes to come

    Crat Cleanthes Oh could you suspect his faith
    Twas he that headed those who forced her hence

    Cleom Pantheus bleeds

    Panth A scratch a feeble dart
    At distance thrown by an Egyptian hand

    Crat You heard me not Cleanthes is

    Cleom He wasno more good mother
    He tore a piece of me away and still
    The void place aches within meO my boy
    I have bad news to tell thee

    Cleon None so bad
    As that I am a boy Cleanthes scorned me
    And when I drove a thrust home as I could
    To reach his traitor heart he put it by
    And cried as in derisionSpare the stripling
    Oh that insulting word I would have swopped
    Youth for old age and all my life behind
    To have been then a momentary man

    Cleom Alas thy manhood like a forward spring
    Before it comes to bear the promised fruit
    Is blighted in the bud Never my boy
    Canst thou fetch manhood up with thy short steps
    While with long strides the giant stalks before thee

    Cleon Am I to die before I am a man

    Cleom Yes thou must die with me and I with her
    Who gave me life and our poor infant too within
    Must die before it knows what dying means
    Three different dates of nature one would think
    But fate has crammed us all into one lease
    And that even now expiring

    Panth Yet we live

    Cleom No even now we die death is within us
    And keeps our life for nourishment is life
    And we have fed our last hunger feeds death

    Crat A lingering doom but four days hence the same
    And we can shorten those turn days to hours
    And hours to moments death is in our call

    Panth The sooner then the better

    Cleon So say I

    Panth While we have spirits left to meet him boldly

    Cleon Ill hold my breath
    And keep my soul a prisoner in my body
    There let it creep and wander in the dark
    Till tired to find no outlet it retreats
    Into my Spartan heart and there lies pleased
    So we two are providedSir your choice       To CLEOM

    Cleom Not this dispatch for we may die at leisure
    This famine has a sharp and meagre face
    Tis death in an undress of skin and bone
    Where age and youth their landmark taen away
    Look all one common furrow

    Crat Yet you chuse it
    To please our foes that when they view our skeletons
    And find them all alike they may cry out
    Look how these dull obedient Spartans died
    Just as we wished as we prescribed their death
    And durst not take a nobler nearer way

    Cleom Not so but that we durst not tempt the gods
    To break their images without their leave
    The moment ere Cassandra came I had
    A note without a name the hand unknown
    That bade me not despair but still hope well
    Then die not yet
    For heaven has means to free us if not me
    Yet these and you I am the hunted stag
    Whose life may ransom yours

    Crat No more of that
    I find your distant driftto die alone
    An unkind accusation of us all
    As if we durst not die Ill not survive you

    Panth Nor I

    Cleon Nor I

    Cleom But hear my reasons

    Enter CLEORA in a black Veil

    Ha what shadows this this that can glide through walls
    Or pass its subtile limbs through bolts and bars
    Black too like what it represents our fate

    Cleor Too true a shadow I and you the substance
                                             Lifts up her Veil

    Omnes Cleora

    Cleom Thus let me grow again to thee
    Too close for fate to sever
    Or let death find me in these dear dear arms
    And looking on thee spare my better part
    And take me willing hence

    Crat What are you dreaming son with eyes cast upwards
    Like a mad prophet in an ecstacy

    Cleom Musing on what we saw
    Just such is death
    With a black veil covering a beauteous face
    Feared afar off
    By erring nature a mistaken phantom
    A harmless lambent fire She kisses cold
    But kind and soft and sweet as my Cleora
    Oh could we know
    What joys she brings at least what rest from grief
    How should we press into her friendly arms
    And be pleased not to be or to be happy

    Crat Look what we have forgot The joy to see
    Cleora here has kept us from enquiring
    By what strange means she entered

    Cleom Small joy heaven knows to be adopted here
    Into the meagre family of famine
    The house of hunger therefore asked I not
    So am I pleased to have her company
    And so displeased to have it but in death

    Cleor I know not how or why my surly gaoler
    Hard as his irons and insolent as power
    When put in vulgar hands Cleanthes gone
    Put off the brute and with a gloomy smile
    That showed a sullen lothness to be kind
    Screened me within this veil then led me forth
    And using to the guards Cassandras name
    Made that my passport every door flew ope
    To admit my entrance and then clapt behind me
    To bar my going back

    Cleom Some new resolve
    Cassandra plots and then refines on malice
    Plays with revenge With rage she snatched you hence
    And renders you with scorn I thought to show you
    How easy twas to die by my example
    And hansel fate before you but thy presence
    Has changed my mind to drag this lingering life
    To share thy sorrows and assist thy weakness
    Come in my friends and let us practise death
    Stroke the grim lion till he grow familiar
    Cleora thou and I as lovers should
      Will hand in hand to the dark mansions go
      Where life no more can cheat us into woe
      That sucking in each others latest breath
      We may transfuse our souls and put the change on death
                                                        Exeunt




ACT VSCENE I


Enter CASSANDRA and SOSIBIUS

    Sosib And what have you determined

    Cas He shall die

    Sosib A wholesome resolution Have you fixed
    The time

    Cas He daily dies by hours and moments
    All vital nourishment but air is wanting
    Three rising days and two descending nights
    Have changed the face of heaven by turns
    But brought no kind vicissitude to him
    His state is still the same with hunger pinched
    Waiting the slow approaches of his death
    Which halting onwards as his life goes back
    Still gains upon his ground

    Sosib But ere fate reach him
    The mercy of the king may interpose
    You have the signet

    Cas Yes in your despite

    Sosib Be not displeasedsuppose he should escape

    Cas Suppose he should have wings impossible

    Sosib Yet keepers have been bribed To whom can Ptolemy
    Impute that crime but you

    Cas He may but let him if he dares
    Come statesman do not shuffle in your pace
    You would expose me to the peoples hatred
    By hurrying on this act of violence
    You know a little thing provokes the crowd
    Against a mistress shes the public mark
    Therefore content yourself I will be safe
    Nor shall the prisoner die a speedier death
    Than what my doom decreed unless the king
    Reverse his orders by my messenger

    Sosib May I presume to ask you whom you sent

    Cas Thy son unknown to thee for so I charged him
    And this the promised hour of his returnNay wonder not
    I chose him with design that whatsoeer
    The king ordains you both should share the event
    And stand or fall with me Ponder on that and leave me

    Sosib Aside What can she mean She neither kills nor saves
                                                 Exit SOSIBIUS

    Cas Now tell me heart now answer for thyself
    What wilt thou do and what dost thou desire
    His life No hes ungrateful or his death
    I tremble at that wordWhat then His love
    His love my heart What by restraint and famine
    Are these the means to compass thy design
    Revenge My hands so soft his heart so hard
    The blow recoils and hurts me while I strike
    Like the mad viper scourged into a rage
    I shoot into myself my fatal sting

Enter Mariner

    Mar The ship is ready when you please to sail
    And waits but your command The wind stands fair

    Cas Be secret and attend my farther pleasure
                          Gives him a Purse and exit Mariner
    So this was time well managed In three days
    To hire a vessel put my wealth on board
    Send off the observing son and fool the father
    See him I will to sound his last resolves
    If love can soften him or fear can bow
    If both should fail the ungrateful wretch shall find
    Rage has no bounds in slighted womankind             Exit


SCENE IIA Prison

Enter CLEOMENES

    Cleom No food and this the third arising sun
    But what have I to do with telling suns
    And measuring time that runs no more for me
    Yet sure the gods are good I would think so
    If they would give me leave
    But virtue in distress and vice in triumph
    Make atheists of mankind

Enter CRATESICLEA

    What comfort mother

    Crat A soul not conscious to itself of ill
    Undaunted courage and a master mind
    No comfort else but death
    Who like a lazy master stands aloof
    And leaves his work to the slow hands of famine

    Cleom All I would ask of heaven
    Is but to die alone a single ruin
    But to die oer and oer in each of you
    With my own hunger pinched but pierced with yours

    Crat Grieve not for me

    Cleom What not for you my mother
    Im strangely tempted to blaspheme the gods
    For giving me so good so kind a parent
    And this is my return to cause her death

    Crat Peace your misfortunes cause it not your fault

Enter CLEORA

    Cleom What my Cleora
    I stretched my bounds as far as I could go
    To shun the sight of what I cannot help
    A flower withering on the stalk for want
    Of nourishment from earth and showers from heaven
    All I can give thee is but rain of eyes   Wiping his Eyes

    Cleor Alas I have not wherewithal to weep
    My eyes grow dim and stiffened up with drought
    Can hardly roll and walk their feeble round
    Indeed I am faint

    Crat And so am I heaven knows However          Aside
    In pity of them both I keep it secret
    Nor shall he see me fall                        Exit CRAT

    Cleom How does your helpless infant

    Cleor It wants the breast its kindly nourishment
    And I have none to give from these dry cisterns
    Which unsupplied themselves can yield no more
    It pulled and pulled but now but nothing came
    At last it drew so hard that the blood followed
    And that red milk I found upon its lips
    Which made me swoon with fear

    Cleom Go in and rest thee
    And hush the child asleep                   Exit CLEORA
    Look down ye gods
    Look Hercules thou author of my race
    And jog thy father Jove that he may look
    On his neglected work of humankind
    Tell him I do not curse him but devotion
    Will cool in aftertimes if none but good men suffer
    What another increase of grief

Enter CLEONIDAS

    Cleon O father

    Cleom Why dost thou call me by so kind a name
    A father that implies presiding care
    Cheerful to give willing himself to want
    Whateer thy needs require

    Cleon A little food
    Have you none father One poor hungry morsel
    Or give me leave to die as I desired
    For without your consent heaven knows I dare not

    Cleom I prythee stay a littleI am loth
    To say hard things of heaven

    Cleon But what if heaven
    Will do hard things must not hard things be said
    Youve often told me that the souls of kings
    Are made above the rest of human race
    Have they not fortunes fitted for those souls
    Did ever king die starved

    Cleom I know not that
    Yet still be firm in thisThe gods are good
    Though thou and I may perish

    Cleon Indeed I know not
    That ever I offended heaven in thought
    I always said my prayers

    Cleom Thou didst thy duty

    Cleon And yet you lost the battle when I prayed

    Cleom Twas in the Fates I should but hold thee there
    The rest is all unfathomable depth
    This we well know that if there be a bliss
    Beyond this present life tis purchased here
    And virtue is its price

    Cleon But are you sure
    Our souls shall be immortal

    Cleom Why that question

    Cleon Because I find that now my body starves
    My soul decays I think not as I did
    My head goes round and now you swim before me
    Methinks my soul is like a flame unfed
    With oil that dances up and down the lamp
    But must expire ere long

    Cleom I prythee try to hold it while thou canst

    Cleon I would obey you
    As I have always done but I am faint
    And when you please to let me die Ill thank you

    Cleom Thou shall have food I promise thee thou shalt

    Cleon Then you shall promise to have food for yourself too
    For if you have it not I would refuse to eat
    Nay I would chuse to die that you might feed on me

    Cleom Mark heaven his filial love
    And if a family of such as these
    Must perish thus your model is destroyed
    By which you made good men

Enter PANTHEUS hastily

    Panth Be cheerful sir the gods have sent us food

    Cleom They tried me of the longest but by whom

    Panth Go in and see

    Cleon Good father do not stay to ask but go

    Cleom Go thou thy youth calls fiercer than my age

    Cleon But then make haste and come to take your part
    Hunger may make me impious to eat all
    And leave you last to starve               Exit CLEONIDAS

    Panth Sir will you go

    Cleom I know not I am half seas oer to death
    And since I must die once I would be loth
    To make a double work of whats half finished
    Unless I could be sure the gods would still
    Renew these miraclesWho brought this food

    Panth Hes here that can resolve you     Exit PANTHEUS

Enter CLEANTHES with a Sword in his Hand

    Cleom How darest thou come again within my sight
    Thou artbut tis no matter what thou art
    Ill not consider thee so far to think
    Thee worth reproachAway away Egyptian
    Thats all the name thats left thee

    Clean Such I appear indeed

    Cleom Why then for once that which thou seemst thou art
    Begone

    Clean Oh I have been too long away

    Cleom Too soon thou art returned
    To triumph oer my fate

    Clean Forgive me that I seemed your foe

    Cleom Forgive me heaven for thinking thee my friend
    No more tis loss of time to talk

    Clean Indeed it is
    When hunger calls so loud for sustenance
    But whether friend or foe tis food I bring

    Cleom Tis poison and my mother and my wife
    And my poor famished boy are eating death
    Thou wouldst not have me think that thou repentst

    Clean Heaven knows I do not

    Cleom Well said man Go on and be not bashful
    To own the merits of thy wickedness

    Clean What need has innocence of a repentance

    Cleom Shuffling again Prythee be of a piece
    A little steadiness becomes a villain

    Clean Oh friendfor yet I dare to call you so
    Which if I were a villain sure I durst not
    Hear me or kill me

    Cleom So by heaven I would
    For thy profaning friendships holy name
    But for thou seest no justice hanging here
    On this bare side thou talkst secure of vengeance

    Clean Then if you had a sword my deaths resolved

    Cleom Thy conscience answers thee

    Clean Without more evidence than bare surmise
    At most appearance of a crime unproved
    And while unproved uncertain

    Cleom Traitor no more tis fulsome

    Clean Take the sword                  Throws it to him

    Cleom I thank thee draw thy own           Takes it up

    Clean No take that too       Draws his and offers it

    Cleom Fool wouldst thou die without defence

    Clean I would not
    But you forbade me to defend myself
    Then when you would not hear me

    Cleom Can falsehood have a better argument
    Than force for its defence Trust to that topic
    And bear thee like a man

    Clean I think I do

    Cleom What kind of man is that who dares not fight

    Clean The man who dares not when his honour calls
    Is what you mean but what I never was
    For honour never summons without reason
    Force is the law of brutes the dumb creation
    Where words and reason want appeal to might
    I thought a king and what you boast a Spartan
    Might have known this without the Egyptians telling

    Cleom Come come thou darst not fight

    Clean By heaven I dare
    But first my honour must be justified
    If you dare be my judge
    For in this crude and indigested quarrel
    If I should fall unheard you kill your friend
    The man who loved you best and holds you dearest
    And should you perish in the unjust attempt
    The sword that slew you should revenge your death
    For I should soon oertake you in the way
    To quit myself before you reached the shades
    And told your tale to Minos

    Cleom Then I must hear but swear swear first I charge thee
    That when I have pronounced thou wilt no more
    Prolong thy prattle with some new excuse
    And prythee cut it short because I faint
    And long to kill thee firstOh I am going
    A rising vapour rumbles in my brains
    I hear my words far offstand stand thou traitor
    And swim not thus before metis too late

     Puts the Point upon the Ground once or twice leans on it and
     staggers

    And I fall unrevenged  Offers to run at him and is falling

    Clean What ho Pantheus
                            Runs to him and takes him in his arms
    The best of men is dying in my arms
    And I want power to save him

Enter PANTHEUS

    Panth O heavens what means this direful object

    Clean Ask not with unassisting pity bow him forward
    Rub his numbed temples while I wipe the sweat
    From his cold clammy face

    Panth His mounting heart
    Bounces against my hands as if it would
    Thrust off his manly soul

    Clean Wrench ope his mouth
    While I infuse these sovereign drops whose power
    Will soon recall his wandered sense
             He instills somewhat out of a Vial into his Mouth
    He stirs
    And stretches now and seems to essay his limbs

    Cleom Where am I    Standing a while they support him

    Clean In his arms who died with you
    And now you live revives

    Cleom Art thou Pantheus

    Panth Believe your eyes I am

    Cleom Speak then and truly for I trust not him
    Who brought me back to life

    Panth Who but he who was left single with you
    Who caught you falling in his faithful arms
    And not alone sufficient to restore you
    Called loud for my assistance
    I found him propping you with trembling hands
    His eyes so hagard I could scarce distinguish
    Who was the living friend and who the dead

    Cleom All this Cleanthes This what this Cleanthes

    Panth Yes your Cleanthes

    Clean Your suspected friend
    Much wronged but ever faithful

    Cleom Art thou sure
    I live Or am I in the regions of the dead
    And hear the fables there myself a fable

    Panth Go in and see your chearful family
    Eating his bread brought in their last distress
    And with a good mistaking piety
    First blessing him then heaven

    Cleom When I hear this I have no need of food
    I am restored without it

    Clean Then now hear me
    How I was forced into this seeming falsehood
    To save myself the only means remaining
    To save the man I love beyond myself
    And gain a needful credit with Cassandra
    And yet even then deceived and sent far off
    For three long days unknowing of your wants
    Not thinking she who loved could use you thus
    By famishment to

    Cleom O no more no more
    For now I understand ere thou canst speak it half
    To thee I owed the seizing of my sword
    Lest I should fall by odds my wifes return
    All all to thee and thou art more than all
    Canst thou forgive me Canst thou my Cleanthes
    Can I deserve thus to grow here once more   Embracing him
    Let me embrace myself quite into thee

    Clean Come come as fiercely as thou wilt I meet thee
                                                Embraces CLEOM
    I close within thee and am thou again

    Panth Why this is as it should be

    Cleom I could not thus have taken to the death
    Anothers falsehood but thine only thine
    For infinitely infinitely loving
    Twas a wide gap thou madst within my bosom
    And as my soul rent from me

    Clean But thy hunger
    This violent transport of my reconcilement
    Makes me forget thy wants when I embraced thee
    Thy spungy body dwindled in my arms
    And like a ghost fled from me

    Cleom I could eat                            Going in
    Now my first appetite of love is served
    And that was much the keenest Let us in
    For life looks lovely now and worth preserving

    Clean Not that way friend
    It leads you to the women and the boy

    Cleom And why must I avoid those tender blessings

    Clean Even such because they are you must avoid them
    For I must tell you friend you have but time
    To snatch a hasty morsel and away
    Nothing of manhood must be clogged or softened
    With womanish sighs and tears and kind adieus
    And those illtimed remorses of good nature
    When your whole soul is needful

    Panth You tell us wonders

    Clean At the kings return
    Which daily we expect your deaths resolved
    This hours your own take it and tempt your fortune
    Some few brave friends I hope to add
    If not all Egypts numbered in myself

    Cleom Im all on fireNow for a lucky pull
    At fates last lottery
    I long to see the colour white or black
    Thats the gods work and if I fall their shame
    Let them neer think of making heroes more
    If cowards must prevail

    Panth The fewer hands
    The fewer partners in the share of honour

    Cleom Come my Pantheuslead my best Cleanthes
    We three to all the world

    Clean Magas and liberty let be the word
    Magas is loved and liberty desired
    A short refection waits at the lieutenants
    That honest friend who sent you back your wife
    Well drink a bowl of wine and pour the rest
    Not to the dog Anubis but to Jove
    The freer and avenger                              Exeunt

Enter CRATESICLEA CLEORA CLEONIDAS

    Cleor Gone and without taking leave

    Crat The better
    He bated me the forms and you the fondness

    Cleon Pantheus too and he who brought the food
    The brave Egyptian vanished altogether

    Cleor Oh my foreboding soul hes gone to death
    And that Cleanthes whom thou callst the brave
    Has basely trained him to his destruction

    Crat Suspect him not when fate was in his power
    And by a method so secure as famine
    To save us then shows he had little need
    To trick my son to death
    I have a better prospect of the event

    Cleor Dear mother comfort me and tell your thoughts
    For I see nothing but a gathering tempest
    Horror on horror to the end of heaven

    Crat No no you are not of a soul to bear
    The mighty good and ill that meet midway
    As from two goals and which comes first upon us
    Fate only knows

    Cleon Then speak to me for I can stand the shock
    Like a young plant that fastens in a storm
    And deeper drives the root

    Crat Thy souls too strong thy body yet too weak
    To bear the crush Be still and wait thy doom
                  A cry within Liberty liberty Magas Magas
    To arms for Magas and for liberty

    Cleon What noble sound was that so smart and vigorous
    A soul in every word

    Crat Why that was it
    I thought was doing but I durst not tell
    Till now it shows itself
    The works begun my boy the works begun
    There was thy father in that warlike shout
    Stemming the tide of Egypt

    Cleor O comfort me my husbands mother say
    My lord may live and conquer

    Crat Possibly
    But still make sure of death trust we to that
    As to our last reserve

    Cleor Alas I dare not die

    Crat Come come you dare
    Do not belye your courage

    Cleor Heaven help me I have none

    Crat Then dare you be a slave to base Egyptians
    For that must be if you outlive your husband

    Cleor I think I durst to save myself from death

    Crat Then as a slave you durst be ravished too

    Cleor The Gods forbid

    Crat The Gods cannot forbid it
    By any way but death

    Cleor Then I dare die

    Crat I told you so you did not know your virtue
    Poor trembling thing Ill warm thee in my bosom
    And make thee take death kindly
      Another Shout withinLiberty and Magas

    Cleon What must become of me

    Crat More trouble yet about this paltry being
    For shame no more such qualms

    Cleon No more such vile mistakes I would die warm
    And not in womens company but mens
    Whether some god inspires me to this act
    Or fate inevitably calls me on
    I will not cannot stay
    But as a generous unfleshed hound that hears
    From far the hunters horn and chearful cry
    So will I haste and by the music led
    Come up with death or honour                         Exit

    Cleor Stop him dear mother he may comfort us
    But cannot help his father

    Crat The heros blood is not to be controuled
    Even in a child tis madly masterful
    But wait we patient with our petty stakes
    Which on those greater gamesters must depend
    For as they throw our little lots must follow
    Like sweepings of their heap

    And could they be their own they would be ours

    Cleom Theyre gone we talk to houses and to walls

Four Egyptians appear peeping from the opposite Entrances of the Stage

    Clean Explain what cause and give the general cry

     and  Egypt Liberty and Magas

    Cleom In their Tone Liberty and Magas
    The cowards whisper liberty so softly
    As if they were afraid the gods would hear it
    And take them at their word

 Egypt No friend We vulgar never fear the gods but we whisper
for fear our oerthwart neighbours should hear us cry Liberty and
betray us to the government

    Clean Of what side are you there  To the opposite Egyptian

 Egypt Thats according as you succeed of your side hitherto

Panth If you are men come join with us

 Egypt You are too few for us to join with you but

to help the common cry

Cleom Dare you do nothing to assert your freedom

 Egypt Yeswell pray devoutly for you

Clean The brave pray with their swords thats a mans part

 Egypt Praying with our swords the law calls fighting and
fighting is bloodshed and bloodshed is hanging and hanging is the
part of a dog and not of a man in my opinion

    Cleom Not worth the seeking Are these fit to atone
    For Cleomenes mother son and wife
    But what the gods have left us we must take

    Clean Tis all in vain we have no further work
    The people will not be dragged out to freedom
    They bar their doors against it Nay the prisoners
    Even guard their chains as their inheritance
    And man their very dungeons for their masters
    Lest godlike liberty the common foe
    Should enter in and they be judged hereafter
    Accomplices of freedom

    Panth Then we may sheath our swords

    Clean We may Pantheus
    But as brave men should each in his bosom
    That only way is left us to die free

    Cleom Alls lost for which I once desired to live

    Panth Come to our business then Be speedy sir
    And give the word Ill be the first to charge
    The grim foe death

    Cleom Fortune thou hast reduced me very low
    To do the drudgery of fate myself
    What not one brave Egyptian not one worthy
    To do me manly right in single combat
    To fall beneath my furyfor thats justice
    But then to drag me afterfor to die
    And yet in death to conquer is my wish

    Clean Then have your wish The gods at last are kind
    And have provided you a sword thats worthy
    To match your own Tis an Egyptians too

    Cleom Is there that hidden treasure in thy country
    The gods be praised for such a foe I want

    Clean Not such a foe but such a friend am I
    I would fall first for fear I should survive you
    And pull you after to make sure in death
    To be your undivided friend for ever

    Cleom Then enter we into each others breasts
    Tis a sharp passage yet a kind one too
    But to prevent the blind mistake of swords
    Lest one drop first and leave his friend behind
    Both thrust at once and home and at our hearts
    Let neither stand on guard but let our bosoms
    Lie open to each other in our death
    As in our life they were

    Clean I seal it thus                  Kiss and embrace

    Panth And wheres my part You shut me out like churls
    While you devour the feast of death betwixt you

    Cleom Cheer up thy soul and thou shalt die Pantheus
    But in thy turn theres death enough for all
    But as I am thy master wait my leisure
    And honestly compose my limbs to rest
    Then serve thyselfNow are you ready friend

    Clean I am

    Cleom Then this to our next happy meeting

     They both push together then stagger backwards and fall
     together in each others Arms

    Clean Speak have I served you to your wish my friend

    Cleom Yes friendthou hastI have thee in my heart
    Sayart thou sped

    Clean I amtis my last breath

    Cleom And minethen both are happy         Both die

    Panth So this was well performed and soon dispatched
    Both sound asleep already
    And farewell both for one short moment
                                 Trumpets sound Victory within
    Those are the foes our little band is lost
    For want of these defenders I must hasten
    Lest I be forced to live and led in triumph
    Defrauded of my fate Ive earned it well
    And finished all my task This is my place
    Just at my masters feetGuard him ye gods
    And save his sacred corpse from public shame
                 He falls on his Sword and lies at the foot of
                   CLEOMENESDies

Enter SOSIBIUS CASSANDRA and Egyptians

    Sosib Twas what my heart foreboded There he lies
    Extended by the man whom best he loved
    A better friend than son

    Cas Whats he or thou or Ptolemy or Egypt
    Or all the world to Cleomenes lost

    Sosib Then I suspected right If my revenge
    Can ease my sorrow this the king shall know
    That thou mayst reap the due reward of treason
    And violated love

    Cas Thy worst old dotard
    I wish to die but if my mind should change
    So well I know my power that thou art lost

    Sosib The kings arrival shall decide our fate
    Mean time to show how much I honour virtue
    Take up that heros body bear it high
    Like the procession of a deity
      Let his armed figure on his tomb be set
      And we like slaves lie grovelling at his feet
      Whose glories growing till his latest breath
      Excelled all others and his own in death        Exeunt




EPILOGUE

SPOKEN BY MRS BRACEGIRDLE


    This day the Poet bloodily inclined
    Has made me die full sore against my mind
    Some of you naughty men I fear will cry
    Poor rogue would I might teach thee how to die
    Thanks for your love but I sincerely say
    I never mean to die your wicked way
    Well since it is decreed all flesh must go
    And I am fleshat least for aught you know
    I first declare I die with pious mind
    In perfect charity with all mankind
    Next for my willI have in my dispose
    Some certain moveables would please you beaux
    As first my youth for as I have been told
    Some of you modish sparks are devilish old
    My chastity I need not leave among ye
    For to suspect old fops were much to wrong ye
    You swear youre sinners but for all your haste
    Your misses shake their heads and find you chaste
    I give my courage to those bold commanders
    Who stay with us and dare not go for Flanders
    I leave my truth to make his plot more clear
    To Mr Fuller when he next shall swear
    I give my judgment craving all your mercies
    To those that leave good plays for damned dull farces
    My small devotion let the gallants share
    That come to ogle us at evening prayer
    I give my personlet me well consider
    Faith een to him that is the fairest bidder
    To some rich hunks if any be so bold
    To say those dreadful words To have and hold
    But stayto give and be bequeathing still
    When Im so poor is just like Wickhams will
    Like that notorious cheat vast sums I give
    Only that you may keep me while I live
    Buy a good bargain gallants while you may
    Ill cost you but your halfacrown a day

in imitation of Pomponius Atticus to take himself off by abstinence
and this resolution he executed like an ancient Roman He saw company
to the last cracked his jokes conversed freely and entertained his
guests with music On the third day of his fast he found himself
entirely freed of his complaint but refused taking sustenance He
said the most disagreeable part of the voyage was past and he should
be a cursed fool indeed to put about ship when he was just entering
the harbour In these sentiments he persisted without any marks of
affectation and thus finished his course with such ease and serenity

LOVE TRIUMPHANT

OR

NATURE WILL PREVAIL

A

TRAGICOMEDY


    Quod optanti Divm promittere nemo
    Auderet volvenda dies en attulit ultr      VIRG




LOVE TRIUMPHANT


This piece which concluded our authors labours as a dramatic poet
was unsuccessful when represented and affords very little pleasure
when perused If we except Amboyna our author never produced a play
where the tragic part had less interest or the comic less humour
For the faults of Amboyna Dryden pleaded the barren nature of the
subject chosen not with a view to dramatic effect but to attain a
political purpose and the hurry of writing upon a temporary theme
But that he should have failed in a play avowedly intended to crown
his dramatic labours where the story was of his own device and the
composition at his own leisure can only be imputed to that occasional
flatness or cessation of the divine influence as an ancient would
have expressed it from which men of the highest poetic genius are not
exempted In despite of all cold reasoning upon this subject the fact
is irresistible that our capacity of exerting mental talents is not
more absolute than that which we possess over our bodily powers We are
in each case limited by a thousand external and internal circumstances
which occasion the greatest and most involuntary inequalities between
our happier and our inferior efforts of mental abilities or of
corporeal strength It can only be to the temporary failure of the
poetic inspiration which like the wind of heaven bloweth where it
listeth and neither to want of labour nor to impaired talents that
we are to attribute the inferiority of Love Triumphant to almost all
Drydens other compositions

The plot is unhappily chosen For as we have had already occasion to
notice stories turning or appearing to turn upon incestuous passion
have seldom been successful upon the modern stage Davies in his
Dramatic Miscellanies attributes Garricks renouncing his intention
of reviving the admirable old play of King and no King to the ardent
passion which Arbaces conceives for his supposed sister and which that
excellent judge suspected would not be tolerated in our age Phdra
and Hippolitus though most powerfully supported both by actors and
admirers failed for the same reason and according to Davies even
the various excellencies of Don Sebastian were unable to expiate
the disgust excited by the unpleasing discovery of his relation
to Almeyda While Love Triumphant labours under this capital and
disagreeable defect little ingenuity can be discovered in the story
abstracted from that consideration The king of Castile suffers his
sole and only offspring to remain in the court of a rival and hostile
monarch and even to head armies against him supposing himself the son
of his enemy The virtuous Queen of Arragon cultivates and encourages
a passion having all the moral guilt of an incestuous attachment
between her own daughter and her supposed son The tyrant Veramond is
the only person who acts upon rational principles through the piece He
refuses the liberty of a rival king to the petulant demand of Alphonso
and not very unreasonably proposes to separate his son and daughter
before worse consequences arose from their infamous and impudently
avowed passion But by this very natural conduct he gains the hatred
of his wife his children and his subjects

    Miranda canit sed non credenda poeta

After so many and such violent stretches of probability the author
does not deign to wind up the plot otherwise than by a sudden change
in the temper and resolutions of Veramond a conclusion which he
himself admits in general to be grossly inartificial and which in the
present case is peculiarly infelicitous The ruling passion of Veramond
seems to be a hatred of his rival Ramirez and a sort of instinctive
antipathy to Alphonso even when he believes him to be his own son
just arrived from conquest in his behalf This hatred and aversion
was not likely to be abated by the objects of them turning out to be
father and son nor much soothed by the circumstance of their making
him prisoner in his own metropolis Yet in this situation moved by a
few soft speeches from Celidea who had taken a fancy to the intended
husband of her sister the tyrant of Arragon alters his whole family
arrangements and habits of mind and takes his hated foes into his
family and bosom merely that the play may be concluded The author
of these inconsistencies can hardly escape the censure of Aristotle
against which he has pleaded in the preface

With regard to the poetry of Love Triumphant it is somewhat
remarkable that in the most laboured scenes of this last effort of
his tragic muse Dryden has had recourse to his discarded mistress
Rhyme As this could hardly arise from an alteration of his final
opinion it may have been owing to a consciousness that there was
some deficiency in the piece which the harmony of numbers might veil
though it could not supply The turn of the dialogue also is quite in
our poets early manner The lovers in the first scene of the second
act burning with a horrible passion which they felt it death to
conceal and infamy and mortal sin to avow communicate their feelings
to each other in alternate couplets like two contending Arcadians
Their horror evaporates in antithesis and their passion in quaint
prettinesses Witness the speech of Alphonso

    Alph Oh raging impious and yet hopeless fire
    Not daring to possess what I desire
    Condemnd to suffer what I cannot bear
    Torturd with love and furious with despair
    Of all the pains which wretched mortals prove
    The fewest remedies belong to love
    But ours has none for if we should enjoy
    Our fatal cure must both of us destroy
    Oh dear Victoria cause of all my pain
    Oh dear Victoria whom I would not gain
    Victoria for whose sake I would survive
    Victoria for whose sake I dare not live

If the tragic part of Love Triumphant have little merit the comic
has even less The absurdity of the two gallants disguising themselves
in hopes to pass for the deceased Conde upon a mistress who had
borne him two children is too gross for a puppetshow or pantomime
and there is nothing in the dialogue to attone for the flatness and
extravagance of the plot It may however be remarked that Sancho
a tawdry and conceited coxcomb the son of a Jewish usurer and
favoured by the father of his mistress only for his wealth has some
resemblance in manners and genealogy to a much more pleasant character
that of Isaac in the Duenna

It is impossible to dismiss a performance of Dryden without some
tribute of praise The verse where it is employed possesses as
usual all the dignity which numbers can give to language and the
Song upon Jealousy as well as that in the character of a Girl have
superior merit

The play was received as ill as might be so at least we are informed
by a curious letter preserved by Mr Malone dated d March 
in which the writer after chuckling over the failure of the Double
Dealer and the absolute damnation of Love Triumphant concludes
that the success of Southernes Fatal Marriage will encourage the
minor poets and vex huffing Dryden and Congreve to madness
Dryden himself it may be noticed says nothing in the preface
concerning the reception of the piece all authorities however state
it to have been unfavourable and thus as Dr Johnson has remarked
this great poet opened and closed his theatrical career with bad
success a fact which may secure the inexperienced author from
despondence and teach him who has gained reputation how little he
ought to presume on its stability

Love Triumphant was first acted and published in

Footnote  The second play is Mr Drydens called Love Triumphant
or Nature will prevail It is a tragicomedy but in my opinion one
of the worst he ever writ if not the very worst the comical part
descends beneath the style and show of a BartholomewFair droll It was
damned by the universal cry of the town nemine contradicente but the
conceited poet He says in his prologue that this is the last the town
must expect from him he had done himself a kindness had he taken his
leave before




TO

THE RIGHT HONOURABLE

JAMES

EARL OF SALISBURY c


MY LORD

This poem being the last which I intend for the theatre ought to
have the same provision made for it which old men make for their
youngest child which is commonly a favourite They who were born
before it carry away the patrimony by right of eldership this is
to make its fortune in the world and since I can do little for it
natural affection calls upon me to put it out at least into the best
service which I can procure for it and as it is the usual practice
of our decayed gentry to look about them for some illustrious family
and their endeavour to fix their young darling where he may be both
well educated and supported I have herein also followed the custom
of the world and am satisfied in my judgment that I could not have
made a more worthy choice It is true I am not vain enough to think
that anything of mine can in any measure be worthy of your lordships
patronage and yet I should be ashamed to leave the stage without some
acknowledgment of your former favours which I have more than once
experienced Besides the honour of my wifes relation to your noble
house to which my sons may plead some title though I cannot
you have been pleased to take a particular notice of me even in this
lowness of my fortunes to which I have voluntarily reduced myself
and of which I have no reason to be ashamed This condescension
my lord is not only becoming of your antient family but of your
personal character in the world and if I value myself the more for
your indulgence to me and your opinion of me it is because any thing
which you like ought to be considered as something in itself and
therefore I must not undervalue my present labours because I have
presumed to make you my patron A man may be just to himself though he
ought not to be partial and I dare affirm that the several manners
which I have given to the persons of this drama are truly drawn from
nature all perfectly distinguished from each other that the fable is
not injudiciously contrived that the turns of fortune are not managed
unartfully and that the last revolution is happily enough invented
Aristotle I acknowledge has declared that the catastrophe which is
made from the change of will is not of the first order of beauty but
it may reasonably be alledged in defence of this play as well as of
the Cinna which I take to be the very best of Corneilles that
the philosopher who made the rule copied all the laws which he gave
for the theatre from the authorities and examples of the Greek poets
which he had read and from their poverty of invention he could get
nothing but mean conclusions of wretched tales where the mind of the
chief actor was for the most part changed without art or preparation
only because the poet could not otherwise end his play Had it been
possible for Aristotle to have seen the Cinna I am confident he
would have altered his opinion and concluded that a simple change of
will might be managed with so much judgment as to render it the most
agreeable as well as the most surprising part of the whole fable
let Dacier and all the rest of the modern critics who are too much
bigotted to the ancients contend ever so much to the contrary I was
afraid that I had been the inventor of a new sort of designing when
in my third act I make a discovery of my Alphonsos true parentage
If it were so what wonder had it been that dramatic poetry though a
limited art yet might be capable of receiving some innovations for
the better But afterwards I casually found that Menander and Terence
in the Heautontimoroumenos had been before me and made the same
kind of discovery in the same act As for the mechanic unitiesthat
of time is much within the compass of an astrological day which begins
at twelve and ends at the same hour the day following that of place
is not observed so justly by me as by the ancients for their scene
was always one and almost constantly in some public place Some of
the late French poets and amongst the English my most ingenious
friend Mr Congreve have observed this rule strictly though the place
was not altogether so public as a street I have followed the example
of Corneille and stretched the latitude to a street and palace not
far distant from each other in the same city They who will not
allow this liberty to a poet make it a very ridiculous thing for an
audience to suppose themselves sometimes to be in a field sometimes
in a garden and at other times in a chamber There are not indeed
so many absurdities in their supposition as in ours but it is an
original absurdity for the audience to suppose themselves to be in
any other place than in the very theatre in which they sit which is
neither chamber nor garden nor yet a public place of any business
but that of the representation For my action it is evidently double
and in that I have the most of the ancients for my examples Yet I
dare not defend this way by reason much less by their authority
for their actions though double were of the same species that is
to say in their comedies two amours and their persons were better
linked in interests than mine Yet even this is a fault which I should
often practise if I were to write again because it is agreeable to
the English genius We love variety more than any other nation and
so long as the audience will not be pleased without it the poet is
obliged to humour them On condition they were cured of this public
vice I could be content to change my method and gladly give them a
more reasonable pleasure This digression my lord is not altogether
the purpose of an epistle dedicatory yet it is expected that somewhat
should be said even here in relation to criticism at least in
vindication of my address that you may not be desired to patronize a
poem which is wholly unworthy of your protection Though after all I
doubt not but some will liken me to the lover in a modern comedy who
was combing his peruke and setting his cravat before his mistress
and being asked by her when he intended to begin his court replied
He had been doing it all this while Yet thus it happens my lord
that self will come into all addresses of this nature though it is
the most unmannerly word of the world in civil conversation and the
most ungrateful to all hearers For which reason I who have nothing
to boast of but my misfortunes ought to be the first to banish it
especially since I have so large a field before me as your inborn
goodness your evenness of temper your humility in so ample a share of
fortune as you possess your humanity to all men and your kindness to
your friends besides your natural and acquired endowments and your
brotherly love to your relations Notus in fratres animo paterno was
the great commendation which Horace gave to one of his patrons and it
is that praise which particularly crowns your other virtues But here
my lord I am obliged in common prudence to stop short and to cast
under a veil some other of your praises as the chemists use to shadow
the secret of their great elixir lest if it were made public the
world should make a bad use of it To enjoy our own quiet without
disturbing that of others is the practice of every moral man and for
the rest to live chearfully and splendidly as it is becoming your
illustrious birth so it is likewise to thank God for his benefits in
the best manner It is unnecessary to wish you more worldly happiness
or content of mind than you enjoy but the continuance of both to
yourself and your posterity is earnestly desired by all who have the
honour to be known to you and more particularly by

    MY LORD
    Your lordships
    most obedient and
    most humbly devoted servant
    JOHN DRYDEN

attached to the religion and cause of his former master James II

Footnote  It was an ancient custom derived from the days of
chivalry but which long survived them that as formerly the future
knight had to go through a preliminary course of education as page and
squire to some person of rank and valour so the pages of the quality
so late as the Revolution were the sons of gentlemen and in no way
derogated from their birth by accepting that menial situation This is
often alluded to in the old plays In the New Inn for example when
Lovel asks of the Host his son for a page we have an account of the
decay of the institution from its original purposes and respectability

    Lovel Call you that desperate which by a line
    Of institution from our ancestors
    Hath been derived down to us and received
    In a succession for the noblest way
    Of breeding up our youth in letters arms
    Fair mien discourses civil exercise
    And all the blazon of a gentleman
    Where can he learn to vault to ride to fence
    To move his body gracefuller to speak
    His language purer or tune his mind
    And manners more to the harmony of nature
    Than in these nurseries of nobility

    Host Aye that was when the nurseries self was noble
    And only virtue made it not the market
    That titles were not vented at the drum
    Or common outcry Goodness gave the greatness
    And greatness worship Every house became
    An academy of honour and those parts
    We see departed in the practice now
    Quite from the institution

    Lovel Why do you say so
    Or think so enviously do they not still
    Learn there the centaurs skill the art of Thrace
    To ride or Pollux mystery to fence
    The Pyrrhick gesture both to dance and spring
    In armour to be active for the wars
    To study figures numbers and proportions
    May yield them great in counsel and the arts
    Grave Nestor and the wise Ulysses practised
    To make their English sweet upon their tongue
    As reverend Chaucer says

    Host Sir you mistake
    To play Sir Pandarus my copy hath it
    And carry messages to Madam Cresside
    Instead of backing the brave steed o mornings
    To mount the chambermaid and for a leap
    O the vaulting horse to ply the vaulting house
    For exercise of arms a bale of dice
    Or two or three packs of cards to shew the cheat
    And nimbleness of hand mistake a cloak
    From my lords back and pawn it ease his pockets
    Of a superfluous watch or geld a jewel
    Of an odd stone or so twinge two or three buttons
    From off my ladys gown These are the arts
    Or seven liberal deadly sciences
    Of pagery or rather paganism
    As the tides run to which if he apply him
    He may perhaps take a degree at Tyburn

Footnote  The second earl of Salisbury married an aunt of Lady
Elizabeth Dryden his son lord Cranbourne was grandfather of James
the fourth earl and therein consisted the relationship between
Drydens sons and the family of his patron to which it is somewhat
difficult in modern days to give an exact name

with our modern ideas of good breeding seems to have been an air
frequently assumed by the beaus of the seventeenth century In a play
by Killigrew called the Parsons Wedding we have this direction

heads and talk Our author alludes to the same fashion in the
Prologue to the Conquest of Grenada Part II

    Straight every man who thinks himself a wit
    Perks up and managing his comb with grace

The same custom is alluded to by Congreve and is supposed to have
remained fashionable during Queen Annes time

virtue which would not bear the light must have been lord Salisburys
secret attachment to the exiled monarch

    As when some treasurer lays down the stick
    Warrants are signed for ready money thick

    So now this poet who forsakes the stage
    Intends to gratify the present age
    One warrant shall be signed for every man
    All shall be wits that will and beaux that can
    Provided still this warrant be not shown
    And you be wits but to yourselves alone
    Provided too you rail at one another
    For theres no one wit will allow a brother
    Provided also that you spare this story
    Damn all the plays that eer shall come before ye
    If one by chance prove good in half a score
    Let that one pay for all and damn it more
    For if a good one scape among the crew          
    And you continue judging as you do               
    Every bad play will hope for damning too         
    You might damn this if it were worth your pains

    To his worst foes he leaves his honesty
    That they may thrive upont as much as he
    He leaves his manners to the roaring boys
    Who come in drunk and fill the house with noise
    He leaves to the dire critics of his wit
    His silence and contempt of all they writ
    To Shakespears critic he bequeaths the curse
    To find his faults and yet himself make worse
    A precious reader in poetic schools
    Who by his own examples damns his rules
    Last for the fair he wishes you may be
    From your dull critics the lampooners free

ACT I


SCENE IA Presencechamber

     At the drawing up of the Curtain VERAMOND King of Arragon
     appears XIMENA the Queen by him VICTORIA their eldest
     Daughter on the right Hand and CELIDEA their younger
     Daughter on the left Courtiers stand attending in File on each
     Side of the stage The Men on the one Hand the Ladies on the
     other Amongst the Men DON LOPEZ amongst the Women DALINDA
     his Daughter

    Vera Now the long wars betwixt Castile and Arragon
    Are ended in the ruin of our foes
    And fierce Ramirez the Castilian king
    Who tugged for empire with our warlike son
    In single combat taken adds his laurels
    To the young victors brow our tender maids
    And trembling children shall with scorn behold
    The haughty captive who had made his vaunts
    To lay their dwellings level and with salt
    To sow the place where Saragossa stood

    Xim Processions prayers and public thanks to heaven
    Were fit to be decreed

    Vera Your sex is ever foremost in devotion
    But for our brave confederate young Navarre
    He shall receive the prize reserved within
    My breast and such a one
    His youth and valour have right well deserved

    Xim I hear he comes along with our Alphonso
    And next our son did best

    Vera Perhaps as well
    Alphonsos action was indeed more glorious
    To buckle with a king in single fight
    And take him prisoner but his fiery temper
    Still hurries him to daring rash attempts

    Xim Alphonso is impetuous but hes noble
    He will not take one atom from Navarre
    Of whats his right nor needs he

    Vera If he should

    Xim You take too bad impressions of your son

    Vera No more Ximena for I hear their trumpets
    Proclaim their entry and our own their welcome
                          Trumpets from each side of the Stage

     Enter ALPHONSO and GARCIA hand in hand After them the
     Prisoner King RAMIREZ alone then the two Colonels SANCHO
     and CARLOS after them other Officers of the Army VERAMOND
     advances to meet them the Queen and the two Princesses follow
     him ALPHONSO first kneels to his Father and Mother and
     immediately runs to salute his Sister VICTORIA tenderly then
     slightly salutes CELIDEA and returns to VICTORIA In the mean
     time VERAMOND embraces Don GARCIA who afterwards kisses the
     Queens hand

    Vera The triumphs of this day auspicious prince
    Proclaim themselves your gift to us and Arragon
    From you they are derived to you return
    For what we are you make us

    Gar May heaven and your brave son and above all
    Your own prevailing genius guard your age
    From such another day of doubtful fate
    But if it come then Garcia will be proud
    To be again the foil of great Alphonso

    Vera It might and well it had become my son
                                    Looking about for ALPHONSO
    To speak your words but you are still before him
    As in the fight you were

    Xim Turn to your father and present your duty
                              Pulling ALPHONSO by the sleeve
    He thinks himself neglected and observes ye

     Here GARCIA after bowing to the King and Queen goes to the
     two Princesses and salutes them After a little dumb courtship
     he leads out VICTORIA and CELIDEA the Ladies follow
     ALPHONSO observes it with discontent and then turns to his
     Father

    Alph I saw you sir engaged in ceremonies
    And therefore thought I might defer this office
    To give you time for decent thanks to Garcia

    Vera You rather went where more affection called you

    Alph I may have been too slack in outward shew
    But when your service and my honour called
    None was more forward in the fighting part

    Vera The rugged business of the war is over
    Softness and sweetness and a gentle air
    Would make a mixture that would temper well
    That inborn fierceness of your boiling mind

    Alph I stand corrected sir and let me tell you now
    That sweetness which so well you have advised
    Fortune has put in your own hand to practise
    Upon this royal soldier till we fought   Showing RAMIREZ
    Your equal now your prisoner of the war
    And once alas that still it is not so
    The partner of your thoughts and bosom friend

    Xim Aside Heaven that inspired thee with this pious thought
    Add virtue and persuasion to thy words
    And bend my stubborn lord

    Vera Say have you more to speak on his behalf

    Alph Much more his fair behaviour in the war
    Not plundering towns nor burning villages
    His bravery of mind his dauntless courage
    When hand to hand he made me stoop beneath
    His weighty blows and often forced to doubt
    The fortune of my youth against his age

    Vera Proceed proceed for this is but to say
    That thou wert almost worsted in the combat

    Alph I have already said much more than needs
    To move a noble mind
    Such as my fathers is or ought to be

    Vera Come let me hear my duty from my son

    Alph If more be wanting on so plain a theme
    Think on the slippery state of human things
    The strange vicissitudes and sudden turns
    Of war and fate recoiling on the proud
    To crush a merciless and cruel victor
    Think there are bounds of fortune set above
    Periods of time and progress of success
    Which none can stop before the appointed limits
    And none can push beyond

    Xim He reasons justly sir

    Alph Ramirez is an honourable foe
    Use him like what he is and make him yours

    Ver By heaven I think
    That when you coped with him in single fight
    You had so much ado to conquer then
    You fear to engage him in a second combat

    Alph The world knows how I fought
    But old men have prerogative of tongue
    And kings of power and parents that of nature
    Your pardon royal sir

    Vera I give it you
    Your battle now is paid at the full price
      XIMENA whispers ALPHONSO for a moment

    Alph Fear not I curb myself                 To XIMENA

    Ram To VERA Your son has mentioned honourable terms
    Propose them Veramond and for his sake
    So much his valour and rare courtesy
    Have wrought upon my soul I will accept them

    Vera Who gave you leave
    To speak of terms or even to speak at all

    Ram And who should give me liberty of speaking
    But heaven who gave me speech

    Vera How dares my captive
    Assume this boldness to his conqueror

    Ram You have not conquered me you could not Veramond
    Tis to Alphonsos arms that I am prisoner

    Vera Under my auspices Alphonso fought
    He led my forces

    Ram Yes and made them too
    By his example else they neer had conquered

    Vera A bargain a plain compact a confederacy
    Betwixt my son and thee to give me part
    Of what my better stars make all my own

    Alph Sir I must speak

    Vera Dare not I charge thee dare not

    Alph Not vindicate my honour
    By heaven I will to all the world to you
    My honour is my own and not derived
    From this frail body and this earth you gave me
    But that etherial spark which heaven inspired
    And kindled in my newcreated soul
    You tell me I have bargained with Ramirez
    To make his ransom cheap

    Vera To make it nothing
    To rob thy father of his victory
    And at my cost oblige my mortal foe
    Fool dost thou know the value of a kingdom

    Alph I think I do because I won a kingdom

    Vera And knowest not how to keep it

    Ram What claim have you What right to my Castile

    Vera The right of conquest for when kings make war
    No law betwixt two sovereigns can decide
    But that of arms where fortune is the judge
    Soldiers the lawyers and the bar the field

    Alph But with what conscience can you keep that crown
    To which you claim no title but the sword

    Vera Then ask that question of thyself when thou
    Thyself art king I will retain my conquest
    And if thou art so mean so poor of soul
    As to refuse thy sword in keeping it
    Then Garcias aid
    Whose share of honour in that glorious day
    Was more than thineduring my life shall guard it
    And at my death shall heir it

    Alph Don Garcia is indeed a valiant prince
    But this large courtesy this overpraise
    You give his worth in any other mouth
    Were villainy to me

    Xim That was too much Alphonso shew the reverence
    That sons should bear to fathers

    Alph To her Did I not say in any other mouth
    The king excepted still

    Ram Had I a son a son like your Alphonso
    The pride of war and darling of the field
    I should not thus receive him nor detract
    From such high actions Let me tell you sir
    For I who felt his arm can best report him
    There lives not one who breathes this vital air
    That eer could boast he made Ramirez bend
    Before Alphonso undertook the task

    Vera Confederacy again How they enhance
    Their mutual worth and bandy fame betwixt them
    Into each others hand
            Looks on RAMIREZ and starts back
    Whats this I see
    Nay now I wonder not the captive prates
    With so secure presumption to his king
    Well may he brave me while his murdering sword
    Sits as before insulting on his side
    Who gave thee back that weapon

    Alph I who took it

    Vera A careful son to trust a foe with arms
    So near his fatherHaste disarm the prisoner

    Alph Ere you dishonour me first hear me speak
    I took his royal word to be my prisoner
    And on his honour I restored his sword
    Because I thought that mark of sovereign justice
    And awful power should not for one short moment
    Be wanting to a monarch

    Vera Then when he lost the power he lost the claim
    And marks of sovereign right
    Nor without my consent couldst thou dispose
    Of him or of his sword or of his life
    Once more disarm himWhat am I betrayed
                              Guards look amazed but stir not
    Have I no subject left

    Xim Submit Alphonso
    I who am partial to you must condemn
    This carriage as unduteous to your father

    Ram To ALPH Brave prince too warmly you assert my cause
    Though tis indeed the common cause of kings
    But to prevent what ills on my account
    May hence ensue betwixt a son and parent
    Take here the sword you trusted in my hands
    Which you alone could takeNow Veramond
                                Presents his Sword to ALPHONSO
    Dispose of old Ramirez as thou pleasest

     He presents it sullenly to VERAMOND who puts it into the Hand
     of an Officer

    Secure thy hate ambition and thy fear
    And give Ramirez death who scorns a life
    Which he must owe to thee

    Vera To the Guards Go bear him to the castle at more leisure
    His doom shall be decreed

    Ram Wheneer it comes tis welcome only this
    If enemies be suffered to request
    Forgive the imprudent zeal thy son has shown
    On my behalf and take him to thy bosom
    A noble temper shines even through his faults
    And gilds them into virtues

    Vera Take him hence

     RAMIREZ is led off by SANCHO and CARLOS and followed by the
     Guards ALPHONSO looking frowningly The rest stay

    Alph Aside How I abhor this base inhuman act
    But patience hes my father

    Vera Thus all his praises are thy accusations
    And even that very sword
    Punish me heaven if I believe not so
    Is far less dangerous in his hand than thine

    Xim Forgive the hasty sallies of his youth

    Vera He never loved me

    Alph You never gave me cause

    Xim To ALPH Come you both loved
    But both were jealous of each others kindness
    His silence shows he longs to pardon you
    And did not you my lord observe Alphonso
                                              Turning to VERAM
    How though at first he could not rule his passion
    Not at the very first for thats impossible
    To hasty blood like his and yours my lord
    Yet in the second moment he repented
    As soon as thought had leisure to be born

    Vera For aught I see you do him better office
    Than he desires Ximena

    Alph Kneeling Sir your pardon
    And if you please your love

    Vera Receive the first
    The last as you deserve

     Reenter Don GARCIA with VICTORIA CELIDEA and the Ladies
     VERAMOND sees them at a distance

    Vera This had not been thus easily oerpast
    But that I see Don Garcia with your sisters
    A fair occasion offers you this hour
    To cancel your offences mark and take it

     The King Queen and ALPHONSO entertain GARCIA in dumb
     show while VICTORIA and CELIDEA speak at a distance

    Cel What think you sister of this youthful hero

    Vict Our dear Alphonso

    Cel No I mean Navarre

    Vict As of a valiant prince what would you more

    Cel Methinks you give him a short commendation
    Yet all his applications were to you

    Vict I minded not his words

    Cel He made a warm beginning of a love

    Vict It seems my thoughts were otherwise employed

    Cel Neither your thoughts nor eyes could be employed
    Upon a nobler object

    Vict Thats your judgment

    Cel His every action nay his every motion
    Were graceful and becoming his high birth

    Vict All of a piece and all like other men
    He seems to me a common kind of creature
    One that may pass among a crowd of courtiers
    And not be known for king

    Cel Sure you forget the troops he brought our father
    Besides his personal valour in the fight

    Vict You more forget Alphonsos greater actions
    When the young hero yet unfledged in arms
    Made the tough age of bold Ramirez bend
    He fought like Mars descending from the skies
    And looked like Venus rising from the waves

    Cel Navarre had done the same twas fortunes fault
    That showed him not Ramirez

    Vict You are too young to judge of men or merits
    You praise the vulgar flight a falcon makes
    When Joves imperial bird that bears the thunder
    Is towering far above him

Reenter CARLOS SANCHO and the rest of the Officers

    Vera Are my commands performed

    Carl With all exactness

    Vera Approach Victoria and you Celidea
    That in your presence I may pay some part
    Of what I owe your brave deliverer

    Cel We cannot show too much of gratitude

    Vera Victoria what say you

    Vict He did the duty of a brave ally
    I do not know the war nor dare I load
    His modesty with larger commendations

    Gar Even those are much too large when given by you
    To whom my soul with all my future service
    Are with devotion offered

    Vera I have indeed disclosed to her alone
    The important secret of the intended match
    And that perhaps has made her fear to praise
    A prince who shortly is to be her own

    Alph Aside Oh heavens what bode these words

     The Queen and CELIDEA shew amazement ALPHONSO and VICTORIA
     discontent

    Vera Now therefore I declare the wished alliance
    Ximena you may give your daughter joy
    And you your sister of the imperial crown         To CEL
    Which Garcia put on our Victorias head
    Your share Alphonso in this happy day            To ALPH
    Is not the least nor will you be the last
    To applaud my worthy choice of such a son

    Alph A sudden damp has seized my vital spirits
    I see but through a mist and hear far off
    Nay trouble not yourselves a little time
    Of needful rest and solitary thought
    Will mend my health till when excuse my presence
                             Exit ALPHONSO and looks back on
                               VICTORIA

    Xim Aside Hes much disturbeda sickness of the soul
    Or I mistake he does not like this marriage
    Assist us heaven if I divine aright
    And prosper thy own work

    Vera Aside I like not this
    But must dissemble till I clear my doubts
    Fortune brave prince has given us this allay     To GAR
    Our joys were else too full
    An hour of sleep will bring him back restored
    Mean time we may withdraw

    Gar To VICT Come my fair mistress by your fathers leave
    I seize this precious gage

    Vict Then thank my father
    He may dispose of all things but my heart
    And thats my ownAside Alas I wish it were

     Exeunt VER XIM CEL GAR VICT and all the Courtiers Men
     and Women The Guards follow SAN CARL remain

San Good news Carlos the old Jew is dead

Carl What Jew

San Why the rich Jew my father Hes gone to the bosom of Abraham
his father and I his Christian son am left sole heir Now do I
intend to be monstrously in love

Carl With whom colonel

San Thats not yet resolved colonel but with one of the court
ladies You may stand a mans friend Carlos in such a business

Carl You may depend on me Sancho because my dependance is on you
You got plunder in the battle while I was hacked and hewed and almost
laid asleep in the damned bed of honour

San Nay I confess I am a lucky rogue for I was born with a caul
upon my head

Carl Im sure I came bare enough into the world and live as barely
in it

San Make me but lustily in love and Ill adopt thee into my
fortune but thou standestshall I shall I till all the ladies are
out of sight Here take that billetdoux which I have pulled out
by chance from amongst twenty that I always wear about me for such
occasions

Carl But to which of them shall I deliver it

San Even to her thou canst first overtakeNay do not lose thy
time in looking ont theres no particular direction man Fortune
ever superscribes my letters to the fair sex I let her alone to
find me out a handsome mistress and let me alone to make her kind
afterwards

Carl But suppose I should happen to deliver it to my own mistress
for she was in the presence with her father

San Then I suppose thou wilt be the first that shall repent it for
she will certainly fall in love with me

LOPEZ and DALINDA reenter and walk softly over the Stage

Look theres one of them already my heart beats at the very sight of
her This must and shall be she by Cupid

Carl And by Venus the very she I love

San Prythee no more words then for fate will have it so

Carl Aside I know its impossible for her father to receive
him or her to love him and yet his good fortune and my rascally
threepenny planet make me suspicious without reason But hang
superstition Ill draw such a picture of him as shall do his business

San Now will I stand incognito like some mighty potentate and
see my own embassy delivered

    CARLOS overtakes LOPEZ and DALINDA
      just going off and salutes them

Lop Cousin Carlos you are welcome from the wars I
think I saw you in the show to day

Carl The ceremony hindered me from paying my respects but I made
haste you see

Lop I hope youll no more be a stranger to my house than you have
been formerly Your mistress here will be proud to entertain you
and then you shall tell me the whole expedition I love battles
wonderfully when a man may hear them without peril of his person

San Aside Nothing of my letter all this whilewhy when
Carlos Whispering aloud to him

Carl Aside Now I dare not but deliver it because he sees
meDon Lopez I have a foolish kind of petition to you To LOP

Lop Why do you call it a foolish petition

Carl Because I bring it from a fool Theres a friend of mine of a
plentiful fortune thats desperately in love with your fair daughter
Dalinda and has commanded me by your permission to deliver this
letter to her

    Lop A rich mans letter may be delivered
                                   CARLOS gives her the Letter

Dal Whats here A note without a superscription She seems to
read As I live a bill of exchange for two hundred pistoles charged
upon a banker and payable to the bearer An accomplished cavalier I
warrant him he writes finely and in the best manner

Carl Aside Theres the covetous sex at the first syllable
The fools good planet begins to work already but I shall stop its
influence

Lop Good cousin colonel what manner of man is my soninlaw that
may be

Carl Dye see that sneaking fellow yonder

Lop Who that gallant cavalier

Dal I wish it were no worse

Carl Plague ye make me mad betwixt ye His outsides tawdry and
his insides fool Hes an usurers son and his father was a Jew

Dal No matter for all that hes rich

Carl He was begot upon the wife of a desperate debtor out of pure
good husbandry to save something Hes covetous by the fathers side
a blockhead by the mothers and a knave by both

Lop I see nothing like your description of him at this distance
Call him hither I would fain speak with him

Carl Come hither Don Sancho and make good the character I have
given of you

    SANCHO comes up and salutes them awkwardly

Lop Cavalier I shall be glad to be better known to you

San To CARL You see I have luck in a bag Carlos

Carl Aside Ay in a bag of money I see it to my sorrowTry
his wit signior youll find it as heavy as lead Aside to LOPEZ

Lop To SANCHO So his money be silver I care notCome
cavalier what say you to my daughter

San Why I say I was resolved to love the first fair lady that I
met

Dal Oh lord sir

Carl To LOP Do but mark his breeding

Lop I like him never the worse for his plain dealing

Dal Bluntness methinks becomes a soldier

Carl Aside How naturally old men take to riches and women to
fools

Lop To SAN You have made a noble declaration of your love sir
with a handsome present of two hundred pistoles

San What I hope I have not mistaken papers and sent you my letter
of exchange for two hundred pistoles charged upon the banker Porto
Carrero Pray return that letter madam and Ill look out for another
that shall treat only of dry love without those terrible appendixes

Dal Why did not you intend this for me cavalier

San No you shall hear me rap out all the oaths in Christendom
that I am wholly innocent of this accusation

Dal Come you bely your noble nature Look upon me again cavalier
She makes the doux yeux to him and then examine your own heart if
you meant it not to me

San Nay I confess my heart beats a charge towards youand yet two
hundred pistoles is a swinging sum for one kind look Carlos

Carl A damnable hard pennyworth hold you there Don Sancho

    DALINDA looks upon him again more sweetly

San She has two devils in her eyes that last ogle was a
lickpennyWell madam I dedicate those fair two hundred pistoles to
your more fair hand and now you have received them I meant them for
you

Dal And in requital I receive you for my servant cavalier

Carl Aside Damn him for his awkward liberality hes always
covetous but when tis to do me a mischief

Lop To DAL Hes come on again my heart was almost at my
mouthNow Mrs Minion let me take you to task in private Draws
her aside a little What hope have you of the Conde Don Alonzo de
Cardona

Dal Little or none a bare possibility You know what has passed
betwixt us

Lop But suppose he should renew his love had you rather marry that
rich old Conde or this poor young rogue Don Carlos

Dal This poor young rogue if you please father

Lop I thought as much good madam But to come closer to the
present business betwixt Don Carlos and Don Sancho that is to say
a poor young wit and a rich young fool put the case gentlewoman
which of them would you chuse

Dal If it were not for mere necessity I have a kind of a loathing
to a fool

Lop The more fool you madam

Dal Would you have a race of booby grandsons

Lop Thats as your conscience serves you I say only that your
husband shall be a fool I say not your childrens father shall be one

San To CAR This is a plaguy long whisper I do not like it And
yet now I think ont my left eye itches some good luck is coming
towards me

Lop To them Ill be short and pithy with you Don SanchoI
think they call yeif out of my abundant love I should bestow my
dutiful daughter on you what kind of husband would you make

San Husband sennor Why none at all None of my predecessors were
ever married my father and my mother never were and I will not be
the first of my family that shall degenerate I thought my two hundred
pistoles would have done my business with Dalinda and a little winking
money with you

Lop What would you make me a pimp to my own daughter

Dal And imagine my chastity could be corrupted with a petty bribe

San Nay I am not so obstinate neither against marriage Carlos gave
me this wicked counsel on purpose to banish me and in revenge to
him I will marry

Lop I hope youll ask her leave first

San Pho I take that for granted no woman has the power to resist
my courtship

Lop Suppose then as before supposed what kind of husband would you
make

San Then to deal roundly with you I would run a rambling myself
and leave the drudgery of my house to her management all things should
go at sixes and sevens for Sancho In short sennor I will be as
absolute as the Great Turk and take as little care of my people as a
heathen god

Lop Now Don Carlos what say you

Carl Aside Ill fit them for a husbandTo LOP Why
sennor I would be the most careful creature of her business I would
inspect every thing would manage the whole estate to save her the
trouble I would be careful of her health by keeping her within doors
she should neither give nor receive visits nor kneel at church among
the fops that look one way and pray another

Dal Oh abominable

Lop Why thou ungrateful fellow wouldst thou make a slave of my
daughter And leave her no business that is to say no authority in
her own house

Dal Ay and to call fine young gentlemen fops too To lock me
up from visitants which are the only comfort of a disconsolate
miserable married woman

Lop An twere not for fear thou shouldst beat me I could find in
my heart to beat theeDon Sancho I have an olla at home and you
shall be welcome to itFarewell kinsman To CARL

    Exeunt LOP and SAN leading out DAL

Carl Now if I had another head I could find in my heart to run
this head against that wall Nature has given me my portion in sense
with a pox to her and turned me out into the wide world to starve upon
it She has given Sancho an empty noddle but fortune in revenge
has filled his pockets just a lords estate in land and wit Well
I have lost Dalinda and something must be done to undermine Sancho
in her good opinion Some pernicious counsel must be given him He
is my prince and I am his statesman and when our two interests come
to clash I hope to make a mere monarch of him and my hunger is
somewhat in my way to quicken my invention

    Wants whets the wit tis true but wit not blest
    With fortunes aid makes beggars at the best
    Wit is not fed but sharpened with applause
    For wealth is solid food and wit but hungry sauce   Exit




ACT II


     SCENE IA BedChamber a Couch prepared and set so near the
     Pit that the Audience may hear

     ALPHONSO enters with a Book in his Hand and sits reads to
     himself a little while Enter VICTORIA and sits by him then
     speaks

    Vict If on your private business I intrude
    Forgive the excess of love that makes me rude
    I hope your sickness has not reached your heart
    But come to bear a suffering sisters part
    Yet lest I should offend you by my stay
    Command me to depart and I obey

    Alph The patient who has passed a sleepless night
    Is far less pleased with his physicians sight
    Welcome thou pleasing but thou short reprieve
    To ease my death but not to make me live
    Welcome but welcome as a winters sun
    That rises late and is too quickly gone

    Vict You are the star of day the public light      
    And I am but your sister of the night                  
    Eclipsed when you are absent from my sight            

    Alph Death will for ever take me from your eyes
    But grieve not you for when I set you rise
    Don Garcia has deserved to be your choice                    
    And tis a brothers duty to rejoice                         
                                                                  
    Vict And yet methought you gave him not your voice      

    Alph You saw a sudden sickness left me weak
    I had no joy to give nor tongue to speak
    And therefore I withdrew to seek relief
    In books the fruitless remedies of grief

    Vict But tell me what philosopher you found
    To cure your pain

    Alph The fittest for my wound
    Who best the gentle passions knows to move
    Ovid the soft philosopher of love
    His Love Epistles for my friends I chose
    For there I found the kindred of my woes

    Vict His nymphs the vows of perjured men deplore
    One in the woods and one upon the shore
    All are at length forsaken or betrayed
    And the false hero leaves the faithful maid

    Alph Not all for Linus kept his constancy
    And one perhaps who more resembled me

    Vict That letter would I view in hope to find
    Some features of the fair that rules your mind

    Alph Read for the guilty page is doubled down
    The love too soon will make the lover known
                                           Giving her the Book
    Read if you dare and when the crime you see
    Accuse my cruel fate but pity me

    Vict Aside Tis what I feared the unhappy Canace
    Read you for to a brother twas designed         To him
    And sent him by a sister much too kind
                         ALPHONSO takes the Book and reads

    Why did thy flames beyond a brothers move
    Why loved I thee with more than sisters love
      He looks upon her and she holds down her head He reads again

    My cheeks no longer did their colour boast
    My food grew loathsome and my strength I lost
    Still ere I spoke a sigh would stop my tongue
    Short were my slumbers and my nights were long
    I knew not from my love those griefs did grow
    Yet was alas the thing I did not know
                    She looks on him and he holds down his Head
    Forced at the last my shameful pain I tell

    Vict No more we know our mutual love too well
                      Both look up and meet each others Eyes

    Alph Two lines in reading had escaped my sight
    Shall I go back and do the poet right

    Vict Already we have read too far I fear
    But read no more than modesty may bear

ALPHONSO READING

    For I loved too and knowing not my wound
    A secret pleasure in thy kisses found
              He offers to kiss her and she turns her head away
               May we not represent the kiss we read

    Vict Alphonso nobrother I should have said

ALPHONSO READING AGAIN

    When half denying more than half content
    Embraces warmed me to a full consent
    Then with tumultuous joys my heart did beat
    And guilt that made them anxious made them great

     She snatches the Book and throws it down then rises and walks
     he rises also

    Vict Incendiary book polluted flame
    Dare not to tempt the chaste Victorias fame
    I love perhaps more than a sister should
    And nature prompts but heaven restrains my blood
    Heaven was unkind to set so strict a bound
    And love would struggle to forbidden ground
    Oh let us gain a Parthian victory
    Our only way to conquer is to fly

    Alph No more Victoria though my love aspires
    More high than yours and fiercer are my fires
    I cannot bear your looks new flames arise
    From every glance and kindle from your eyes
    Pure are the beams which from those suns you dart
    But gather blackness from my sooty heart
    Then let us each with hasty steps remove
    Nor spread contagion where we meant but love

    Vict Hear heaven and earth and witness to my vows
    And Love thou greatest power that nature knows
    This heart Alphonso shall be firmly thine
    This hand shall never with another join
    Or if by force my father makes me wed
    Then Death shall be the bridegroom of my bed
    Now let us both our shares of sorrow take
    And both be wretched for each others sake

    Alph By those relentless powers that rule the skies
    And by a greater power Victorias eyes
    No love but yours shall touch Alphonsos heart
    Nor time nor death my vowed affections part
    Nor shall my hated rival live to see
    That hour which envious fate denies to me
    Now seal we both our vows with one dear kiss

    Vict No tis a hot and an incestuous bliss
    Let both be satisfied with what we swore
    I dare not give it lest I give you more
                                                 Exit VICTORIA
                      looking back on him and he gazing on her

    Alph Oh raging impious and yet hopeless fire
    Not daring to possess what I desire
    Condemned to suffer what I cannot bear
    Tortured with love and furious with despair
    Of all the pains which wretched mortals prove
    The fewest remedies belong to love
    But ours has none for if we should enjoy
    Our fatal cure must both of us destroy
    Oh dear Victoria cause of all my pain
    Oh dear Victoria whom I would not gain
    Victoria for whose sake I would survive
    Victoria for whose sake I dare not live

Enter GARCIA with Attendants The two Princes salute but ALPHONSO
very coldly

    Gar I come to show my grief for your distemper
    For if my noble brother saw my heart
    There should you find a plain a holy friendship
    Unmixt with interest equally partaking
    Of what affects you both of good and ill

    Alph I thank you but my malady increases
    At your approach I have no more to say
    But wish you better health than I can boast
    And to myself a lonely privacy

    Gar I find I am not welcome to your sight
    But know not from what cause

    Alph Angrily My surest remedy is in your absence
    Tis hard my lodgings cannot be my own
    But importuned with visits undesired
    And therefore I must tell you troublesome

    Gar Tis an odd way of entertaining friends
    But since I find you discomposed with sickness
    That shall excuse your humours where I go
    I hope for better welcome

    Alph Sir I must ask whom you pretend to visit

    Gar My mistress prince

    Alph Your mistress whos that mistress

    Gar What need I name Victoria

    Alph Who my sister

    Gar Whom else could you imagine

    Alph Any other

    Gar And why not her

    Alph Because I know not if she will admit you

    Gar Her father has allowed it

    Alph But not she
    Or if both have yet my consent is wanting
    You take upon you in a foreign kingdom
    As if you were at home in your Navarre

    Gar And you methinks
    As if you had no father or no king
    Farewell I will not stay

    Alph You shall not go
    Thus as I am thus single thus unarmed
    And you with guards attended

    Gar You teach me to forget the rule of manners

    Alph I mean to teach you better

     As GARCIA is going to pass by him ALPHONSO runs to one of
     his Attendants and snatches his Sword away then steps between
     GARCIA and the Door

Enter VERAMOND and XIMENA attended

    Vera What means this rude behaviour in my court
    As if our Arragon were turned to Thrace
    Unhospitable to her guests and thou
    Alphonso a Lycurgus

    Alph He would pass
    Without my sisters leave into her lodgings
    By heaven if this be suffered to proceed
    The next will be to treat the royal maid
    As coarsely as she were some suburb girl

    Gar To Vera Had I not your permission sir

    Vera You had
    But these Alphonso are thy ruffian manners
    How darst thou boy to break my orders
    And then asperse thy sister with thy crime

    Alph She said his presence was unpleasing to her

    Vera Come thou beliest her innocence and duty
    She did not durst not say it

    Alph If she did not
    I dare and will maintain to all the world
    That Garcia is not worthy of my sister

    Vera Not worthy

    Alph No I say once more not worthy

    Gar Not in myself for who deserves Victoria
    But since her royal father bids me hope
    Not less unworthy than another prince
    And none with your permission sir shall dare     To VER
    To interpose betwixt my love and me

    Alph Sure a less price than our infantas bed
    Might pay thee for thy mercenary troops

    Vera Peace insolent too long I have endured
    Thy haughty soul untamed and turbulent
    But if I live this shall not pass unpunished
    Darkness and chains are medicines for a madman

    Xim My lord I humbly beg you spare your son
    And add not fury to a raging fire
    He soon will recollect his scattered reason
    Which heat of youth and sickness and fatigues
    Have dissipated in his boiling blood
    Give him but time and then his temperate humour
    Will soon return into the native channel
    And unopposed be calm

    Vera No never more
    The moon has rolled above his head and turned it
    As peals of thunder sour the generous wine
    Hence from my presence thou no more my son       To ALPH

    Xim If he be mad be madness his excuse
    And pardon natures error not his own

    Vera Ximena you have fondled him to this
    I prophesied and now tis come to pass

    Gar Perhaps I interrupted him too rudely
    And since I caused myself that ill reception
    Forgive our mutual faults

    Vera You shall prevail
    Though he deserves not such an intercessor
    To ALPH Retire Alphonso to your inmost lodgings
    And there inclose yourself and mourn your crimes
    Be this your last relapse the next is fatal

    Alph I will retire
    But if I am a madman as you say
    And as I half believe expect no cure
    But in Alphonsos death                  ALPHONSO goes in

    Xim Aside It works apace
    But whither it will tend heaven only knows
                            VERA sees the Book upon the Ground
                                    and takes it up

    Vera This book he left go bear it after him
    Yet stay I know not why but somewhat prompts me
    To read this folded page
    To GARCIA Go royal youth
    I would myself conduct you to Victoria
    But lovers need no guide to their desires
    And love no witness but himself requires

     Exeunt the King and Queen one Way with their Attendants and
     DON GARCIA with his another


SCENE IIA Street

Enter CARLOS before DON LOPEZS Door

Carl That is the door of Lopez and Sancho must come out this way
Now fool sit fast for thou shalt not want for pestilent advice but
first I must know how far thou hast proceeded with the father and the
daughter that I may know what drugs I must prepare for the present
condition of my patientOh the door opens already and he bolts out
single as I wished

Enter SANCHO picking his Teeth

San What Carlos you have dined before me but it may be you have
not fared so well

Carl The best part of your entertainment I suppose was the desert
of the fair Dalinda after dinner and how and how go matters

San Better than thou wouldst have them thou wouldst have put a
spoke in my wheel I know it

Carl No fortune always sets those of your admirable understanding
uppermost But remember Dalinda was once mine however

San Thou wouldst not have me give the box away when I have thrown
seven Come set upon it what thou darest and Ill give thee leave to
do thy worst

Carl You are very confident of your good luck

San Thou knowest I have a perpetual ascendant over thee

Carl And you are sure to carry her

San She is fond of my person she ogled me all dinnertime she put
her foot under the table and trod upon mine and if these are not
certain symptoms of passion the devils in womankind

Carl And her father

San The goodest old man he drank my health to his daughter and I
to comply with my obligation answered the challenge There I think I
was with her again

Carl You have no more to do but to take out a licence

San Indeed I have her licence for it

Carl What quibbling too in your prosperity If you let another
I shall be enraged But you have not told me that her father is
consenting

San In a manner but

Carl But what is he not absolutely yours

San There is a small demur upon the matter in short he hit me
in the teeth with a damnable rich old Conde who I find has been
dabbling with this covetous old hunks but bating him Don Lopez tells
me I shall be the welcomest man alive

Carl Do you know that Condes name

San Don something de Cardona whom the devil confound

Carl My old acquaintance he charged with me in the battle but what
became of him I know not If he be the man despair betimes Sancho
hell revenge my quarrel and carry her in spite of you

San I am cunning you know and I believe he named that cursed
Conde only to draw me on the faster

Carl And do you think a gentleman can succeed against a Conde with a
woman

San Why not

Carl No more than a Conde against a duke and so upwardsabandon
her I say

San No I am resolute

Carl To be the shoeinghorn for the Conde

San I confess I would not be the shoeinghorn to draw him on

Carl No for thats to be a pimp for him

San Right therefore I will leave her

Carl Then go back and quarrel with her and her father go I say
immediately before your virtue cools

    San Ill give them their own Ill warrant them
    What make a shoeinghorn of a man of honour  Exit SANCHO

Carl alone If the Conde be in love then why should Lopez admit
of Sancho for a suitor if not the fool is in the right that it was
only feigned to draw him on However my advice will strike on both
sides for if Sancho quarrels hes discarded and for the Condestay
a littlewhat if I should play this Conde I know him and can mimic
him exactly tis but a jest if I am discovered and if the Conde loves
her and she him then I marry her in his shapeOh they are coming
out to quarrel in the open air for the house is grown too hot for
them but I dare not stay to see the battle for fear of getting blows
on both sides Exit CARLOS

Enter LOPEZ DALINDA and SANCHO

Lop Ill wait upon you out of my house however

San Fatherinlaw that might have been no more ceremonies Ill be
no shoeinghorn for any man

Lop You would not be my daughters hindrance

San Theres no more to be said ont but either a bargain or no
bargain

Lop A bargain if the Conde comes not on

San Then as he comes on I must go off with a pox to you and to
your daughter

Dal At least it shall not be a pox of your giving

San The Condes pox take you then thats an honourable pox
descended in a right line from Don Roderic the Goth Ill warrant you

Lop Indeed if your estate were as great as his

San Nay for that matter I can drop gold with him as little as I
care for her

Dal But then his title

San I have more gold yet to weigh down his parchment and then my
wit against a Condes wit thats for overplus for though I say it

Lop Who should not say it

San Yet I do say it and will say it especially as lords go now
Come theres no more to be said Lopez but take back your trumpery I
mean your daughter or Ill send for the scavenger with a dungcart

Lop This is insufferable and by this honourable
beard

San Which Ill pull off by handfuls if you swagger

Lop Aside to DAL What shall we do with this madman daughter

Dal You should send for an alguazil to order him if I were sure
that the Conde would come on again but since thats uncertain go
in father and let me alone with him if I make him your soninlaw
thats punishment sufficient for him

Lop Well cavalier you may chance to hear of me Exit LOPEZ

San Yes and of your daughter too in the next lampoon I doubt
notTo DALINDA Why dont you follow him What do you and I
together madam countess

Dal Nay I know not

San Nor I neither

Dal I hope you will not beat me

    She looks languishingly upon him

San I cant tell that thou hast a damnable kind of leer that would
provoke me to somewhatI say not what

Dal Beat me with my own hand if I deserve it there tis for you

    Gives him her hand and squeezes his

San If I should beat thee now as thou hast deserved richly I could
make thee satisfaction

Dal Indeed they say an old man should never beat a young woman
because he cannot make her satisfaction

San Abominable chuck if I did not hate thee mortally I could be
content to love thee for a quarter of an hour or soWhy whats here
to do you are at your old tricks again Prythee sweet devil do not
ogle me nor squeeze my palm so feelingly thou dear infernal do not

Dal Why do I hurt you

San No but thou ticklest me to the very heartstrings most
wickedly

Dal You command me then to leave you

    Seems to be going

San Not command you neither not absolutely

Dal I go then

San Then I do command thee I mean to stay a little longer Thou
hast fired my blood most horribly with that squeezing hast not thou
the itch speak damnation I think I have got the infection of thee

   He shakes his hands

Dal Ill go and comfort my old father for the affronts you gave him

San No perverseness Ill make thee stay in very spite of thy
proud sex Ill humble thee

Dal But was not you a grievous man to use him so you shall tell me
or I break your fingers

San Not a word to save thee from perdition I am as dumb as a
heathen oracle

Dal Then I must squeeze it out of you

    Pressing his hand again

San Ah ha it runs through me like wildfire

    Panting

Dal Did not Carlos give you this naughty counsel

San I should not answer thee I know it Hartlykins this is just
cramping a man when hes asleep to make him tell his dream Let go my
hand and Carlos did not advise me but hold it and he didnow will
you be at quiet with me

Dal Not till you promise me to be friends with my father

San Well confound thee I am friends with him

Dal And to banish Carlos for an evil counsellor

San Upon condition youll discharge the count from seeing you

Dal No conditions either surrender upon discretion or Ill put you
to the sword

San Pox on thee for being so tyrannical but I cant help myself
and therefore I totally submit

Dal Now then you shall perceive how gracious a princess I intend
to be My father doats upon this count but I despise him

San Thats a good girl for love of me Ill warrant you

Dal You think I coax you now

San No I know my own merit too well for that

Dal Then do what I advise you My father has not often seen this
count what if you should pass for him

San Hum I do not apprehend thee

Dal A man of your wit and be so stupid you shall counterfeit the
count

San Counterfeit the count thats a pure quibble but I can make no
more ont

Dal Hes an old fellow and a fool now you shall take upon you to
be this count to deceive my father and Ill keep your counsel and
teach you how to represent him

San Oh now I understand you but tis impossible for me to
counterfeit a fool

Dal Ill warrant you trust nature

San A man of my sense can never hide his parts

Dal No but you may shew them Go back to your lodgings Ill
provide you clothes and send you directions in writing how to behave
yourself before my fatherOne word more be sure you manage this in
private and shut out Carlos lest he should discover our intrigue

San Well I will strive for once to get the better of my wit
and play the natural as naturally as I can but you had better come
yourself and teach me for you have put me in a pure way of taking your
instructions Exit SANCHO

Dal Alone When I consider what has passed between the count and
me theres little reason to believe a man should put on a foul shirt
again when he has put it off already and has change of linen by him
However my father shall know nothing of this disguise for he that
sold my first maidenhead to the lord may sell my second to the fool
and that would be too much in conscience that a woman once in twice
should not have the letting her own freehold And therefore I will have
the selling of myself and Sancho shall have the refusal of the bargain

    Wise heaven in pity to the sex designed
    Fools for the last relief of womankind
    Two married wits no quiet can enjoy
    Two fools together would the house destroy
    But providence to level human life
    Made the fool husband for the witty wife     Exit DALINDA




ACT III


SCENE IVICTORIAs Chamber

Enter ALPHONSO with Music

A Song is sung when it is beginning VICTORIA
enters


SONG OF JEALOUSY

    What state of life can be so blest
    As love that warms a lovers breast
    Two souls in one the same desire
    To grant the bliss and to require
    But if in heaven a hell we find
    Tis all from thee
    O Jealousy
    Tis all from thee
    O Jealousy
    Thou tyrant tyrant Jealousy
    Thou tyrant of the mind

    All other ills though sharp they prove
    Serve to refine and perfect love
    In absence or unkind disdain
    Sweet hope relieves the lovers pain
    But ah no cure but death we find
    To set us free
    From Jealousy
    O Jealousy
    Thou tyrant tyrant Jealousy
    Thou tyrant of the mind

    False in thy glass all objects are
    Some set too near and some too far
    Thou art the fire of endless night
    The fire that burns and gives no light
    All torments of the damned we find
    In only thee
    O Jealousy
    Thou tyrant tyrant Jealousy
    Thou tyrant of the mind                 Exeunt Musicians

    Alph Tis true my tyrant father has confined me
    But love who traverses the world at will
    Who knows not awe nor law nor parentage
    Has broke my tedder and enlarged my bounds

    Vict Retire betimes the court is full of eyes
    As eagles sharp fatal as basilisks
    Who live on looking and who see no death

    Alph I come but to depart and go for ever
    Because denied the common rights of nature
    Which the first brother and first sister had
    Why were not you and I that happy pair
    But nature doats with age

    Vict Whateer it be tis past redress Alphonso

    Alph But then shall Garcia take thee in his arms
    Glutted with joys which I would die to taste
    No let me stab the wretch in every vein
    And leave him dry of pleasure ere we part

    Vict Alphonso no you cannot kill Don Garcia
    But you declare the cause and own your love

    Alph And what care I what after ages say
    Alphonso did to make Alphonso happy
    But oh you love and would preserve his life
    To be for ever his

    Vict My dearest brother
    I hate your rival and I die for you
    All but my spotless honour shall be yours

    Alph By heavenbut that word heaven comes
    cross my thoughts

    Vict Beware for by my own I guess your passion
    You would I fear

    Alph Enjoy my heaven one moment

    Vict And part with it for ever Think on that

    Alph That moment were eternity in little
    A mighty sum but taken on content
    To save the tedious telling oer and oer

    Vict Oh we are too long together

    Alph Fear you that

    Vict I ought to fear it but I trust my virtue
    Depart my soulI will not ask you whither
    For fear I should repent of my repentance
    And follow you to death

    Alph I go Victoria
    For loves cold fit of jealousy returns
    You must not be Don Garcias swear you will not

    Vict I swear I will not by my own consent

    Alph You may be forcedoh cursed jealousy
    Thou bastard son of Love unlike thy father
    Why dost thou still torment me

    Vict Trust my honour

    Alph That may be chafed into a warmth Victoria
    Talk seeing touching are incendiaries
    And these may mount your young desires like straw
    To meet the jett that draws you

    Vict Trust my love

    Alph I swear I trust it but I fear your beauty
    Tis a fair fruit that hangs upon the bough
    Tempts and is tempted

    Vict Tis indeed a fruit
    Seen and desired by all while yet unpulled
    But can be gathered by one only hand

    Alph That one is Garciastill the fit returns
    I wish my jealousy could quench my love

    Vict It cannot if I measure yours by mine
    Or if extinguished like a trail of smoke
    From a wax taper soon would light again

    Alph Tis so for when I say I will not love
    Then I love most Farewell my only joy
    I go to hide me from the world and you

    Vict As when the sun is down
    His light is clipt into a thousand stars
    So your sweet image though you shine not on me
    Will gild the horror of the night and make
    A pleasing scene of solitary grief

Enter VERAMOND and XIMENA he with an Ovid in his hand

    Vera How darest thou rebel thus provoke my patience
    Beyond all sufferance and transgress thy bounds

    Alph When kings and fathers on their sons and subjects
    Exact intolerable things to bear
    Nature and selfdefence dispense with duty

    Vera Oh heaven what horrid sin have I committed
    That I was punished to beget this son

    Alph I could ask heaven another question too
    But that tis not so decent In few words
    Hither I came to take my latest leave
    Of dear Victoria then depart for ever
    And buried in some solitary cave
    Forgetting and forgotten end my days

    Vera Tis what thou hast deserved perform thy
    penance

    Xim So hard a sentence for so small a fault
    Are you a father sir

    Vera Is he a son
    Thou knowest not his offence
    But mark the glowing blood the guilty flush
    Upon Victorias face and read it there

    Xim I know not what you mean

    Vera Victoria speak
    And clear yourselfshe answers not a word
    Nay then my fears are true on both sides guilty

    Vict Tis found and we are lost                 Aside

    Vera But what needs more conviction know you this
                                      Shewing the Ovid to ALPH
    This book the tutor of incestuous love
    The page is doubled down and points thee to thy crime
    I feared before from every rolling glance
    How quick they shot upon thy sisters face
    And she received them all like smoking flax
    Confessed the fire and answered to the flame

    Vict I love my brother and avow that fire
    His love to me has raised his noble thoughts
    To brave achievements for your crown and you
    For loves the steel that strikes upon the flint
    Gives coldness heat exerts the hidden flame
    And spreads the sparkles round to warm the world

    Vera Oh heavens she makes a merit of her crime
    Victoria I would yet think better of thee
    And therefore dare I not enquire too far
    Willing to doubt the guilt I fear to find
    Depart and answer not                        Exit VICT
    For thee whom I abhor to call my son             To ALPH
    And wish thou wert a stranger to my blood

    Xim That was a happy hint I must improve it     Aside

    Vera One way and only one remains to clear thee
    If with a holy fire thou lovst thy sister
    Aspiring but to fame not sinking down
    Into the abyss of lust unnatural
    Consent that she may be Don Garcias wife
    Else give the lie to all thy fair pretences
    And stand exposed a monster of mankind
    Foul as the fiends which fell from heavens high towers
    Fall thou from empire so and from my sight
    Depart accursed for ever

    Alph Gladly I leave you but shall go more lightly
    If eased of this your dreadful imprecation
    O let me go unloaded with your curse
    And I will bless you for my banishment

    Vera So may that blessing or that curse oertake thee
    As thou obeyest or disobeyest my will

    Alph Guiltless of sin with conscience to my friend
    I go to shun that fatal hour that shews me
    Victoria married and Alphonso lost           He is going

    Xim Stay yet Alphonso for one moment stay
    For somewhat if I durst I have to speak
    Which would at least take half thy load away
    And free thy shoulders from the weight of sin

    Vera Ximena darest thou hope to palliate incest
    And gild so black a crime

    Xim I gild it not but if I prove it none
    You may be kind Alphonso may be happy
    And these domestic jars for ever cease

    Vera Explain yourself

    Xim Afford me then your patience
    A mighty secret labours in my soul
    And like a rushing stream breaks down the dam
    This day must give it vent It rests in you
    To make it end in a tempestuous night
    Or in a glorious evening

    Vera No more preface

    Xim You wonder at Alphonsos haughty carriage
    His fiery temper and his awless mind

    Vera Too true Ximena

    Xim And he wonders more
    At your harsh nature and your rugged usage
    On each side unbecoming son and father
    And yet the cause of both is to be found
    But ere I farther shall proceed to speak
    Command your royal prisoner to be brought
    For I must be confronted with Ramirez
    And in his presence tell you wonderous things
    Which if he vouch not let Ximena die

    Vera I sent for him to hear his final doom
    And think he waits without
    Admit the prisoner        He goes to the door and speaks

Enter RAMIREZ guarded

    Now sir is yet your haughty soul resolved
    To quit your empty title for your freedom

    Xim Ramirez answer not to raise his passion
    For now the important secret of our lives
    Must come to public view and on that hinge
    Depends thy crown thy liberty and life
    My honour and thy sons

    Alph What means my mother                        Aside

    Vera A son Ramirez

    Ram Yes a son I had

    Vera He died an infant here in Saragossa

    Ram A living son I have and since the queen
    Is pleased to expose my life
    Before a judge so prejudiced as you
    Undaunted in the face of death I speak
    And claim Alphonso mine

    Vera There needs no more I spare thee all the rest
    My wifes adultery thy foul interloping
    My own dishonour and that bastards birth

    Xim Injurious words unfitting you to speak
    And me my lord and those concerned to hear

    Alph To VER Though I would give whateer the sun beholds
    Not to be yours yet when my mothers fame
    Is questioned none shall wrong her innocence
    Nor shall Ramirez go
    Unpunished for that infamous aspersion

    Ram Alphonso peace your father bids you peace

    Vera Then what am I

    Ram His fosterfather

    Vera Impudently said
    And yet I hope tis true So much I hate him
    That I could buy the public scorn to be
    An alien to his blood

    Xim Have patience sir
    And you shall have your wish on cheaper terms
    But hear me speak

    Vera Good heaven then give me patience

    Xim When you and brave Ramirez then your friend
    Me and my sister married four full years
    We passed in barren wedlock childless both
    Ramirez you remember brought his queen
    To Saragossa on a friendly visit
    Then as we both were married on one day
    We both conceived together

    Vera I observe it
    That when Ramirez came you both conceived
    Mark that and if thou hast the face proceed

    Xim My lord I dare
    You took me once aside and as your rage
    Inspired your soul spoke thus Ximena know
    That if the fruit thou bearst be not a son
    Henceforth no more my queen we part for ever
    The word was hard I bore it as I could
    I prayed and heaven in pity heard my vows
    Two boys in one fair morning were disclosed
    By me and by my sister
    And both the fathers equally were blest

    Vera Say one was blest with two and speak more truly

    Xim Forbear this language sir or I am dumb
    It seems that you deserved not him you had
    For in seven days heaven ravished your Alphonso
    My sisters little Veramond survived
    And shes a living witness of this truth
    Great was my grief but greater was my fear
    From your alas too much experienced anger
    Thus low reduced and urged by anxious thoughts
    Of what I might expect from your unkindness
    Now speak Ramirez and relate the rest
    For my tongue faulters and denies its office
    So much I fear my lord should take offence

    Ram Then like or disapprove it thus it was
    She told my wife and me this mournful story
    Her fears for thy resentment of thy loss
    If by misfortune it should reach thy ears
    Begged secrecy and then implored our aid
    To substitute the living for the dead
    And make our Veramond pass for thy Alphonso
    A hard request but with compassion moved
    At length twas granted

    Vera Is this true Ximena

    Xim So heaven and you forgive my pious fraud
    As what he says is certain

    Alph O joyful news Oh happy day too good
    To end in nightMy father and my king
                                               Runs to RAMIREZ
                             kneels to him and kisses his hand
    My soul foreknew you with a sure presage
    Of native duty and instinctive love

    Ram Arise my son

    Vera You own him then

    Ram I do

    Vera A welcome riddance
    Meantime in prospect of a double crown
    You gave the sparrow leave to brood upon
    The cuckoos egg

    Ram The advantage was to you
    He proved his blood upon me when we fought
    Fierce eagles never procreate fearful doves
    I sent him word he was my son before
    The battle but the hand of fate was in it
    The note miscarried and we blindly met

    Xim Past accidents embitter both your minds
    Think forward on your mutual interest
    Alphonso loves Victoria
    I saw it in the seeds before disclosed
    To other eyes connived at it approved it

    Vera A most commodious mother

    Xim Blame me not
    Guilt there was none but in their apprehension
    And both their virtues barred ill consequences
    Now take the blest occasion by the foretop
    And on their marriage found a lasting peace

    Ram A trivial accident begot this war
    Some paltry bounds of ill distinguished earth
    A clod that lay betwixt us unascertained
    And royal pride on both sides drew our swords
    Thus monarchs quarrel and their subjects bleed
    Remove your landmarks set them where you please
    Stretch out your Arragon on my Castile
    And be once more my brother

    Alph I implore it
    And prostrate beg your pardon and your grace
    I have offended in my proud behaviour
    But make Victoria mine and what your son
    In duty wanted by your soninlaw
    Shall doubly be supplied

    Xim What would you more

    Vera To her Are you the mediatrix of this peace

    Xim It well becomes the softness of my sex
    To mediate for sweet peace the best of blessings
    And like a Sabine wife to run betwixt
    Relations lifted swords

    Ver A rare chaste Sabine you
    To save the adulterer of thy husbands bed
    See there Alphonsos father that old goat
    Who on two sisters propagated lust
    And got two children for himself and me
    Suppose thee chastea favourable guess
    To any of thy sexthese are my foes
    To RAMIREZ Thou first the former sharer of my sheets
    A king without a kingdom Thine is conquered
    And Garcia with Victoria shall enjoy it

    Ram So monstrously you wrong your wife and me

    Vera No more my will is law

    Ram So tyrants say

    Vera I will not hear thee speakConduct him hence
    And stow him in the dungeons depth with toads
                                  The Guards carry off RAMIREZ

    To ALPH For thee the worthy son of such a father
                                              Walks by himself

    Xim To ALPH Tis desperate now and I with illtimed zeal
    Have hastened your destruction

    Alph To her You have saved me

    Vera Aside Say I should put the ungrateful wretch to death
    Hes thought my son and whilst so thought tis dangerous
    To imprison him the people might rebel
    Hes popular and I am ill beloved
    Then banish himthats best but yet unsafe
    He may with foreign aid reconquer all
    Ill venture that with Garcia to my friend
    He shall recall his troops mine are at hand
    And ready prest for service    He comes to ALPH and XIMENA

    Xim Now the storm

    Vera To ALPH Thy dooms resolved too gentle for thy crimes
    I spare thy life depart to banishment
    Tomorrow leave the realm this day the town
    And like the scapegoat driven into the desart
    Bear all ill omens with thee

    Alph Proud of my exile with erected face
    I leave your court your town and your dominions
    Pleased that I love at least without a crime
    Lighter by what I lost I tread in air
    Unhappy but triumphant in despair          Exit ALPHONSO

    Vera Behold how haughtily he strides away
    Lofty and bold as if not banished hence
    But seeking for some other place to reign
    I think he cannot hope but lest he should
    Victoria soon shall be Don Garcias bride
    To XIMENA Go madam for I know you are in haste
    To greet your daughter with this goodly news
    Tell her Alphonso is no more my son
    But tell her too he shall not be her husband
    Bid her prepare herself to wed Navarre
    Whether by force or by consent I care not
    Tomorrow shall determine that affair
    Nor shall my will be frustrate or delayed
    Kings are not kings unless they be obeyed         Exeunt


SCENE IIThe Street before LOPEZS House

Enter SANCHO habited like DON ALONZO DE CARDONA with a
hunchback DALINDA meeting him

Dal I watched your coming at the window and told my father Hes
coming out to welcome you

San But if I chance to break out into a little wit sometimes youll
excuse my frailty

Dal Pugh you are so suspicious of yourself and have so little
reason for it Be as witty as you can I fear you not

Enter DON LOPEZ and salutes him

Lop Noble Conde you are welcome from the wars And who did best in
the battle I beseech your honour

San Why next my honour one colonel Sancho did best

Lop Who Sancho hes little better than a coxcomb

San Nay he has too much wit if he had as much grace twould be
better for him

Lop But hes your lordships rival in my daughter

San Is he so then make much of him old gentleman

Lop You would not have me prefer him to your excellency

San Faith you can hardly chuse amiss betwixt us two hes my other
self man

Lop I make a vast difference betwixt you

San That shall be a very good jest between you and me another time

Dal Aside The fools too much a fool hes going to discover
himself if I prevent it not To LOPEZ Make haste father and
put him upon the point or hell give me up to Sancho

Lop Let Sancho be no fool since your lordship pleases for he is
not bound to make my daughter any satisfaction as you are

San And satisfaction she shall have What I hope you dont think I
am a eunuch

Dal Aside Oh heaven I shall be ruined between them I forgot
to instruct my father not to meddle with that pointTo LOPEZ Say
no more of it I beseech you sir

Lop To her Tis for thy good let me alone You know you have
injured the poor girl my lord

San Not to my remembrance sennor You and I may have quarrelled I
confess and I think I may have given you some hard words today

Dal Aside Now has he forgotten hes my lord and is harping
upon the quarrel he had with him as Sancho This must end in my
destruction

Lop Your lordship and I can have had no quarrel today for I have
not seen you this twelvemonth

San Thats true now I remember myself you have not

Lop But that you have wronged my daughter is manifest

Dal To SANCHO Sir I must needs speak a word with you in
private If you love me confess you have enjoyed me for I told my
father so on purpose to make him the more condescending to the match

San To her A word to the wise I understand you Now you shall
see me top upon the old fellow To LOPEZ Well sennor I wont
stand with you for a nights lodging with your daughter I acknowledge
I have been a little familiar with her or so but to make her amends
I will marry her and consummate with her most abundantly

Lop Then all shall be set right and the man shall have his mare
again

Enter CARLOS habited like SANCHO

Lop What another Don Alonzo this is prodigious

Carl Aside seeing SANCHO Bless me the post is taken up
already and the true count is here before me

Dal Aside This is not my Conde but some other counterfeit
To SANCHO You are as true a count as he stand to your likeness

San Would I were out of my likeness Sneaking back

Dal Put forward man Ill second you

San But what a devilish high back he has gotten too hell carry me
away a pickapack thats certain

Carl Aside I find him now by their whispering and by his
aukwardness this must be Sancho and Ill outface him To LOPEZ
Sennor Don Lopez I am come by your permission to renew my addresses
to your fair daughter

Lop Your lordship is most welcome

San Whose lordship

Lop Why one of your lordships I know not which for by your backs
you are both my lords Thats as you two can agree the matter

San To CARLOS Sirrah where did you steal that back of mine

Carl Sirrah I was born with it but what hecamel has your mother
been dealing withal that you are begotten in my resemblance

San What I hope you wont pretend to pass for the true Conde

Carl I am Don Alonzo de Cardona

San And so am I

Carl If you stay a little longer Ill stretch your bones till you
are as strait as an arrow

San Do not provoke me I am mischievously bent

Carl Nay you are bent enough in conscience but I have a bent fist
for boxing

San And I have a strait foot for kicking

They come up to each other

Lop Here will be bloodshed immediatelyHold noblemen both will
ye be content that I should examine ye and then stand to my award
which is the true Conde

San Well to save Christian blood I will

Carl And to save Jewish bloodthat is your blood sirrahI am
contented too

Lop To CARLOS What command had you my lord in the last battle

Carl I had none I was a volunteer and charged with honourable
Colonel Carlos in the fight

Lop To SANCHO And what command had your lordship there

San I had none neither and I charged with that rogue Carlos

Lop Aside So far they are both right as I have heard To
SANCHO And what became of you afterwards

San Now I am posed for Carlos told me he knew nothing of the count
afterwardSennor I do not well remember what became of me for
I was in a very great passion but I did prodigious things that is
certain

Carl To LOP Sennor you may see he is a counterfeit because he
knows nothing of himself but I the true Conde was trodden under the
horses feet and lay for dead above half an hour

San Well and now I remember myself I was laid for dead too for
just about half a year

Lop To DAL This is the wrong lord he can say nothing but what
the other lord has said before him

Dal Then hes the likelier to be the true Conde for hes a fool
father

Carl You see sennor he does not remember what became of him as I
said before

San How would you have a man remember when he was laid for dead

Carl But I recovered rogue and pursued the enemy

San And I recovered and pursued them too for above an hundred
miles together at full speed

Lop Thats farther than you needed by threescore miles for tis
but forty from the place of battle to the city

Carl Yes at full speed upon the same horse and never drew bit
neither

San To DAL Help me dear Dalinda I am bogged you see

Dal To him Thats with pursuing your enemies too far but Ill
help you out againTo LOPEZPray sir let me examine them a
little

Lop Youll make nothing of that first Conde

Dal Yes a soninlaw I warrant youTo them Which of you two
promised me marriage

Both I did

Dal To CARL And did you enjoy me

Carl Heaven forbid madam What before marriage

Dal To SAN And what did you

San I did enjoy her so I did and there I was before you for a
false Conde as you are

Carl Speak for yourself madam and clear your reputation from that
scandalous companion

Dal With her Fan before her Face I must confess the true Conde
has enjoyed me the more my frailty

Lop The matter mends on that side

San Now goodman Goosecap whos the most a man of honour he who
has enjoyed a fair lady or he who has only licked his lips and gone
without her

Carl Aside I see she takes his part this is all a lie
contrived betwixt them

Enter a Messenger

Mess To DAL Madam I am sent to you on a sad errand from the
late Conde Don Alonzo who was killed in the last battle

Lop You are mistaken friend for here he stands alive and well
Pointing to SANCHO And for fear of failing heres a counterpart
of him Pointing to CARLOS

Mess Do not abuse yourself sennor neither of these is the true
Conde I took him from under the horses feet and he had only life
enough to say remember me to my fair Dalinda

Lop To SAN What does your lordship say to this

San He was fairly killed I must confess but I can give you a
better account of his lordship afterwards

Lop You why who are you

San Nay I am he too

Mess You see hes a counterfeit and so is the other

Lop Tis too true

Dal Did the Conde leave me nothing in his will

Mess Not a cross madam

Dal Theres the same payment for your news be gone poor fellow
Exit Messenger

Carl At least I have the satisfaction that hes discovered as well
as I am Throwing off some part of his disguise Now Sancho you
are welcome to the discovery of your fine intrigue

Lop Then Sancho I make good my word to you since the Conde is
dead you stand fairest for my daughterand you cousin Carlos with
your wit and your poverty are in statu quoCome away soninlaw
and leave the forsaken lover to make himself a willow garland

    Exeunt SANCHO LOPEZ and DALINDA

Carl Yet if I could hinder Sancho from marrying her I should make
myself some satisfaction Ill think ont farther and something comes
into my head already Stands musing

Enter ALPHONSO

Alph Now Carlos what make you here in this disguise I have been
looking for you at least half an hour

Carl Only a masquerade sir an innocent diversion in times of peace

    Alph No Carlos these are times of war not peace
    I must abruptly tell you what is past
    I am Ramirezs son not Veramonds
    I love Victoria and for her am banished

Carl Just my own condition I have had a revolution in my small
affairs too I am banished and going to look for the next commodious
tree to make a wry face upon it

    Alph I know you brave and if you love me still
    Follow my fortune yours shall be my care
    Our army lies encamped without the walls
    Your regiment is quartered in the town
    I think I can with ease revolt the troops
    Because they love me and with their assistance
    Release my father and redeem my mistress
    While you and yours at an appointed signal
    Procure me entrance

    Carl Right and force the gate

    Alph Thats all I ask I think myself as worthy
    To wed Victoria as this foreign prince
    But if you find reluctance to this action
    Now speak that I may seek some other friend

Carl No sir I shall never break with you for so small a matter as
a rebellion I warrant you for my soldiers theyll never flinch when
theres a town to plunder

    Alph The signal and the time shall be concerted
    Victoria be the word
      That happy name our bold attempt shall bless
      And give an omen of assured success    Exeunt severally




ACT IV SCENE I


SCENE IA Street with a Temple at a distance

Enter GARCIA with a Letter in his hand XIMENA and CELIDEA

    Gar May I believe you tis Victorias hand
    For tis a strange request

    Xim So may it move your noble mind to pity
    As what the paper tells you is most true
    She gave it me and with a thousand sighs
    Begged me to recommend her life her love
    And all her hopes of happiness to you

    Gar To break my marriage off renounce her bed
    To stand excluded from my promised bliss
    And as my proper act to do all this
    Disdainful faithless and ungrateful maid

    Cel Disdainful and ungrateful but not faithless
    Because she never vowed nor promised love
    But only to Alphonso

    Xim They loved not as a brother and a sister
    But as the fair and brave each other love
    For sympathy of souls inspired their passion

    Gar That sympathy which made him love Victoria
    Has caused the same effect of love in me

    Cel But not in her She loved him first my lord
    And you besieged a town already his
    As you for her others may die for you
    And plead that argument to hope your love
    If the same reason hold

    Gar No doubt it would
    Were not my soul already prepossessed

    Cel So is Victorias soul for her Alphonso
    And thats her plea for constancy to him

    Gar My reason is convinced but not my passion
    For I must love and loving must enjoy

    Cel Others must not enjoy and yet must love

    Xim You cannot wed Victoria but by force
    And force can only make her person yours
    Think what a fatal doom you pass on her
    To make yourself half happy

    Gar When shes mine
    I will pursue her with so dear a passion
    So chafe her coldness with my warm embraces
    That she shall melt at length hard as she is
    And run like stubborn metal

    Cel No my lord
    Victoria is not formed of steel but marble
    Which is not made to melt but flies the fire
    And neither yields nor softens to the flames
    Gain her esteem at least her love is hopeless

    Gar Esteem a scanty mean reward of passion
    That pays not half the value of the loss

    Cel Pay scorn with scorn and make revenge a pleasure
    So generous minds should do and so should I
    What needs there more
    You see who loves you not and

    Xim And she would say you may behold who loves you
    But maiden bashfulness has tied her tongue
    Look on her eyes they speak

    Cel Softly A language that they never spoke before

    Xim Mark how she whispers like a western wind
    Which trembles through the forest she whose eyes
    Meet ready victory whereer they glance
    Whom gazing crowds admire whom nations court
    And did her praise become a mothers mouth
    One who could change the worship of all climates
    And make a new religion where she comes
    Unite the differing faith of all the world
    To idolize her face

    Gar And well she may
    Her eyes her lips her cheeks her shape her features
    Seem to be drawn by Loves own hand by Love
    Himself in love but oh tis now too late
    My eyes have drank a poison in before
    A former basilisk has seen me first
    Yet know fair princess if there were a part
    In all my breast that could receive a wound
    Your eyes could only give it

    Cel So helpless friends when safe themselves ashore
    Behold a vessel driven against a rock
    They sigh they weep they counsel and they pray
    They stretch their unassisting hands in vain
    But none will plunge into the raging main
    To save the sinking passenger from death

    Xim Already see the joyless bride appears
    Grief rage disdain distraction and despair
    Are equal in my daughters different fates
    In one to be constrained to be your wife
    In one to be refused

Enter VERAMOND and VICTORIA led as to Marriage A Train follows
and after it a Guard

    Cel Great nature break thy chain that links together
    The fabric of this globe and make a chaos
    Like that within my soul O heaven unkind
    That gives us passions strong and unconfined
    And leaves us reason for a vain defence
    Too powerful rebels and too weak a prince

     GARCIA XIMENA CELIDEA mix with the Train which walk as in
     procession towards the Temple

     Enter on the sudden ALPHONSO and CARLOS at the Head of
     their Party the Soldiers attack the Guards and King and drive
     them off the Stage ALPHONSO fights with GARCIA grapples with
     him and gets him under in the mean time XIMENA VICTORIA
     and CELIDEA retire to a corner of the Stage When GARCIA is
     fallen CELIDEA runs and kneels to ALPHONSO

    Cel Oh spare him spare the noble Garcias life
    Or take the forfeit in the loss of mine
    How happy should I be to die for him
    Who will not live for me

    Alph To GARCIA Rise and be safe
    If you have any thanks to pay reserve them
    To give this royal maid

    Gar Rising Youd been more kind
    To take my life for I would throw it off
    Dishonoured as I am tis worn to rags
    Nor worth a princes wearing
                            Exit GARCIA followed by CELIDEA

Reenter VERAMOND disarmed and led by CARLOS

    Vera Ungrateful traitor

    Alph Hold thy peace old man
    I do not love to insult on thy misfortunes
    Though thou hast brought this ruin on thyself

    Vera Avenging heaven

    Alph I prythee curse me not
    Because I held thee for my father once

    Vera Then would I were thy father that my curse
    Might take the surer place and

    Alph Guard him hence
    But use no violence to his royal person
    Call back the soldiers Carlos from the spoil
    I have my wish in having my Victoria
    And would no more of him nor what is his

     CARLOS restores VERAMOND his Sword with respect and conducts
     him off XIMENA follows him ALPHONSO waits on them to the
     Door and returns

    Vict What have you done Alphonso

    Alph What I ought
    Obtained the glorious prize for which I fought
    Redeemed you from a fathers tyranny
    And from a hated rival set you free
    Remove my fair from this unhappy place
    The scene of sorrows sufferings and disgrace
    To my victorious camp with me remove
    The scene of triumph and rewarded love

    Vict Mars has been present with your arms today
    But Love and Hymen have been far away
    You forced me from a rivals power I know
    But then you forced me from a fathers too

    Alph What words are these I feel my vital heat
    Forsake my limbs my curdled blood retreat
    Too much amazed to speak in this surprise
    With silent grief on yours I fix my eyes
    To learn the reasons of your change from thence
    To read your cruel doom and my offence

    Vict Your arms and glorious action I approve
    Esteem your honour and embrace your love

    Alph My soul recovers as a gentle shower
    Refreshes and revives a drooping flower
    Im yours so much so little am my own
    Your smiles are life and death is in your frown

    Vict But oh a hard request is yet behind
    Which for my sake endure with equal mind
    Your debt of honour you have cleared this day
    But mine of duty still remains to pay
    Restore my liberty and let me go
    To make a full discharge of all I owe

    Alph What debts but those of love have you to clear
    Are you not free are you not sovereign here
    And were you not a slave before I broke
    Your fatal chains and loosed you from the yoke

    Vict Tis true I was but that captivity
    Though hard to bear was more becoming me
    A slave I am but nature made me so
    Slave to my father not my fathers foe
    Since then you have declared me free this hour
    I put myself within a parents power

    Alph Cruel Victoria would you go from hence
    And leave a desolate despairing prince
    Is this the freedom you demand from me
    Are these the vows and this the constancy
    Put off the mask for I too well perceive
    Whom you resolve to love and whom to leave
    Go teach me at my own expence to find
    What change a day can make in womankind

    Vict Think not a day nor all my life can make
    Victorias heart her steadfast love forsake
    I plighted you my faith and I renew
    My vows once more to love but only you

    Alph You vowed no time our fortune should divide
    And well twas kept like all your vows beside
    When een this hour you went to be a bride

    Vict I went but was securely first prepared
    For this was my redemption or my guard
                                            Pulls out a Dagger
    Let this your causeless jealousy remove
    And learn no more to doubt Victorias love

    Alph That fatal proof I never did desire

    Vict And yet a proof more fatal you require
    Which would with infamy my name pursue
    To fly my father and to follow you

    Alph Your love you forfeit if you go away

    Vict I forfeit my obedience if I stay

    Alph You may transfer your duty and be mine

    Vict Yes when my father shall his claim resign
    For when the nuptial knot our love assures
    All that was his before is after yours

    Alph Then when you vowed your love you falsely swore

    Vict I love you much but love my honour more

    Alph You hate my rival yet you take the way
    To make you his inevitable prey

    Vict Beasts fear not more to be the hunters spoil

    Alph Then sure you would not run into the toil
    How ill your actions with your words agree

    Vict This friend is still at hand to set me free
                                         Holding up the Dagger

    Alph Let me not live to see that fatal hour
    Rather return into your fathers power
    Rather return into his arms again
    For whom your lost Alphonso you disdain
    If one must die to set your honour free
    You have already cast the lot on me
    Death is the only way to clear my fame
    Which must be branded with a cowards name
    If basely I resign Victorias charms
    And tamely give you to my rivals arms

    Vict To give me to my father is no crime

    Alph Tis still the same your father gives you him
    Ungrateful woman

    Vict More ungrateful man
    More than I ought I give and all I can
    But if my duty I prefer to you
    Be satisfied with all that love can do

    Alph Not satisfied but yet your will shall be
    Like fates inviolable law to me
    Since my unhappy stars will have it so
    Depart from hence and leave your fathers foe
    Go then but quickly go for while you stay
    As on a rack I find myself decay
    And every moment looks a part of me away

    Vict I wish I with my duty could dispense
    Heaven knows how loth I am to part from hence
    So from the seal is softened wax disjoined
    So from the mother plant the tender rind
    But take the latest pledge that love can give
    Have courage and for your Victoria live

     She offers him her hand he kisses it Exit VICTORIA he
     looking after her

Enter RAMIREZ attended by CARLOS RAMIREZ embraces ALPHONSO

    Ram Prop of my age and pattern of my youth
    But such as far excels the original
    Ten thousand blessings on thee for this deed

    Alph Heaven and my fate speak other language to me
    No blessings none but millions of their curses
    Like burning glasses with contracted beams
    Are pointed on my head

    Ram What words are these on this auspicious day

    Alph Oh fly me fly me sir
    Lest the contagion of my woes
    Pollute my fathers joys Victorias gone
    And with her went Alphonsos life and soul

    Ram You had her in your power and were too easy

    Alph Or rather she too cruel
    Her duty forced her hence in scorn of love

    Ram You must resume your arms
    And force her fathers will to make her yours
    Why like a woman stand you thus complaining
    Born to the strength and courage of a man
    Rouse up your spirits to a just revenge
    Like lightning wasteful and like thunder loud
    Rivers of blood shall run about the town
    For which you were so lavish of your own
    Garcia shall die and by his death remove
    The cause of jealousy and injured love
    The king himself the ungrateful king shall fall
    Of all our ills the curst original

    Alph Beseech you sir no more

    Ram Your reason son

    Alph For you have given my soul so large a swing
    That it bounds back again with double force
    Only because you carried it too far
    Youve set an image of so vast destruction
    Before my sight that reason shuns the approach
    And dares not view the fearful precipice

    Ram Is vengeance which is said so sweet a morsel
    That heaven reserves it for its proper taste
    Is it so soon disrelished

    Alph What have the people done the sheep of princes
    That they should perish for the shepherds fault
    They bring their yearly wool to clothe their owners
    And yet when bare themselves are culled for slaughter
    Should I do this what could the wolf do more
    Than what the master did

    Ram Then Garcia must he scape

    Alph Tis true I had him at my mercy once
    I should have killed him then or once forgiven
    Should spare him now

    Ram Aside His noble soul relents

    Alph But then I give Victoria to his arms
    And make my own destruction my own act
    That fires my blood againyet if she loves him
    Is killing him she loves the way to gain her
    No let him livebut Veramond shall die
    Who when he was my father as he thought
    When I deserved his love then hated me

    Ram Oh now the tempest drives another way       Aside

    Alph No more deliberationthere it goes
    Ill kill him first to satisfy my vengeance
    And then to atone her anger kill myself
                                           Seems going hastily

    Ram Hold hold Alphonso heaven and earth and I
    Who have a fathers title to your life
    Forbid that parricide

    Alph Would you refuse a madman leave to sleep
    Tis sleep must cure me and that sleep is death

    Ram A madman must be cooled to make him sleep
    I have prepared a gentle opiate for you
    One moments patience and I will infuse it
    You see me dispossessed of all my state

    Alph Yes to my grief and to enhance that grief
    Tis to my sword my father owes his ruin

    Ram And tis that only sword that can restore me
    It must and ought you owe it to your duty

    Alph Duty was what Victoria urged to me
    I hate that fatal word because she used it
    And for a cruel father left her love

    Ram Could she do that for Veramond a tyrant
    Which you refuse to me
    The conquering troops of Arragon are yours
    You are their life their idol and their soul
    Conduct me home and with their aid restore me
    And that once done we shall not need to treat
    For Veramond himself will send and sue
    For that alliance which his pride now scorns

    Alph Long ere that time Victoria will be Garcias
    Her father will not lose one moments space
    To gratify his vengeance with my ruin
    If I would force him this must be the time
    Which since I now refuse tis lost forever
    Hear then and take it as my last resolve
    Lead you the troops you need not fear their faith
    The guilt of their rebellion makes them yours
    With them and with your own restore yourself

    Ram Then what becomes of you

    Alph No matter what
    Provide yourself of some more worthy heir
    For I am lost beyond redemption lost
    Farewell the joys of empire from this moment
    Farewell the honours of the dusty field
    Here I lay down this instrument of death
                           Ungirds his Sword and lays it down
    And may it gird some happier soldiers side
    For nothing it could gain can countervail
    To me the loss of my Victorias love
    Your blessing and farewell                        Kneels

    Ram Alas I fear some fatal resolution
    Is harboured in your soul If thus you leave me
    My mind forebodes we never more shall meet

    Alph Give not so black an omen to this parting
    For we may meet again if heaven thinks fit
    A beam of comfort like the moon through clouds
    Gilds the brown horror and directs my way
    Blast not my purpose by refusing leave
    Nor ask the means but know I will not die
    Till I have proved the extremest remedy
    And if unarmed I go to tempt my fate
    Think my despair is from Victorias hate    Exit ALPHONSO

    Ram I might have used the power heaven gives to parents
    And hindered his departure
    But somewhat of divine controuled my tongue
    For heroes souls irregular to us
    Yet move like planets in their proper sphere
    Performing even course
    In paths uneven to beholders eyes      Pauses a little
    To CARLOS His words mysterious as they were imported
    Some desperate design which I must watch
    And therefore dare not lead the forces far
    But camped without the town at some small distance
    To expect the issue and prevent his death

    Carl Sir what orders give you for you are now our general

    Ram Follow and you shall know            Exit RAMIREZ

Carl Follow whither No plunder when the town was fairly taken
theres a hopeful general to follow The son and father are both gone
away without providing for me who betrayed the city to them a fine
encouragement for virtue Well these monarchs make no more of us
soldiers when their turn is served than we make of our old battered
horses To put us off for stallions is the best that can become of us
and those indeed are my present circumstances Dalinda will none and
Sancho is just mounting if I get not between and thrust him off for
which purpose I have insinuated to him that I have left Dalinda for his
sake and am upon another scentYonder he comes this and another
lie which I have ready coined will go near to spoil his market

Enter SANCHO

San Well Carlos the hurly burlys quite over I met Ramirez
marching off the army and just afterwards appeared a fellow in a
fools coat on horseback with three trumpets Herod I think they
called him some such Jewish name

Carl A herald at arms you mean

San It may be so but I should have taken him for some pardonner
for he scattered indulgences by handfuls to the people but only they
paid nothing for them

Carl But did he proclaim nothing

San Oh yes and now I remember he began his speech with O yes
too he proclaimed a general pardon to all rebels of which number you
know you and I Carlos were two ringleaders

Carl Then farewell Ramirez even trudge on by yourself for there
is an end of my expedition I will lay down my arms like a dutiful
subject and submit to his majesty when I can rebel no longer

San Very good and try the other touch for Dalinda will you

Carl You know I have quitted her for your sake and now am
altogether forlet me see what lady am I for

San Pump pump Carlos for thats to be invented yet

Carl Only out of my head a littletis the dead Counts sister
a great fortune since her brother died but somewhat homely she has
already made some advances to me or else I lie

San And will you say To have and to hold with an ugly woman

Carl Yes and For better for worsethat is for virgin or
for whore as you will Sancho who are listing yourself into the
honourable company of cuckolds

San What a hero as I am to be a cuckold

Carl Do not disdain your calling Julius Csar was one before you
The Count has had her by her own confession so shes a noblemans
dowager for your comfort

San Pugh she denied it afterwards that was but a copy of her
countenance

Carl What if it prove a copy of the Condes countenance do you
think she had not a bastard by him

San That was only a plot betwixt us to cheat her father

Carl Did her father know nothing of it

San Not a syllable

Carl Then when he believed you to be the Count how came he to
charge you with enjoying her

San That is something to the purposebut now I think ont tis
nothing neither tis but asking her the question and I know shell
satisfy me

Carl And you are resolved to take her word

San Rather than yours for you may have a mind to have a lick at the
honeypot yourself

Carl Farewell you know I have other business upon the stocks
Seems going out

San Stay Carlos I am afraid you know something more of this bawdy
business than you confess

Carl Fecks not I

San Fecks what a sneaking oath is that for a man of honour swear
me bloodily like a soldier if you would be believed

Carl Without swearing I believe her honest therefore make sure of
her immediately

San That is take a rivals counsel and make sure of being an
antedated cuckold

Carl If you wont believe me I cannot help it But marry Dalinda
and be happy for I may prevent you if you make not haste

San Thou hast cheated me so often that I cannot credit one syllable
thou sayest

Carl Going out Then take your fortune

     CARLOS pulls out his handkerchief to wipe his face and drops a
     letter

Yonder comes Dalinda I know her by her trip Ill
watch their greeting Exit

San The rogues malicious and would have me marry her in spite
besides he is off and on at so devilish a rate a man knows not where
to have him Well I am resolved in the first place not to follow
the rogues counsel I will not marry her because he advised me to
itand yet I will marry her because he counselled me not to marry
herHeyday I will marry her and I will not marry her whats the
meaning of this friend Sancho Thats taking the rogues advice one
way or tother Sees the letter and takes it up What has he dropt
a letter To whom is it directed to Don Carlos DYbarrathat is

Dalindas fair and a fortune but marry her not for to my knowledge
pox confound him for his knowledge she has had aWhat aMr
Friend why a bastard by the late Conde Ay I thought as much
But his sister Leonora is in love with you

Damn it I will read no more it agrees with what he first told me and
therefore it must be all orthodox Here she comes too just in the
nick of my revenge but I shall be very laconic with her

Enter DALINDA

Dal Now servant

San Now cockatrice

Dal Youre pretty familiar

San So have you been

Dal With your mistress

San With the Conde of whoring memory

Dal A fine salutation

San A final parting

Dal Whats the meaning of this will you come in

San Will you go in

Dal Come look upon me She makes the doux yeux to him

San I have no eyes

Dal Then I must take you by the hand She offers and he pulls
back

San I have no hands neither

Dal Hows this I have been but too kind

San Yes to the Conde

Dal Pugh that was a jest you know

San Tis turned to earnest

Dal You know twas of my conception

San And of your bringing forth too

Dal What did I bring forth

San A bastard

Dal O impudent

San Woman

Dal What proof have you of that scandal

San This with a pox tye Throws her the letter

Patience oh ye gods Exit

     She takes up the note and as she is reading it reenter
     CARLOS

Carl Much good may do you with your note madam now I think I am
revenged at full your cully has forsaken you

Dal Well I did not expect this from you cousin Carlos

Carl What did you take me for King Log in sops Fables for you to
insult me and play at leapfrog over me Did not you forsake me for a
fool

Dal But was not this a terrible revenge of yours must you needs
shew him the letter which has ruined my reputation and lost my
fortune Am I the first frail creature that had the misfortune of two
great bellies and yet afterwards was decently married and passed for
a virgin

Carl Nay do not aggravate the matter consult your note and you
will find but one bastard charged upon you you see I was not for
laying loaders

Dal A great courtesy to bate me one as if that was not enough to
do my business

Carl Well suppose I should discover this contrivance of mine and
set all right again

Dal Aside Contrivance oh heaven I have undone myself by
confessing all too soon

Carl If I should prove you innocent you would prove ungrateful

Dal No you know I always loved you

Carl You have shown it most abundantly in choosing Sancho

Dal You speak more truly than you think I have shewn it for since
I must confess the truth to you I am no fortune my father though
he bears it high to put me off has mortgaged his estate we keep
servants for shew and when we should pay their wages pick a quarrel
with their service and turn them off pennyless There is neither
sheet nor shirt in the whole family the lodgingrooms are furnished
with loam and bare mattresses are the beds The diningroom plays
the hypocrite for all the house for all the furniture is there When
strangers dine with us we eat before the servants and then they
fast but when we dine alone tis all a muss they scramble for
victuals before tis served up and then we fast

Carl The spirit of famine comes upon me at the very description of
it

Dal Now since neither you nor I have fortunes what should we do
together unless we should turn canibals and eat up one another But
if you would make up this foul business and help me to that rich fool
Sancho I say no more but

Carl But thou wouldst be kind to me speak out for I dare not trust
thee thou art such a woman

Dal You should

Carl What should I

Dal Why you should

Carl Well well I will believe thee though my heart misgives me
plaguily And therefore in the first place I beg your pardon for the
scandal I have laid upon you In the next I restore your virginity and
take away your bastard

Dal And youll tell Sancho twas a forged letter

Carl No doubt ont for I wrote it to myself and out of revenge
invented the whole story

Dal But suppose dear cousin that Sancho should not believe all
this to be your invention and should still suspect the letter to be
true

Carl I can easily convince him by writing the same hand again in
which that letter was indited

Dal Thats an excellent expedient but do it now for a woman can
never be cleared too soon

Carl But when you are cleared you will forget your promise to me

Dal But if I am not cleared I cannot marry him nor be put in a way
to keep my promise Come Ill hold my hand write upon it I always
carry pen and ink about me

Carl Let me seal my affection first Kisses her hand Now what
should I write

Dal Only these words at the bottom of the note in the same
characterThis letter was wholly forged by me Carlos He kneels
and writes

Carl There tis

Gives it her she puts it in her pocket

But now tell me truly what made you confess a couple of bastards have
you indeed been dabbling

Dal Who I confess it Oh thou impudent fellow I only soothed thee
up in thy villainy to make thee betray thy own plot I confessed
seemingly to make thee confess really Heaven and thy own conscience
know I did Seems to weep

Carl But when youre married youll remember your promise

Dal What promise

Carl That I should

Dal Should what

Carl Must I tell you

Dal No Ill tell you I said you shouldand so you shallbe
cozened in your expectation

Carl I foreboded this and yet was fool enough to trust thee Give
me back my letter

Dal What deliver up my evidence thats the testimony of my virtue
and thy wickedness

Carl Ill search your petticoat

Dal Dare but touch my petticoat and Ill cry out a rape against
thee

Carl Oh thou Eve of Genesis thou wouldst have tempted the serpent
if thou hadst been there

Dal The next news you hear is of my wedding be patient and you
shall be invited to the dinner

Carl I say no more but Ill go home and indite iambics thou shalt
not want for an epithalamium Ill do thy business in verse

                                                          Exit

Dal My comfort is I have done your business in prose already

    The wittiest men are all but womens tools
    Tis our prerogative to make them fools
    For one sweet look the rich the beaux the braves
    And all mankind run headlong to be slaves
    Ours is the harvest which those Indians mow
    They plough the deep but we reap what they sow      Exit

San And thou art welcome as a witness of my triumph

Carl I could tell tales that would spoil your appetite both to your
dinner and your brideYou think you are married to a vast fortune

Dal A better perhaps than you imagine

Lop For if Sancho looks into his writings hell find that my
estate was mortgaged to his father

San Then would I had looked into my writings before I had looked so
far into your daughter

Dal My fathers fortune will be yours at last and I have but
redeemed it for you

San Im sure Im married without redemption

Carl You must take the good and the bad together he that keeps a
tame cat must be content to be scratched a little

Dal The counts sister I hope has claws for you too

Carl That was invented only in hopes of you Dalinda though now I
thank my stars that I have missed you for two wits without fortunes
would be like two millstones without corn betwixt them they would only
grind upon one another and make a terrible noise but no meal would
follow

Enter a Nurse leading a Boy and Girl

Nurse Madam here are two poor orphans that hearing you are
married come to dine with you

Dal Aside My two bastards I am undone what shall I do with

Carl By your favour I shall make bold to call them back again

    Exit CARLOS

Dal To LOP Oh barbarous villain hell discover all

duty to your mother

Children Kneeling Mamma your blessing

San Hey day whats here to do Are these the issue of your body
Madam Bride

Carl Yes and they are now your children by the mothers side The
late Conde presents his service to you with these two pledges of his
affection to your wife

San Is it even thus Dalinda

Lop Christian patience soninlaw

San Christian patience I say pagan fury This is enough to make me
turn Jew again like my father of Hebrew memory

Carl You may make your assault colonel without danger the breach
is already made to your hands

San Ay the devil take him that stormed it first

Carl Speak well of the dead

Dal Kneeling And forgive the living

San Oh Dalinda no more Dalinda but Dalilah the Philistine Could
you find none but me to practise on

Carl Sooner upon you than upon any man for nature has put a
superscription upon a fools face and all cheats are directed thither

Lop Theres no recalling whats past and done

San You never said a truer word fatherinlaw tis done indeed
to my sorrow

Carl If you could undo it Sancho it were something but since you
cannot your only remedy is to do it again

San Thats true but the memory of that damned Conde is enough to
turn ones stomach to her Do you remember what a devilish hunch back
he had when you and I played him

Carl For that reason you may be sure shell loath the thought of him

San Do you think so Carlos

Dal How can I do otherwise when I have in my arms so handsome so
sweet and so charming a cavalier as you

San Well I amI know not howish she has a delicious tongue of her
own and I begin to mollify

Carl Do Sancho Faith youve held it out too long in conscience
for so slight a quarrel this is nothing among great ladies man How
many fathers have I known that have given their blessings to other
mens children Come bless them bless them honest daddyKneel down
children

Children Kneeling Your blessing papa

    Children cry

San It goes against the grain to give it them

Carl For shame Sancho take them up youll break their pretty
hearts else twould grieve a mans soul to see them weep thus

San Ay they learnt that trick of their mother but I cannot be
obdurate the fault was none of theirs Im sure Crying Heaven
een bless you and Ill provide for you nay and it shall go hard but
Ill get you some more playfellows if your mother be as fruitful as
she used to be

Lop Why this is as it should be

Dal Heaven reward you and Ill study obedience to you

San They say children are great blessings if they are I have two
great blessings ready gotten to my hands

Carl For your comfort marriage they say is holy

San Ay and so is martyrdom as they say but both of them are good
for just nothing but to make an end of a mans life

Lop Cheer up soninlaw your children are very towardly you see
they can ask blessing already

Dal If he does not like them he may get the next himself

Carl I will not trouble the company with reading my letter from the
dead counts sister tis enough to tell you that I loved her once
and forsook her because she was then no fortune But she has been
kinder to me than I deserve and has offered me her brothers estate in
dowry with her

Dal Which I hope you will accept

Carl Yes and release you of a certain promise to me without
explainingShe only recommended to me her brothers children by
Dalinda and I think I have taken a decent care in providing them a
rich father

San I always loved a harlot and now I have one of my own Ill
een take up with her for my youth is going and my days of whoring
I mean emphatical whoring are almost over But for once well have a
frolick come offspring can either of you two dance

 Child Yes forsooth father and my sister can sing too like an
angel

San Then foot it featly that you may say hereafter you remember
when your mother was first married and danced at her wedding

Carl Hold a littleyou may remember too Madam Bride that I
promised you an epithalamium Twas meant a satire but fortune has
turned it to a jest I have given it to the musicians and brought them
along with me strike up gentlemen

     The Dance is first then the Song the last Words of which are
     sung while the Company is going out and the Musick plays before
     them


SONG

BY MR CONGREVE

I

    How happys the husband whose wife has been tried
    Not damned to the bed of an ignorant bride
    Secure of whats left he neer misses the rest
    But where theres enough supposes a feast
          So foreknowing the cheat
          He escapes the deceit
    And in spite of the curse resolves to be blest

II

    If children are blessings his comforts the more
    Whose spouse has been known to be fruitful before
    And the boy that she brings ready made to his hand
    May stand him instead for an heir to his land
          Should his own prove a sot
          When hes lawfully got
    As wheneer tis so if he dont Ill be hanged


SONG

FOR A GIRL

I

    Young I am and yet unskilled
    How to make a lover yield
    How to keep or how to gain
    When to love and when to feign

II

    Take me take me some of you
    While I yet am young and true
    Ere I can my soul disguise
    Heave my breasts and roll my eyes

III

    Stay not till I learn the way
    How to lie and to betray
    He that has me first is blest
    For I may deceive the rest

IV

    Could I find a blooming youth
    Full of love and full of truth
    Brisk and of a jaunty mien
    I should long to be fifteen                         Exeunt

     A Royal Chamber is discovered by drawing the former Scene
     VERAMOND GARCIA XIMENA VICTORIA CELIDEA with a full Train of
     Courtiers and Guards amongst the Crowd RAMIREZ disguised with
     some of his Party

    Vera To VICT No more delays but go

    Xim This is inhuman
    To press her to a marriage made by force
    At least allow yourself and her this day
    That each of you may think and one may change

    Vera You mean the times or accidents may change
    And leave her for Alphonso

    Xim Your enemies are but without your gates
    And soon they may return Forbear for fear

    Vera The sooner then
    I must prevent the effect of their return
    What now remains but to complete my vows
    And sacrifice to vengeance

    Xim Your own daughter

    Vera Even her myself and all the world together

    Vict Can you refuse me one poor day to live

    Vera Obey me and be blest if not accurst
    A fathers curse has wings remember that
    Through this world and the next it will pursue thee
    And sink thee down for ever

    Vict Tis enough
    I know how far a daughter owes obedience
    But duty has a bound like other empires
    It reaches but to life for all beyond it
    Is the dominion of another world
    Where you have no command
    For you Don Garcia
    You know the power a mistress ought to have
    But since you will be master take your hour
    The next is mine

    Gar I grant the debt of service which I owe you
    But tis a sum too vast to pay at sight
    If now you call it in I must be bankrupt
    To all my future bliss

    Vict I find by you
    The laws of love are like the laws of heaven
    All know but few will keep themTo the temple
    Where I myself am victim

Enter ALPHONSO unarmed all seem amazed

    Alph Stay Veramond

    Vera Alphonso here then all my hopes are blasted
    The town is his and I once more a slave            Aside

    Alph Dismiss thy fears and tremble not old man
    I neither come with purpose nor with power
    To avenge my wrongs but single and unarmed
    This head is necessary to thy peace
    And to Victorias violated vows
    Who while I live can never be Don Garcias
    Take then this odious life securely take it
    And glut thy vengeance with Alphonsos blood
    Behold the man who forced thee in thy strength
    In thy imperial town made thee a captive
    Now give thy fury scope revenge the affront
    And show more pity not to spare my life
    Than I in sparing thine

    Xim To CEL Oh boundless courage or extreme despair

    Cel To her I tremble for the event see the king reddens
    The fear which seized him at Alphonsos sight
    And left his face forsaken of his blood
    Is vanished now
    And a new tide returns upon his cheeks
    And rage and vengeance sparkle in his eyes

    Vera Aside All things are hushed no noise is in the streets
    Nor shouts of soldiers nor the cries of matrons
    To speak a town in plunderThen I take
    A traitors counsel once and thou shalt die    To Alph
    Condemned by thy own sentence go to death
    Nor shall thy seeming generosity
    And feigned assurance save thee tis despair
    To see thy frustrate hopes that brought thee hither
    To meet my just revenge

    Alph Yes I will die because I chuse to die
    Which had I not desired I had not come
    Unarmed unguarded and alone to tempt
    Thy known ingratitude and barbarous hate
    Boast not the advantage which thou holdst of me
    But know thyself for what thou artno more
    Than the mean minister of my despair

    Vera Whether to heavens justice or thy choice
    I owe this happy hour of sweet revenge
    Ill not be wanting to the wished occasion

    Vict You shall not die alone my dear Alphonso
    Though much I blame this desperate enterprize
    You should have staid to see
    The event of what I promised to perform
    For had I been so base to be anothers
    That baseness might have cured your illplaced love
    But this untimely rashness makes you guilty
    Both of your fate and mine

    Alph While I believed
    My life was precious to my dear Victoria
    I valued and preserved it for her sake
    But when you broke from your deliverers arms
    To put yourself into a tyrants power
    I threw a worthless wretched being from me
    Abandoned first by you

    Vict Oh cruel man
    Where at what moment did that change begin
    With which you tax my violated vows
    I left your lawless power to put myself
    Into a fathers chains my lawful tyrant
    If this be my upbraided crime even this
    On that occasion would I do once more
    But could I with my honour safe have staid
    In your dear arms bear witness heaven and earth
    Nor threats nor force nor promises nor fears
    Should take me from your love

    Alph Oh I believe you
    Vanish my fears and causeless jealousies
    Live my Victoria for yourself not me
    But let the unfortunate Alphonso die
    My death will glut your cruel fathers rage
    When I am gone and his revenge complete
    Pity perhaps may seize a parents mind
    To free you from a hated lovers arms

    Cel To XIM Speak mother speak my father gives you time
    He stands amazed irresolute and dumb
    Like the still face of heaven before a storm
    Speak and arrest the thunder ere it rolls

    Xim I stand suspected but you Celidea
    The favourite of his heart his darling child
    May speak and ought your interest is concerned
    For if Alphonso die your hopes are lost
    I see your fathers soul like glowing steel
    Is on the anvil strike while yet hes hot
    Turn him and ply him set him strait betimes
    Lest he for ever warp

    Cel I fear and yet would speak but will he hear me

    Xim For what is all this silence but to hear
    Bring him but to calm reasoning and hes gained

    Cel Then heaven inspire my tongue
    Sir royal sir
    He hears me not he lifts not up his eyes
    But fixed upon the pavement looks the way
    That points to death                      She pulls him
    Oh hear me hear me father
    Have you forgot that dear indulgent name
    Never before in vain pronounced by me

    Vera Ha who disturbs my thoughts

    Cel Kneeling Tis Celidea
    Alas I would relieve you if I durst
    If ever I offended even in thought
    Or made not your commands
    The bounds of all my wishes and desires
    Bid me be dumb or else permit me speech

    Vera Oh rise my only unoffending child
    Who reconciles me to the name of father
    Speak thenbut not for her and less for him

    Cel Perhaps I would accuse them not defend
    For both are guilty dipt in equal crimes
    And are obnoxious to your justice both

    Vera True Celidea thou confirmst my sentence
    Tis just Alphonso die

    Xim Forgive her heaven she aggravates their faults
    And pushes their destruction                        Aside

    Cel Speak Alphonso
    Can you deny when royal Veramond
    Then thought your father and by you so deemed
    When he required your captive old Ramirez
    And ordered his confinement did you well
    Then to controul the pleasure of that king
    Under whose just commands you fought and conquered

    Alph I did not well but heat of boiling youth
    And ill weighed honour made me disobey

    Vera That cause is gained for he confesses guilt
    Proceed most equitable judge proceed

    Cel To ALPH Next I reproach you with a worse rebellion
    The kings first promise to Don Garcia made
    You dared to oppose forbade his fair addresses
    Then made a ruffian quarrel with that prince
    And last were guilty of incestuous love
    I will not load my sister with consent
    But in strict virtue listening to a crime
    And not rejecting is itself a crime

    Vict Is this a sisters office peace for shame
    We loved without transgressing virtues bounds
    We fixed the limits of our tenderest thoughts
    Came to the verge of honour and there stopt
    We warmed us by the fire but were not scorched
    If this be sin angels might love with less
    And mingle rays of minds less pure than ours
    Our souls enjoyed but to their holy feasts
    Bodies on both sides were forbidden guests

    Cel Now help me father or our cause is lost
    For much I fear their love was innocent

    Vera With my own troops Alphonso seized my person
    In my own town to my perpetual shame
    Pass on to that and strike the traitor dead

    Cel Yes proud Alphonso you were banishd hence
    Your father was confined and doomed to death
    The beauty you adored was made anothers
    How durst you then attempt to avenge your wrongs
    And force your mistress from your rivals arms
    Rather than die contented as you ought

    Alph Even for those very reasons you allege

    Xim At last I find her drift                     Aside

    Vera Thou justifiest and not accusest him

    Cel Patience good father and hear out the rest To ALPH
    Thought you because you bravely fought and conquered
    For royal Veramond nay saved his life
    And set him free when you had conquered him
    Only because he was Victorias father
    Thought you for such slight services as these
    That he should spare you now O generous madman
    To give your head to one who neer forgave

    Vera Oh she stings me                           Aside

    Cel And you Don Garcia witness to this truth
    You were his hated rival fairly vanquished
    And yet he spared your life

    Gar At your request
    I owe it to you both

    Cel That he dismissed my sister twas her fault
    I charge it not on him but twas his folly
    A capital fool he was in that last error
    For which he justly stands condemned to death
    Your sentence royal sir

    Vera That he should live
    Should live triumphant over Veramond
    And should live happy in Victorias love
    Oh I have held as long as nature could
    Convinced in reason obstinate in will
    I saw the pleaders aim found her design
    I longed to be oercome and yet resisted
    What have I done against thee my Alphonso
    And what hast thou not done for Veramond

    Xim Oh fortunate event

    Vict Oh happy day

    Alph Oh unexpected bliss and therefore double

    Vera To ALPH Can you forgive me yes I know Alphonso can
       forgive Victorias father
    But yet in pity pardon not too soon
    Punish my pride a while
    And make me linger for so great a good
    Lest ecstasy of joy prevent this blessing
    And you instead of pardon give me death

     He offers to kneel to ALPHONSO ALPHONSO takes him up and
     kneels himself

    Alph Oh let me raise my father from the ground

    Vera Rising Tis your peculiar virtue my Alphonso
    Always to raise me up

    Alph Here let me grow till I obtain your grace
    My life has been one universal crime
    And you like heaven accepting short repentance
    Forgive my length of sins

    Vera Raising him Let us forget from whence offence began
    But since to save my shame thou wilt be guilty
    Impute thy hate for me to sure instinct
    That showed thee thy true father in my foe
    Now grafted on my stock be son to both
    Turning to GAR To you Don Garcia next

    Gar Before you speak
    Permit me sir to assume some little merit
    In this days happiness your promise made
    Victoria mine

    Alph What then

    Gar Nay hear me out
    He kept his royal word he gave her me
    I lost her when I fell beneath your sword
    Or if I have a title I resign it
    And make her yours

    Alph I take her as your gift

    Gar To VER Make me but blest in Celideas love
    She saved my life and hers it is for ever
    Tis pity she who gained anothers cause
    Should lose her own

    Vera Presenting CEL Shes yours

    Cel My joys are full

    Vict And mine oerflow

    Alph And mine are all a soul can bear and live

    Vera Then seek we out Ramirez
    To make him partner of this happy day
    That gives him back his crown and his Alphonso

    Ram Behold me here unsought with some few friends
                                        Taking off his vizard
    Resolved to save my son or perish with him
    Thus far I traced and followed him unknown
    And here have waited with a beating heart
    To see this blest event

    Vera Just like the winding up of some design
    Wellformed upon the crowded theatre
    Where all concerned surprisingly are pleased

EPILOGUE

SPOKEN BY DALINDA


    Now in good manners nothing should be said
    Against this play because the poets dead
    The prologue told us of a moral here
    Would I could find it but the devil knows where
    If in my part it lies I fear he means
    To warn us of the sparks behind our scenes
    For if youll take it on Dalindas word
    Tis a hard chapter to refuse a lord
    The poet might pretend this moral too
    That when a wit and fool together woo
    The damsel not to break an antient rule
    Should leave the wit and take the wealthy fool
    This he might mean but theres a truth behind      
    And since it touches none of all our kind           
    But masks and misses faith Ill speak my mind    
    What if he taught our sex more cautious carriage
    And not to be too coming before marriage
    For fear of my misfortune in the play
    A kid brought home upon the wedding day
    I fear there are few Sanchos in the pit
    So good as to forgive and to forget
    That will like him restore us into favour
    And take us after on our good behaviour
    Few when they find the moneybag is rent
    Will take it for good payment on content
    But in the telling there the difference is
    Sometimes they find it more than they could wish
    Therefore be warned you misses and you masks
    Look to your hits nor give the first that asks
    Tears sighs and oaths no truth of passion prove
    True settlement alone declares true love
    For him that weds a puss who kept her first
    I say but little but I doubt the worst
    The wife that was a cat may mind her house        
    And prove an honest and a careful spouse           
    But faith I would not trust her with a mouse

PROLOGUE SONG

SECULAR MASQUE  EPILOGUE

WRITTEN FOR

THE PILGRIM

REVIVED FOR DRYDENS BENEFIT IN 


Our Authors connection with the Theatre only ended with his life
The pieces which follow have reference to the performance of The
Pilgrim a play of Beaumont and Fletcher which was revived in 
Vanburgh a lively comic writer who seems to have looked up to Dryden
with that veneration which was his due added some light touches of
humour to adapt this play to the taste of the age The aged poet
himself furnished a Prologue and Epilogue a Song and Secular Masque
and with these additions the piece was performed for the benefit of
Dryden It seems dubious whether the kind intentions of Vanburgh and
the players actually took effect in favour of our author himself or
in that of his son It is certain that if he did not die before the
representation he did not survive it many weeks as the play was
not published till after his death


But his lamp burned bright to the close The Prologue and Epilogue
written within a few weeks of his death equal any thing of the kind
which he ever produced He combats his two enemies Blackmore and
Collier with his usual spirit but with manliness concedes that they
had attacked him in one vulnerable and indefensible particular where
he lay open less from any peculiar depravity in his own taste than
from compliance with the general licence of the age

Cibber informs us that Sir John Vanburgh who cast the parts being
pleased with the young actors moderation in contenting himself with
those of the Stuttering Cook and Mad Englishman assigned him also
the creditable task of speaking the Epilogue which as it was so much
above the ordinary strain highly gratified his vanity Dryden himself
on hearing Cibber recite it made him the further compliment of
trusting him with the Prologue also an honourable distinction which
drew upon him the jealousy of the other actors and the indignation
of Wilkes in particular This revival of The Pilgrim was also
remarkable as affording Mrs Oldfield who had been about a year or
more a mute on the stage an opportunity of attracting public attention
in the character of Alinda which suited the want of confidence natural
to her inexperience and in which she afforded that promise of future
excellence which was afterwards so amply fulfilled

FOOTNOTES

Footnote  Mr Malone supposes the play to have been acted on the
th March  Dryden died on the st of May following The play was
advertised for publication in the London Gazette of th June 
The following is the full title

The Pilgrim a Comedy as it is acted at the Theatreroyal in
Drurylane written originally by Mr Fletcher and now very much
altered with several additions likewise a Prologue Epilogue
Dialogue and Masque written by the late great poet Mr Dryden just

In the published copy our author is mentioned as deadGovernor
I hope before you go sir youll share with us an entertainment the
late great poet of our age prepared to celebrate this day But this
as Mr Malone observes was probably an addition after Drydens death
had taken place Gildon in his Comparison between the Stages seems
to say that the play was performed for the benefit of Drydens son
probably because in his fathers extreme illness or upon his death
his son would naturally draw the profits On the whole it seems
probable that Dryden survived the performance of the play as it is
presumable that The Secular Masque being intended to solemnise
the supposed termination of the century was brought out as soon as
possible in the new year




PROLOGUE

TO

THE PILGRIM

REVIVED FOR OUR AUTHORS BENEFIT ANNO 


    How wretched is the fate of those who write
    Brought muzzled to the stage for fear they bite
    Where like Tom Dove they stand the common foe
    Lugged by the critic baited by the beau
    Yet worse their brother poets damn the play
    And roar the loudest though they never pay
    The fops are proud of scandal for they cry
    At every lewd low characterThats I
    He who writes letters to himself would swear
    The world forgot him if he was not there
    What should a poet do Tis hard for one        
    To pleasure all the fools that would be shown  
    And yet not two in ten will pass the town      
    Most coxcombs are not of the laughing kind
    More goes to make a fop than fops can find
      Quack Maurus though he never took degrees
    In either of our universities
    Yet to be shown by some kind wit he looks
    Because he played the fool and writ three books
    But if he would be worth a poets pen
    He must be more a fool and write again
    For all the former fustian stuff he wrote
    Was deadborn doggrel or is quite forgot
    His man of Uz stript of his Hebrew robe
    Is just the proverb and As poor as Job
    One would have thought he could no longer jog
    But Arthur was a level Jobs a bog
    There though he crept yet still he kept in sight
    But here he founders in and sinks downright
    Had he prepared us and been dull by rule
    Tobit had first been turned to ridicule
    But our bold Briton without fear or awe
    Oerleaps at once the whole Apocrypha
    Invades the Psalms with rhymes and leaves no room
    For any Vandal Hopkins yet to come
      But when if after all this godly gear
    Is not so senseless as it would appear
    Our mountebank has laid a deeper train     
    His cant like Merry Andrews noble vein   
    Catcalls the sects to draw them in again  
    At leisure hours in Epic Song he deals
    Writes to the rumbling of his coachs wheels
    Prescribes in haste and seldom kills by rule
    But rides triumphant between stool and stool
      Well let him gotis yet too early day
    To get himself a place in farce or play
    We know not by what name we should arraign him
    For no one category can contain him
    A pedant canting preacher and a quack
    Are load enough to break an asss back
    At last grown wanton he presumed to write        
    Traduced two kings their kindness to requite      
    One made the Doctor and one dubbed the Knight 

FOOTNOTES

Footnote  The savage amusement of bearbaiting was much in fashion
in England during the seventeenth century Tom Dove although equipped
with a name not very expressive of his properties seems to have been
a bear of great celebrity Dryden honours him by another notice in the
second Prologue on the Union of the Companies

    They roar so loud youd think behind the stairs
    Tom Dove and all the brotherhood of bears

Footnote  Quack Maurus is the noted Sir Richard Blackmore who if
he was not witty himself was the cause of more wit in others than most
who have favoured the world with their writings In his Satire against
Wit he had proposed a sort of mint in which the works of the witty
should be purified and recoined

    Tis true that when the coarse and worthless dross
    Is purged away there will be mighty loss
    Even Congreve Southerne Manly Wycherly
    When thus refined will grievous sufferers be
    Into the meltingpot when Dryden comes
    What horrid stench will rise what noisome
    How will he shrink when all his lewd allay
    And wicked mixture shall be purged away

In the first edition of the Poem this lumbering attack upon Dryden
concluded with a compliment

    But what remains will be so pure twill bear
    The examination of the most severe

But Blackmore when our author had retaliated upon him in the Preface
to the Fables finding says Dr Johnson the censure resented
and the civility disregarded ungenerously omitted the softer part
Such variations discover a writer who consults his passions more than
his virtue and it may be reasonably supposed that Dryden attributes
his enmity to its true causehis attack upon Blackmores fanatic
patrons in the city He had also assailed our author in the Preface to
his Prince Arthur which after a general and bitter complaint of
the profligacy of the stage contains these personal remarks levelled
against Dryden And there are among these writers some who think
they might have arisen to the highest dignities in other professions
had they employed their wit in those ways Tis a mighty dishonour
and reproach to any man that is capable of being useful to the world
in any liberal or virtuous profession to lavish out his life and
wit in propagating vice and corruption of manners and in battering
from the stage the strongest entrenchments and best works of religion
and virtue Whoever makes this his choice when the other was in his
power may he go off the stage unpitied complaining of neglect
and poverty the just punishment of his irreligion and folly
This reproach which touched some very tender points was not to be
tolerated or forgot by Dryden

Footnote  Blackmore was a commoner of Edmund Hall Oxford where
he remained thirteen years and took the degree of Master of Arts on
d June  but he did not take his medical degrees there and
appears not to have studied physic regularly as he was for some time a
schoolmaster when according to Col Coddrington

    By nature formed by want a pedant made
    Blackmore at first set up the whipping trade
    Next quack commenced when fierce with pride he swore
    That toothache gout and corns should be no more
    In vain his drugs as well as birch he plied
    His boys grow blockheads and his patients died

Sir Richard Blackmore had his medical diploma from Padua in Italy a
learned and eminent University which like some in my own country
is supposed not to be over scrupulous in conferring honours of this
nature

Footnote  Prince Arthur a heroic poem in ten books published
in  was written the author assures us in his Preface by such
catches and starts and in such occasional uncertain hours as his
profession afforded and for the greatest part in coffeehouses or in
passing up and down the streets

Footnote  Who was the first of these welljudging monarchs is
hard to say Blackmore may have had some sort of royal licence for the
practice of physic during the reign of Charles or James but he was not
made physician to the Household till the reign of King William who
conferred on him at the same time the honour of knighthood for which
that monarchs taste is thus commemorated by Pope

    The hero William and the martyr Charles
    One knighted Blackmore and one pensioned Quarles

Blackmores dulness or solidity of temper rendered him absolutely
impenetrable to the shafts of ridicule which were aimed at him from
all quarters and consoling himself with the excellence of his
intentions he wrote on till the catalogue of his works gave room for
Swifts burlesque inscription to be placed under his picture

    See who neer was or will be half read
    Who first sung Arthur then sung Alfreda
    Praised great Elizab in Gods anger
    Till all true Englishmen cried hang her
    Made Williams virtues wipe the bare a
    And hanged up Marlborough in arrasc
    Then hissed from earth grown heavenly quite
    Made every reader curse the lightd
    Mauled human wit in one thick satiree
    Next in three books spoiled human naturef
    Ended Creationg at a jerk
    And of Redemptionh made damned work
    Then took his muse at once and dipped her
    Full in the middle of the scripture
    What wonders there the man grown old did
    Sternhold himself he outsternholded
    Made Davidi seem so mad and freakish
    All thought him just what thought king Achish
    No mortal read his Solomonk
    But judged Roboam his own son
    Mosesl he served as Moses Pharoah
    And Deborah as she Sisera
    Made Jeremym full sore to cry

SONG

     OF A SCHOLAR AND HIS MISTRESS WHO BEING CROSSED BY THEIR
     FRIENDS FELL MAD FOR ONE ANOTHER AND NOW FIRST MEET IN BEDLAM


In The Pilgrim as originally written by Beaumont and Fletcher
one scene is laid in a madhouse where the humours of the different
persons confined are described with some pleasantry Amongst others
is introduced a Scholar who has solicited dismission from his
confinement and who after having been carefully examined by two
gentlemen whom his patron had appointed to visit him is on the
point of being discharged as possessed of his perfect understanding
The Dialogue which follows probably formed the introduction to our
Authors Song

    st Gent What flaws and whils of weather
    Or rather storms have been aloft these three days
    How dark and hot and full of mutiny
    And still grows louder

    Mas It has been stubborn weather

    d Gent Strange work at sea I fear me theres old tumbling

    st Gent Bless my old uncles bark I have a venture

    d Gent And I more than Id wish to lose

    Schol Do you fear

    nd Gent Ha how he looks

    Mas Nay mark him better gentlemen

    d Gent Mercy upon me how his eyes are altered

    Mas Now tell me how you like him whether now
    He be that perfect man you credited

    Schol Does the sea stagger ye

    Mas Now ye have hit the nick

    Schol Do ye fear the billows

    st Gent What ails him who has stirred him

    Schol Be not shaken
    Nor let the singing of the storm shoot through you
    Let it blow on blow on Let the clouds wrestle
    And let the vapours of the earth turn mutinous
    The sea in hideous mountains rise and tumble
    Upon a dolphins back Ill make all tremble
    For I am Neptune

    Mas Now what think ye of him

    d Gent Alas poor man

    Schol Your bark shall plow through all
    And not a surge so saucy as disturb her
    Ill see her safe my power shall sail before her
          Down ye angry waters all
          Ye loud whistling whirlwinds fall
          Down ye proud waves ye storms cease
          I command ye be at peace
          Fright not with your churlish notes
          Nor bruise the keel of bark that floats
          No devouring fish come nigh
          Nor monster in my empery
          Once shew his head or terror bring
          But let the weary sailor sing
          Amphitrite with white arms
          Strike my lute Ill sing thy charms

    Mas He must have music now I must observe him
    This fit will grow too full else

Music and Song

Here it seems probable the following Mad Song betwixt the Scholar
and his Mistress was introduced Probably the Dialogue sustained
some alterations in the action to render the introduction of Phillis
more natural for in the original the Scholar far from having lost
his senses by being crossed in love disclaims acquaintance with the
passion during his previous examination

    st Gent Is there no unkindness
    You have conceived from any friend or parent
    Or scorn from what you loved

    Schol No truly sir
    I never yet was master of a faith
    So poor and weak to doubt my friend or kindred
    And what love is unless it be in learning
    I think Im ignorant

This passage is retained in The Pilgrim as altered by Sir John
Vanburgh so that it does not appear what alterations were made to
accommodate the Song to the Scholars previous appearance The idea
of the character is copied from the story told by the Curate in the
First Chapter of the Second Part of the Adventures of the Knight of La
Mancha and applied by him to the relapse of that doughty champion




SONG

MUSIC WITHIN


The Lovers enter at opposite Doors each held by a Keeper

    Phil Look look I seeI see my love appear
        Tis he tis he alone
        For like him there is none
    Tis the dear dear man tis thee dear

    Amyn Hark the winds war
        The foaming waves roar
        I see a ship afar
    Tossing and tossing and making to the shore
        But whats that I view
        So radiant of hue
    St Hermo St Hermo that sits upon the sails
        Ah no no no
    St Hermo never never shone so bright
    Tis Phillis only Phillis can shoot so fair a light
    Tis Phillis tis Phillis that saves the ship alone
    For all the winds are hushed and the storm is overblown

    Phil Let me go let me run let me fly to his arms

    Amyn  If all the fates combine
                  And all the furies join
    Ill force my way to Phillis and break through the charm

     Here they break from their Keepers run to each other and
     embrace

    Phil Shall I marry the man I love
      And shall I conclude my pains
    Now blessed be the powers above
      I feel the blood bound in my veins
    With a lively leap it began to move
      And the vapours leave my brains

    Amyn Body joined to body and heart joined to heart
      To make sure of the cure
    Go call the man in black to mumble oer his part

    Phil But suppose he should stay

    Amyn At worst if he delay
      Tis a work must be done
    Well borrow but a day
      And the better the sooner begun

    Cho of both At worst if he delay c

                           They run out together hand in hand

Mediterranean the Lights of St Elmo and by the ancients Castor and

THE

SECULAR MASQUE


The moral of this emblematical representation is sufficiently
intelligible By the introduction of the deities of the chace of
war and of love as governing the various changes of the seventeenth
century the poet alludes to the sylvan sports of James the First the
bloody wars of his son and the licentious gallantry which reigned in
the courts of Charles II and James his successor

James I was inordinately attached to the sports of the chace it
was indeed the only manly passion which our British Solomon ever
manifested his dress was of the forestgreen and his only severity
was in executing the gamelaws Able hunters were the bribes by
which the English courtiers endeavoured to secure his favour while
he was yet but king of Scotland and in England his perpetual hunting
expeditions were censured by his prelates and their oppressive
duration deprecated by his subjects who to render their complaints
more palatable contrived upon one occasion to make a favourite hound
convey a hint of the burthen which his long residence at a hunting
seat imposed upon the neighbourhood Even in the most advanced
state of his age and imbecility when unable to sit on horseback
without assistance he contrived to pursue the chace by being laced
or tied up in his saddle When we add to this vehement passion for
hunting the spirit of extravagant dissipation which discharged itself
in shows sights and banquetings from morn to eve where even
the ladies abandoned their sobriety the age of James might well be
characterised as in the Masque

    A very merry dancing drinking
    Laughing quaffing and unthinking time

To show how justly the middle part of the seventeenth century was
characterised as under the influence of Mars we have only to mention
the great civil war which so long ravaged the whole kingdom

The manners of the court of Charles II so notoriously dissolute and
licentious when as our author says in the Epilogue

    Whitehall the naked Venus first revealed

amply vindicate Dryden for placing the period in which they were
fashionable under the dominion of the queen of Cyprus

The moral by which the whole masque is winded up was sadly true The
frivolity of James the Firsts sports would have been admitted by the
sapient monarch himself

    His sport had a beast in view

But it is less credible were it not a historical fact that the wars
of Charles the First brought nothing about since royal prerogative
and popular encroachment far from being adjusted by so many years
bloodshed were as much themes of mutual dissention betwixt the Court
and the House of Commons in the reign of Charles II as during that
of his father But so bloody a lesson was not entirely lost The
contending parties at the Revolution lived too near that eventful
period not to be aware of the direful consequences of civil war and
thence by mutual concession were determined to avoid the repetition
of similar calamities The nation gained by the compromise for freedom
is always benefited by the equal balance of contending factions and as
certainly suffers by the decided ascendancy of either

A thousand lampoons bear witness that during the reign of Venus
under the auspices of Charles II her

    Lovers were all untrue

The modern reader will find the most decent and at the same time the
most lively record of their infidelities in Count Hamiltons Memoires
du Compte de Grammont

From the Secular Masque being performed in the beginning of the year
 it appears that by a blunder or rather confusion of ideas the
century was supposed to terminate with  in other words a hundred
years were considered as accomplished when the hundredth was just
commencedan error of calculation which though it could not puzzle a
horsejockey who if he was to ride twenty miles would hardly think
he had accomplished the match by riding nineteen did nevertheless
find patrons in the year  though hardly any of such account as
Dryden

The original music of the Masque was very much approved It is
mentioned in the Travels of John Buncle Mr Malone believes Daniel
Purcel to have been the composer It was set anew by Dr Boyce and
afterwards revived with success at DruryLane in  The hunting song
was long popular

FOOTNOTES

Footnote  Nay I dare boldly say one man might with more

please tragical was this sylvan prince against deerkillers and
indulgent to menslayers But lest this expression should be thought
too poetical for an historian I shall leave him dressed to posterity

Footnote  See the Nug Antiqu In vol i p  of Mr
Parks excellent edition Sir John Harrington gives the following
extraordinary account of one of King Jamess revels with Christian
IV of DenmarkOne day a great feast was held and after dinner
the representation of Solomon his Temple and the coming of the queen
of Sheba was made or as I may better say was meant to have been
made before their majesties by device of the earl of Salisbury and
others But alas as all earthly things do fail to poor mortals in
enjoyment so did prove our presentment hereof The ladie who did
play the queens part did carry most precious gifts to both their
majesties but forgetting the steps arising to the canopy overset her
caskets into his Danish majesties lap and fell at his feet though
I rather think it was in his face Much was the hurry and confusion
clothes and napkins were at hand to make all clean His majesty then
got up and would dance with the queen of Sheba but he fell down and
humbled himself before her and was carried to an inner chamber and
laid upon a bed of state which was not a little defiled with the
presents of the queen which had been bestowed on his garments such as
wine cream jelly beverage cakes spices and other good matters
The entertainment and show went forward and most of the presenters
went backward or fell down wine did so occupy their upper chambers
Now did appear in rich dresses Hope Faith and Charity Hope did
essay to speak but wine rendered her endeavours so feeble that she
withdrew and hoped the king would excuse her brevity Faith was
then left all alone for I am certain she was not joined with good
works and left the court in a staggering condition Charity came to
the kings feet and seemed to cover the multitude of sins her sisters
had committed in some sort she made obeisance and brought gifts but
said she would return home again as there was no gift which heaven had
not already given his majesty She then returned to Hope and Faith
who were both sick and spewing in the lower hall Next came Victory
in bright armour and presented a rich sword to the king who did not
accept it but put it by with his hand and by a strange medley of
versification did endeavour to make suit to the king But Victory did
not triumph long for after much lamentable utterance she was led
away like a silly captive and laid to sleep on the outer steps of the
antichamber Now did Peace make entry and strove to get foremost to
the king but I grieve to tell how great wrath she did discover unto
those of her attendants and much contrary to her semblance most
rudely made war with her olivebranch and laid on the pates of those
who did oppose her coming I have much marvelled at these strange
pageantries and they do bring to my remembrance what past of this sort
in our queens days of which I was sometime a humble presenter and
assistant but I neer did see such lack of good order discretion
and sobriety as I have now done I have passed much time in seeing

Footnote  The first edition and some others have Good but I
prefer God as the more poetical reading

Footnote  There seems here to be a secret allusion to the exile of
the beautiful queen of James II so much admired by the Tory poets of
the time




EPILOGUE

TO

THE PILGRIM


This epilogue bears chiefly reference to the violent controversy
which about this time arose between the favourers of the drama and
Jeremy Collier who in  published A short View of the Immorality
and Profaneness of the English StageI believe says Johnson
with no other view than religious zeal and honest indignation
He was formed for a controvertist with sufficient learning with
diction vehement and pointed though often vulgar and incorrect with
unconquerable pertinacity with wit in the highest degree keen and
sarcastic and with all those powers exalted and invigorated by just
confidence in his cause

Thus qualified and thus incited he walked forth to battle and
assailed at once most of the living writers from Dryden to Durfey
His onset was violent Those passages which while they had stood
single had passed with little notice when they were accumulated and
exposed together excited horror The wise and the pious caught the
alarm and the nation wondered why it had so long suffered irreligion
and licentiousness to be openly taught at the public chargeLife of
Congreve

Dryden had his personal share of rough treatment in this indiscriminate
attack upon dramatic profligacy But it is creditable to him that
whatever his feelings of resentment might be he was too much
consciencestruck to attempt a defence of what was really indefensible
I shall say the less of Mr Collier because in many things he
has taxed me justly and I have pleaded guilty to all thoughts
and expressions of mine which can be truly argued of obscenity
profaneness or immorality and retract them If he be my enemy let
him triumph if he be my friend as I have given him no personal
occasion to be otherwise he will be glad of my repentance It becomes
me not to draw my pen in the defence of a bad cause when I have so
often drawn it for a good one Preface to the Fables

This candid avowal and the coincidence of their political sentiments
for Collier was a rigid Nonjuror did not save Dryden from some
oblique thrusts in an Answer published by Collier to the Vindications
of Congreve and Vanburgh who less patient or prudent than our poet
had stepped forward to assert the correctness of their dramatic
writings These passages in the Defence of the Short View which
was published in  seem to have incited our poet to put himself
upon his defence or at least to offer the best apology he could
by throwing upon the gay court of Charles the scandal of importing
the open profligacy which the poet insists had corrupted the stage
instead of being derived from thence Lord Lansdowne in a prologue to
the Jew of Venice when revived took the freedom to dissent from
Dryden and Collier and by exculpating both the theatre and court to
throw the whole blame upon the public at large

    Each in his turn the poet and the priest
    Have viewed the stage but like false prophets guessed
    The man of zeal in his religious rage
    Would silence poets and reduce the stage
    The poet rashly to get clear retorts
    On kings the scandal and bespatters courts
    Both err for without mincing to be plain
    The guilts your own of every odious scene
    The present time still gives the stage its mode
    The vices that you practise we explode
    We hold the glass and but reflect your shame
    Like Spartans by exposing to reclaim
    The scribbler pinched with hunger writes to dine
    And to your genius must conform his line
    Not lewd by choice but merely to submit
    Would you encourage sense sense would be writ

There is in every case of this kind much partial accusation The
court stage and public at large have a mutual action and reaction
on the manners of each other If the habits of a court be licentious
the poet will hardly venture to paint them noble and innocent but it
will depend upon the extent which that licence has attained amongst
his audience at large whether he represents the courtly vices in gay
or in disgusting and odious colours In any case the dramatist who
degrades himself by indecency has little personal apology for if he
has condescended to blot his pages with filth it avails but little
where he has gathered it

Colliers attack on the stage was attended with good consequences
which that active disputant lived to witness indecencies were no
longer either fashionable or tolerated and by degrees the ladies
began to fill the boxes at a new play without either the necessity
of wearing masks or the risk of incurring censure Later times have
carried this laudable restraint still farther till at last if we
have lost almost all the wit of our predecessors we at least have
retained none of their licentiousness

The following verses appear upon Drydens death in the State Poems
vol iii founded upon his controversy with Sir Richard Blackmore and
Collier which so immediately preceded that event

    John Dryden enemies had three
    Sir Dick old Nick and Jeremy
    The doughty knight was forced to yield
    The other two have kept the field
    But had his life been something holier
    Hed foiled the Devil and the Collier

FOOTNOTES

Footnote  The facetious Joe Haines who is mentioned at the end of
the epilogue assigned another motive for this assault The clergy and
the actors are both moral menders by profession said the wag and
you know two of a trade can never agreeCibbers Apology




EPILOGUE

TO

THE PILGRIM


    Perhaps the parson stretched a point too far
    When with our theatres he waged a war
    He tells you that this very moral age
    Received the first infection from the stage
    But sure a banished court with lewdness fraught
    The seeds of open vice returning brought
    Thus lodged as vice by great example thrives
    It first debauched the daughters and the wives
    London a fruitful soil yet never bore
    So plentiful a crop of horns before
    The poets who must live by courts or starve
    Were proud so good a government to serve
    And mixing with buffoons and pimps prophane
    Tainted the stage for some small snip of gain
    For they like harlots under bawds profest
    Took all the ungodly pains and got the least
    Thus did the thriving malady prevail
    The court its head the poets but the tail
    The sin was of our native growth tis true
    The scandal of the sin was wholly new
    Misses there were but modestly concealed
    Whitehall the naked Venus first revealed
    Who standing as at Cyprus in her shrine
    The strumpet was adored with rites divine
    Ere this if saints had any secret motion
    Twas chamberpractice all and close devotion
    I pass the peccadillos of their time
    Nothing but open lewdness was a crime
    A monarchs blood was venial to the nation
    Compared with one foul act of fornication
    Now they would silence us and shut the door
    That let in all the barefaced vice before
    As for reforming us which some pretend     
    That work in England is without an end      
    Well may we change but we shall never mend 
    Yet if you can but bear the present stage
    We hope much better of the coming age
    What would you say if we should first begin 
    To stop the trade of love behind the scene  
    Where actresses make bold with married men  
    For while abroad so prodigal the dolt is
    Poor spouse at home as ragged as a colt is
    In short well grow as moral as we can
    Save here and there a woman or a man
    But neither you nor we with all our pains
    Can make clean work there will be some remains
    While you have still your Oates and we our Haines

FOOTNOTES

Footnote  The rigour of the republicans against female frailty
was of a piece with their general hypocrisy It was however carried
much farther in Scotland where open adultery was declared by statute a
capital crime That act is still unrepealed and may remind the reader
of a verse I have somewhere read

    Beware ye knights on British ground
      Beware ye dames so free
    Full many a neck so straight and round
      On gallows stretched might be

Footnote  The infamous Oates fared at the Revolution not so
well as he wished though much better than he deserved James II by
the extreme cruelty of the punishment which Jefferies doomed and he
suffered to be inflicted contrived to excite the public commiseration
even in favour of this miscreant whose forsworn tongue had occasioned
more murders than the dagger of the most sanguinary bravo After the
Revolution he obtained a pardon or rather remission of his inhuman
sentence to be imprisoned during life and pilloried five times every
year He was also admitted to the comforts of a pension of L
ayear But although he bestirred himself to obtain a reversal of
his judgement for perjury and wrote an abusive pamphlet entitled a
Picture of the late King James and dedicated to King William that
coolheaded monarch and his sagacious council would never restore
him to a capacity of bearing evidence The Earl of Danby now Duke
of Leeds who had experienced the danger of his swearing capacity
would consent to the reversal in no other sense than that having
been condemned to be scourged from Newgate to Tyburn he should now be
scourged back from Tyburn to Newgate Dryden therefore without fear
of offence might venture a stroke of satire at this once formidable
person

Footnote  The allusion seems to be partly to Bryan Haines the
Tory evidence against Shaftesbury and College a fellow almost as
infamous as Oates but chiefly by way of equivoque to the wicked wag
Jee Haines the comedian who amongst other pranks chose during the
reign of James II to become Roman Catholic Whether he took this step
from any serious prospect of advantage or to throw ridicule on the new
converts is somewhat dubious at least his apostacy was not founded
upon conviction for after the Revolution he abjured the errors of
Popery spoke a penitentiary prologue and reconciled himself to the
church and theatre of England

Section   Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment  Many small donations
 to  are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all  states of the United
States  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit wwwgutenbergorgdonate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States  US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section   General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone  For forty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included  Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility
