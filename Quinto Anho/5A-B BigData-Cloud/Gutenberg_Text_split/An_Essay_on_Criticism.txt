AN ESSAY ON CRITICISM

BY

ALEXANDER POPE

WITH INTRODUCTORY AND EXPLANATORY NOTES



ALEXANDER POPE

                                   

This eminent English poet was born in London May   His parents
were Roman Catholics and to this faith the poet adhered thus debarring
himself from public office and employment His father a linen merchant
having saved a moderate competency withdrew from business and settled
on a small estate he had purchased in Windsor Forest He died at
Chiswick in  His son shortly afterwards took a long lease of a
house and five acres of land at Twickenham on the banks of the Thames
whither he retired with his widowed mother to whom he was tenderly
attached and where he resided till death cultivating his little domain
with exquisite taste and skill and embellishing it with a grotto
temple wilderness and other adjuncts poetical and picturesque In this
famous villa Pope was visited by the most celebrated wits statesmen and
beauties of the day himself being the most popular and successful poet
of his age His early years were spent at Binfield within the range of
the Royal Forest He received some education at little Catholic schools
but was his own instructor after his twelfth year He never was a
profound or accurate scholar but he read Latin poets with ease and
delight and acquired some Greek French and Italian He was a poet
almost from infancy he lisped in numbers and when a mere youth
surpassed all his contemporaries in metrical harmony and correctness
His pastorals and some translations appeared in  but were written
three or four years earlier These were followed by the Essay on
Criticism  Rape of the Lock when completed the most
graceful airy and imaginative of his works  Windsor
Forest  Temple of Fame  In a collection of his
works printed in  he included the Epistle of Eloisa and
Elegy on an Unfortunate Lady two poems inimitable for pathetic
beauty and finished melodious versification

From  till  Pope was chiefly engaged on his translations of the
Iliad and Odyssey which though wanting in time Homeric
simplicity naturalness and grandeur are splendid poems In  he
published his greatest satirethe Dunciad an attack on all
poetasters and pretended wits and on all other persons against whom the
sensitive poet had conceived any enmity In  he gave to the world a
volume of his Literary Correspondence containing some pleasant
gossip and observations with choice passages of description but it
appears that the correspondence was manufactured for publication not
composed of actual letters addressed to the parties whose names are
given and the collection was introduced to the public by means of an
elaborate stratagem on the part of the scheming poet Between the years
 and  he issued a series of poetical essays moral and
philosophical with satires and imitations of Horace all admirable for
sense wit spirit and brilliancy of these delightful productions the
most celebrated is the Essay on Man to which Bolingbroke is
believed to have contributed the spurious philosophy and false
sentiment but its merit consists in detached passages descriptions
and pictures A fourth book to the Dunciad containing many
beautiful and striking lines and a general revision of his works closed
the poets literary cares and toils He died on the th of May 
and was buried in the church at Twickenham

Pope was of very diminutive stature and deformed from his birth His
physical infirmity susceptible temperament and incessant study
rendered his life one long disease He was as his friend Lord
Chesterfield said the most irritable of all the genus irritabile
vatum offended with trifles and never forgetting or forgiving
them His literary stratagems disguises assertions denials and we
must add misrepresentations would fill volumes Yet when no disturbing
jealousy vanity or rivalry intervened was generous and affectionate
and he had a manly independent spirit As a poet he was deficient in
originality and creative power and thus was inferior to his prototype
Dryden but as a literary artist and brilliant declaimer satirist and
moralizer in verse he is still unrivaled He is the English Horace and
will as surely descend with honors to the latest posterity






AN ESSAY ON CRITICISM

WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 


    The title An Essay on Criticism hardly indicates all
    that is included in the poem It would have been impossible to
    give a full and exact idea of the art of poetical criticism
    without entering into the consideration of the art of poetry
    Accordingly Pope has interwoven the precepts of both throughout
    the poem which might more properly have been styled an essay on
    the Art of Criticism and of Poetry

                                   

PART I

    Tis hard to say if greater want of skill
  Appear in writing or in judging ill
  But of the two less dangerous is the offense
  To tire our patience than mislead our sense
  Some few in that but numbers err in this
  Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss
  A fool might once himself alone expose
  Now one in verse makes many more in prose

    Tis with our judgments as our watches none
  Go just alike yet each believes his own
  In poets as true genius is but rare
  True taste as seldom is the critic share
  Both must alike from Heaven derive their light
  These born to judge as well as those to write
  Let such teach others who themselves excel
  And censure freely who have written well
  Authors are partial to their wit tis true 
  But are not critics to their judgment too

    Yet if we look more closely we shall find
  Most have the seeds of judgment in their mind
  Nature affords at least a glimmering light
  The lines though touched but faintly are drawn right
  But as the slightest sketch if justly traced
  Is by ill coloring but the more disgraced
  So by false learning is good sense defaced
  Some are bewildered in the maze of schools 
  And some made coxcombs nature meant but fools
  In search of wit these lose their common sense
  And then turn critics in their own defense
  Each burns alike who can or cannot write
  Or with a rivals or an eunuchs spite
  All fools have still an itching to deride
  And fain would be upon the laughing side
  If Maevius scribble in Apollos spite 
  There are who judge still worse than he can write

    Some have at first for wits then poets passed
  Turned critics next and proved plain fools at last
  Some neither can for wits nor critics pass
  As heavy mules are neither horse nor ass
  Those halflearned witlings numerous in our isle
  As halfformed insects on the banks of Nile
  Unfinished things one knows not what to call
  Their generation is so equivocal
  To tell them would a hundred tongues require
  Or one vain wits that might a hundred tire

    But you who seek to give and merit fame
  And justly bear a critics noble name
  Be sure yourself and your own reach to know
  How far your genius taste and learning go
  Launch not beyond your depth but be discreet
  And mark that point where sense and dullness meet

    Nature to all things fixed the limits fit
  And wisely curbed proud mans pretending wit
  As on the land while here the ocean gains
  In other parts it leaves wide sandy plains
  Thus in the soul while memory prevails
  The solid power of understanding fails
  Where beams of warm imagination play
  The memorys soft figures melt away
  One science only will one genius fit
  So vast is art so narrow human wit
  Not only bounded to peculiar arts
  But oft in those confined to single parts
  Like kings we lose the conquests gained before
  By vain ambition still to make them more
  Each might his several province well command
  Would all but stoop to what they understand

    First follow nature and your judgment frame
  By her just standard which is still the same
  Unerring nature still divinely bright
  One clear unchanged and universal light
  Life force and beauty must to all impart
  At once the source and end and test of art
  Art from that fund each just supply provides
  Works without show and without pomp presides
  In some fair body thus the informing soul
  With spirits feeds with vigor fills the whole
  Each motion guides and every nerve sustains
  Itself unseen but in the effects remains
  Some to whom Heaven in wit has been profuse 
  Want as much more to turn it to its use
  For wit and judgment often are at strife
  Though meant each others aid like man and wife
  Tis more to guide than spur the muses steed
  Restrain his fury than provoke his speed
  The winged courser like a generous horse 
  Shows most true mettle when you check his course

    Those rules of old discovered not devised
  Are nature still but nature methodized
  Nature like liberty is but restrained
  By the same laws which first herself ordained

    Hear how learned Greece her useful rules indites
  When to repress and when indulge our flights
  High on Parnassus top her sons she showed 
  And pointed out those arduous paths they trod
  Held from afar aloft the immortal prize
  And urged the rest by equal steps to rise 
  Just precepts thus from great examples given
  She drew from them what they derived from Heaven
  The generous critic fanned the poets fire
  And taught the world with reason to admire
  Then criticism the muses handmaid proved
  To dress her charms and make her more beloved
  But following wits from that intention strayed
  Who could not win the mistress wooed the maid
  Against the poets their own arms they turned
  Sure to hate most the men from whom they learned
  So modern pothecaries taught the art
  By doctors bills to play the doctors part
  Bold in the practice of mistaken rules
  Prescribe apply and call their masters fools
  Some on the leaves of ancient authors prey
  Nor time nor moths eer spoil so much as they
  Some dryly plain without inventions aid
  Write dull receipts how poems may be made
  These leave the sense their learning to display
  And those explain the meaning quite away

    You then whose judgment the right course would steer
  Know well each ancients proper character
  His fable subject scope in every page
  Religion country genius of his age
  Without all these at once before your eyes
  Cavil you may but never criticise
  Be Homers works your study and delight
  Read them by day and meditate by night
  Thence form your judgment thence your maxims bring
  And trace the muses upward to their spring
  Still with itself compared his text peruse
  And let your comment be the Mantuan Muse 

    When first young Maro in his boundless mind 
  A work to outlast immortal Rome designed
  Perhaps he seemed above the critics law
  And but from natures fountain scorned to draw
  But when to examine every part he came
  Nature and Homer were he found the same
  Convinced amazed he checks the bold design
  And rules as strict his labored work confine
  As if the Stagirite oerlooked each line 
  Learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem
  To copy nature is to copy them

    Some beauties yet no precepts can declare
  For theres a happiness as well as care
  Music resembles poetryin each
  Are nameless graces which no methods teach
  And which a master hand alone can reach
  If where the rules not far enough extend
  Since rules were made but to promote their end
  Some lucky license answer to the full
  The intent proposed that license is a rule
  Thus Pegasus a nearer way to take
  May boldly deviate from the common track
  Great wits sometimes may gloriously offend
  And rise to faults true critics dare not mend
  From vulgar bounds with brave disorder part
  And snatch a grace beyond the reach of art
  Which without passing through the judgment gains
  The heart and all its end at once attains
  In prospects thus some objects please our eyes
  Which out of natures common order rise
  The shapeless rock or hanging precipice
  But though the ancients thus their rules invade
  As kings dispense with laws themselves have made
  Moderns beware or if you must offend
  Against the precept neer transgress its end
  Let it be seldom and compelled by need
  And have at least their precedent to plead
  The critic else proceeds without remorse
  Seizes your fame and puts his laws in force

    I know there are to whose presumptuous thoughts
  Those freer beauties even in them seem faults
  Some figures monstrous and misshaped appear
  Considered singly or beheld too near
  Which but proportioned to their light or place
  Due distance reconciles to form and grace
  A prudent chief not always must display
  His powers in equal ranks and fair array
  But with the occasion and the place comply
  Conceal his force nay seem sometimes to fly
  Those oft are stratagems which errors seem
  Nor is it Homer nods but we that dream 

    Still green with bays each ancient altar stands
  Above the reach of sacrilegious hands
  Secure from flames from envys fiercer rage 
  Destructive war and allinvolving age
  See from each clime the learned their incense bring
  Hear in all tongues consenting Paeans ring
  In praise so just let every voice be joined
  And fill the general chorus of mankind
  Hail bards triumphant born in happier days
  Immortal heirs of universal praise
  Whose honors with increase of ages grow
  As streams roll down enlarging as they flow
  Nations unborn your mighty names shall sound 
  And worlds applaud that must not yet be found
  Oh may some spark of your celestial fire
  The last the meanest of your sons inspire
  That on weak wings from far pursues your flights
  Glows while he reads but trembles as he writes
  To teach vain wits a science little known
  To admire superior sense and doubt their own

                                   

PART II

    Of all the causes which conspire to blind
  Mans erring judgment and misguide the mind
  What the weak head with strongest bias rules
  Is pride the neverfailing vice of fools
  Whatever nature has in worth denied
  She gives in large recruits of needful pride
  For as in bodies thus in souls we find
  What wants in blood and spirits swelled with wind
  Pride where wit fails steps in to our defense
  And fills up all the mighty void of sense
  If once right reason drives that cloud away
  Truth breaks upon us with resistless day
  Trust not yourself but your defects to know
  Make use of every friendand every foe

    A little learning is a dangerous thing
  Drink deep or taste not the Pierian spring 
  There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain
  And drinking largely sobers us again
  Fired at first sight with what the muse imparts
  In fearless youth we tempt the heights of arts
  While from the bounded level of our mind
  Short views we take nor see the lengths behind
  But more advanced behold with strange surprise
  New distant scenes of endless science rise
  So pleased at first the towering Alps we try
  Mount oer the vales and seem to tread the sky
  The eternal snows appear already passed
  And the first clouds and mountains seem the last
  But those attained we tremble to survey
  The growing labors of the lengthened way
  The increasing prospect tires our wandering eyes
  Hills peep oer hills and Alps on Alps arise

    A perfect judge will read each work of wit
  With the same spirit that its author writ
  Survey the whole nor seek slight faults to find
  Where nature moves and rapture warms the mind
  Nor lose for that malignant dull delight
  The generous pleasure to be charmed with wit
  But in such lays as neither ebb nor flow
  Correctly cold and regularly low
  That shunning faults one quiet tenor keep
  We cannot blame indeedbut we may sleep
  In wit as nature what affects our hearts
  Is not the exactness of peculiar parts
  Tis not a lip or eye we beauty call
  But the joint force and full result of all
  Thus when we view some well proportioned dome
  The worlds just wonder and even thine O Rome 
  No single parts unequally surprise
  All comes united to the admiring eyes
  No monstrous height or breadth or length appear
  The whole at once is bold and regular

  Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see
  Thinks what neer was nor is nor eer shall be
  In every work regard the writers end
  Since none can compass more than they intend
  And if the means be just the conduct true
  Applause in spite of trivial faults is due
  As men of breeding sometimes men of wit
  To avoid great errors must the less commit
  Neglect the rules each verbal critic lays
  For not to know some trifles is a praise
  Most critics fond of some subservient art
  Still make the whole depend upon a part
  They talk of principles but notions prize
  And all to one loved folly sacrifice

    Once on a time La Manchas knight they say 
  A certain bard encountering on the way
  Discoursed in terms as just with looks as sage
  As eer could Dennis of the Grecian stage 
  Concluding all were desperate sots and fools
  Who durst depart from Aristotles rules
  Our author happy in a judge so nice
  Produced his play and begged the knights advice
  Made him observe the subject and the plot
  The manners passions unities what not
  All which exact to rule were brought about
  Were but a combat in the lists left out
  What leave the combat out exclaims the knight
  Yes or we must renounce the Stagirite
  Not so by heaven he answers in a rage
  Knights squires and steeds must enter on the stage
  So vast a throng the stage can neer contain
  Then build a new or act it in a plain

    Thus critics of less judgment than caprice
  Curious not knowing not exact but nice
  Form short ideas and offend in arts
  As most in manners by a love to parts

    Some to conceit alone their taste confine
  And glittering thoughts struck out at every line
  Pleased with a work where nothings just or fit
  One glaring chaos and wild heap of wit
  Poets like painters thus unskilled to trace
  The naked nature and the living grace
  With gold and jewels cover every part
  And hide with ornaments their want of art
  True wit is nature to advantage dressed
  What oft was thought but neer so well expressed
  Something whose truth convinced at sight we find
  That gives us back the image of our mind
  As shades more sweetly recommend the light
  So modest plainness sets off sprightly wit
  For works may have more wit than does them good
  As bodies perish through excess of blood

    Others for language all their care express
  And value books as women men for dress
  Their praise is stillthe style is excellent
  The sense they humbly take upon content 
  Words are like leaves and where they most abound
  Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found
  False eloquence like the prismatic glass 
  Its gaudy colors spreads on every place
  The face of nature we no more survey
  All glares alike without distinction gay
  But true expression like the unchanging sun
  Clears and improves whateer it shines upon
  It gilds all objects but it alters none
  Expression is the dress of thought and still
  Appears more decent as more suitable
  A vile conceit in pompous words expressed
  Is like a clown in regal purple dressed
  For different styles with different subjects sort
  As several garbs with country town and court
  Some by old words to fame have made pretense
  Ancients in phrase mere moderns in their sense
  Such labored nothings in so strange a style
  Amaze the unlearned and make the learned smile
  Unlucky as Fungoso in the play 
  These sparks with awkward vanity display
  What the fine gentleman wore yesterday
  And but so mimic ancient wits at best
  As apes our grandsires in their doublets dressed
  In words as fashions the same rule will hold
  Alike fantastic if too new or old
  Be not the first by whom the new are tried
  Nor yet the last to lay the old aside

  But most by numbers judge a poets song
  And smooth or rough with them is right or wrong
  In the bright muse though thousand charms conspire
  Her voice is all these tuneful fools admire
  Who haunt Parnassus but to please their ear
  Not mend their minds as some to church repair
  Not for the doctrine but the music there
  These equal syllables alone require
  Though oft the ear the open vowels tire
  While expletives their feeble aid do join
  And ten low words oft creep in one dull line
  While they ring round the same unvaried chimes
  With sure returns of still expected rhymes
  Whereer you find the cooling western breeze
  In the next line it whispers through the trees
  If crystal streams with pleasing murmurs creep
  The readers threatened not in vain with sleep
  Then at the last and only couplet fraught
  With some unmeaning thing they call a thought
  A needless Alexandrine ends the song 
  That like a wounded snake drags its slow length along

    Leave such to tune their own dull rhymes and know
  Whats roundly smooth or languishingly slow
  And praise the easy vigor of a line
  Where Denhams strength and Wallers sweetness join 
  True ease in writing comes from art not chance
  As those move easiest who have learned to dance
  Tis not enough no harshness gives offense
  The sound must seem an echo to the sense
  Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows 
  And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows
  But when loud surges lash the sounding shore
  The hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar
  When Ajax strives some rocks vast weight to throw
  The line too labors and the words move slow
  Not so when swift Camilla scours the plain
  Flies oer the unbending corn and skims along the main 
  Hear how Timotheus varied lays surprise 
  And bid alternate passions fall and rise
  While at each change the son of Libyan Jove 
  Now burns with glory and then melts with love
  Now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow
  Now sighs steal out and tears begin to flow
  Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found
  And the worlds victor stood subdued by sound 
  The power of music all our hearts allow
  And what Timotheus was is Dryden now

    Avoid extremes and shun the fault of such
  Who still are pleased too little or too much
  At every trifle scorn to take offense
  That always shows great pride or little sense
  Those heads as stomachs are not sure the best
  Which nauseate all and nothing can digest
  Yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move
  For fools admire but men of sense approve
  As things seem large which we through mist descry
  Dullness is ever apt to magnify 

    Some foreign writers some our own despise
  The ancients only or the moderns prize
  Thus wit like faith by each man is applied
  To one small sect and all are damned beside
  Meanly they seek the blessing to confine
  And force that sun but on a part to shine
  Which not alone the southern wit sublimes
  But ripens spirits in cold northern climes
  Which from the first has shone on ages past
  Enlights the present and shall warm the last
  Though each may feel increases and decays
  And see now clearer and now darker days
  Regard not then if wit be old or new
  But blame the false and value still the true

    Some neer advance a judgment of their own
  But catch the spreading notion of the town
  They reason and conclude by precedent
  And own stale nonsense which they neer invent
  Some judge of authors names not works and then
  Nor praise nor blame the writing but the men
  Of all this servile herd the worst is he
  That in proud dullness joins with quality
  A constant critic at the great mans board
  To fetch and carry nonsense for my lord
  What woful stuff this madrigal would be
  In some starved hackney sonnetteer or me
  But let a lord once own the happy lines
  How the wit brightens how the style refines
  Before his sacred name flies every fault
  And each exalted stanza teems with thought

    The vulgar thus through imitation err
  As oft the learned by being singular
  So much they scorn the crowd that if the throng
  By chance go right they purposely go wrong
  So schismatics the plain believers quit
  And are but damned for having too much wit
  Some praise at morning what they blame at night
  But always think the last opinion right
  A muse by these is like a mistress used
  This hour shes idolized the next abused
  While their weak heads like towns unfortified
  Twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side
  Ask them the cause theyre wiser still they say
  And still tomorrows wiser than today
  We think our fathers fools so wise we grow
  Our wiser sons no doubt will think us so
  Once schooldivines this zealous isle oerspread
  Who knew most sentences was deepest read 
  Faith Gospel all seemed made to be disputed
  And none had sense enough to be confuted
  Scotists and Thomists now in peace remain 
  Amidst their kindred cobwebs in Duck Lane 
  If faith itself has different dresses worn
  What wonder modes in wit should take their turn
  Oft leaving what is natural and fit
  The current folly proves the ready wit
  And authors think their reputation safe
  Which lives as long as fools are pleased to laugh

    Some valuing those of their own side or mind
  Still make themselves the measure of mankind
  Fondly we think we honor merit then
  When we but praise ourselves in other men
  Parties in wit attend on those of state
  And public faction doubles private hate
  Pride malice folly against Dryden rose
  In various shapes of parsons critics beaux 
  But sense survived when merry jests were past
  For rising merit will buoy up at last
  Might he return and bless once more our eyes
  New Blackmores and new Millbourns must arise 
  Nay should great Homer lift his awful head
  Zoilus again would start up from the dead 
  Envy will merit as its shade pursue
  But like a shadow proves the substance true
  For envied wit like Sol eclipsed makes known
  The opposing bodys grossness not its own
  When first that sun too powerful beams displays
  It draws up vapors which obscure its rays
  But even those clouds at last adorn its way
  Reflect new glories and augment the day

    Be thou the first true merit to befriend
  His praise is lost who stays till all commend
  Short is the date alas of modern rhymes
  And tis but just to let them live betimes
  No longer now that golden age appears
  When patriarch wits survived a thousand years 
  Now length of fame our second life is lost
  And bare threescore is all even that can boast
  Our sons their fathers failing language see
  And such as Chaucer is shall Dryden be
  So when the faithful pencil has designed
  Some bright idea of the masters mind
  Where a new world leaps out at his command
  And ready nature waits upon his hand
  When the ripe colors soften and unite
  And sweetly melt into just shade and light
  When mellowing years their full perfection give
  And each bold figure just begins to live
  The treacherous colors the fair art betray
  And all the bright creation fades away

    Unhappy wit like most mistaken things
  Atones not for that envy which it brings
  In youth alone its empty praise we boast
  But soon the short lived vanity is lost
  Like some fair flower the early spring supplies
  That gayly blooms but even in blooming dies
  What is this wit which must our cares employ
  The owners wife that other men enjoy
  Then most our trouble still when most admired
  And still the more we give the more required
  Whose fame with pains we guard but lose with ease
  Sure some to vex but never all to please
  Tis what the vicious fear the virtuous shun
  By fools tis hated and by knaves undone

    If wit so much from ignorance undergo
  Ah let not learning too commence its foe
  Of old those met rewards who could excel
  And such were praised who but endeavored well
  Though triumphs were to generals only due
  Crowns were reserved to grace the soldiers too
  Now they who reach Parnassus lofty crown
  Employ their pains to spurn some others down
  And while selflove each jealous writer rules
  Contending wits become the sport of fools
  But still the worst with most regret commend
  For each ill author is as bad a friend
  To what base ends and by what abject ways
  Are mortals urged through sacred lust of praise
  Ah neer so dire a thirst of glory boast
  Nor in the critic let the man be lost
  Goodnature and good sense must ever join
  To err is human to forgive divine

    But if in noble minds some dregs remain
  Not yet purged off of spleen and sour disdain
  Discharge that rage on more provoking crimes
  Nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times
  No pardon vile obscenity should find
  Though wit and art conspire to move your mind
  But dullness with obscenity must prove
  As shameful sure as impotence in love
  In the fat age of pleasure wealth and ease
  Sprung the rank weed and thrived with large increase
  When love was all an easy monarchs care 
  Seldom at council never in a war
  Jilts ruled the state and statesmen farces writ
  Nay wits had pensions and young lords had wit
  The fair sat panting at a courtiers play
  And not a mask went unimproved away 
  The modest fan was lifted up no more
  And virgins smiled at what they blushed before
  The following license of a foreign reign 
  Did all the dregs of bold Socinus drain 
  Then unbelieving priests reformed the nation
  And taught more pleasant methods of salvation
  Where Heavens free subjects might their rights dispute
  Lest God himself should seem too absolute
  Pulpits their sacred satire learned to spare
  And vice admired to find a flatterer there
  Encouraged thus wits Titans braved the skies 
  And the press groaned with licensed blasphemies
  These monsters critics with your darts engage
  Here point your thunder and exhaust your rage
  Yet shun their fault who scandalously nice
  Will needs mistake an author into vice
  All seems infected that the infected spy
  As all looks yellow to the jaundiced eye

                                   


PART III

    Learn then what morals critics ought to show
  For tis but half a judges task to know
  Tis not enough taste judgment learning join
  In all you speak let truth and candor shine
  That not alone what to your sense is due
  All may allow but seek your friendship too

    Be silent always when you doubt your sense
  And speak though sure with seeming diffidence
  Some positive persisting fops we know
  Who if once wrong will needs be always so
  But you with pleasure own your errors past
  And make each day a critique on the last

    Tis not enough your counsel still be true
  Blunt truths more mischief than nice falsehoods do
  Men must be taught as if you taught them not
  And things unknown proposed as things forgot
  Without good breeding truth is disapproved
  That only makes superior sense beloved

    Be niggards of advice on no pretense
  For the worst avarice is that of sense
  With mean complacence neer betray your trust
  Nor be so civil as to prove unjust
  Fear not the anger of the wise to raise
  Those best can bear reproof who merit praise

    Twere well might critics still this freedom take
  But Appius reddens at each word you speak 
  And stares tremendous with a threatening eye
  Like some fierce tyrant in old tapestry
  Fear most to tax an honorable fool
  Whose right it is uncensured to be dull
  Such without wit are poets when they please
  As without learning they can take degrees
  Leave dangerous truths to unsuccessful satires
  And flattery to fulsome dedicators
  Whom when they praise the world believes no more
  Than when they promise to give scribbling oer

    Tis best sometimes your censure to restrain
  And charitably let the dull be vain
  Your silence there is better than your spite
  For who can rail so long as they can write
  Still humming on their drowsy course they keep
  And lashed so long like tops are lashed asleep
  False steps but help them to renew the race
  As after stumbling jades will mend their pace
  What crowds of these impenitently bold
  In sounds and jingling syllables grown old
  Still run on poets in a raging vein
  Even to the dregs and squeezing of the brain
  Strain out the last dull droppings of their sense
  And rhyme with all the rage of impotence

    Such shameless bards we have and yet tis true
  There are as mad abandoned critics too
  The bookful blockhead ignorantly read
  With loads of learned lumber in his head
  With his own tongue still edifies his ears
  And always listening to himself appears
  All books he reads and all he reads assails
  From Drydens Fables down to Durfeys Tales 
  With him most authors steal their works or buy
  Garth did not write his own Dispensary 
  Name a new play and hes the poets friend
  Nay showed his faultsbut when would poets mend
  No place so sacred from such fops is barred
  Nor is Pauls Church more safe than Pauls Churchyard 
  Nay fly to altars there theyll talk you dead
  For fools rush in where angels fear to tread
  Distrustful sense with modest caution speaks
  It still looks home and short excursions makes
  But rattling nonsense in full volleys breaks
  And never shocked and never turned aside
  Bursts out resistless with a thundering tide

    But wheres the man who counsel can bestow
  Still pleased to teach and yet not proud to know
  Unbiased or by favor or in spite
  Not dully prepossessed nor blindly right
  Though learned wellbred and though well bred sincere
  Modestly bold and humanly severe
  Who to a friend his faults can freely show
  And gladly praise the merit of a foe
  Blessed with a taste exact yet unconfined
  A knowledge both of books and human kind
  Generous converse a soul exempt from pride
  And love to praise with reason on his side

    Such once were critics such the happy few
  Athens and Rome in better ages knew
  The mighty Stagirite first left the shore 
  Spread all his sails and durst the deeps explore
  He steered securely and discovered far
  Led by the light of the Maeonian star 
  Poets a race long unconfined and free
  Still fond and proud of savage liberty
  Received his laws and stood convinced twas fit
  Who conquered nature should preside oer wit 

    Horace still charms with graceful negligence
  And without method talks us into sense
  Will like a friend familiarly convey
  The truest notions in the easiest way
  He who supreme in judgment as in wit
  Might boldly censure as he boldly writ
  Yet judged with coolness though he sung with fire
  His precepts teach but what his works inspire
  Our critics take a contrary extreme
  They judge with fury but they write with phlegm
  Nor suffers Horace more in wrong translations
  By wits than critics in as wrong quotations

    See Dionysius Homers thoughts refine 
  And call new beauties forth from every line

    Fancy and art in gay Petronius please 
  The scholars learning with the courtiers ease

    In grave Quintilians copious work we find 
  The justest rules and clearest method joined
  Thus useful arms in magazines we place
  All ranged in order and disposed with grace
  But less to please the eye than arm the hand
  Still fit for use and ready at command

    Thee bold Longinus all the Nine inspire 
  And bless their critic with a poets fire
  An ardent judge who zealous in his trust
  With warmth gives sentence yet is always just
  Whose own example strengthens all his laws
  And is himself that great sublime he draws

    Thus long succeeding critics justly reigned
  License repressed and useful laws ordained
  Learning and Rome alike in empire grew
  And arts still followed where her eagles flew
  From the same foes at last both felt their doom
  And the same age saw learning fall and Rome 
  With tyranny then superstition joined
  As that the body this enslaved the mind
  Much was believed but little understood
  And to be dull was construed to be good
  A second deluge learning thus oerrun
  And the monks finished what the Goths begun 

    At length Erasmus that great injured name 
  The glory of the priesthood and the shame
  Stemmed the wild torrent of a barbarous age
  And drove those holy Vandals off the stage 

    But see each muse in Leos golden days 
  Starts from her trance and trims her withered bays
  Romes ancient genius oer its ruins spread
  Shakes off the dust and rears his reverent head
  Then sculpture and her sister arts revive
  Stones leaped to form and rocks began to live
  With sweeter notes each rising temple rung
  A Raphael painted and a Vida sung 
  Immortal Vida on whose honored brow
  The poets bays and critics ivy grow
  Cremona now shall ever boast thy name
  As next in place to Mantua next in fame

    But soon by impious arms from Latium chased
  Their ancient bounds the banished muses passed
  Thence arts oer all the northern world advance
  But criticlearning flourished most in France
  The rules a nation born to serve obeys
  And Boileau still in right of Horace sways 
  But we brave Britons foreign laws despised
  And kept unconquered and uncivilized
  Fierce for the liberties of wit and bold
  We still defied the Romans as of old
  Yet some there were among the sounder few
  Of those who less presumed and better knew
  Who durst assert the juster ancient cause
  And here restored wits fundamental laws
  Such was the muse whose rule and practice tell
  Natures chief masterpiece is writing well
  Such was Roscommon not more learned than good
  With manners generous as his noble blood
  To him the wit of Greece and Rome was known
  And every authors merit but his own
  Such late was Walshthe muses judge and friend
  Who justly knew to blame or to commend
  To failings mild but zealous for desert
  The clearest head and the sincerest heart
  This humble praise lamented shade receive
  This praise at least a grateful muse may give
  The muse whose early voice you taught to sing
  Prescribed her heights and pruned her tender wing
  Her guide now lost no more attempts to rise
  But in low numbers short excursions tries
  Content if hence the unlearned their wants may view
  The learned reflect on what before they knew
  Careless of censure nor too fond of fame
  Still pleased to praise yet not afraid to blame
  Averse alike to flatter or offend
  Not free from faults nor yet too vain to mend

                                   






LINE NOTES


Line  Wit is used in the poem in a great variety of
meanings  Here it seems to mean genius or fancy
 in line  a man of fancy  in line  the
understanding or powers of the mind  in line  it
means judgment

Line  SchoolsDifferent systems of doctrine or
philosophy as taught by particular teachers

Line  MaeviusAn insignificant poet of the Augustan age
ridiculed by Virgil in his third Eclogue and by Horace in his tenth
Epode

Lines   There is here a slight inaccuracy or inconsistency
since wit has a different meaning in the two lines in  it means
fancy in  judgment

Line  The winged courserPegasus a winged horse which
sprang from the blood of Medusa when Perseus cut off her head As soon
as born he left the earth and flew up to heaven or according to Ovid
took up his abode on Mount Helicon and was always associated with the
Muses

Line  ParnassusA mountain of Phocis which received
its name from Parnassus the son of Neptune and was sacred to the
Muses Apollo and Bacchus

Line  Equal stepsSteps equal to the undertaking

Line  The Mantuan MuseVirgil called Maro in the next
line his full name being Virgilius Publius Maro born near Mantua
 BC

Lines  It is said that Virgil first intended to write a poem
on the Alban and Roman affairs which he found beyond his powers and
then he imitated Homer

  Cum canerem reges et proelia Cynthius aurem
  VellitVirg Ecl VI

Line  The StagiriteAristotle born at the Greek town of
Stageira on the Strymonic Gulf Gulf of Contessa in Turkey  BC
whose treatises on Rhetoric and the Art of Poetry were the earliest
development of a Philosophy of Criticism and still continue to be
studied

The poet contradicts himself with regard to the principle he is here
laying down in lines  where he laughs at Dennis for

  Concluding all were desperate sots and fools
  Who durst depart from Aristotles rules

Line  Homer nodsQuandoque bonus dormitat
Homerus even the good Homer nodsHorace Epistola ad
Pisones 

Lines   Secure from flamesThe poet probably
alludes to such fires as those in which the Alexandrine and Palatine
Libraries were destroyed From envys fiercer rageProbably he
alludes to the writings of such men as Maevius see note to line  and
Zoilus a sophist and grammarian of Amphipolis who distinguished
himself by his criticism on Isocrates Plato and Homer receiving the
nickname of Homeromastic chastiser of Homer Destructive
warProbably an allusion to the irruption of the barbarians into
the south of Europe And allinvolving age that is time This is
usually explained as an allusion to the long reign of ignorance and
superstition in the cloisters but it is surely farfetched and more
than the language will bear

Lines  

  Round the whole world this dreaded name shall sound
   And reach to worlds that must not yet be foundCOWLEY

Line  The Pierian springA fountain in Pieria a district round
Mount Olympus and the native country of the Muses

Line  And even thine O RomeThe dome of St Peters
Church designed by Michael Angelo

Line  La Manchas KnightDon Quixote a fictitious
Spanish knight the hero of a book written  by Cervantes a
Spanish writer

Line  Dennis the son of a saddler in London born 
was a mediocre writer and rather better critic of the time with whom
Pope came a good deal into collision Addisons tragedy of Cato
for which Pope had written a prologue had been attacked by Dennis
Pope to defend Addison wrote an imaginary report pretending to be
written by a notorious quack maddoctor of the day entitled The
Narrative of Dr Robert Norris on the Frenz of F D Dennis replied
to it by his Character of Mr Pope Ultimately Pope gave him a
place in his Dunciad and wrote a prologue for his benefit

Line  On contentOn trust a common use of the word in
Popes time

Lines   Prismatic glassA glass prism by which
light is refracted and the component rays which are of different
colors being refracted at different angles show what is called a
spectrum or series of colored bars in the order violet indigo blue
green yellow orange red

Line  FungosoOne of the characters in Ben Jonsons
Every Man out of his Humor who assumed the dress and tried to
pass himself off for another

Line  AlexandrineA line of twelve syllables so called
from a French poem on the Life of Alexander the Great written in that
meter The poet gives a remarkable example in the next line

Line  Sir John Denham a poet of the time of Charles I 
His verse is characterized by considerable smoothness and ingenuity of
rhythm with here and there a passage of some forceEdmund Waller
 is celebrated as one of the refiners of English poetry
His rank among English poets however is very subordinate

Line  ZephyrZephyrus the west wind personified by the
poets and made the most mild and gentle of the sylvan deities

Lines  In this passage the poet obviously intended to make
the sound seem an echo to the sense The success of the attempt has
not been very complete except in the second two lines expressing the
dash and roar of the waves and in the last two expressing the skimming
continuous motion of Camilla What he refers to is the onomatopoeia of
Homer and Virgil in the passages alluded to Ajax the son of
Telamon was next to Achilles the bravest of all the Greeks in the
Trojan war When the Greeks were challenged by Hector he was chosen
their champion and it was in their encounter that he seized a huge stone
and hurled it at Hector

Thus rendered by Pope himself

  Then Ajax seized the fragment of a rock
  Applied each nerve and swinging round on high
  With force tempestuous let the ruin fly
  The huge stone thundering through his buckler broke

Camilla queen of the Volsci was brought up in the woods and
according to Virgil was swifter than the winds She led an army to
assist Turnus against Aeneas

  Dura pan cursuque pedum praevertere ventos
   Illa vel intactae segetis per summa volaret
   Gramina nec teneras cursu laesisset aristas
   Vel mare per medium fluctu suspensa tumenti
   Ferret iter celeres nec tingeret aequore plantas
                                        Aen vii 

Thus rendered by Dryden

  Outstripped the winds in speed upon the plain
  Flew oer the fields nor hurt the bearded grain
  She swept the seas and as she skimmed along
  Her flying feet unbathed on billows hung

Lines  This passage refers to Drydens ode Alexanders
Feast or The Power of Music Timotheus mentioned in it was
a musician of Boeotia a favorite of Alexanders not the great musician
Timotheus who died before Alexander was born unless indeed Dryden
have confused the two

Line  The son of Libyan JoveA title arrogated to
himself by Alexander

Line  Dullness here seems to be incorrectly used
Ignorance is apt to magnify but dullness reposes in stolid
indifference

Line  SentencesPassages from the Fathers of the Church
who were regarded as decisive authorities on all disputed points of
doctrine

Line  ScotistsThe disciples of Duns Scotus one of the
most famous and influential of the scholastics of the fourteenth
century who was opposed to Thomas Aquinas  another famous
scholastic regarding the doctrines of grace and the freedom of the
will but especially the immaculate conception of the Virgin The
followers of the latter were called Thomists between whom and the
Scotists bitter controversies were carried on

Line  Duck LaneA place near Smithfield where old
books were sold The cobwebs were kindred to the works of these
controversialists because their arguments were intricate and obscure
Scotus is said to have demolished two hundred objections to the doctrine
of the immaculate conception and established it by a cloud of proofs

Line  ParsonsThis is an allusion to Jeremy Collier
the author of A Short View etc of the English Stage Critics
beauxThis to the Duke of Buckingham the author of The
Rehearsal

Line  Blackmore Sir Richard  one of the
court physicians and the writer of a great deal of worthless poetry He
attacked the dramatists of the time generally and Dryden individually
and is the Quack Maurus of Drydens prologue to The Secular
Masque Millbourn Rev Luke who criticised Dryden which
criticism although sneered at by Pope is allowed to have been judicious
and decisive

Line  Zoilus See note on line 

Line  Patriarch witsPerhaps an allusion to the great
age to which the antediluvian patriarchs of the Bible lived

Line  An easy monarchCharles II

Line  At that time ladies went to the theater in masks

Line  A foreign reignThe reign of the foreigner
William III

Line  SocinusThe reaction from the fanaticism of the
Puritans who held extreme notions of free grace and satisfaction by
resolving all Christianity into morality led the way to the
introduction of Socinianism the most prominent feature of which is the
denial of the existence of the Trinity

Line  Wits TitansThe Titans in Greek mythology
were the children of Uranus heaven and Gaea earth and of gigantic
size They engaged in a conflict with Zeus the king of heaven which
lasted ten years They were completely defeated and hurled down into a
dungeon below Tartarus Very often they are confounded with the Giants
as has apparently been done here by Pope These were a later progeny of
the same parents and in revenge for what had been done to the Titans
conspired to dethrone Zeus In order to scale heaven they piled Mount
Ossa upon Pelion and would have succeeded in their attempt if Zeus had
not called in the assistance of his son Hercules

Line  AppiusHe refers to Dennis see note to verse
 who had published a tragedy called Appius and Virginia He
retaliated for these remarks by coarse personalities upon Pope in his
criticism of this poem

Line  Durfeys TalesThomas DUrfey the author in
the reign of Charles II of a sequel in five acts of The
Rehearsal a series of sonnets entitled Pills to Purge
Melancholy the Tales here alluded to etc He was a very inferior

eminent physician and a poet of considerable reputation He is best known

Line  Quintilian born in Spain  AD was a celebrated
teacher of rhetoric and oratory at Rome His greatwork is De
Institutione Oratorica a complete system of rhetoric which is here
referred to

Line  Longinus a Platonic philosopher and famous
rhetorician born either in Syria or at Athens about  AD was
probably the best critic of antiquity From his immense knowledge he
was called a living library and walking museum hence the poet speaks
of him as inspired by all the NineMuses that is These were

Comic Poetry and Festivals Melpomene of Tragedy Terpsichore of

freely shared with anyone For forty years he produced and
distributed Project Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support
