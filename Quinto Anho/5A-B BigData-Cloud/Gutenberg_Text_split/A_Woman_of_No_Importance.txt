FIRST ACT


                                  SCENE

              Lawn in front of the terrace at Hunstanton

SIR JOHN and LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT MISS WORSLEY on chairs under
large yew tree

LADY CAROLINE  I believe this is the first English country house you
have stayed at Miss Worsley

HESTER  Yes Lady Caroline

LADY CAROLINE  You have no country houses I am told in America

HESTER  We have not many

LADY CAROLINE  Have you any country  What we should call country

HESTER  Smiling  We have the largest country in the world Lady
Caroline  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as
big as France and England put together

LADY CAROLINE  Ah you must find it very draughty I should fancy
To SIR JOHN  John you should have your muffler  What is the use of
my always knitting mufflers for you if you wont wear them

SIR JOHN  I am quite warm Caroline I assure you

LADY CAROLINE  I think not John  Well you couldnt come to a more
charming place than this Miss Worsley though the house is excessively
damp quite unpardonably damp and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a
little lax about the people she asks down here  To SIR JOHN  Jane
mixes too much  Lord Illingworth of course is a man of high
distinction  It is a privilege to meet him  And that member of
Parliament Mr Kettle

SIR JOHN  Kelvil my love Kelvil

LADY CAROLINE  He must be quite respectable  One has never heard his
name before in the whole course of ones life which speaks volumes for a
man nowadays  But Mrs Allonby is hardly a very suitable person

HESTER  I dislike Mrs Allonby  I dislike her more than I can say

LADY CAROLINE  I am not sure Miss Worsley that foreigners like
yourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people they are
invited to meet  Mrs Allonby is very well born  She is a niece of Lord
Brancasters  It is said of course that she ran away twice before she
was married  But you know how unfair people often are  I myself dont
believe she ran away more than once

HESTER  Mr Arbuthnot is very charming

LADY CAROLINE  Ah yes the young man who has a post in a bank  Lady
Hunstanton is most kind in asking him here and Lord Illingworth seems to
have taken quite a fancy to him  I am not sure however that Jane is
right in taking him out of his position  In my young days Miss Worsley
one never met any one in society who worked for their living  It was not
considered the thing

HESTER  In America those are the people we respect most

LADY CAROLINE  I have no doubt of it

HESTER  Mr Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature  He is so simple so
sincere  He has one of the most beautiful natures I have ever come
across  It is a privilege to meet him

LADY CAROLINE  It is not customary in England Miss Worsley for a young
lady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex
English women conceal their feelings till after they are married  They
show them then

HESTER  Do you in England allow no friendship to exist between a young
man and a young girl

Enter LADY HUNSTANTON followed by Footman with shawls and a
cushion

LADY CAROLINE  We think it very inadvisable  Jane I was just saying
what a pleasant party you have asked us to meet  You have a wonderful
power of selection  It is quite a gift

LADY HUNSTANTON  Dear Caroline how kind of you  I think we all do fit
in very nicely together  And I hope our charming American visitor will
carry back pleasant recollections of our English country life  To
Footman  The cushion there Francis  And my shawl  The Shetland
Get the Shetland  Exit Footman for shawl

Enter GERALD ARBUTHNOT

GERALD  Lady Hunstanton I have such good news to tell you  Lord
Illingworth has just offered to make me his secretary

LADY HUNSTANTON  His secretary  That is good news indeed Gerald  It
means a very brilliant future in store for you  Your dear mother will be
delighted  I really must try and induce her to come up here tonight
Do you think she would Gerald  I know how difficult it is to get her to
go anywhere

GERALD  Oh  I am sure she would Lady Hunstanton if she knew Lord
Illingworth had made me such an offer

Enter Footman with shawl

LADY HUNSTANTON  I will write and tell her about it and ask her to come
up and meet him  To Footman  Just wait Francis  Writes
letter

LADY CAROLINE  That is a very wonderful opening for so young a man as
you are Mr Arbuthnot

GERALD  It is indeed Lady Caroline  I trust I shall be able to show
myself worthy of it

LADY CAROLINE  I trust so

GERALD  To HESTER  You have not congratulated me yet Miss
Worsley

HESTER  Are you very pleased about it

GERALD  Of course I am  It means everything to methings that were out
of the reach of hope before may be within hopes reach now

HESTER  Nothing should be out of the reach of hope  Life is a hope

LADY HUNSTANTON  I fancy Caroline that Diplomacy is what Lord
Illingworth is aiming at  I heard that he was offered Vienna  But that
may not be true

LADY CAROLINE  I dont think that England should be represented abroad
by an unmarried man Jane  It might lead to complications

LADY HUNSTANTON  You are too nervous Caroline  Believe me you are too
nervous  Besides Lord Illingworth may marry any day  I was in hopes he
would have married lady Kelso  But I believe he said her family was too
large  Or was it her feet  I forget which  I regret it very much  She
was made to be an ambassadors wife

LADY CAROLINE  She certainly has a wonderful faculty of remembering
peoples names and forgetting their faces

LADY HUNSTANTON  Well that is very natural Caroline is it not  To
Footman  Tell Henry to wait for an answer  I have written a line to
your dear mother Gerald to tell her your good news and to say she
really must come to dinner

Exit Footman

GERALD  That is awfully kind of you Lady Hunstanton  To HESTER
Will you come for a stroll Miss Worsley

HESTER  With pleasure  Exit with GERALD

LADY HUNSTANTON  I am very much gratified at Gerald Arbuthnots good
fortune  He is quite a protg of mine  And I am particularly pleased
that Lord Illingworth should have made the offer of his own accord
without my suggesting anything  Nobody likes to be asked favours  I
remember poor Charlotte Pagden making herself quite unpopular one season
because she had a French governess she wanted to recommend to every one

LADY CAROLINE  I saw the governess Jane  Lady Pagden sent her to me
It was before Eleanor came out  She was far too goodlooking to be in
any respectable household  I dont wonder Lady Pagden was so anxious to
get rid of her

LADY HUNSTANTON  Ah that explains it

LADY CAROLINE  John the grass is too damp for you  You had better go
and put on your overshoes at once

SIR JOHN  I am quite comfortable Caroline I assure you

LADY CAROLINE  You must allow me to be the best judge of that John
Pray do as I tell you

SIR JOHN gets up and goes off

LADY HUNSTANTON  You spoil him Caroline you do indeed

Enter MRS ALLONBY and LADY STUTFIELD

To MRS ALLONBY  Well dear I hope you like the park  It is said
to be well timbered

MRS ALLONBY  The trees are wonderful Lady Hunstanton

LADY STUTFIELD  Quite quite wonderful

MRS ALLONBY  But somehow I feel sure that if I lived in the country
for six months I should become so unsophisticated that no one would take
the slightest notice of me

LADY HUNSTANTON  I assure you dear that the country has not that
effect at all  Why it was from Melthorpe which is only two miles from
here that Lady Belton eloped with Lord Fethersdale  I remember the
occurrence perfectly  Poor Lord Belton died three days afterwards of
joy or gout  I forget which  We had a large party staying here at the
time so we were all very much interested in the whole affair

MRS ALLONBY  I think to elope is cowardly  Its running away from
danger  And danger has become so rare in modern life

LADY CAROLINE  As far as I can make out the young women of the present
day seem to make it the sole object of their lives to be always playing
with fire

MRS ALLONBY  The one advantage of playing with fire Lady Caroline is
that one never gets even singed  It is the people who dont know how to
play with it who get burned up

LADY STUTFIELD  Yes I see that  It is very very helpful

LADY HUNSTANTON  I dont know how the world would get on with such a
theory as that dear Mrs Allonby

LADY STUTFIELD  Ah  The world was made for men and not for women

MRS ALLONBY  Oh dont say that Lady Stutfield  We have a much better
time than they have  There are far more things forbidden to us than are
forbidden to them

LADY STUTFIELD  Yes that is quite quite true  I had not thought of
that

Enter SIR JOHN and MR KELVIL

LADY HUNSTANTON  Well Mr Kelvil have you got through your work

KELVIL  I have finished my writing for the day Lady Hunstanton  It has
been an arduous task  The demands on the time of a public man are very
heavy nowadays very heavy indeed  And I dont think they meet with
adequate recognition

LADY CAROLINE  John have you got your overshoes on

SIR JOHN  Yes my love

LADY CAROLINE  I think you had better come over here John  It is more
sheltered

SIR JOHN  I am quite comfortable Caroline

LADY CAROLINE  I think not John  You had better sit beside me  SIR
JOHN rises and goes across

LADY STUTFIELD  And what have you been writing about this morning Mr
Kelvil

KELVIL  On the usual subject Lady Stutfield  On Purity

LADY STUTFIELD  That must be such a very very interesting thing to
write about

KELVIL  It is the one subject of really national importance nowadays
Lady Stutfield  I purpose addressing my constituents on the question
before Parliament meets  I find that the poorer classes of this country
display a marked desire for a higher ethical standard

LADY STUTFIELD  How quite quite nice of them

LADY CAROLINE  Are you in favour of women taking part in politics Mr
Kettle

SIR JOHN  Kelvil my love Kelvil

KELVIL  The growing influence of women is the one reassuring thing in
our political life Lady Caroline  Women are always on the side of
morality public and private

LADY STUTFIELD  It is so very very gratifying to hear you say that

LADY HUNSTANTON  Ah yesthe moral qualities in womenthat is the
important thing  I am afraid Caroline that dear Lord Illingworth
doesnt value the moral qualities in women as much as he should

Enter LORD ILLINGWORTH

LADY STUTFIELD  The world says that Lord Illingworth is very very
wicked

LORD ILLINGWORTH  But what world says that Lady Stutfield  It must be
the next world  This world and I are on excellent terms  Sits down
beside MRS ALLONBY

LADY STUTFIELD  Every one I know says you are very very wicked

LORD ILLINGWORTH  It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about
nowadays saying things against one behind ones back that are absolutely
and entirely true

LADY HUNSTANTON  Dear Lord Illingworth is quite hopeless Lady
Stutfield  I have given up trying to reform him  It would take a Public
Company with a Board of Directors and a paid Secretary to do that  But
you have the secretary already Lord Illingworth havent you  Gerald
Arbuthnot has told us of his good fortune it is really most kind of you

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Oh dont say that Lady Hunstanton  Kind is a
dreadful word  I took a great fancy to young Arbuthnot the moment I met
him and hell be of considerable use to me in something I am foolish
enough to think of doing

LADY HUNSTANTON  He is an admirable young man  And his mother is one of
my dearest friends  He has just gone for a walk with our pretty
American  She is very pretty is she not

LADY CAROLINE  Far too pretty  These American girls carry off all the
good matches  Why cant they stay in their own country  They are always
telling us it is the Paradise of women

LORD ILLINGWORTH  It is Lady Caroline  That is why like Eve they are
so extremely anxious to get out of it

LADY CAROLINE  Who are Miss Worsleys parents

LORD ILLINGWORTH  American women are wonderfully clever in concealing
their parents

LADY HUNSTANTON  My dear Lord Illingworth what do you mean  Miss
Worsley Caroline is an orphan  Her father was a very wealthy
millionaire or philanthropist or both I believe who entertained my son
quite hospitably when he visited Boston  I dont know how he made his
money originally

KELVIL  I fancy in American dry goods

LADY HUNSTANTON  What are American dry goods

LORD ILLINGWORTH  American novels

LADY HUNSTANTON  How very singular    Well from whatever source her
large fortune came I have a great esteem for Miss Worsley  She dresses
exceedingly well  All Americans do dress well  They get their clothes
in Paris

MRS ALLONBY  They say Lady Hunstanton that when good Americans die
they go to Paris

LADY HUNSTANTON  Indeed  And when bad Americans die where do they go
to

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Oh they go to America

KELVIL  I am afraid you dont appreciate America Lord Illingworth  It
is a very remarkable country especially considering its youth

LORD ILLINGWORTH  The youth of America is their oldest tradition  It
has been going on now for three hundred years  To hear them talk one
would imagine they were in their first childhood  As far as civilisation
goes they are in their second

KELVIL  There is undoubtedly a great deal of corruption in American
politics  I suppose you allude to that

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I wonder

LADY HUNSTANTON  Politics are in a sad way everywhere I am told  They
certainly are in England  Dear Mr Cardew is ruining the country  I
wonder Mrs Cardew allows him  I am sure Lord Illingworth you dont
think that uneducated people should be allowed to have votes

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I think they are the only people who should

KELVIL  Do you take no side then in modern politics Lord Illingworth

LORD ILLINGWORTH  One should never take sides in anything Mr Kelvil
Taking sides is the beginning of sincerity and earnestness follows
shortly afterwards and the human being becomes a bore  However the
House of Commons really does very little harm  You cant make people
good by Act of Parliamentthat is something

KELVIL  You cannot deny that the House of Commons has always shown great
sympathy with the sufferings of the poor

LORD ILLINGWORTH  That is its special vice  That is the special vice of
the age  One should sympathise with the joy the beauty the colour of
life  The less said about lifes sores the better Mr Kelvil

KELVIL  Still our East End is a very important problem

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Quite so  It is the problem of slavery  And we are
trying to solve it by amusing the slaves

LADY HUNSTANTON  Certainly a great deal may be done by means of cheap
entertainments as you say Lord Illingworth  Dear Dr Daubeny our
rector here provides with the assistance of his curates really
admirable recreations for the poor during the winter  And much good may
be done by means of a magic lantern or a missionary or some popular
amusement of that kind

LADY CAROLINE  I am not at all in favour of amusements for the poor
Jane  Blankets and coals are sufficient  There is too much love of
pleasure amongst the upper classes as it is  Health is what we want in
modern life  The tone is not healthy not healthy at all

KELVIL  You are quite right Lady Caroline

LADY CAROLINE  I believe I am usually right

MRS ALLONBY  Horrid word health

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Silliest word in our language and one knows so well
the popular idea of health  The English country gentleman galloping
after a foxthe unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable

KELVIL  May I ask Lord Illingworth if you regard the House of Lords as
a better institution than the House of Commons

LORD ILLINGWORTH  A much better institution of course  We in the House
of Lords are never in touch with public opinion  That makes us a
civilised body

KELVIL  Are you serious in putting forward such a view

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Quite serious Mr Kelvil  To MRS ALLONBY
Vulgar habit that is people have nowadays of asking one after one has
given them an idea whether one is serious or not  Nothing is serious
except passion  The intellect is not a serious thing and never has
been  It is an instrument on which one plays that is all  The only
serious form of intellect I know is the British intellect  And on the
British intellect the illiterates play the drum

LADY HUNSTANTON  What are you saying Lord Illingworth about the drum

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I was merely talking to Mrs Allonby about the leading
articles in the London newspapers

LADY HUNSTANTON  But do you believe all that is written in the
newspapers

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I do  Nowadays it is only the unreadable that occurs
Rises with MRS ALLONBY

LADY HUNSTANTON  Are you going Mrs Allonby

MRS ALLONBY  Just as far as the conservatory  Lord Illingworth told me
this morning that there was an orchid there as beautiful as the seven
deadly sins

LADY HUNSTANTON  My dear I hope there is nothing of the kind  I will
certainly speak to the gardener

Exit MRS ALLONBY and LORD ILLINGWORTH

LADY CAROLINE  Remarkable type Mrs Allonby

LADY HUNSTANTON  She lets her clever tongue run away with her sometimes

LADY CAROLINE  Is that the only thing Jane Mrs Allonby allows to run
away with her

LADY HUNSTANTON  I hope so Caroline I am sure

Enter LORD ALFRED

Dear Lord Alfred do join us  LORD ALFRED sits down beside LADY
STUTFIELD

LADY CAROLINE  You believe good of every one Jane  It is a great
fault

LADY STUTFIELD  Do you really really think Lady Caroline that one
should believe evil of every one

LADY CAROLINE  I think it is much safer to do so Lady Stutfield
Until of course people are found out to be good  But that requires a
great deal of investigation nowadays

LADY STUTFIELD  But there is so much unkind scandal in modern life

LADY CAROLINE  Lord Illingworth remarked to me last night at dinner that
the basis of every scandal is an absolutely immoral certainty

KELVIL  Lord Illingworth is of course a very brilliant man but he
seems to me to be lacking in that fine faith in the nobility and purity
of life which is so important in this century

LADY STUTFIELD  Yes quite quite important is it not

KELVIL  He gives me the impression of a man who does not appreciate the
beauty of our English homelife  I would say that he was tainted with
foreign ideas on the subject

LADY STUTFIELD  There is nothing nothing like the beauty of homelife
is there

KELVIL  It is the mainstay of our moral system in England Lady
Stutfield  Without it we would become like our neighbours

LADY STUTFIELD  That would be so so sad would it not

KELVIL  I am afraid too that Lord Illingworth regards woman simply as
a toy  Now I have never regarded woman as a toy  Woman is the
intellectual helpmeet of man in public as in private life  Without her
we should forget the true ideals  Sits down beside LADY STUTFIELD

LADY STUTFIELD  I am so very very glad to hear you say that

LADY CAROLINE  You a married man Mr Kettle

SIR JOHN  Kelvil dear Kelvil

KELVIL  I am married Lady Caroline

LADY CAROLINE  Family

KELVIL  Yes

LADY CAROLINE  How many

KELVIL  Eight

LADY STUTFIELD turns her attention to LORD ALFRED

LADY CAROLINE  Mrs Kettle and the children are I suppose at the
seaside  SIR JOHN shrugs his shoulders

KELVIL  My wife is at the seaside with the children Lady Caroline

LADY CAROLINE  You will join them later on no doubt

KELVIL  If my public engagements permit me

LADY CAROLINE  Your public life must be a great source of gratification
to Mrs Kettle

SIR JOHN  Kelvil my love Kelvil

LADY STUTFIELD  To LORD ALFRED  How very very charming those
goldtipped cigarettes of yours are Lord Alfred

LORD ALFRED  They are awfully expensive  I can only afford them when
Im in debt

LADY STUTFIELD  It must be terribly terribly distressing to be in debt

LORD ALFRED  One must have some occupation nowadays  If I hadnt my
debts I shouldnt have anything to think about  All the chaps I know are
in debt

LADY STUTFIELD  But dont the people to whom you owe the money give you
a great great deal of annoyance

Enter Footman

LORD ALFRED  Oh no they write I dont

LADY STUTFIELD  How very very strange

LADY HUNSTANTON  Ah here is a letter Caroline from dear Mrs
Arbuthnot  She wont dine  I am so sorry  But she will come in the
evening  I am very pleased indeed  She is one of the sweetest of women
Writes a beautiful hand too so large so firm  Hands letter to LADY
CAROLINE

LADY CAROLINE  Looking at it  A little lacking in femininity Jane
Femininity is the quality I admire most in women

LADY HUNSTANTON  Taking back letter and leaving it on table  Oh
she is very feminine Caroline and so good too  You should hear what
the Archdeacon says of her  He regards her as his right hand in the
parish  Footman speaks to her  In the Yellow Drawingroom  Shall
we all go in  Lady Stutfield shall we go in to tea

LADY STUTFIELD  With pleasure Lady Hunstanton  They rise and proceed
to go off  SIR JOHN offers to carry LADY STUTFIELDS cloak

LADY CAROLINE  John  If you would allow your nephew to look after Lady
Stutfields cloak you might help me with my workbasket

Enter LORD ILLINGWORTH and MRS ALLONBY

SIR JOHN  Certainly my love  Exeunt

MRS ALLONBY  Curious thing plain women are always jealous of their
husbands beautiful women never are

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Beautiful women never have time  They are always so
occupied in being jealous of other peoples husbands

MRS ALLONBY  I should have thought Lady Caroline would have grown tired
of conjugal anxiety by this time  Sir John is her fourth

LORD ILLINGWORTH  So much marriage is certainly not becoming  Twenty
years of romance make a woman look like a ruin but twenty years of
marriage make her something like a public building

MRS ALLONBY  Twenty years of romance  Is there such a thing

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Not in our day  Women have become too brilliant
Nothing spoils a romance so much as a sense of humour in the woman

MRS ALLONBY  Or the want of it in the man

LORD ILLINGWORTH  You are quite right  In a Temple every one should be
serious except the thing that is worshipped

MRS ALLONBY  And that should be man

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Women kneel so gracefully men dont

MRS ALLONBY  You are thinking of Lady Stutfield

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I assure you I have not thought of Lady Stutfield for
the last quarter of an hour

MRS ALLONBY  Is she such a mystery

LORD ILLINGWORTH  She is more than a mysteryshe is a mood

MRS ALLONBY  Moods dont last

LORD ILLINGWORTH  It is their chief charm

Enter HESTER and GERALD

GERALD  Lord Illingworth every one has been congratulating me Lady
Hunstanton and Lady Caroline and    every one  I hope I shall make a
good secretary

LORD ILLINGWORTH  You will be the pattern secretary Gerald  Talks to
him

MRS ALLONBY  You enjoy country life Miss Worsley

HESTER  Very much indeed

MRS ALLONBY  Dont find yourself longing for a London dinnerparty

HESTER  I dislike London dinnerparties

MRS ALLONBY  I adore them  The clever people never listen and the
stupid people never talk

HESTER  I think the stupid people talk a great deal

MRS ALLONBY  Ah I never listen

LORD ILLINGWORTH  My dear boy if I didnt like you I wouldnt have made
you the offer  It is because I like you so much that I want to have you
with me

Exit HESTER with GERALD

Charming fellow Gerald Arbuthnot

MRS ALLONBY  He is very nice very nice indeed  But I cant stand the
American young lady

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Why

MRS ALLONBY  She told me yesterday and in quite a loud voice too that
she was only eighteen  It was most annoying

LORD ILLINGWORTH  One should never trust a woman who tells one her real
age  A woman who would tell one that would tell one anything

MRS ALLONBY  She is a Puritan besides

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Ah that is inexcusable  I dont mind plain women
being Puritans  It is the only excuse they have for being plain  But
she is decidedly pretty  I admire her immensely  Looks steadfastly
at MRS ALLONBY

MRS ALLONBY  What a thoroughly bad man you must be

LORD ILLINGWORTH  What do you call a bad man

MRS ALLONBY  The sort of man who admires innocence

LORD ILLINGWORTH  And a bad woman

MRS ALLONBY  Oh the sort of woman a man never gets tired of

LORD ILLINGWORTH  You are severeon yourself

MRS ALLONBY  Define us as a sex

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Sphinxes without secrets

MRS ALLONBY  Does that include the Puritan women

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Do you know I dont believe in the existence of
Puritan women  I dont think there is a woman in the world who would not
be a little flattered if one made love to her  It is that which makes
women so irresistibly adorable

MRS ALLONBY  You think there is no woman in the world who would object
to being kissed

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Very few

MRS ALLONBY  Miss Worsley would not let you kiss her

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Are you sure

MRS ALLONBY  Quite

LORD ILLINGWORTH  What do you think shed do if I kissed her

MRS ALLONBY  Either marry you or strike you across the face with her
glove  What would you do if she struck you across the face with her
glove

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Fall in love with her probably

MRS ALLONBY  Then it is lucky you are not going to kiss her

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Is that a challenge

MRS ALLONBY  It is an arrow shot into the air

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Dont you know that I always succeed in whatever I
try

MRS ALLONBY  I am sorry to hear it  We women adore failures  They
lean on us

LORD ILLINGWORTH  You worship successes  You cling to them

MRS ALLONBY  We are the laurels to hide their baldness

LORD ILLINGWORTH  And they need you always except at the moment of
triumph

MRS ALLONBY  They are uninteresting then

LORD ILLINGWORTH  How tantalising you are  A pause

MRS ALLONBY  Lord Illingworth there is one thing I shall always like
you for

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Only one thing  And I have so many bad qualities

MRS ALLONBY  Ah dont be too conceited about them  You may lose them
as you grow old

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I never intend to grow old  The soul is born old but
grows young  That is the comedy of life

MRS ALLONBY  And the body is born young and grows old  That is lifes
tragedy

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Its comedy also sometimes  But what is the
mysterious reason why you will always like me

MRS ALLONBY  It is that you have never made love to me

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I have never done anything else

MRS ALLONBY  Really  I have not noticed it

LORD ILLINGWORTH  How fortunate  It might have been a tragedy for both
of us

MRS ALLONBY  We should each have survived

LORD ILLINGWORTH  One can survive everything nowadays except death and
live down anything except a good reputation

MRS ALLONBY  Have you tried a good reputation

LORD ILLINGWORTH  It is one of the many annoyances to which I have never
been subjected

MRS ALLONBY  It may come

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Why do you threaten me

MRS ALLONBY  I will tell you when you have kissed the Puritan

Enter Footman

FRANCIS  Tea is served in the Yellow Drawingroom my lord

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Tell her ladyship we are coming in

FRANCIS  Yes my lord

Exit

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Shall we go in to tea

MRS ALLONBY  Do you like such simple pleasures

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I adore simple pleasures  They are the last refuge of
the complex  But if you wish let us stay here  Yes let us stay here
The Book of Life begins with a man and a woman in a garden

MRS ALLONBY  It ends with Revelations

LORD ILLINGWORTH  You fence divinely  But the button has come of your
foil

MRS ALLONBY  I have still the mask

LORD ILLINGWORTH  It makes your eyes lovelier

MRS ALLONBY  Thank you  Come

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Sees MRS ARBUTHNOTS letter on table and takes
it up and looks at envelope  What a curious handwriting  It reminds
me of the handwriting of a woman I used to know years ago

MRS ALLONBY  Who

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Oh no one  No one in particular  A woman of no
importance  Throws letter down and passes up the steps of the
terrace with MRS ALLONBY  They smile at each other

SECOND ACT


                                  SCENE

 Drawingroom at Hunstanton after dinner lamps lit  Door LC
                               Door RC

Ladies seated on sofas

MRS ALLONBY  What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a
little

LADY STUTFIELD  Yes men persecute us dreadfully dont they

MRS ALLONBY  Persecute us  I wish they did

LADY HUNSTANTON  My dear

MRS ALLONBY  The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly
happy without us  That is why I think it is every womans duty never to
leave them alone for a single moment except during this short breathing
space after dinner without which I believe we poor women would be
absolutely worn to shadows

Enter Servants with coffee

LADY HUNSTANTON  Worn to shadows dear

MRS ALLONBY  Yes Lady Hunstanton  It is such a strain keeping men up
to the mark  They are always trying to escape from us

LADY STUTFIELD  It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
escape from them  Men are so very very heartless  They know their
power and use it

LADY CAROLINE  Takes coffee from Servant  What stuff and nonsense
all this about men is  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper
place

MRS ALLONBY  But what is their proper place Lady Caroline

LADY CAROLINE  Looking after their wives Mrs Allonby

MRS ALLONBY  Takes coffee from Servant  Really  And if theyre
not married

LADY CAROLINE  If they are not married they should be looking after a
wife  Its perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going
about society  There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry
within twelve months

LADY STUTFIELD  Refuses coffee  But if theyre in love with some
one who perhaps is tied to another

LADY CAROLINE  In that case Lady Stutfield they should be married off
in a week to some plain respectable girl in order to teach them not to
meddle with other peoples property

MRS ALLONBY  I dont think that we should ever be spoken of as other
peoples property  All men are married womens property  That is the
only true definition of what married womens property really is  But we
dont belong to any one

LADY STUTFIELD  Oh I am so very very glad to hear you say so

LADY HUNSTANTON  But do you really think dear Caroline that
legislation would improve matters in any way  I am told that nowadays
all the married men live like bachelors and all the bachelors like
married men

MRS ALLONBY  I certainly never know one from the other

LADY STUTFIELD  Oh I think one can always know at once whether a man
has home claims upon his life or not  I have noticed a very very sad
expression in the eyes of so many married men

MRS ALLONBY  Ah all that I have noticed is that they are horribly
tedious when they are good husbands and abominably conceited when they
are not

LADY HUNSTANTON  Well I suppose the type of husband has completely
changed since my young days but Im bound to state that poor dear
Hunstanton was the most delightful of creatures and as good as gold

MRS ALLONBY  Ah my husband is a sort of promissory note Im tired of
meeting him

LADY CAROLINE  But you renew him from time to time dont you

MRS ALLONBY  Oh no Lady Caroline  I have only had one husband as yet
I suppose you look upon me as quite an amateur

LADY CAROLINE  With your views on life I wonder you married at all

MRS ALLONBY  So do I

LADY HUNSTANTON  My dear child I believe you are really very happy in
your married life but that you like to hide your happiness from others

MRS ALLONBY  I assure you I was horribly deceived in Ernest

LADY HUNSTANTON  Oh I hope not dear  I knew his mother quite well
She was a Stratton Caroline one of Lord Crowlands daughters

LADY CAROLINE  Victoria Stratton  I remember her perfectly  A silly
fairhaired woman with no chin

MRS ALLONBY  Ah Ernest has a chin  He has a very strong chin a
square chin  Ernests chin is far too square

LADY STUTFIELD  But do you really think a mans chin can be too square
I think a man should look very very strong and that his chin should be
quite quite square

MRS ALLONBY  Then you should certainly know Ernest Lady Stutfield  It
is only fair to tell you beforehand he has got no conversation at all

LADY STUTFIELD  I adore silent men

MRS ALLONBY  Oh Ernest isnt silent  He talks the whole time  But he
has got no conversation  What he talks about I dont know  I havent
listened to him for years

LADY STUTFIELD  Have you never forgiven him then  How sad that seems
But all life is very very sad is it not

MRS ALLONBY  Life Lady Stutfield is simply a mauvais quart dheure
made up of exquisite moments

LADY STUTFIELD  Yes there are moments certainly  But was it something
very very wrong that Mr Allonby did  Did he become angry with you and
say anything that was unkind or true

MRS ALLONBY  Oh dear no  Ernest is invariably calm  That is one of
the reasons he always gets on my nerves  Nothing is so aggravating as
calmness  There is something positively brutal about the good temper of
most modern men  I wonder we women stand it as well as we do

LADY STUTFIELD  Yes mens good temper shows they are not so sensitive
as we are not so finely strung  It makes a great barrier often between
husband and wife does it not  But I would so much like to know what was
the wrong thing Mr Allonby did

MRS ALLONBY  Well I will tell you if you solemnly promise to tell
everybody else

LADY STUTFIELD  Thank you thank you  I will make a point of repeating
it

MRS ALLONBY  When Ernest and I were engaged he swore to me positively
on his knees that he had never loved any one before in the whole course
of his life  I was very young at the time so I didnt believe him I
neednt tell you  Unfortunately however I made no enquiries of any
kind till after I had been actually married four or five months  I found
out then that what he had told me was perfectly true  And that sort of
thing makes a man so absolutely uninteresting

LADY HUNSTANTON  My dear

MRS ALLONBY  Men always want to be a womans first love  That is their
clumsy vanity  We women have a more subtle instinct about things  What
we like is to be a mans last romance

LADY STUTFIELD  I see what you mean  Its very very beautiful

LADY HUNSTANTON  My dear child you dont mean to tell me that you wont
forgive your husband because he never loved any one else  Did you ever
hear such a thing Caroline  I am quite surprised

LADY CAROLINE  Oh women have become so highly educated Jane that
nothing should surprise us nowadays except happy marriages  They
apparently are getting remarkably rare

MRS ALLONBY  Oh theyre quite out of date

LADY STUTFIELD  Except amongst the middle classes I have been told

MRS ALLONBY  How like the middle classes

LADY STUTFIELD  Yesis it notvery very like them

LADY CAROLINE  If what you tell us about the middle classes is true
Lady Stutfield it redounds greatly to their credit  It is much to be
regretted that in our rank of life the wife should be so persistently
frivolous under the impression apparently that it is the proper thing to
be  It is to that I attribute the unhappiness of so many marriages we
all know of in society

MRS ALLONBY  Do you know Lady Caroline I dont think the frivolity of
the wife has ever anything to do with it More marriages are ruined
nowadays by the common sense of the husband than by anything else  How
can a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating
her as if she were a perfectly rational being

LADY HUNSTANTON  My dear

MRS ALLONBY  Man poor awkward reliable necessary man belongs to a
sex that has been rational for millions and millions of years  He cant
help himself  It is in his race  The History of Woman is very
different  We have always been picturesque protests against the mere
existence of common sense  We saw its dangers from the first

LADY STUTFIELD  Yes the common sense of husbands is certainly most
most trying  Do tell me your conception of the Ideal Husband  I think
it would be so very very helpful

MRS ALLONBY  The Ideal Husband  There couldnt be such a thing  The
institution is wrong

LADY STUTFIELD  The Ideal Man then in his relations to us

LADY CAROLINE  He would probably be extremely realistic

MRS CAROLINE  The Ideal Man  Oh the Ideal Man should talk to us as if
we were goddesses and treat us as if we were children  He should refuse
all our serious requests and gratify every one of our whims  He should
encourage us to have caprices and forbid us to have missions  He should
always say much more than he means and always mean much more than he
says

LADY HUNSTANTON  But how could he do both dear

MRS ALLONBY  He should never run down other pretty women  That would
show he had no taste or make one suspect that he had too much  No he
should be nice about them all but say that somehow they dont attract
him

LADY STUTFIELD  Yes that is always very very pleasant to hear about
other women

MRS ALLONBY  If we ask him a question about anything he should give us
an answer all about ourselves  He should invariably praise us for
whatever qualities he knows we havent got  But he should be pitiless
quite pitiless in reproaching us for the virtues that we have never
dreamed of possessing  He should never believe that we know the use of
useful things  That would be unforgiveable  But he should shower on us
everything we dont want

LADY CAROLINE  As far as I can see he is to do nothing but pay bills
and compliments

MRS ALLONBY  He should persistently compromise us in public and treat
us with absolute respect when we are alone  And yet he should be always
ready to have a perfectly terrible scene whenever we want one and to
become miserable absolutely miserable at a moments notice and to
overwhelm us with just reproaches in less than twenty minutes and to be
positively violent at the end of half an hour and to leave us for ever
at a quarter to eight when we have to go and dress for dinner  And
when after that one has seen him for really the last time and he has
refused to take back the little things he has given one and promised
never to communicate with one again or to write one any foolish letters
he should be perfectly brokenhearted and telegraph to one all day long
and send one little notes every halfhour by a private hansom and dine
quite alone at the club so that every one should know how unhappy he
was  And after a whole dreadful week during which one has gone about
everywhere with ones husband just to show how absolutely lonely one
was he may be given a third last parting in the evening and then if
his conduct has been quite irreproachable and one has behaved really
badly to him he should be allowed to admit that he has been entirely in
the wrong and when he has admitted that it becomes a womans duty to
forgive and one can do it all over again from the beginning with
variations

LADY HUNSTANTON  How clever you are my dear  You never mean a single
word you say

LADY STUTFIELD  Thank you thank you  It has been quite quite
entrancing  I must try and remember it all  There are such a number of
details that are so very very important

LADY CAROLINE  But you have not told us yet what the reward of the Ideal
Man is to be

MRS ALLONBY  His reward  Oh infinite expectation  That is quite
enough for him

LADY STUTFIELD  But men are so terribly terribly exacting are they
not

MRS ALLONBY  That makes no matter  One should never surrender

LADY STUTFIELD  Not even to the Ideal Man

MRS ALLONBY  Certainly not to him  Unless of course one wants to
grow tired of him

LADY STUTFIELD  Oh    yes  I see that  It is very very helpful
Do you think Mrs Allonby I shall ever meet the Ideal Man  Or are
there more than one

MRS ALLONBY  There are just four in London Lady Stutfield

LADY HUNSTANTON  Oh my dear

MRS ALLONBY  Going over to her  What has happened  Do tell me

LADY HUNSTANTON in a low voice  I had completely forgotten that the
American young lady has been in the room all the time  I am afraid some
of this clever talk may have shocked her a little

MRS ALLONBY  Ah that will do her so much good

LADY HUNSTANTON  Let us hope she didnt understand much  I think I had
better go over and talk to her  Rises and goes across to HESTER
WORSLEY  Well dear Miss Worsley Sitting down beside her  How
quiet you have been in your nice little corner all this time  I suppose
you have been reading a book  There are so many books here in the
library

HESTER  No I have been listening to the conversation

LADY HUNSTANTON  You mustnt believe everything that was said you know
dear

HESTER  I didnt believe any of it

LADY HUNSTANTON  That is quite right dear

HESTER  Continuing  I couldnt believe that any women could really
hold such views of life as I have heard tonight from some of your
guests  An awkward pause

LADY HUNSTANTON  I hear you have such pleasant society in America
Quite like our own in places my son wrote to me

HESTER  There are cliques in America as elsewhere Lady Hunstanton  But
true American society consists simply of all the good women and good men
we have in our country

LADY HUNSTANTON  What a sensible system and I dare say quite pleasant
too  I am afraid in England we have too many artificial social barriers
We dont see as much as we should of the middle and lower classes

HESTER  In America we have no lower classes

LADY HUNSTANTON  Really  What a very strange arrangement

MRS ALLONBY  What is that dreadful girl talking about

LADY STUTFIELD  She is painfully natural is she not

LADY CAROLINE  There are a great many things you havent got in America
I am told Miss Worsley  They say you have no ruins and no curiosities

MRS ALLONBY  To LADY STUTFIELD  What nonsense  They have their
mothers and their manners

HESTER  The English aristocracy supply us with our curiosities Lady
Caroline  They are sent over to us every summer regularly in the
steamers and propose to us the day after they land  As for ruins we
are trying to build up something that will last longer than brick or
stone  Gets up to take her fan from table

LADY HUNSTANTON  What is that dear  Ah yes an iron Exhibition is it
not at that place that has the curious name

HESTER  Standing by table  We are trying to build up life Lady
Hunstanton on a better truer purer basis than life rests on here
This sounds strange to you all no doubt  How could it sound other than
strange  You rich people in England you dont know how you are living
How could you know  You shut out from your society the gentle and the
good  You laugh at the simple and the pure  Living as you all do on
others and by them you sneer at selfsacrifice and if you throw bread
to the poor it is merely to keep them quiet for a season  With all your
pomp and wealth and art you dont know how to liveyou dont even know
that  You love the beauty that you can see and touch and handle the
beauty that you can destroy and do destroy but of the unseen beauty of
life of the unseen beauty of a higher life you know nothing  You have
lost lifes secret  Oh your English society seems to me shallow
selfish foolish  It has blinded its eyes and stopped its ears  It
lies like a leper in purple  It sits like a dead thing smeared with
gold  It is all wrong all wrong

LADY STUTFIELD  I dont think one should know of these things  It is
not very very nice is it

LADY HUNSTANTON  My dear Miss Worsley I thought you liked English
society so much  You were such a success in it  And you were so much
admired by the best people  I quite forget what Lord Henry Weston said
of youbut it was most complimentary and you know what an authority he
is on beauty

HESTER  Lord Henry Weston  I remember him Lady Hunstanton  A man with
a hideous smile and a hideous past  He is asked everywhere  No
dinnerparty is complete without him  What of those whose ruin is due to
him  They are outcasts  They are nameless  If you met them in the
street you would turn your head away  I dont complain of their
punishment  Let all women who have sinned be punished

MRS ARBUTHNOT enters from terrace behind in a cloak with a lace veil
over her head  She hears the last words and starts

LADY HUNSTANTON  My dear young lady

HESTER  It is right that they should be punished but dont let them be
the only ones to suffer  If a man and woman have sinned let them both
go forth into the desert to love or loathe each other there  Let them
both be branded  Set a mark if you wish on each but dont punish the
one and let the other go free  Dont have one law for men and another
for women  You are unjust to women in England  And till you count what
is a shame in a woman to be an infamy in a man you will always be
unjust and Right that pillar of fire and Wrong that pillar of cloud
will be made dim to your eyes or be not seen at all or if seen not
regarded

LADY CAROLINE  Might I dear Miss Worsley as you are standing up ask
you for my cotton that is just behind you  Thank you

LADY HUNSTANTON  My dear Mrs Arbuthnot  I am so pleased you have come
up  But I didnt hear you announced

MRS ALLONBY  Oh I came straight in from the terrace Lady Hunstanton
just as I was  You didnt tell me you had a party

LADY HUNSTANTON  Not a party  Only a few guests who are staying in the
house and whom you must know  Allow me  Tries to help her  Rings
bell  Caroline this is Mrs Arbuthnot one of my sweetest friends
Lady Caroline Pontefract Lady Stutfield Mrs Allonby and my young
American friend Miss Worsley who has just been telling us all how
wicked we are

HESTER  I am afraid you think I spoke too strongly Lady Hunstanton
But there are some things in England

LADY HUNSTANTON  My dear young lady there was a great deal of truth I
dare say in what you said and you looked very pretty while you said it
which is much more important Lord Illingworth would tell us  The only
point where I thought you were a little hard was about Lady Carolines
brother about poor Lord Henry  He is really such good company

Enter Footman

Take Mrs Arbuthnots things

Exit Footman with wraps

HESTER  Lady Caroline I had no idea it was your brother  I am sorry
for the pain I must have caused youI

LADY CAROLINE  My dear Miss Worsley the only part of your little
speech if I may so term it with which I thoroughly agreed was the part
about my brother  Nothing that you could possibly say could be too bad
for him  I regard Henry as infamous absolutely infamous  But I am
bound to state as you were remarking Jane that he is excellent
company and he has one of the best cooks in London and after a good
dinner one can forgive anybody even ones own relations

LADY HUNSTANTON to MISS WORSLEY  Now do come dear and make friends
with Mrs Arbuthnot  She is one of the good sweet simple people you
told us we never admitted into society  I am sorry to say Mrs Arbuthnot
comes very rarely to me  But that is not my fault

MRS ALLONBY  What a bore it is the men staying so long after dinner  I
expect they are saying the most dreadful things about us

LADY STUTFIELD  Do you really think so

MRS ALLONBY  I was sure of it

LADY STUTFIELD  How very very horrid of them  Shall we go onto the
terrace

MRS ALLONBY  Oh anything to get away from the dowagers and the
dowdies  Rises and goes with LADY STUTFIELD to door LC  We are
only going to look at the stars Lady Hunstanton

LADY HUNSTANTON  You will find a great many dear a great many  But
dont catch cold  To MRS ARBUTHNOT  We shall all miss Gerald so
much dear Mrs Arbuthnot

MRS ARBUTHNOT  But has Lord Illingworth really offered to make Gerald
his secretary

LADY HUNSTANTON  Oh yes  He has been most charming about it  He has
the highest possible opinion of your boy  You dont know Lord
Illingworth I believe dear

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I have never met him

LADY HUNSTANTON  You know him by name no doubt

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I am afraid I dont  I live so much out of the world
and see so few people  I remember hearing years ago of an old Lord
Illingworth who lived in Yorkshire I think

LADY HUNSTANTON  Ah yes  That would be the last Earl but one  He was
a very curious man  He wanted to marry beneath him  Or wouldnt I
believe  There was some scandal about it  The present Lord Illingworth
is quite different  He is very distinguished  He doeswell he does
nothing which I am afraid our pretty American visitor here thinks very
wrong of anybody and I dont know that he cares much for the subjects in
which you are so interested dear Mrs Arbuthnot  Do you think
Caroline that Lord Illingworth is interested in the Housing of the Poor

LADY CAROLINE  I should fancy not at all Jane

LADY HUNSTANTON  We all have our different tastes have we not  But
Lord Illingworth has a very high position and there is nothing he
couldnt get if he chose to ask for it  Of course he is comparatively a
young man still and he has only come to his title withinhow long
exactly is it Caroline since Lord Illingworth succeeded

LADY CAROLINE  About four years I think Jane  I know it was the same
year in which my brother had his last exposure in the evening newspapers

LADY HUNSTANTON  Ah I remember  That would be about four years ago
Of course there were a great many people between the present Lord
Illingworth and the title Mrs Arbuthnot  There waswho was there
Caroline

LADY CAROLINE  There was poor Margarets baby  You remember how anxious
she was to have a boy and it was a boy but it died and her husband
died shortly afterwards and she married almost immediately one of Lord
Ascots sons who I am told beats her

LADY HUNSTANTON  Ah that is in the family dear that is in the family
And there was also I remember a clergyman who wanted to be a lunatic
or a lunatic who wanted to be a clergyman I forget which but I know the
Court of Chancery investigated the matter and decided that he was quite
sane  And I saw him afterwards at poor Lord Plumsteads with straws in
his hair or something very odd about him  I cant recall what  I often
regret Lady Caroline that dear Lady Cecilia never lived to see her son
get the title

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Lady Cecilia

LADY HUNSTANTON  Lord Illingworths mother dear Mrs Arbuthnot was one
of the Duchess of Jerninghams pretty daughters and she married Sir
Thomas Harford who wasnt considered a very good match for her at the
time though he was said to be the handsomest man in London  I knew them
all quite intimately and both the sons Arthur and George

MRS ARBUTHNOT  It was the eldest son who succeeded of course Lady
Hunstanton

LADY HUNSTANTON  No dear he was killed in the hunting field  Or was
it fishing Caroline  I forget  But George came in for everything  I
always tell him that no younger son has ever had such good luck as he has
had

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Lady Hunstanton I want to speak to Gerald at once
Might I see him  Can he be sent for

LADY HUNSTANTON  Certainly dear  I will send one of the servants into
the diningroom to fetch him  I dont know what keeps the gentlemen so
long  Rings bell  When I knew Lord Illingworth first as plain
George Harford he was simply a very brilliant young man about town with
not a penny of money except what poor dear Lady Cecilia gave him  She
was quite devoted to him  Chiefly I fancy because he was on bad terms
with his father  Oh here is the dear Archdeacon  To Servant  It
doesnt matter

Enter SIR JOHN and DOCTOR DAUBENY  SIR JOHN goes over to LADY
STUTFIELD DOCTOR DAUBENY to LADY HUNSTANTON

THE ARCHDEACON  Lord Illingworth has been most entertaining  I have
never enjoyed myself more  Sees MRS ARBUTHNOT  Ah Mrs Arbuthnot

LADY HUNSTANTON  To DOCTOR BAUBENY  You see I have got Mrs
Arbuthnot to come to me at last

THE ARCHDEACON  That is a great honour Lady Hunstanton  Mrs Daubeny
will be quite jealous of you

LADY HUNSTANTON  Ah I am so sorry Mrs Daubeny could not come with you
tonight  Headache as usual I suppose

THE ARCHDEACON  Yes Lady Hunstanton a perfect martyr  But she is
happiest alone  She is happiest alone

LADY CAROLINE  To her husband  John  SIR JOHN goes over to his
wife  DOCTOR BAUBENY talks to LADY HUNSTANTON and MRS ARBUTHNOT

MRS ARBUTHNOT watches LORD ILLINGWORTH the whole time  He has passed
across the room without noticing her and approaches MRS ALLONBY who
with LADY STUTFIELD is standing by the door looking on to the terrace

LORD ILLINGWORTH  How is the most charming woman in the world

MRS ALLONBY  Taking LADY STUTFIELD by the hand  We are both quite
well thank you Lord Illingworth  But what a short time you have been
in the diningroom  It seems as if we had only just left

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I was bored to death  Never opened my lips the whole
time  Absolutely longing to come in to you

MRS ALLONBY  You should have  The American girl has been giving us a
lecture

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Really  All Americans lecture I believe  I suppose
it is something in their climate  What did she lecture about

MRS ALLONBY  Oh Puritanism of course

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I am going to convert her am I not  How long do you
give me

MRS ALLONBY  A week

LORD ILLINGWORTH  A week is more than enough

Enter GERALD and LORD ALFRED

GERALD  Going to MRS ARBUTHNOT  Dear mother

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Gerald I dont feel at all well  See me home Gerald
I shouldnt have come

GERALD  I am so sorry mother  Certainly  But you must know Lord
Illingworth first  Goes across room

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Not tonight Gerald

GERALD  Lord Illingworth I want you so much to know my mother

LORD ILLINGWORTH  With the greatest pleasure  To MRS ALLONBY
Ill be back in a moment  Peoples mothers always bore me to death  All
women become like their mothers  That is their tragedy

MRS ALLONBY  No man does  That is his

LORD ILLINGWORTH  What a delightful mood you are in tonight  Turns
round and goes across with GERALD to MRS ARBUTHNOT  When he sees
her he starts back in wonder  Then slowly his eyes turn towards
GERALD

GERALD  Mother this is Lord Illingworth who has offered to take me as
his private secretary  MRS ARBUTHNOT bows coldly  It is a
wonderful opening for me isnt it  I hope he wont be disappointed in
me that is all  Youll thank Lord Illingworth mother wont you

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Lord Illingworth in very good I am sure to interest
himself in you for the moment

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Putting his hand on GERALDS shoulder  Oh
Gerald and I are great friends already Mrs    Arbuthnot

MRS ARBUTHNOT  There can be nothing in common between you and my son
Lord Illingworth

GERALD  Dear mother how can you say so  Of course Lord Illingworth is
awfully clever and that sort of thing  There is nothing Lord Illingworth
doesnt know

LORD ILLINGWORTH  My dear boy

GERALD  He knows more about life than any one I have ever met  I feel
an awful duffer when I am with you Lord Illingworth  Of course I have
had so few advantages  I have not been to Eton or Oxford like other
chaps  But Lord Illingworth doesnt seem to mind that  He has been
awfully good to me mother

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Lord Illingworth may change his mind  He may not really
want you as his secretary

GERALD  Mother

MRS ARBUTHNOT  You must remember as you said yourself you have had so
few advantages

MRS ALLONBY  Lord Illingworth I want to speak to you for a moment  Do
come over

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Will you excuse me Mrs Arbuthnot  Now dont let
your charming mother make any more difficulties Gerald  The thing is
quite settled isnt it

GERALD  I hope so  LORD ILLINGWORTH goes across to MRS ARBUTHNOT

MRS ALLONBY  I thought you were never going to leave the lady in black
velvet

LORD ILLINGWORTH  She is excessively handsome  Looks at MRS
ARBUTHNOT

LADY HUNSTANTON  Caroline shall we all make a move to the musicroom
Miss Worsley is going to play  Youll come too dear Mrs Arbuthnot
wont you  You dont know what a treat is in store for you  To
DOCTOR BAUBENY  I must really take Miss Worsley down some afternoon to
the rectory  I should so much like dear Mrs Daubeny to hear her on the
violin  Ah I forgot  Dear Mrs Daubenys hearing is a little
defective is it not

THE ARCHDEACON  Her deafness is a great privation to her  She cant
even hear my sermons now  She reads them at home  But she has many
resources in herself many resources

LADY HUNSTANTON  She reads a good deal I suppose

THE ARCHDEACON  Just the very largest print  The eyesight is rapidly
going  But shes never morbid never morbid

GERALD  To LORD ILLINGWORTH  Do speak to my mother Lord
Illingworth before you go into the musicroom  She seems to think
somehow you dont mean what you said to me

MRS ALLONBY  Arent you coming

LORD ILLINGWORTH  In a few moments  Lady Hunstanton if Mrs Arbuthnot
would allow me I would like to say a few words to her and we will join
you later on

LADY HUNSTANTON  Ah of course  You will have a great deal to say to
her and she will have a great deal to thank you for  It is not every
son who gets such an offer Mrs Arbuthnot  But I know you appreciate
that dear

LADY CAROLINE  John

LADY HUNSTANTON  Now dont keep Mrs Arbuthnot too long Lord
Illingworth  We cant spare her

Exit following the other guests  Sound of violin heard from
musicroom

LORD ILLINGWORTH  So that is our son Rachel  Well I am very proud of
him  He in a Harford every inch of him  By the way why Arbuthnot
Rachel

MRS ARBUTHNOT  One name is as good as another when one has no right to
any name

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I suppose sobut why Gerald

MRS ARBUTHNOT  After a man whose heart I brokeafter my father

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Well Rachel what in over is over  All I have got to
say now in that I am very very much pleased with our boy  The world
will know him merely as my private secretary but to me he will be
something very near and very dear  It is a curious thing Rachel my
life seemed to be quite complete  It was not so  It lacked something
it lacked a son  I have found my son now I am glad I have found him

MRS ARBUTHNOT  You have no right to claim him or the smallest part of
him  The boy is entirely mine and shall remain mine

LORD ILLINGWORTH  My dear Rachel you have had him to yourself for over
twenty years  Why not let me have him for a little now  He is quite as
much mine as yours

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Are you talking of the child you abandoned  Of the
child who as far as you are concerned might have died of hunger and of
want

LORD ILLINGWORTH  You forget Rachel it was you who left me  It was
not I who left you

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I left you because you refused to give the child a name
Before my son was born I implored you to marry me

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I had no expectations then  And besides Rachel I
wasnt much older than you were  I was only twentytwo  I was
twentyone I believe when the whole thing began in your fathers
garden

MRS ARBUTHNOT  When a man is old enough to do wrong he should be old
enough to do right also

LORD ILLINGWORTH  My dear Rachel intellectual generalities are always
interesting but generalities in morals mean absolutely nothing  As for
saying I left our child to starve that of course is untrue and silly
My mother offered you six hundred a year  But you wouldnt take
anything  You simply disappeared and carried the child away with you

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I wouldnt have accepted a penny from her  Your father
was different  He told you in my presence when we were in Paris that
it was your duty to marry me

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Oh duty is what one expects from others it is not
what one does oneself  Of course I was influenced by my mother  Every
man is when he is young

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I am glad to hear you say so  Gerald shall certainly
not go away with you

LORD ILLINGWORTH  What nonsense Rachel

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Do you think I would allow my son

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Our son

MRS ARBUTHNOT  My son LORD ILLINGWORTH shrugs his shouldersto go
away with the man who spoiled my youth who ruined my life who has
tainted every moment of my days  You dont realise what my past has been
in suffering and in shame

LORD ILLINGWORTH  My dear Rachel I must candidly say that I think
Geralds future considerably more important than your past

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Gerald cannot separate his future from my past

LORD ILLINGWORTH  That is exactly what he should do  That is exactly
what you should help him to do  What a typical woman you are  You talk
sentimentally and you are thoroughly selfish the whole time  But dont
let us have a scene  Rachel I want you to look at this matter from the
commonsense point of view from the point of view of what is best for
our son leaving you and me out of the question  What is our son at
present  An underpaid clerk in a small Provincial Bank in a thirdrate
English town  If you imagine he is quite happy in such a position you
are mistaken  He is thoroughly discontented

MRS ARBUTHNOT  He was not discontented till he met you  You have made
him so

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Of course I made him so  Discontent is the first
step in the progress of a man or a nation  But I did not leave him with
a mere longing for things he could not get  No I made him a charming
offer  He jumped at it I need hardly say  Any young man would  And
now simply because it turns out that I am the boys own father and he my
own son you propose practically to ruin his career  That is to say if
I were a perfect stranger you would allow Gerald to go away with me but
as he is my own flesh and blood you wont  How utterly illogical you
are

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I will not allow him to go

LORD ILLINGWORTH  How can you prevent it  What excuse can you give to
him for making him decline such an offer as mine  I wont tell him in
what relations I stand to him I need hardly say  But you darent tell
him  You know that  Look how you have brought him up

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I have brought him up to be a good man

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Quite so  And what is the result  You have educated
him to be your judge if he ever finds you out  And a bitter an unjust
judge he will be to you  Dont be deceived Rachel  Children begin by
loving their parents  After a time they judge them  Rarely if ever do
they forgive them

MRS ARBUTHNOT  George dont take my son away from me  I have had
twenty years of sorrow and I have only had one thing to love me only
one thing to love  You have had a life of joy and pleasure and
success  You have been quite happy you have never thought of us  There
was no reason according to your views of life why you should have
remembered us at all  Your meeting us was a mere accident a horrible
accident  Forget it  Dont come now and rob me of    of all I have
in the whole world  You are so rich in other things  Leave me the
little vineyard of my life leave me the walledin garden and the well of
water the ewelamb God sent me in pity or in wrath oh leave me that
George dont take Gerald from me

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Rachel at the present moment you are not necessary to
Geralds career I am  There is nothing more to be said on the subject

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I will not let him go

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Here is Gerald  He has a right to decide for himself

Enter GERALD

GERALD  Well dear mother I hope you have settled it all with Lord
Illingworth

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I have not Gerald

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Your mother seems not to like your coming with me for
some reason

GERALD  Why mother

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I thought you were quite happy here with me Gerald  I
didnt know you were so anxious to leave me

GERALD  Mother how can you talk like that  Of course I have been quite
happy with you  But a man cant stay always with his mother  No chap
does  I want to make myself a position to do something  I thought you
would have been proud to see me Lord Illingworths secretary

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I do not think you would be suitable as a private
secretary to Lord Illingworth  You have no qualifications

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I dont wish to seem to interfere for a moment Mrs
Arbuthnot but as far as your last objection is concerned I surely am
the best judge  And I can only tell you that your son has all the
qualifications I had hoped for  He has more in fact than I had even
thought of  Far more  MRS ARBUTHNOT remains silent  Have you any
other reason Mrs Arbuthnot why you dont wish your son to accept this
post

GERALD  Have you mother  Do answer

LORD ILLINGWORTH  If you have Mrs Arbuthnot pray pray say it  We
are quite by ourselves here  Whatever it is I need not say I will not
repeat it

GERALD  Mother

LORD ILLINGWORTH  If you would like to be alone with your son I will
leave you  You may have some other reason you dont wish me to hear

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I have no other reason

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Then my dear boy we may look on the thing as
settled  Come you and I will smoke a cigarette on the terrace together
And Mrs Arbuthnot pray let me tell you that I think you have acted
very very wisely

Exit with GERALD  MRS ARBUTHNOT is left alone  She stands
immobile with a look of unutterable sorrow on her face

                                 ACT DROP




THIRD ACT


                                  SCENE

    The Picture Gallery at Hunstanton  Door at back leading on to
                                terrace

LORD ILLINGWORTH and GERALD RC  LORD ILLINGWORTH lolling on a
sofa  GERALD in a chair

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Thoroughly sensible woman your mother Gerald  I
knew she would come round in the end

GERALD  My mother is awfully conscientious Lord Illingworth and I know
she doesnt think I am educated enough to be your secretary  She is
perfectly right too  I was fearfully idle when I was at school and I
couldnt pass an examination now to save my life

LORD ILLINGWORTH  My dear Gerald examinations are of no value
whatsoever  If a man is a gentleman he knows quite enough and if he is
not a gentleman whatever he knows is bad for him

GERALD  But I am so ignorant of the world Lord Illingworth

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Dont be afraid Gerald  Remember that youve got on
your side the most wonderful thing in the worldyouth  There is nothing
like youth  The middleaged are mortgaged to Life  The old are in
lifes lumberroom  But youth is the Lord of Life  Youth has a kingdom
waiting for it  Every one is born a king and most people die in exile
like most kings  To win back my youth Gerald there is nothing I
wouldnt doexcept take exercise get up early or be a useful member of
the community

GERALD  But you dont call yourself old Lord Illingworth

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I am old enough to be your father Gerald

GERALD  I dont remember my father he died years ago

LORD ILLINGWORTH  So Lady Hunstanton told me

GERALD  It is very curious my mother never talks to me about my father
I sometimes think she must have married beneath her

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Winces slightly  Really  Goes over and puts
his hand on GERALDS shoulder  You have missed not having a father
I suppose Gerald

GERALD  Oh no my mother has been so good to me  No one ever had such
a mother as I have had

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I am quite sure of that  Still I should imagine that
most mothers dont quite understand their sons  Dont realise I mean
that a son has ambitions a desire to see life to make himself a name
After all Gerald you couldnt be expected to pass all your life in such
a hole as Wrockley could you

GERALD  Oh no  It would be dreadful

LORD ILLINGWORTH  A mothers love is very touching of course but it is
often curiously selfish  I mean there is a good deal of selfishness in
it

GERALD  Slowly  I suppose there is

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Your mother is a thoroughly good woman  But good
women have such limited views of life their horizon is so small their
interests are so petty arent they

GERALD  They are awfully interested certainly in things we dont care
much about

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I suppose your mother is very religious and that sort
of thing

GERALD  Oh yes shes always going to church

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Ah she is not modern and to be modern is the only
thing worth being nowadays  You want to be modern dont you Gerald
You want to know life as it really is  Not to be put of with any
oldfashioned theories about life  Well what you have to do at present
is simply to fit yourself for the best society  A man who can dominate a
London dinnertable can dominate the world  The future belongs to the
dandy  It is the exquisites who are going to rule

GERALD  I should like to wear nice things awfully but I have always
been told that a man should not think too much about his clothes

LORD ILLINGWORTH  People nowadays are so absolutely superficial that
they dont understand the philosophy of the superficial  By the way
Gerald you should learn how to tie your tie better  Sentiment is all
very well for the buttonhole  But the essential thing for a necktie is
style  A welltied tie is the first serious step in life

GERALD  Laughing  I might be able to learn how to tie a tie Lord
Illingworth but I should never be able to talk as you do  I dont know
how to talk

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Oh talk to every woman as if you loved her and to
every man as if he bored you and at the end of your first season you
will have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact

GERALD  But it is very difficult to get into society isnt it

LORD ILLINGWORTH  To get into the best society nowadays one has either
to feed people amuse people or shock peoplethat is all

GERALD  I suppose society is wonderfully delightful

LORD ILLINGWORTH  To be in it is merely a bore  But to be out of it
simply a tragedy  Society is a necessary thing  No man has any real
success in this world unless he has got women to back him and women rule
society  If you have not got women on your side you are quite over  You
might just as well be a barrister or a stockbroker or a journalist at
once

GERALD  It is very difficult to understand women is it not

LORD ILLINGWORTH  You should never try to understand them  Women are
pictures  Men are problems  If you want to know what a woman really
meanswhich by the way is always a dangerous thing to dolook at her
dont listen to her

GERALD  But women are awfully clever arent they

LORD ILLINGWORTH  One should always tell them so  But to the
philosopher my dear Gerald women represent the triumph of matter over
mindjust as men represent the triumph of mind over morals

GERALD  How then can women have so much power as you say they have

LORD ILLINGWORTH  The history of women is the history of the worst form
of tyranny the world has ever known  The tyranny of the weak over the
strong  It is the only tyranny that lasts

GERALD  But havent women got a refining influence

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Nothing refines but the intellect

GERALD  Still there are many different kinds of women arent there

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Only two kinds in society the plain and the coloured

GERALD  But there are good women in society arent there

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Far too many

GERALD  But do you think women shouldnt be good

LORD ILLINGWORTH  One should never tell them so theyd all become good
at once  Women are a fascinatingly wilful sex  Every woman is a rebel
and usually in wild revolt against herself

GERALD  You have never been married Lord Illingworth have you

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Men marry because they are tired women because they
are curious  Both are disappointed

GERALD  But dont you think one can be happy when one is married

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Perfectly happy  But the happiness of a married man
my dear Gerald depends on the people he has not married

GERALD  But if one is in love

LORD ILLINGWORTH  One should always be in love  That is the reason one
should never marry

GERALD  Love is a very wonderful thing isnt it

LORD ILLINGWORTH  When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself
And one ends by deceiving others  That is what the world calls a
romance  But a really grande passion is comparatively rare nowadays
It is the privilege of people who have nothing to do  That is the one
use of the idle classes in a country and the only possible explanation
of us Harfords

GERALD  Harfords Lord Illingworth

LORD ILLINGWORTH  That is my family name  You should study the Peerage
Gerald  It is the one book a young man about town should know
thoroughly and it is the best thing in fiction the English have ever
done  And now Gerald you are going into a perfectly new life with me
and I want you to know how to live  MRS ARBUTHNOT appears on terrace
behind  For the world has been made by fools that wise men should live
in it

Enter LC LADY HUNSTANTON and DR DAUBENY

LADY HUNSTANTON  Ah here you are dear Lord Illingworth  Well I
suppose you have been telling our young friend Gerald what his new
duties are to be and giving him a great deal of good advice over a
pleasant cigarette

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I have been giving him the best of advice Lady
Hunstanton and the best of cigarettes

LADY HUNSTANTON  I am so sorry I was not here to listen to you but I
suppose I am too old now to learn  Except from you dear Archdeacon
when you are in your nice pulpit  But then I always know what you are
going to say so I dont feel alarmed  Sees MRS ARBUTHNOT  Ah
dear Mrs Arbuthnot do come and join us  Come dear  Enter MRS
ARBUTHNOT  Gerald has been having such a long talk with Lord
Illingworth I am sure you must feel very much flattered at the pleasant
way in which everything has turned out for him  Let us sit down  They
sit down  And how is your beautiful embroidery going on

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I am always at work Lady Hunstanton

LADY HUNSTANTON  Mrs Daubeny embroiders a little too doesnt she

THE ARCHDEACON  She was very deft with her needle once quite a Dorcas
But the gout has crippled her fingers a good deal  She has not touched
the tambour frame for nine or ten years  But she has many other
amusements  She is very much interested in her own health

LADY HUNSTANTON  Ah that is always a nice distraction in it not  Now
what are you talking about Lord Illingworth  Do tell us

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I was on the point of explaining to Gerald that the
world has always laughed at its own tragedies that being the only way in
which it has been able to bear them  And that consequently whatever
the world has treated seriously belongs to the comedy side of things

LADY HUNSTANTON  Now I am quite out of my depth  I usually am when Lord
Illingworth says anything  And the Humane Society is most careless
They never rescue me  I am left to sink  I have a dim idea dear Lord
Illingworth that you are always on the side of the sinners and I know I
always try to be on the side of the saints but that is as far as I get
And after all it may be merely the fancy of a drowning person

LORD ILLINGWORTH  The only difference between the saint and the sinner
is that every saint has a past and every sinner has a future

LADY HUNSTANTON  Ah that quite does for me  I havent a word to say
You and I dear Mrs Arbuthnot are behind the age  We cant follow Lord
Illingworth  Too much care was taken with our education I am afraid
To have been well brought up is a great drawback nowadays  It shuts one
out from so much

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I should be sorry to follow Lord Illingworth in any of
his opinions

LADY HUNSTANTON  You are quite right dear

GERALD shrugs his shoulders and looks irritably over at his mother
Enter LADY CAROLINE

LADY CAROLINE  Jane have you seen John anywhere

LADY HUNSTANTON  You neednt be anxious about him dear  He is with
Lady Stutfield I saw them some time ago in the Yellow Drawingroom
They seem quite happy together  You are not going Caroline  Pray sit
down

LADY CAROLINE  I think I had better look after John

Exit LADY CAROLINE

LADY HUNSTANTON  It doesnt do to pay men so much attention  And
Caroline has really nothing to be anxious about  Lady Stutfield is very
sympathetic  She is just as sympathetic about one thing as she is about
another  A beautiful nature

Enter SIR JOHN and MRS ALLONBY

Ah here is Sir John  And with Mrs Allonby too  I suppose it was Mrs
Allonby I saw him with  Sir John Caroline has been looking everywhere
for you

MRS ALLONBY  We have been waiting for her in the Musicroom dear Lady
Hunstanton

LADY HUNSTANTON  Ah the Musicroom of course  I thought it was the
Yellow Drawingroom my memory is getting so defective  To the
ARCHDEACON  Mrs Daubeny has a wonderful memory hasnt she

THE ARCHDEACON  She used to be quite remarkable for her memory but
since her last attack she recalls chiefly the events of her early
childhood  But she finds great pleasure in such retrospections great
pleasure

Enter LADY STUTFIELD and MR KELVIL

LADY HUNSTANTON  Ah dear Lady Stutfield and what has Mr Kelvil been
talking to you about

LADY STUTFIELD  About Bimetallism as well as I remember

LADY HUNSTANTON  Bimetallism  Is that quite a nice subject  However I
know people discuss everything very freely nowadays  What did Sir John
talk to you about dear Mrs Allonby

MRS ALLONBY  About Patagonia

LADY HUNSTANTON  Really  What a remote topic  But very improving I
have no doubt

MRS ALLONBY  He has been most interesting on the subject of Patagonia
Savages seem to have quite the same views as cultured people on almost
all subjects  They are excessively advanced

LADY HUNSTANTON  What do they do

MRS ALLONBY  Apparently everything

LADY HUNSTANTON  Well it is very gratifying dear Archdeacon is it
not to find that Human Nature is permanently oneOn the whole the
world is the same world is it not

LORD ILLINGWORTH  The world is simply divided into two classesthose who
believe the incredible like the publicand those who do the improbable

MRS ALLONBY  Like yourself

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Yes I am always astonishing myself  It is the only
thing that makes life worth living

LADY STUTFIELD  And what have you been doing lately that astonishes you

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I have been discovering all kinds of beautiful
qualities in my own nature

MRS ALLONBY  Ah dont become quite perfect all at once  Do it
gradually

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I dont intend to grow perfect at all  At least I
hope I shant  It would be most inconvenient  Women love us for our
defects  If we have enough of them they will forgive us everything
even our gigantic intellects

MRS ALLONBY  It is premature to ask us to forgive analysis  We forgive
adoration that is quite as much as should be expected from us

Enter LORD ALFRED  He joins LADY STUTFIELD

LADY HUNSTANTON  Ah we women should forgive everything shouldnt we
dear Mrs Arbuthnot  I am sure you agree with me in that

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I do not Lady Hunstanton  I think there are many
things women should never forgive

LADY HUNSTANTON  What sort of things

MRS ARBUTHNOT  The ruin of another womans life

Moves slowly away to back of stage

LADY HUNSTANTON  Ah those things are very sad no doubt but I believe
there are admirable homes where people of that kind are looked after and
reformed and I think on the whole that the secret of life is to take
things very very easily

MRS ALLONBY  The secret of life is never to have an emotion that is
unbecoming

LADY STUTFIELD  The secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure of
being terribly terribly deceived

KELVIL  The secret of life is to resist temptation Lady Stutfield

LORD ILLINGWORTH  There is no secret of life  Lifes aim if it has
one is simply to be always looking for temptations  There are not
nearly enough  I sometimes pass a whole day without coming across a
single one  It is quite dreadful  It makes one so nervous about the
future

LADY HUNSTANTON  Shakes her fan at him  I dont know how it is
dear Lord Illingworth but everything you have said today seems to me
excessively immoral  It has been most interesting listening to you

LORD ILLINGWORTH  All thought is immoral  Its very essence is
destruction  If you think of anything you kill it  Nothing survives
being thought of

LADY HUNSTANTON  I dont understand a word Lord Illingworth  But I
have no doubt it is all quite true  Personally I have very little to
reproach myself with on the score of thinking  I dont believe in women
thinking too much  Women should think in moderation as they should do
all things in moderation

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Moderation is a fatal thing Lady Hunstanton  Nothing
succeeds like excess

LADY HUNSTANTON  I hope I shall remember that  It sounds an admirable
maxim  But Im beginning to forget everything  Its a great misfortune

LORD ILLINGWORTH  It is one of your most fascinating qualities Lady
Hunstanton  No woman should have a memory  Memory in a woman is the
beginning of dowdiness  One can always tell from a womans bonnet
whether she has got a memory or not

LADY HUNSTANTON  How charming you are dear Lord Illingworth  You
always find out that ones most glaring fault is ones most important
virtue  You have the most comforting views of life

Enter FARQUHAR

FARQUHAR  Doctor Daubenys carriage

LADY HUNSTANTON  My dear Archdeacon  It is only halfpast ten

THE ARCHDEACON  Rising  I am afraid I must go Lady Hunstanton
Tuesday is always one of Mrs Daubenys bad nights

LADY HUNSTANTON  Rising  Well I wont keep you from her  Goes
with him towards door  I have told Farquhar to put a brace of
partridge into the carriage  Mrs Daubeny may fancy them

THE ARCHDEACON  It is very kind of you but Mrs Daubeny never touches
solids now  Lives entirely on jellies  But she is wonderfully cheerful
wonderfully cheerful  She has nothing to complain of

Exit with LADY HUNSTANTON

MRS ALLONBY  Goes over to LORD ILLINGWORTH  There is a beautiful
moon tonight

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Let us go and look at it  To look at anything that is
inconstant is charming nowadays

MRS ALLONBY  You have your lookingglass

LORD ILLINGWORTH  It is unkind  It merely shows me my wrinkles

MRS ALLONBY  Mine is better behaved  It never tells me the truth

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Then it is in love with you

Exeunt SIR JOHN LADY STUTFIELD MR KELVIL and LORD ALFRED

GERALD  To LORD ILLINGWORTH  May I come too

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Do my dear boy  Moves towards with MRS ALLONBY
and GERALD

LADY CAROLINE enters looks rapidly round and goes off in opposite
direction to that taken by SIR JOHN and LADY STUTFIELD

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Gerald

GERALD  What mother

Exit LORD ILLINGWORTH with MRS ALLONBY

MRS ARBUTHNOT  It is getting late  Let us go home

GERALD  My dear mother  Do let us wait a little longer  Lord
Illingworth is so delightful and by the way mother I have a great
surprise for you  We are starting for India at the end of this month

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Let us go home

GERALD  If you really want to of course mother but I must bid
goodbye to Lord Illingworth first  Ill be back in five minutes
Exit

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Let him leave me if he chooses but not with himnot
with him  I couldnt bear it  Walks up and down

Enter HESTER

HESTER  What a lovely night it is Mrs Arbuthnot

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Is it

HESTER  Mrs Arbuthnot I wish you would let us be friends  You are so
different from the other women here  When you came into the Drawingroom
this evening somehow you brought with you a sense of what is good and
pure in life  I had been foolish  There are things that are right to
say but that may be said at the wrong time and to the wrong people

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I heard what you said  I agree with it Miss Worsley

HESTER  I didnt know you had heard it  But I knew you would agree with
me  A woman who has sinned should be punished shouldnt she

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Yes

HESTER  She shouldnt be allowed to come into the society of good men
and women

MRS ARBUTHNOT  She should not

HESTER  And the man should be punished in the same way

MRS ARBUTHNOT  In the same way  And the children if there are
children in the same way also

HESTER  Yes it is right that the sins of the parents should be visited
on the children  It is a just law  It is Gods law

MRS ARBUTHNOT  It is one of Gods terrible laws

Moves away to fireplace

HESTER  You are distressed about your son leaving you Mrs Arbuthnot

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Yes

HESTER  Do you like him going away with Lord Illingworth  Of course
there is position no doubt and money but position and money are not
everything are they

MRS ARBUTHNOT  They are nothing they bring misery

HESTER  Then why do you let your son go with him

MRS ARBUTHNOT  He wishes it himself

HESTER  But if you asked him he would stay would he not

MRS ARBUTHNOT  He has set his heart on going

HESTER  He couldnt refuse you anything  He loves you too much  Ask
him to stay  Let me send him in to you  He is on the terrace at this
moment with Lord Illingworth  I heard them laughing together as I passed
through the Musicroom

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Dont trouble Miss Worsley I can wait  It is of no
consequence

HESTER  No Ill tell him you want him  Dodo ask him to stay  Exit
HESTER

MRS ARBUTHNOT  He wont comeI know he wont come

Enter LADY CAROLINE  She looks round anxiously  Enter GERALD

LADY CAROLINE  Mr Arbuthnot may I ask you is Sir John anywhere on the
terrace

GERALD  No Lady Caroline he is not on the terrace

LADY CAROLINE  It is very curious  It is time for him to retire

Exit LADY CAROLINE

GERALD  Dear mother I am afraid I kept you waiting  I forgot all about
it  I am so happy tonight mother I have never been so happy

MRS ARBUTHNOT  At the prospect of going away

GERALD  Dont put it like that mother  Of course I am sorry to leave
you  Why you are the best mother in the whole world  But after all as
Lord Illingworth says it is impossible to live in such a place as
Wrockley  You dont mind it  But Im ambitions I want something more
than that  I want to have a career  I want to do something that will
make you proud of me and Lord Illingworth is going to help me  He is
going to do everything for me

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Gerald dont go away with Lord Illingworth  I implore
you not to  Gerald I beg you

GERALD  Mother how changeable you are  You dont seem to know your own
mind for a single moment  An hour and a half ago in the Drawingroom you
agreed to the whole thing now you turn round and make objections and
try to force me to give up my one chance in life  Yes my one chance
You dont suppose that men like Lord Illingworth are to be found every
day do you mother  It is very strange that when I have had such a
wonderful piece of good luck the one person to put difficulties in my
way should be my own mother  Besides you know mother I love Hester
Worsley  Who could help loving her  I love her more than I have ever
told you far more  And if I had a position if I had prospects I
couldI could ask her toDont you understand now mother what it means
to me to be Lord Illingworths secretary  To start like that is to find
a career ready for onebefore onewaiting for one  If I were Lord
Illingworths secretary I could ask Hester to be my wife  As a wretched
bank clerk with a hundred a year it would be an impertinence

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I fear you need have no hopes of Miss Worsley  I know
her views on life  She has just told them to me  A pause

GERALD  Then I have my ambition left at any rate  That is somethingI
am glad I have that  You have always tried to crush my ambition
motherhavent you  You have told me that the world is a wicked place
that success is not worth having that society is shallow and all that
sort of thingwell I dont believe it mother  I think the world must
be delightful  I think society must be exquisite  I think success is a
thing worth having  You have been wrong in all that you taught me
mother quite wrong  Lord Illingworth is a successful man  He is a
fashionable man  He is a man who lives in the world and for it  Well I
would give anything to be just like Lord Illingworth

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I would sooner see you dead

GERALD  Mother what is your objection to Lord Illingworth  Tell
metell me right out  What is it

MRS ARBUTHNOT  He is a bad man

GERALD  In what way bad  I dont understand what you mean

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I will tell you

GERALD  I suppose you think him bad because he doesnt believe the same
things as you do  Well men are different from women mother  It is
natural that they should have different views

MRS ARBUTHNOT  It is not what Lord Illingworth believes or what he
does not believe that makes him bad  It is what he is

GERALD  Mother is it something you know of him  Something you actually
know

MRS ARBUTHNOT  It is something I know

GERALD  Something you are quite sure of

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Quite sure of

GERALD  How long have you known it

MRS ARBUTHNOT  For twenty years

GERALD  Is it fair to go back twenty years in any mans career  And
what have you or I to do with Lord Illingworths early life  What
business is it of ours

MRS ARBUTHNOT  What this man has been he is now and will be always

GERALD  Mother tell me what Lord Illingworth did  If he did anything
shameful I will not go away with him  Surely you know me well enough
for that

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Gerald come near to me  Quite close to me as you used
to do when you were a little boy when you were mothers own boy
GERALD sits down betide his mother  She runs her fingers through his
hair and strokes his hands  Gerald there was a girl once she was
very young she was little over eighteen at the time  George
Harfordthat was Lord Illingworths name thenGeorge Harford met her
She knew nothing about life  Heknew everything  He made this girl love
him  He made her love him so much that she left her fathers house with
him one morning  She loved him so much and he had promised to marry
her  He had solemnly promised to marry her and she had believed him
She was very young andand ignorant of what life really is  But he put
the marriage off from week to week and month to monthShe trusted in
him all the while  She loved himBefore her child was bornfor she had
a childshe implored him for the childs sake to marry her that the
child might have a name that her sin might not be visited on the child
who was innocent  He refused  After the child was born she left him
taking the child away and her life was ruined and her soul ruined and
all that was sweet and good and pure in her ruined also  She suffered
terriblyshe suffers now  She will always suffer  For her there is no
joy no peace no atonement  She is a woman who drags a chain like a
guilty thing  She is a woman who wears a mask like a thing that is a
leper  The fire cannot purify her  The waters cannot quench her
anguish  Nothing can heal her no anodyne can give her sleep no poppies
forgetfulness  She is lost  She is a lost soulThat is why I call Lord
Illingworth a bad man  That is why I dont want my boy to be with him

GERALD  My dear mother it all sounds very tragic of course  But I
dare say the girl was just as much to blame as Lord Illingworth
wasAfter all would a really nice girl a girl with any nice feelings
at all go away from her home with a man to whom she was not married and
live with him as his wife  No nice girl would

MRS ARBUTHNOT  After a pause  Gerald I withdraw all my
objections  You are at liberty to go away with Lord Illingworth when
and where you choose

GERALD  Dear mother I knew you wouldnt stand in my way  You are the
best woman God ever made  And as for Lord Illingworth I dont believe
he is capable of anything infamous or base  I cant believe it of himI
cant

HESTER  Outside  Let me go  Let me go  Enter HESTER in
terror and rushes over to GERALD and flings herself in his arms

HESTER  Oh save mesave me from him

GERALD  From whom

HESTER  He has insulted me  Horribly insulted me  Save me

GERALD  Who  Who has dared

LORD ILLINGWORTH enters at back of stage  HESTER breaks from
GERALDS arms and points to him

GERALD  He is quite beside himself with rage and indignation  Lord
Illingworth you have insulted the purest thing on Gods earth a thing
as pure as my own mother  You have insulted the woman I love most in the
world with my own mother  As there is a God in Heaven I will kill you

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Rushing across and catching hold of him  No no

GERALD  Thrusting her back  Dont hold me mother  Dont hold
meIll kill him

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Gerald

GERALD  Let me go I say

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Stop Gerald stop  He is your own father

GERALD clutches his mothers hands and looks into her face  She
sinks slowly on the ground in shame  HESTER steals towards the door
LORD ILLINGWORTH frowns and bites his lip  After a time GERALD
raises his mother up puts his am round her and leads her from the
room

FOURTH ACT


                                  SCENE

Sittingroom at Mrs Arbuthnots  Large open French window at back
looking on to garden  Doors RC and LC

GERALD ARBUTHNOT writing at table

Enter ALICE RC followed by LADY HUNSTANTON and MRS ALLONBY

ALICE  Lady Hunstanton and Mrs Allonby

Exit LC

LADY HUNSTANTON  Good morning Gerald

GERALD  Rising  Good morning Lady Hunstanton  Good morning Mrs
Allonby

LADY HUNSTANTON  Sitting down  We came to inquire for your dear
mother Gerald  I hope she is better

GERALD  My mother has not come down yet Lady Hunstanton

LADY HUNSTANTON  Ah I am afraid the heat was too much for her last
night  I think there must have been thunder in the air  Or perhaps it
was the music  Music makes one feel so romanticat least it always gets
on ones nerves

MRS ALLONBY  Its the same thing nowadays

LADY HUNSTANTON  I am so glad I dont know what you mean dear  I am
afraid you mean something wrong  Ah I see youre examining Mrs
Arbuthnots pretty room  Isnt it nice and oldfashioned

MRS ALLONBY  Surveying the room through her lorgnette  It looks
quite the happy English home

LADY HUNSTANTON  Thats just the word dear that just describes it
One feels your mothers good influence in everything she has about her
Gerald

MRS ALLONBY  Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad but that
a good influence is the worst in the world

LADY HUNSTANTON  When Lord Illingworth knows Mrs Arbuthnot better he
will change his mind  I must certainly bring him here

MRS ALLONBY  I should like to see Lord Illingworth in a happy English
home

LADY HUNSTANTON  It would do him a great deal of good dear  Most women
in London nowadays seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but
orchids foreigners and French novels  But here we have the room of a
sweet saint  Fresh natural flowers books that dont shock one pictures
that one can look at without blushing

MRS ALLONBY  But I like blushing

LADY HUNSTANTON  Well there is a good deal to be said for blushing
if one can do it at the proper moment  Poor dear Hunstanton used to tell
me I didnt blush nearly often enough  But then he was so very
particular  He wouldnt let me know any of his men friends except those
who were over seventy like poor Lord Ashton who afterwards by the way
was brought into the Divorce Court  A most unfortunate case

MRS ALLONBY  I delight in men over seventy  They always offer one the
devotion of a lifetime  I think seventy an ideal age for a man

LADY HUNSTANTON  She is quite incorrigible Gerald isnt she
Bytheby Gerald I hope your dear mother will come and see me more
often now  You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately dont you

GERALD  I have given up my intention of being Lord Illingworths
secretary

LADY HUNSTANTON  Surely not Gerald  It would be most unwise of you
What reason can you have

GERALD  I dont think I should be suitable for the post

MRS ALLONBY  I wish Lord Illingworth would ask me to be his secretary
But he says I am not serious enough

LADY HUNSTANTON  My dear you really mustnt talk like that in this
house  Mrs Arbuthnot doesnt know anything about the wicked society in
which we all live  She wont go into it  She is far too good  I
consider it was a great honour her coming to me last night  It gave
quite an atmosphere of respectability to the party

MRS ALLONBY  Ah that must have been what you thought was thunder in
the air

LADY HUNSTANTON  My dear how can you say that  There is no resemblance
between the two things at all  But really Gerald what do you mean by
not being suitable

GERALD  Lord Illingworths views of life and mine are too different

LADY HUNSTANTON  But my dear Gerald at your age you shouldnt have any
views of life  They are quite out of place  You must be guided by
others in this matter  Lord Illingworth has made you the most flattering
offer and travelling with him you would see the worldas much of it at
least as one should look atunder the best auspices possible and stay
with all the right people which is so important at this solemn moment in
your career

GERALD  I dont want to see the world Ive seen enough of it

MRS ALLONBY  I hope you dont think you have exhausted life Mr
Arbuthnot  When a man says that one knows that life has exhausted him

GERALD  I dont wish to leave my mother

LADY HUNSTANTON  Now Gerald that is pure laziness on your part  Not
leave your mother  If I were your mother I would insist on your going

Enter ALICE LC

ALICE  Mrs Arbuthnots compliments my lady but she has a bad
headache and cannot see any one this morning  Exit RC

LADY HUNSTANTON  Rising  A bad headache  I am so sorry  Perhaps
youll bring her up to Hunstanton this afternoon if she is better
Gerald

GERALD  I am afraid not this afternoon Lady Hunstanton

LADY HUNSTANTON  Well tomorrow then  Ah if you had a father
Gerald he wouldnt let you waste your life here  He would send you off
with Lord Illingworth at once  But mothers are so weak  They give up to
their sons in everything  We are all heart all heart  Come dear I
must call at the rectory and inquire for Mrs Daubeny who I am afraid
is far from well  It is wonderful how the Archdeacon bears up quite
wonderful  He is the most sympathetic of husbands  Quite a model
Goodbye Gerald give my fondest love to your mother

MRS ALLONBY  Goodbye Mr Arbuthnot

GERALD  Goodbye

Exit LADY HUNSTANTON and MRS ALLONBY  GERALD sits down and reads
over his letter

GERALD  What name can I sign  I who have no right to any name
Signs name puts letter into envelope addresses it and is about
to seal it when door LC opens and MRS ARBUTHNOT enters
GERALD lays down sealingwax  Mother and son look at each other

LADY HUNSTANTON  Through French window at the back  Goodbye again
Gerald  We are taking the short cut across your pretty garden  Now
remember my advice to youstart at once with Lord Illingworth

MRS ALLONBY  Au revoir Mr Arbuthnot  Mind you bring me back
something nice from your travelsnot an Indian shawlon no account an
Indian shawl

Exeunt

GERALD  Mother I have just written to him

MRS ARBUTHNOT  To whom

GERALD  To my father  I have written to tell him to come here at four
oclock this afternoon

MRS ARBUTHNOT  He shall not come here  He shall not cross the
threshold of my house

GERALD  He must come

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Gerald if you are going away with Lord Illingworth go
at once  Go before it kills me but dont ask me to meet him

GERALD  Mother you dont understand  Nothing in the world would induce
me to go away with Lord Illingworth or to leave you  Surely you know me
well enough for that  No I have written to him to say

MRS ARBUTHNOT  What can you have to say to him

GERALD  Cant you guess mother what I have written in this letter

MRS ARBUTHNOT  No

GERALD  Mother surely you can  Think think what must be done now at
once within the next few days

MRS ARBUTHNOT  There is nothing to be done

GERALD  I have written to Lord Illingworth to tell him that he must
marry you

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Marry me

GERALD  Mother I will force him to do it  The wrong that has been done
you must be repaired  Atonement must be made  Justice may be slow
mother but it comes in the end  In a few days you shall be Lord
Illingworths lawful wife

MRS ARBUTHNOT  But Gerald

GERALD  I will insist upon his doing it  I will make him do it he will
not dare to refuse

MRS ARBUTHNOT  But Gerald it is I who refuse  I will not marry Lord
Illingworth

GERALD  Not marry him  Mother

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I will not marry him

GERALD  But you dont understand it is for your sake I am talking not
for mine  This marriage this necessary marriage this marriage which
for obvious reasons must inevitably take place will not help me will
not give me a name that will be really rightly mine to bear  But surely
it will be something for you that you my mother should however late
become the wife of the man who is my father  Will not that be something

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I will not marry him

GERALD  Mother you must

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I will not  You talk of atonement for a wrong done
What atonement can be made to me  There is no atonement possible  I am
disgraced he is not  That is all  It is the usual history of a man and
a woman as it usually happens as it always happens  And the ending is
the ordinary ending  The woman suffers  The man goes free

GERALD  I dont know if that is the ordinary ending mother I hope it
is not  But your life at any rate shall not end like that  The man
shall make whatever reparation is possible  It is not enough  It does
not wipe out the past I know that  But at least it makes the future
better better for you mother

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I refuse to marry Lord Illingworth

GERALD  If he came to you himself and asked you to be his wife you would
give him a different answer  Remember he is my father

MRS ARBUTHNOT  If he came himself which he will not do my answer
would be the same  Remember I am your mother

GERALD  Mother you make it terribly difficult for me by talking like
that and I cant understand why you wont look at this matter from the
right from the only proper standpoint  It is to take away the
bitterness out of your life to take away the shadow that lies on your
name that this marriage must take place  There is no alternative and
after the marriage you and I can go away together  But the marriage must
take place first  It is a duty that you owe not merely to yourself but
to all other womenyes to all the other women in the world lest he
betray more

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I owe nothing to other women  There is not one of them
to help me  There is not one woman in the world to whom I could go for
pity if I would take it or for sympathy if I could win it  Women are
hard on each other  That girl last night good though she is fled from
the room as though I were a tainted thing  She was right  I am a
tainted thing  But my wrongs are my own and I will bear them alone  I
must bear them alone  What have women who have not sinned to do with me
or I with them  We do not understand each other

Enter HESTER behind

GERALD  I implore you to do what I ask you

MRS ARBUTHNOT  What son has ever asked of his mother to make so hideous
a sacrifice  None

GERALD  What mother has ever refused to marry the father of her own
child  None

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Let me be the first then  I will not do it

GERALD  Mother you believe in religion and you brought me up to
believe in it also  Well surely your religion the religion that you
taught me when I was a boy mother must tell you that I am right  You
know it you feel it

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I do not know it  I do not feel it nor will I ever
stand before Gods altar and ask Gods blessing on so hideous a mockery
as a marriage between me and George Harford  I will not say the words
the Church bids us to say  I will not say them  I dare not  How could
I swear to love the man I loathe to honour him who wrought you
dishonour to obey him who in his mastery made me to sin  No marriage
is a sacrament for those who love each other  It is not for such as him
or such as me  Gerald to save you from the worlds sneers and taunts I
have lied to the world  For twenty years I have lied to the world  I
could not tell the world the truth  Who can ever  But not for my own
sake will I lie to God and in Gods presence  No Gerald no ceremony
Churchhallowed or Statemade shall ever bind me to George Harford  It
may be that I am too bound to him already who robbing me yet left me
richer so that in the mire of my life I found the pearl of price or
what I thought would be so

GERALD  I dont understand you now

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Men dont understand what mothers are  I am no
different from other women except in the wrong done me and the wrong I
did and my very heavy punishments and great disgrace  And yet to bear
you I had to look on death  To nurture you I had to wrestle with it
Death fought with me for you  All women have to fight with death to keep
their children  Death being childless wants our children from us
Gerald when you were naked I clothed you when you were hungry I gave
you food  Night and day all that long winter I tended you  No office is
too mean no care too lowly for the thing we women loveand oh how I
loved you  Not Hannah Samuel more  And you needed love for you were
weakly and only love could have kept you alive  Only love can keep any
one alive  And boys are careless often and without thinking give pain
and we always fancy that when they come to mans estate and know us
better they will repay us  But it is not so  The world draws them from
our side and they make friends with whom they are happier than they are
with us and have amusements from which we are barred and interests that
are not ours and they are unjust to us often for when they find life
bitter they blame us for it and when they find it sweet we do not taste
its sweetness with them    You made many friends and went into their
houses and were glad with them and I knowing my secret did not dare to
follow but stayed at home and closed the door shut out the sun and sat
in darkness  What should I have done in honest households  My past was
ever with me    And you thought I didnt care for the pleasant things
of life  I tell you I longed for them but did not dare to touch them
feeling I had no right  You thought I was happier working amongst the
poor  That was my mission you imagined  It was not but where else was
I to go  The sick do not ask if the hand that smooths their pillow is
pure nor the dying care if the lips that touch their brow have known the
kiss of sin  It was you I thought of all the time I gave to them the
love you did not need lavished on them a love that was not theirs   
And you thought I spent too much of my time in going to Church and in
Church duties  But where else could I turn  Gods house is the only
house where sinners are made welcome and you were always in my heart
Gerald too much in my heart  For though day after day at morn or
evensong I have knelt in Gods house I have never repented of my sin
How could I repent of my sin when you my love were its fruit  Even now
that you are bitter to me I cannot repent  I do not  You are more to me
than innocence  I would rather be your motheroh much ratherthan have
been always pure    Oh dont you see dont you understand  It is my
dishonour that has made you so dear to me  It is my disgrace that has
bound you so closely to me  It is the price I paid for youthe price of
soul and bodythat makes me love you as I do  Oh dont ask me to do
this horrible thing  Child of my shame be still the child of my shame

GERALD  Mother I didnt know you loved me so much as that  And I will
be a better son to you than I have been  And you and I must never leave
each other    but mother    I cant help it    you must become
my fathers wife  You must marry him  It is your duty

HESTER  Running forwards and embracing MRS ARBUTHNOT  No no you
shall not  That would be real dishonour the first you have ever known
That would be real disgrace the first to touch you  Leave him and come
with me  There are other countries than England    Oh other
countries over sea better wiser and less unjust lands  The world is
very wide and very big

MRS ARBUTHNOT  No not for me  For me the world is shrivelled to a
palms breadth and where I walk there are thorns

HESTER  It shall not be so  We shall somewhere find green valleys and
fresh waters and if we weep well we shall weep together  Have we not
both loved him

GERALD  Hester

HESTER  Waving him back  Dont dont  You cannot love me at all
unless you love her also  You cannot honour me unless shes holier to
you  In her all womanhood is martyred  Not she alone but all of us are
stricken in her house

GERALD  Hester Hester what shall I do

HESTER  Do you respect the man who is your father

GERALD  Respect him  I despise him  He is infamous

HESTER  I thank you for saving me from him last night

GERALD  Ah that is nothing  I would die to save you  But you dont
tell me what to do now

HESTER  Have I not thanked you for saving me

GERALD  But what should I do

HESTER  Ask your own heart not mine  I never had a mother to save or
shame

MRS ARBUTHNOT  He is hardhe is hard  Let me go away

GERALD  Rushes over and kneels down bedside his mother  Mother
forgive me I have been to blame

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Dont kiss my hands they are cold  My heart is cold
something has broken it

HESTER  Ah dont say that  Hearts live by being wounded  Pleasure may
turn a heart to stone riches may make it callous but sorrowoh sorrow
cannot break it  Besides what sorrows have you now  Why at this
moment you are more dear to him than ever dear though you have been
and oh how dear you have been always  Ah be kind to him

GERALD  You are my mother and my father all in one  I need no second
parent  It was for you I spoke for you alone  Oh say something
mother  Have I but found one love to lose another  Dont tell me that
O mother you are cruel  Gets up and flings himself sobbing on a
sofa

MRS ARBUTHNOT  To HESTER  But has he found indeed another love

HESTER  You know I have loved him always

MRS ARBUTHNOT  But we are very poor

HESTER  Who being loved is poor  Oh no one  I hate my riches  They
are a burden  Let him share it with me

MRS ARBUTHNOT  But we are disgraced  We rank among the outcasts Gerald
is nameless  The sins of the parents should be visited on the children
It is Gods law

HESTER  I was wrong  Gods law is only Love

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Rises and taking HESTER by the hand goes
slowly over to where GERALD is lying on the sofa with his head buried
in his hands  She touches him and he looks up  Gerald I cannot
give you a father but I have brought you a wife

GERALD  Mother I am not worthy either of her or you

MRS ARBUTHNOT  So she comes first you are worthy  And when you are
away Gerald    with    heroh think of me sometimes  Dont
forget me  And when you pray pray for me  We should pray when we are
happiest and you will be happy Gerald

HESTER  Oh you dont think of leaving us

GERALD  Mother you wont leave us

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I might bring shame upon you

GERALD  Mother

MRS ARBUTHNOT  For a little then and if you let me near you always

HESTER  To MRS ARBUTHNOT  Come out with us to the garden

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Later on later on  Exeunt HESTER and GERALD
MRS ARBUTHNOT goes towards door LC   Stops at lookingglass over
mantelpiece and looks into it  Enter ALICE RC

ALICE  A gentleman to see you maam

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Say I am not at home  Show me the card  Takes card
from salver and looks at it  Say I will not see him

LORD ILLINGWORTH enters  MRS ARBUTHNOT sees him in the glass and
starts but does not turn round  Exit ALICE  What can you have to
say to me today George Harford  You can have nothing to say to me
You must leave this house

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Rachel Gerald knows everything about you and me now
so some arrangement must be come to that will suit us all three  I
assure you he will find in me the most charming and generous of fathers

MRS ARBUTHNOT  My son may come in at any moment  I saved you last
night  I may not be able to save you again  My son feels my dishonour
strongly terribly strongly  I beg you to go

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Sitting down  Last night was excessively
unfortunate  That silly Puritan girl making a scene merely because I
wanted to kiss her  What harm is there in a kiss

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Turning round  A kiss may ruin a human life George
Harford  I know that  I know that too well

LORD ILLINGWORTH  We wont discuss that at present  What is of
importance today as yesterday is still our son  I am extremely fond
of him as you know and odd though it may seem to you I admired his
conduct last night immensely  He took up the cudgels for that pretty
prude with wonderful promptitude  He is just what I should have liked a
son of mine to be  Except that no son of mine should ever take the side
of the Puritans that is always an error  Now what I propose is this

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Lord Illingworth no proposition of yours interests me

LORD ILLINGWORTH  According to our ridiculous English laws I cant
legitimise Gerald  But I can leave him my property  Illingworth is
entailed of course but it is a tedious barrack of a place  He can have
Ashby which is much prettier Harborough which has the best shooting in
the north of England and the house in St James Square  What more can a
gentleman require in this world

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Nothing more I am quite sure

LORD ILLINGWORTH  As for a title a title is really rather a nuisance in
these democratic days  As George Harford I had everything I wanted  Now
I have merely everything that other people want which isnt nearly so
pleasant  Well my proposal is this

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I told you I was not interested and I beg you to go

LORD ILLINGWORTH  The boy is to be with you for six months in the year
and with me for the other six  That is perfectly fair is it not  You
can have whatever allowance you like and live where you choose  As for
your past no one knows anything about it except myself and Gerald
There is the Puritan of course the Puritan in white muslin but she
doesnt count  She couldnt tell the story without explaining that she
objected to being kissed could she  And all the women would think her a
fool and the men think her a bore  And you need not be afraid that
Gerald wont be my heir  I neednt tell you I have not the slightest
intention of marrying

MRS ARBUTHNOT  You come too late  My son has no need of you  You are
not necessary

LORD ILLINGWORTH  What do you mean Rachel

MRS ARBUTHNOT  That you are not necessary to Geralds career  He does
not require you

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I do not understand you

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Look into the garden  LORD ILLINGWORTH rises and goes
towards window  You had better not let them see you you bring
unpleasant memories  LORD ILLINGWORTH looks out and starts  She
loves him  They love each other  We are safe from you and we are going
away

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Where

MRS ARBUTHNOT  We will not tell you and if you find us we will not
know you  You seem surprised  What welcome would you get from the girl
whose lips you tried to soil from the boy whose life you have shamed
from the mother whose dishonour comes from you

LORD ILLINGWORTH  You have grown hard Rachel

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I was too weak once  It is well for me that I have
changed

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I was very young at the time  We men know life too
early

MRS ARBUTHNOT  And we women know life too late  That is the difference
between men and women  A pause

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Rachel I want my son  My money may be of no use to
him now  I may be of no use to him but I want my son  Bring us
together Rachel  You can do it if you choose  Sees letter on
table

MRS ARBUTHNOT  There is no room in my boys life for you  He is not
interested in you

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Then why does he write to me

MRS ARBUTHNOT  What do you mean

LORD ILLINGWORTH  What letter is this  Takes up letter

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Thatis nothing  Give it to me

LORD ILLINGWORTH  It is addressed to me

MRS ARBUTHNOT  You are not to open it  I forbid you to open it

LORD ILLINGWORTH  And in Geralds handwriting

MRS ARBUTHNOT  It was not to have been sent  It is a letter he wrote
to you this morning before he saw me  But he is sorry now he wrote it
very sorry  You are not to open it  Give it to me

LORD ILLINGWORTH  It belongs to me  Opens it sits down and reads
it slowly MRS ARBUTHNOT watches him all the time  You have read
this letter I suppose Rachel

MRS ARBUTHNOT  No

LORD ILLINGWORTH  You know what is in it

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Yes

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I dont admit for a moment that the boy is right in
what he says  I dont admit that it is any duty of mine to marry you  I
deny it entirely  But to get my son back I am readyyes I am ready to
marry you Racheland to treat you always with the deference and respect
due to my wife  I will marry you as soon as you choose  I give you my
word of honour

MRS ARBUTHNOT  You made that promise to me once before and broke it

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I will keep it now  And that will show you that I
love my son at least as much as you love him  For when I marry you
Rachel there are some ambitions I shall have to surrender  High
ambitions too if any ambition is high

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I decline to marry you Lord Illingworth

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Are you serious

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Yes

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Do tell me your reasons  They would interest me
enormously

MRS ARBUTHNOT  I have already explained them to my son

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I suppose they were intensely sentimental werent
they  You women live by your emotions and for them  You have no
philosophy of life

MRS ARBUTHNOT  You are right  We women live by our emotions and for
them  By our passions and for them if you will  I have two passions
Lord Illingworth my love of him my hate of you  You cannot kill those
They feed each other

LORD ILLINGWORTH  What sort of love is that which needs to have hate as
its brother

MRS ARBUTHNOT  It is the sort of love I have for Gerald  Do you think
that terrible  Well it is terrible  All love is terrible  All love is
a tragedy  I loved you once Lord Illingworth  Oh what a tragedy for a
woman to have loved you

LORD ILLINGWORTH  So you really refuse to marry me

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Yes

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Because you hate me

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Yes

LORD ILLINGWORTH  And does my son hate me as you do

MRS ARBUTHNOT  No

LORD ILLINGWORTH  I am glad of that Rachel

MRS ARBUTHNOT  He merely despises you

LORD ILLINGWORTH  What a pity  What a pity for him I mean

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Dont be deceived George  Children begin by loving
their parents  After a time they judge them  Rarely if ever do they
forgive them

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Reads letter over again very slowly  May I ask
by what arguments you made the boy who wrote this letter this beautiful
passionate letter believe that you should not marry his father the
father of your own child

MRS ARBUTHNOT  It was not I who made him see it  It was another

LORD ILLINGWORTH  What findesicle person

MRS ARBUTHNOT  The Puritan Lord Illingworth  A pause

LORD ILLINGWORTH  Winces then rises slowly and goes over to table
where his hat and gloves are  MRS ARBUTHNOT is standing close to the
table  He picks up one of the gloves and begins pulling it on
There is not much then for me to do here Rachel

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Nothing

LORD ILLINGWORTH  It is goodbye is it

MRS ARBUTHNOT  For ever I hope this time Lord Illingworth

LORD ILLINGWORTH  How curious  At this moment you look exactly as you
looked the night you left me twenty years ago  You have just the same
expression in your mouth  Upon my word Rachel no woman ever loved me
as you did  Why you gave yourself to me like a flower to do anything I
liked with  You were the prettiest of playthings the most fascinating
of small romances    Pulls out watch  Quarter to two  Must be
strolling back to Hunstanton  Dont suppose I shall see you there again
Im sorry I am really  Its been an amusing experience to have met
amongst people of ones own rank and treated quite seriously too ones
mistress and ones

MRS ARBUTHNOT snatches up glove and strikes LORD ILLINGWORTH across
the face with it  LORD ILLINGWORTH starts  He is dazed by the
insult of his punishment  Then he controls himself and goes to
window and looks out at his son  Sighs and leaves the room

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Falls sobbing on the sofa  He would have said it
He would have said it

Enter GERALD and HESTER from the garden

GERALD  Well dear mother  You never came out after all  So we have
come in to fetch you  Mother you have not been crying  Kneels down
beside her

MRS ARBUTHNOT  My boy  My boy  My boy  Running her fingers through
his hair

HESTER  Coming over  But you have two children now  Youll let me
be your daughter

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Looking up  Would you choose me for a mother

HESTER  You of all women I have ever known

They move towards the door leading into garden with their arms round
each others waists  GERALD goes to table LC for his hat  On
turning round he sees LORD ILLINGWORTHS glove lying on the floor
and picks it up

GERALD  Hallo mother whose glove is this  You have had a visitor
Who was it

MRS ARBUTHNOT  Turning round  Oh no one  No one in particular
A man of no importance

                                 CURTAIN
