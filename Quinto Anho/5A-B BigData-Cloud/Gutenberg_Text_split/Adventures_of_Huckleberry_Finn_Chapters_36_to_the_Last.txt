CHAPTER XXXVI

AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the
lightningrod and shut ourselves up in the leanto and got out our pile
of foxfire and went to work  We cleared everything out of the way
about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log  Tom said we
was right behind Jims bed now and wed dig in under it and when we got
through there couldnt nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole
there because Jims counterpin hung down most to the ground and youd
have to raise it up and look under to see the hole  So we dug and dug
with the caseknives till most midnight and then we was dogtired and
our hands was blistered and yet you couldnt see wed done anything
hardly  At last I says

This aint no thirtyseven year job this is a thirtyeight year job
Tom Sawyer

He never said nothing  But he sighed and pretty soon he stopped
digging and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking
Then he says

It aint no use Huck it aint agoing to work  If we was prisoners it
would because then wed have as many years as we wanted and no hurry
and we wouldnt get but a few minutes to dig every day while they was
changing watches and so our hands wouldnt get blistered and we could
keep it up right along year in and year out and do it right and the
way it ought to be done  But WE cant fool along we got to rush we
aint got no time to spare  If we was to put in another night this way
wed have to knock off for a week to let our hands get wellcouldnt
touch a caseknife with them sooner

Well then what we going to do Tom

Ill tell you  It aint right and it aint moral and I wouldnt like
it to get out but there aint only just the one way  we got to dig him
out with the picks and LET ON its caseknives

NOW youre TALKING  I says your head gets leveler and leveler all
the time Tom Sawyer I says  Picks is the thing moral or no moral
and as for me I dont care shucks for the morality of it nohow  When I
start in to steal a nigger or a watermelon or a Sundayschool book I
aint no ways particular how its done so its done  What I want is my
nigger or what I want is my watermelon or what I want is my
Sundayschool book and if a picks the handiest thing thats the thing
Im agoing to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sundayschool
book out with and I dont give a dead rat what the authorities thinks
about it nuther

Well he says theres excuse for picks and lettingon in a case like
this if it warnt so I wouldnt approve of it nor I wouldnt stand by
and see the rules brokebecause right is right and wrong is wrong and
a body aint got no business doing wrong when he aint ignorant and knows
better  It might answer for YOU to dig Jim out with a pick WITHOUT any
letting on because you dont know no better but it wouldnt for me
because I do know better  Gimme a caseknife

He had his own by him but I handed him mine  He flung it down and
says

Gimme a CASEKNIFE

I didnt know just what to dobut then I thought  I scratched around
amongst the old tools and got a pickaxe and give it to him and he took
it and went to work and never said a word

He was always just that particular  Full of principle

So then I got a shovel and then we picked and shoveled turn about and
made the fur fly  We stuck to it about a half an hour which was as long
as we could stand up but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it
When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing his
level best with the lightningrod but he couldnt come it his hands was
so sore  At last he says

It aint no use it cant be done  What you reckon I better do  Cant
you think of no way

Yes I says but I reckon it aint regular  Come up the stairs and
let on its a lightningrod

So he done it

Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house
for to make some pens for Jim out of and six tallow candles and I hung
around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance and stole three tin
plates  Tom says it wasnt enough but I said nobody wouldnt ever see
the plates that Jim throwed out because theyd fall in the dogfennel
and jimpson weeds under the windowholethen we could tote them back and
he could use them over again  So Tom was satisfied  Then he says

Now the thing to study out is how to get the things to Jim

Take them in through the hole I says when we get it done

He only just looked scornful and said something about nobody ever heard
of such an idiotic idea and then he went to studying  By and by he said
he had ciphered out two or three ways but there warnt no need to decide
on any of them yet  Said wed got to post Jim first

That night we went down the lightningrod a little after ten and took
one of the candles along and listened under the windowhole and heard
Jim snoring so we pitched it in and it didnt wake him  Then we
whirled in with the pick and shovel and in about two hours and a half
the job was done  We crept in under Jims bed and into the cabin and
pawed around and found the candle and lit it and stood over Jim awhile
and found him looking hearty and healthy and then we woke him up gentle
and gradual  He was so glad to see us he most cried and called us
honey and all the pet names he could think of and was for having us
hunt up a coldchisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away
and clearing out without losing any time  But Tom he showed him how
unregular it would be and set down and told him all about our plans and
how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm and not
to be the least afraid because we would see he got away SURE  So Jim
he said it was all right and we set there and talked over old times
awhile and then Tom asked a lot of questions and when Jim told him
Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him and Aunt Sally
come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat and both of
them was kind as they could be Tom says

NOW I know how to fix it  Well send you some things by them

I said Dont do nothing of the kind its one of the most jackass ideas
I ever struck but he never paid no attention to me went right on  It
was his way when hed got his plans set

So he told Jim how wed have to smuggle in the ropeladder pie and other
large things by Nat the nigger that fed him and he must be on the
lookout and not be surprised and not let Nat see him open them and we
would put small things in uncles coatpockets and he must steal them
out and we would tie things to aunts apronstrings or put them in her
apronpocket if we got a chance and told him what they would be and
what they was for  And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with
his blood and all that He told him everything  Jim he couldnt see no
sense in the most of it but he allowed we was white folks and knowed
better than him so he was satisfied and said he would do it all just as
Tom said

Jim had plenty corncob pipes and tobacco so we had a right down good
sociable time then we crawled out through the hole and so home to bed
with hands that looked like theyd been chawed  Tom was in high spirits
He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life and the most
intellectural and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep
it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to get out
for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the more he
got used to it  He said that in that way it could be strung out to as
much as eighty year and would be the best time on record  And he said
it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it

In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass
candlestick into handy sizes and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in
his pocket  Then we went to the nigger cabins and while I got Nats
notice off Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a
cornpone that was in Jims pan and we went along with Nat to see how it
would work and it just worked noble when Jim bit into it it most mashed
all his teeth out and there warnt ever anything could a worked better
Tom said so himself Jim he never let on but what it was only just a
piece of rock or something like that thats always getting into bread
you know but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his
fork into it in three or four places first

And whilst we was astanding there in the dimmish light here comes a
couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jims bed and they kept on
piling in till there was eleven of them and there warnt hardly room in
there to get your breath  By jings we forgot to fasten that leanto
door  The nigger Nat he only just hollered Witches once and keeled
over on to the floor amongst the dogs and begun to groan like he was
dying  Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jims meat and
the dogs went for it and in two seconds he was out himself and back
again and shut the door and I knowed hed fixed the other door too
Then he went to work on the nigger coaxing him and petting him and
asking him if hed been imagining he saw something again  He raised up
and blinked his eyes around and says

Mars Sid youll say Is a fool but if I didnt blieve I see most a
million dogs er devils er somen I wisht I may die right heah in dese
tracks  I did mos sholy  Mars Sid I FELT umI FELT um sah dey was
all over me  Dad fetch it I jis wisht I could git my hans on one er
dem witches jis wunstony jis wunstits all Id ast  But mosly I
wisht deyd lemme lone I does

Tom says

Well I tell you what I think  What makes them come here just at this
runaway niggers breakfasttime  Its because theyre hungry thats the
reason  You make them a witch pie thats the thing for YOU to do

But my lan Mars Sid hows I gwyne to make m a witch pie  I doan
know how to make it  I haint ever hearn er sich a thing bfo

Well then Ill have to make it myself

Will you do it honeywill you  Ill wusshup de groun und yo foot
I will

All right Ill do it seeing its you and youve been good to us and
showed us the runaway nigger  But you got to be mighty careful  When we
come around you turn your back and then whatever weve put in the pan
dont you let on you see it at all  And dont you look when Jim unloads
the pansomething might happen I dont know what  And above all dont
you HANDLE the witchthings

HANNEL m Mars Sid  What IS you atalkin bout  I wouldn lay de
weight er my finger on um not fr ten hundd thousn billion dollars I
wouldnt




CHAPTER XXXVII

THAT was all fixed  So then we went away and went to the rubbagepile in
the back yard where they keep the old boots and rags and pieces of
bottles and woreout tin things and all such truck and scratched
around and found an old tin washpan and stopped up the holes as well as
we could to bake the pie in and took it down cellar and stole it full
of flour and started for breakfast and found a couple of shinglenails
that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and
sorrows on the dungeon walls with and dropped one of them in Aunt
Sallys apronpocket which was hanging on a chair and tother we stuck
in the band of Uncle Silass hat which was on the bureau because we
heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway niggers
house this morning and then went to breakfast and Tom dropped the
pewter spoon in Uncle Silass coatpocket and Aunt Sally wasnt come
yet so we had to wait a little while

And when she come she was hot and red and cross and couldnt hardly wait
for the blessing and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand
and cracking the handiest childs head with her thimble with the other
and says

Ive hunted high and Ive hunted low and it does beat all what HAS
become of your other shirt

My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things and a hard
piece of corncrust started down my throat after it and got met on the
road with a cough and was shot across the table and took one of the
children in the eye and curled him up like a fishingworm and let a cry
out of him the size of a warwhoop and Tom he turned kinder blue around
the gills and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for
about a quarter of a minute or as much as that and I would a sold out
for half price if there was a bidder  But after that we was all right
againit was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold
Uncle Silas he says

Its most uncommon curious I cant understand it  I know perfectly
well I took it OFF because

Because you haint got but one ON  Just LISTEN at the man  I know you
took it off and know it by a better way than your woolgethering memory
too because it was on the closline yesterdayI see it there myself
But its gone thats the long and the short of it and youll just have
to change to a red flannl one till I can get time to make a new one
And it ll be the third Ive made in two years  It just keeps a body on
the jump to keep you in shirts and whatever you do manage to DO with m
all is moren I can make out  A body d think you WOULD learn to take
some sort of care of em at your time of life

I know it Sally and I do try all I can  But it oughtnt to be
altogether my fault because you know I dont see them nor have nothing
to do with them except when theyre on me and I dont believe Ive ever
lost one of them OFF of me

Well it aint YOUR fault if you havent Silas youd a done it if you
could I reckon  And the shirt aint all thats gone nuther  Thers a
spoon gone and THAT aint all  There was ten and now thers only nine
The calf got the shirt I reckon but the calf never took the spoon
THATS certain

Why what else is gone Sally

Thers six CANDLES gonethats what  The rats could a got the candles
and I reckon they did I wonder they dont walk off with the whole place
the way youre always going to stop their holes and dont do it and if
they warnt fools theyd sleep in your hair SilasYOUD never find it
out but you cant lay the SPOON on the rats and that I know

Well Sally Im in fault and I acknowledge it Ive been remiss but I
wont let tomorrow go by without stopping up them holes

Oh I wouldnt hurry next year ll do  Matilda Angelina Araminta
PHELPS

Whack comes the thimble and the child snatches her claws out of the
sugarbowl without fooling around any  Just then the nigger woman steps
on to the passage and says

Missus deys a sheet gone

A SHEET gone  Well for the lands sake

Ill stop up them holes today says Uncle Silas looking sorrowful

Oh DO shet upspose the rats took the SHEET  WHERES it gone
Lize

Clah to goodness I haint no notion Miss Sally  She wuz on de
closline yistiddy but she done gone  she ain dah no mo now

I reckon the world IS coming to an end  I NEVER see the beat of it in
all my born days  A shirt and a sheet and a spoon and six can

Missus comes a young yaller wench deys a brass cannelstick missn

Cler out from here you hussy er Ill take a skillet to ye

Well she was just abiling  I begun to lay for a chance I reckoned I
would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated  She
kept araging right along running her insurrection all by herself and
everybody else mighty meek and quiet and at last Uncle Silas looking
kind of foolish fishes up that spoon out of his pocket  She stopped
with her mouth open and her hands up and as for me I wished I was in
Jeruslem or somewheres But not long because she says

Its JUST as I expected  So you had it in your pocket all the time and
like as not youve got the other things there too  Howd it get there

I reely dont know Sally he says kind of apologizing or you know I
would tell  I was astudying over my text in Acts Seventeen before
breakfast and I reckon I put it in there not noticing meaning to put
my Testament in and it must be so because my Testament aint in but
Ill go and see and if the Testament is where I had it Ill know I
didnt put it in and that will show that I laid the Testament down and
took up the spoon and

Oh for the lands sake  Give a body a rest  Go long now the whole
kit and biling of ye and dont come nigh me again till Ive got back my
peace of mind

Id a heard her if shed a said it to herself let alone speaking it out
and Id a got up and obeyed her if Id a been dead  As we was passing
through the settingroom the old man he took up his hat and the
shinglenail fell out on the floor and he just merely picked it up and
laid it on the mantelshelf and never said nothing and went out  Tom
see him do it and remembered about the spoon and says

Well it aint no use to send things by HIM no more he aint reliable
Then he says  But he done us a good turn with the spoon anyway
without knowing it and so well go and do him one without HIM knowing
itstop up his ratholes

There was a noble good lot of them down cellar and it took us a whole
hour but we done the job tight and good and shipshape  Then we heard
steps on the stairs and blowed out our light and hid and here comes the
old man with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in tother
looking as absentminded as year before last  He went a mooning around
first to one rathole and then another till hed been to them all  Then
he stood about five minutes picking tallowdrip off of his candle and
thinking  Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs saying

Well for the life of me I cant remember when I done it  I could show
her now that I warnt to blame on account of the rats  But never mind
let it go  I reckon it wouldnt do no good

And so he went on amumbling up stairs and then we left  He was a
mighty nice old man  And always is

Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon but he said
wed got to have it so he took a think  When he had ciphered it out he
told me how we was to do then we went and waited around the spoonbasket
till we see Aunt Sally coming and then Tom went to counting the spoons
and laying them out to one side and I slid one of them up my sleeve and
Tom says

Why Aunt Sally there aint but nine spoons YET

She says

Go long to your play and dont bother me  I know better I counted m
myself

Well Ive counted them twice Aunty and I cant make but nine

She looked out of all patience but of course she come to countanybody
would

I declare to gracious ther AINT but nine she says  Why what in
the worldplague TAKE the things Ill count m again

So I slipped back the one I had and when she got done counting she
says

Hang the troublesome rubbage thers TEN now and she looked huffy and
bothered both  But Tom says

Why Aunty I dont think theres ten

You numskull didnt you see me COUNT m

I know but

Well Ill count m AGAIN

So I smouched one and they come out nine same as the other time  Well
she WAS in a tearing wayjust atrembling all over she was so mad  But
she counted and counted till she got that addled shed start to count in
the basket for a spoon sometimes and so three times they come out
right and three times they come out wrong  Then she grabbed up the
basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galleywest
and she said cler out and let her have some peace and if we come
bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner shed skin us  So we
had the odd spoon and dropped it in her apronpocket whilst she was
agiving us our sailing orders and Jim got it all right along with her
shingle nail before noon  We was very well satisfied with this
business and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took because
he said NOW she couldnt ever count them spoons twice alike again to save
her life and wouldnt believe shed counted them right if she DID and
said that after shed about counted her head off for the next three days
he judged shed give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to
ever count them any more

So we put the sheet back on the line that night and stole one out of her
closet and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of
days till she didnt know how many sheets she had any more and she
didnt CARE and warnt agoing to bullyrag the rest of her soul out
about it and wouldnt count them again not to save her life she druther
die first

So we was all right now as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and
the candles by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixedup
counting and as to the candlestick it warnt no consequence it would
blow over by and by

But that pie was a job we had no end of trouble with that pie  We fixed
it up away down in the woods and cooked it there and we got it done at
last and very satisfactory too but not all in one day and we had to
use up three washpans full of flour before we got through and we got
burnt pretty much all over in places and eyes put out with the smoke
because you see we didnt want nothing but a crust and we couldnt
prop it up right and she would always cave in  But of course we thought
of the right way at lastwhich was to cook the ladder too in the
pie  So then we laid in with Jim the second night and tore up the sheet
all in little strings and twisted them together and long before daylight
we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with  We let on it
took nine months to make it

And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods but it wouldnt go into
the pie  Being made of a whole sheet that way there was rope enough
for forty pies if wed a wanted them and plenty left over for soup or
sausage or anything you choose  We could a had a whole dinner

But we didnt need it  All we needed was just enough for the pie
and so we throwed the rest away  We didnt cook none of the pies in the
washpanafraid the solder would melt but Uncle Silas he had a noble
brass warmingpan which he thought considerable of because it belonged
to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from
England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early
ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things
that was valuable not on account of being any account because they
warnt but on account of them being relicts you know and we snaked her
out private and took her down there but she failed on the first pies
because we didnt know how but she come up smiling on the last one  We
took and lined her with dough and set her in the coals and loaded her
up with rag rope and put on a dough roof and shut down the lid and put
hot embers on top and stood off five foot with the long handle cool
and comfortable and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a
satisfaction to look at But the person that et it would want to fetch a
couple of kags of toothpicks along for if that rope ladder wouldnt
cramp him down to business I dont know nothing what Im talking about
and lay him in enough stomachache to last him till next time too

Nat didnt look when we put the witch pie in Jims pan and we put the
three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles and so Jim
got everything all right and as soon as he was by himself he busted into
the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick and scratched
some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the windowhole




CHAPTER XXXVIII

MAKING them pens was a distressid tough job and so was the saw and Jim
allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all  Thats the
one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall  But he had to have
it Tom said hed GOT to there warnt no case of a state prisoner not
scrabbling his inscription to leave behind and his coat of arms

Look at Lady Jane Grey he says look at Gilford Dudley look at old
Northumberland  Why Huck spose it IS considerble troublewhat you
going to dohow you going to get around it  Jims GOT to do his
inscription and coat of arms  They all do

Jim says

Why Mars Tom I haint got no coat o arm I haint got nuffn but dish
yer ole shirt en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat

Oh you dont understand Jim a coat of arms is very different

Well I says Jims right anyway when he says he aint got no coat
of arms because he haint

I reckon I knowed that Tom says but you bet hell have one before he
goes out of thisbecause hes going out RIGHT and there aint going to
be no flaws in his record

So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece Jim
amaking hisn out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon Tom
set to work to think out the coat of arms  By and by he said hed struck
so many good ones he didnt hardly know which to take but there was one
which he reckoned hed decide on  He says

On the scutcheon well have a bend OR in the dexter base a saltire
MURREY in the fess with a dog couchant for common charge and under
his foot a chain embattled for slavery with a chevron VERT in a chief
engrailed and three invected lines on a field AZURE with the nombril
points rampant on a dancette indented crest a runaway nigger SABLE
with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister and a couple of
gules for supporters which is you and me motto MAGGIORE FRETTA MINORE
OTTO  Got it out of a bookmeans the more haste the less speed

Geewhillikins I says but what does the rest of it mean

We aint got no time to bother over that he says we got to dig in
like all gitout

Well anyway I says whats SOME of it  Whats a fess

A fessa fess isYOU dont need to know what a fess is  Ill show him
how to make it when he gets to it

Shucks Tom I says I think you might tell a person  Whats a bar
sinister

Oh I dont know  But hes got to have it  All the nobility does

That was just his way  If it didnt suit him to explain a thing to you
he wouldnt do it  You might pump at him a week it wouldnt make no
difference

Hed got all that coat of arms business fixed so now he started in to
finish up the rest of that part of the work which was to plan out a
mournful inscriptionsaid Jim got to have one like they all done  He
made up a lot and wrote them out on a paper and read them off so

  Here a captive heart busted   Here a poor prisoner forsook by the
world and friends fretted his sorrowful life   Here a lonely heart
broke and a worn spirit went to its rest after thirtyseven years of
solitary captivity   Here homeless and friendless after thirtyseven
years of bitter captivity perished a noble stranger natural son of
Louis XIV

Toms voice trembled whilst he was reading them and he most broke down
When he got done he couldnt no way make up his mind which one for Jim to
scrabble on to the wall they was all so good but at last he allowed he
would let him scrabble them all on  Jim said it would take him a year to
scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail and he didnt
know how to make letters besides but Tom said he would block them out
for him and then he wouldnt have nothing to do but just follow the
lines  Then pretty soon he says

Come to think the logs aint agoing to do they dont have log walls
in a dungeon  we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock  Well fetch a
rock

Jim said the rock was worse than the logs he said it would take him such
a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldnt ever get out  But
Tom said he would let me help him do it  Then he took a look to see how
me and Jim was getting along with the pens  It was most pesky tedious
hard work and slow and didnt give my hands no show to get well of the
sores and we didnt seem to make no headway hardly so Tom says

I know how to fix it  We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and
mournful inscriptions and we can kill two birds with that same rock
Theres a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill and well smouch it and
carve the things on it and file out the pens and the saw on it too

It warnt no slouch of an idea and it warnt no slouch of a grindstone
nuther but we allowed wed tackle it  It warnt quite midnight yet so
we cleared out for the mill leaving Jim at work  We smouched the
grindstone and set out to roll her home but it was a most nation tough
job Sometimes do what we could we couldnt keep her from falling over
and she come mighty near mashing us every time  Tom said she was going
to get one of us sure before we got through  We got her half way and
then we was plumb played out and most drownded with sweat  We see it
warnt no use we got to go and fetch Jim So he raised up his bed and
slid the chain off of the bedleg and wrapt it round and round his neck
and we crawled out through our hole and down there and Jim and me laid
into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing and Tom
superintended  He could outsuperintend any boy I ever see  He knowed
how to do everything

Our hole was pretty big but it warnt big enough to get the grindstone
through but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough  Then Tom
marked out them things on it with the nail and set Jim to work on them
with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the
leanto for a hammer and told him to work till the rest of his candle
quit on him and then he could go to bed and hide the grindstone under
his straw tick and sleep on it  Then we helped him fix his chain back on
the bedleg and was ready for bed ourselves  But Tom thought of
something and says

You got any spiders in here Jim

No sah thanks to goodness I haint Mars Tom

All right well get you some

But bless you honey I doan WANT none  Is afeard un um  I jis s
soon have rattlesnakes aroun

Tom thought a minute or two and says

Its a good idea  And I reckon its been done  It MUST a been done it
stands to reason  Yes its a prime good idea  Where could you keep
it

Keep what Mars Tom

Why a rattlesnake

De goodness gracious alive Mars Tom  Why if dey was a rattlesnake to
come in heah Id take en bust right out thoo dat log wall I would wid
my head

Why Jim you wouldnt be afraid of it after a little  You could tame
it

TAME it

Yeseasy enough  Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting
and they wouldnt THINK of hurting a person that pets them  Any book
will tell you that  You trythats all I ask just try for two or three
days Why you can get him so in a little while that hell love you and
sleep with you and wont stay away from you a minute and will let you
wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth

PLEASE Mars TomDOAN talk so  I cant STAN it  Hed LET me shove
his head in my mouffer a favor haint it  I lay hed wait a powful
long time fo I AST him  En mo en dat I doan WANT him to sleep wid
me

Jim dont act so foolish  A prisoners GOT to have some kind of a dumb
pet and if a rattlesnake haint ever been tried why theres more glory
to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way
you could ever think of to save your life

Why Mars Tom I doan WANT no sich glory  Snake take n bite Jims
chin off den WHAH is de glory  No sah I doan want no sich doins

Blame it cant you TRY  I only WANT you to tryyou neednt keep it up
if it dont work

But de trouble all DONE ef de snake bite me while Is a tryin him
Mars Tom Is willin to tackle mos anything at aint onreasonable but
ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame Is gwyne to
LEAVE dats SHORE

Well then let it go let it go if youre so bullheaded about it  We
can get you some gartersnakes and you can tie some buttons on their
tails and let on theyre rattlesnakes and I reckon that ll have to
do

I kn stan DEM Mars Tom but blame f I couldn get along widout um
I tell you dat  I never knowed bfo t was so much bother and trouble
to be a prisoner

Well it ALWAYS is when its done right  You got any rats around here

No sah I haint seed none

Well well get you some rats

Why Mars Tom I doan WANT no rats  Deys de dadblamedest creturs to
sturb a body en rustle roun over im en bite his feet when hes
tryin to sleep I ever see  No sah gimme gyartersnakes f Is got
to have m but doan gimme no rats I hain got no use fr um skasely

But Jim you GOT to have emthey all do  So dont make no more fuss
about it  Prisoners aint ever without rats  There aint no instance of
it  And they train them and pet them and learn them tricks and they
get to be as sociable as flies  But you got to play music to them  You
got anything to play music on

I ain got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o paper en a juiceharp
but I reckn dey wouldn take no stock in a juiceharp

Yes they would  THEY dont care what kind of music tis  A jewsharps
plenty good enough for a rat  All animals like musicin a prison they
dote on it  Specially painful music and you cant get no other kind
out of a jewsharp  It always interests them they come out to see
whats the matter with you  Yes youre all right youre fixed very
well  You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep and
early in the mornings and play your jewsharp play The Last Link is
Brokenthats the thing that ll scoop a rat quicker n anything else
and when youve played about two minutes youll see all the rats and the
snakes and spiders and things begin to feel worried about you and
come  And theyll just fairly swarm over you and have a noble good
time

Yes DEY will I reckn Mars Tom but what kine er time is JIM havin
Blest if I kin see de pint  But Ill do it ef I got to  I reckn I
better keep de animals satisfied en not have no trouble in de house

Tom waited to think it over and see if there wasnt nothing else and
pretty soon he says

Oh theres one thing I forgot  Could you raise a flower here do you
reckon

I doan know but maybe I could Mars Tom but its tolable dark in heah
en I ain got no use fr no flower nohow en shed be a powful sight o
trouble

Well you try it anyway  Some other prisoners has done it

One er dem big cattaillookin mullenstalks would grow in heah Mars
Tom I reckn but she wouldnt be wuth half de trouble shed coss

Dont you believe it  Well fetch you a little one and you plant it in
the corner over there and raise it  And dont call it mullen call it
Pitchiolathats its right name when its in a prison  And you want to
water it with your tears

Why I got plenty spring water Mars Tom

You dont WANT spring water you want to water it with your tears  Its
the way they always do

Why Mars Tom I lay I kin raise one er dem mullenstalks twyste wid
spring water whiles another mans a STARTN one wid tears

That aint the idea  You GOT to do it with tears

Shell die on my hans Mars Tom she sholy will kase I doan skasely
ever cry

So Tom was stumped  But he studied it over and then said Jim would have
to worry along the best he could with an onion  He promised he would go
to the nigger cabins and drop one private in Jims coffeepot in the
morning Jim said he would jis s soon have tobacker in his coffee
and found so much fault with it and with the work and bother of raising
the mullen and jewsharping the rats and petting and flattering up the
snakes and spiders and things on top of all the other work he had to do
on pens and inscriptions and journals and things which made it more
trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he
ever undertook that Tom most lost all patience with him and said he was
just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in
the world to make a name for himself and yet he didnt know enough to
appreciate them and they was just about wasted on him  So Jim he was
sorry and said he wouldnt behave so no more and then me and Tom shoved
for bed




CHAPTER XXXIX

IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rattrap and
fetched it down and unstopped the best rathole and in about an hour we
had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones and then we took it and put it
in a safe place under Aunt Sallys bed  But while we was gone for
spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found
it there and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out
and they did and Aunt Sally she come in and when we got back she was
astanding on top of the bed raising Cain and the rats was doing what
they could to keep off the dull times for her  So she took and dusted us
both with the hickry and we was as much as two hours catching another
fifteen or sixteen drat that meddlesome cub and they warnt the
likeliest nuther because the first haul was the pick of the flock
I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was

We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders and bugs and frogs and
caterpillars and one thing or another and we like to got a hornets
nest but we didnt  The family was at home  We didnt give it right
up but stayed with them as long as we could because we allowed wed
tire them out or theyd got to tire us out and they done it  Then we
got allycumpain and rubbed on the places and was pretty near all right
again but couldnt set down convenient  And so we went for the snakes
and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and housesnakes and put them in a
bag and put it in our room and by that time it was suppertime and a
rattling good honest days work  and hungryoh no I reckon not  And
there warnt a blessed snake up there when we went backwe didnt half
tie the sack and they worked out somehow and left  But it didnt
matter much because they was still on the premises somewheres  So we
judged we could get some of them again  No there warnt no real
scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell  Youd see
them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then and they
generly landed in your plate or down the back of your neck and most of
the time where you didnt want them  Well they was handsome and
striped and there warnt no harm in a million of them but that never
made no difference to Aunt Sally she despised snakes be the breed what
they might and she couldnt stand them no way you could fix it and
every time one of them flopped down on her it didnt make no difference
what she was doing she would just lay that work down and light out  I
never see such a woman  And you could hear her whoop to Jericho  You
couldnt get her to take aholt of one of them with the tongs  And if
she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a
howl that you would think the house was afire  She disturbed the old man
so that he said he could most wish there hadnt ever been no snakes
created  Why after every last snake had been gone clear out of the
house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warnt over it yet she warnt
near over it when she was setting thinking about something you could
touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right
out of her stockings  It was very curious  But Tom said all women was
just so  He said they was made that way for some reason or other

We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way and she
allowed these lickings warnt nothing to what she would do if we ever
loaded up the place again with them  I didnt mind the lickings because
they didnt amount to nothing but I minded the trouble we had to lay in
another lot  But we got them laid in and all the other things and you
never see a cabin as blithesome as Jims was when theyd all swarm out
for music and go for him  Jim didnt like the spiders and the spiders
didnt like Jim and so theyd lay for him and make it mighty warm for
him  And he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone
there warnt no room in bed for him skasely and when there was a body
couldnt sleep it was so lively and it was always lively he said
because THEY never all slept at one time but took turn about so when
the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck and when the rats turned in
the snakes come on watch so he always had one gang under him in his
way and tother gang having a circus over him and if he got up to hunt
a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over
He said if he ever got out this time he wouldnt ever be a prisoner
again not for a salary

Well by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape  The
shirt was sent in early in a pie and every time a rat bit Jim he would
get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh the
pens was made the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the
grindstone the bedleg was sawed in two and we had et up the sawdust
and it give us a most amazing stomachache  We reckoned we was all going
to die but didnt  It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever see and
Tom said the same  But as I was saying wed got all the work done now
at last and we was all pretty much fagged out too but mainly Jim  The
old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to
come and get their runaway nigger but hadnt got no answer because
there warnt no such plantation so he allowed he would advertise Jim in
the St Louis and New Orleans papers and when he mentioned the St Louis
ones it give me the cold shivers and I see we hadnt no time to lose
So Tom said now for the nonnamous letters

Whats them  I says

Warnings to the people that something is up  Sometimes its done one
way sometimes another  But theres always somebody spying around that
gives notice to the governor of the castle  When Louis XVI was going to
light out of the Tooleries a servantgirl done it  Its a very good way
and so is the nonnamous letters  Well use them both  And its usual
for the prisoners mother to change clothes with him and she stays in
and he slides out in her clothes  Well do that too

But looky here Tom what do we want to WARN anybody for that
somethings up  Let them find it out for themselvesits their
lookout

Yes I know but you cant depend on them  Its the way theyve acted
from the very startleft us to do EVERYTHING  Theyre so confiding and
mulletheaded they dont take notice of nothing at all  So if we dont
GIVE them notice there wont be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us
and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape ll go off
perfectly flat wont amount to nothingwont be nothing TO it

Well as for me Tom thats the way Id like

Shucks he says and looked disgusted  So I says

But I aint going to make no complaint  Any way that suits you suits
me What you going to do about the servantgirl

Youll be her  You slide in in the middle of the night and hook that
yaller girls frock

Why Tom that ll make trouble next morning because of course she
probbly haint got any but that one

I know but you dont want it but fifteen minutes to carry the
nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door

All right then Ill do it but I could carry it just as handy in my
own togs

You wouldnt look like a servantgirl THEN would you

No but there wont be nobody to see what I look like ANYWAY

That aint got nothing to do with it  The thing for us to do is just to
do our DUTY and not worry about whether anybody SEES us do it or not
Haint you got no principle at all

All right I aint saying nothing Im the servantgirl  Whos Jims
mother

Im his mother  Ill hook a gown from Aunt Sally

Well then youll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves

Not much  Ill stuff Jims clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed
to represent his mother in disguise and Jim ll take the nigger womans
gown off of me and wear it and well all evade together  When a
prisoner of style escapes its called an evasion  Its always called so
when a king escapes frinstance  And the same with a kings son it
dont make no difference whether hes a natural one or an unnatural one

So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter and I smouched the yaller wenchs
frock that night and put it on and shoved it under the front door the
way Tom told me to  It said

Beware  Trouble is brewing  Keep a sharp lookout UNKNOWN FRIEND

Next night we stuck a picture which Tom drawed in blood of a skull and
crossbones on the front door and next night another one of a coffin on
the back door  I never see a family in such a sweat  They couldnt a
been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them
behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air  If a
door banged Aunt Sally she jumped and said ouch if anything fell she
jumped and said ouch if you happened to touch her when she warnt
noticing she done the same she couldnt face noway and be satisfied
because she allowed there was something behind her every timeso she was
always awhirling around sudden and saying ouch and before shed got
twothirds around shed whirl back again and say it again and she was
afraid to go to bed but she dasnt set up  So the thing was working
very well Tom said he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory
He said it showed it was done right

So he said now for the grand bulge  So the very next morning at the
streak of dawn we got another letter ready and was wondering what we
better do with it because we heard them say at supper they was going to
have a nigger on watch at both doors all night  Tom he went down the
lightningrod to spy around and the nigger at the back door was asleep
and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back  This letter said

Dont betray me I wish to be your friend  There is a desprate gang of
cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway
nigger tonight and they have been trying to scare you so as you will
stay in the house and not bother them  I am one of the gang but have
got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again and will
betray the helish design They will sneak down from northards along the
fence at midnight exact with a false key and go in the niggers cabin
to get him I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any
danger but stead of that I will BA like a sheep soon as they get in and
not blow at all then whilst they are getting his chains loose you slip
there and lock them in and can kill them at your leasure  Dont do
anything but just the way I am telling you if you do they will suspicion
something and raise whoopjamboreehoo I do not wish any reward but to
know I have done the right thing UNKNOWN FRIEND




CHAPTER XL

WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast and took my canoe and went
over the river afishing with a lunch and had a good time and took a
look at the raft and found her all right and got home late to supper
and found them in such a sweat and worry they didnt know which end they
was standing on and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done
supper and wouldnt tell us what the trouble was and never let on a
word about the new letter but didnt need to because we knowed as much
about it as anybody did and as soon as we was half up stairs and her
back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good
lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed and got up about
halfpast eleven and Tom put on Aunt Sallys dress that he stole and
was going to start with the lunch but says

Wheres the butter

I laid out a hunk of it I says on a piece of a cornpone

Well you LEFT it laid out thenit aint here

We can get along without it I says

We can get along WITH it too he says just you slide down cellar and
fetch it  And then mosey right down the lightningrod and come along
Ill go and stuff the straw into Jims clothes to represent his mother in
disguise and be ready to BA like a sheep and shove soon as you get
there

So out he went and down cellar went I The hunk of butter big as a
persons fist was where I had left it so I took up the slab of
cornpone with it on and blowed out my light and started up stairs very
stealthy and got up to the main floor all right but here comes Aunt
Sally with a candle and I clapped the truck in my hat and clapped my
hat on my head and the next second she see me and she says

You been down cellar

Yesm

What you been doing down there

Nothn

NOTHN

Nom

Well then what possessed you to go down there this time of night

I dont know m

You dont KNOW  Dont answer me that way Tom I want to know what you
been DOING down there

I haint been doing a single thing Aunt Sally I hope to gracious if I
have

I reckoned shed let me go now and as a generl thing she would but I
spose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat
about every little thing that warnt yardstick straight so she says
very decided

You just march into that settingroom and stay there till I come  You
been up to something you no business to and I lay Ill find out what it
is before IM done with you

So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the settingroom
My but there was a crowd there  Fifteen farmers and every one of them
had a gun  I was most powerful sick and slunk to a chair and set down
They was setting around some of them talking a little in a low voice
and all of them fidgety and uneasy but trying to look like they warnt
but I knowed they was because they was always taking off their hats and
putting them on and scratching their heads and changing their seats
and fumbling with their buttons  I warnt easy myself but I didnt take
my hat off all the same

I did wish Aunt Sally would come and get done with me and lick me if
she wanted to and let me get away and tell Tom how wed overdone this
thing and what a thundering hornetsnest wed got ourselves into so we
could stop fooling around straight off and clear out with Jim before
these rips got out of patience and come for us

At last she come and begun to ask me questions but I COULDNT answer
them straight I didnt know which end of me was up because these men
was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and lay
for them desperadoes and saying it warnt but a few minutes to midnight
and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the
sheepsignal and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions and me
ashaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was that scared
and the place getting hotter and hotter and the butter beginning to melt
and run down my neck and behind my ears and pretty soon when one of
them says IM for going and getting in the cabin FIRST and right NOW
and catching them when they come I most dropped and a streak of butter
come atrickling down my forehead and Aunt Sally she see it and turns
white as a sheet and says

For the lands sake what IS the matter with the child  Hes got the
brainfever as shore as youre born and theyre oozing out

And everybody runs to see and she snatches off my hat and out comes the
bread and what was left of the butter and she grabbed me and hugged me
and says

Oh what a turn you did give me and how glad and grateful I am it aint
no worse for lucks against us and it never rains but it pours and
when I see that truck I thought wed lost you for I knowed by the color
and all it was just like your brains would be ifDear dear whydnt you
TELL me that was what youd been down there for I wouldnt a cared  Now
cler out to bed and dont lemme see no more of you till morning

I was up stairs in a second and down the lightningrod in another one
and shinning through the dark for the leanto  I couldnt hardly get my
words out I was so anxious but I told Tom as quick as I could we must
jump for it now and not a minute to losethe house full of men yonder
with guns

His eyes just blazed and he says

Nois that so  AINT it bully  Why Huck if it was to do over
again I bet I could fetch two hundred  If we could put it off till

Hurry  HURRY  I says  Wheres Jim

Right at your elbow if you reach out your arm you can touch him  Hes
dressed and everythings ready  Now well slide out and give the
sheepsignal

But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door and heard them
begin to fumble with the padlock and heard a man say

I TOLD you wed be too soon they havent comethe door is locked
Here Ill lock some of you into the cabin and you lay for em in the
dark and kill em when they come and the rest scatter around a piece
and listen if you can hear em coming

So in they come but couldnt see us in the dark and most trod on us
whilst we was hustling to get under the bed  But we got under all right
and out through the hole swift but softJim first me next and Tom
last which was according to Toms orders  Now we was in the leanto
and heard trampings close by outside  So we crept to the door and Tom
stopped us there and put his eye to the crack but couldnt make out
nothing it was so dark and whispered and said he would listen for the
steps to get further and when he nudged us Jim must glide out first and
him last  So he set his ear to the crack and listened and listened and
listened and the steps ascraping around out there all the time and at
last he nudged us and we slid out and stooped down not breathing and
not making the least noise and slipped stealthy towards the fence in
Injun file and got to it all right and me and Jim over it but Toms
britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail and then he hear the
steps coming so he had to pull loose which snapped the splinter and
made a noise and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings
out

Whos that  Answer or Ill shoot

But we didnt answer we just unfurled our heels and shoved  Then there
was a rush and a BANG BANG BANG and the bullets fairly whizzed around
us We heard them sing out

Here they are  Theyve broke for the river  After em boys and turn
loose the dogs

So here they come full tilt  We could hear them because they wore boots
and yelled but we didnt wear no boots and didnt yell  We was in the
path to the mill and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into
the bush and let them go by and then dropped in behind them  Theyd had
all the dogs shut up so they wouldnt scare off the robbers but by this
time somebody had let them loose and here they come making powwow
enough for a million but they was our dogs so we stopped in our tracks
till they catched up and when they see it warnt nobody but us and no
excitement to offer them they only just said howdy and tore right ahead
towards the shouting and clattering and then we upsteam again and
whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill and then struck
up through the bush to where my canoe was tied and hopped in and pulled
for dear life towards the middle of the river but didnt make no more
noise than we was obleeged to Then we struck out easy and comfortable
for the island where my raft was and we could hear them yelling and
barking at each other all up and down the bank till we was so far away
the sounds got dim and died out  And when we stepped on to the raft I
says

NOW old Jim youre a free man again and I bet you wont ever be a
slave no more

En a mighty good job it wuz too Huck  It uz planned beautiful en it
uz done beautiful en dey aint NOBODY kin git up a plan dats mo
mixedup en splendid den what dat one wuz

We was all glad as we could be but Tom was the gladdest of all because
he had a bullet in the calf of his leg

When me and Jim heard that we didnt feel so brash as what we did before
It was hurting him considerable and bleeding so we laid him in the
wigwam and tore up one of the dukes shirts for to bandage him but he
says

Gimme the rags I can do it myself  Dont stop now dont fool around
here and the evasion booming along so handsome man the sweeps and set
her loose  Boys we done it elegantdeed we did  I wish WED a had
the handling of Louis XVI there wouldnt a been no Son of Saint Louis
ascend to heaven wrote down in HIS biography no sir wed a whooped
him over the BORDERthats what wed a done with HIMand done it just
as slick as nothing at all too  Man the sweepsman the sweeps

But me and Jim was consultingand thinking  And after wed thought a
minute I says

Say it Jim

So he says

Well den dis is de way it look to me Huck  Ef it wuz HIM dat uz
bein sot free en one er de boys wuz to git shot would he say Go on
en save me nemmine bout a doctor fr to save dis one  Is dat like
Mars Tom Sawyer  Would he say dat  You BET he wouldnt  WELL den is
JIM gywne to say it  No sahI doan budge a step outn dis place dout
a DOCTOR not if its forty year

I knowed he was white inside and I reckoned hed say what he did sayso
it was all right now and I told Tom I was agoing for a doctor  He
raised considerable row about it but me and Jim stuck to it and wouldnt
budge so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself but
we wouldnt let him  Then he give us a piece of his mind but it didnt
do no good

So when he sees me getting the canoe ready he says

Well then if you re bound to go Ill tell you the way to do when you
get to the village  Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and
fast and make him swear to be silent as the grave and put a purse full
of gold in his hand and then take and lead him all around the back
alleys and everywheres in the dark and then fetch him here in the canoe
in a roundabout way amongst the islands and search him and take his
chalk away from him and dont give it back to him till you get him back
to the village or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again
Its the way they all do

So I said I would and left and Jim was to hide in the woods when he see
the doctor coming till he was gone again




CHAPTER XLI

THE doctor was an old man a very nice kindlooking old man when I got
him up  I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting
yesterday afternoon and camped on a piece of a raft we found and about
midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams for it went off and shot
him in the leg and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say
nothing about it nor let anybody know because we wanted to come home
this evening and surprise the folks

Who is your folks he says

The Phelpses down yonder

Oh he says  And after a minute he says

Howd you say he got shot

He had a dream I says and it shot him

Singular dream he says

So he lit up his lantern and got his saddlebags and we started  But
when he sees the canoe he didnt like the look of hersaid she was big
enough for one but didnt look pretty safe for two  I says

Oh you neednt be afeard sir she carried the three of us easy
enough

What three

Why me and Sid andandand THE GUNS thats what I mean

Oh he says

But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her and shook his head and
said he reckoned hed look around for a bigger one  But they was all
locked and chained so he took my canoe and said for me to wait till he
come back or I could hunt around further or maybe I better go down home
and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to  But I said I didnt
so I told him just how to find the raft and then he started

I struck an idea pretty soon  I says to myself sposn he cant fix that
leg just in three shakes of a sheeps tail as the saying is sposn it
takes him three or four days  What are we going to dolay around there
till he lets the cat out of the bag  No sir I know what ILL do  Ill
wait and when he comes back if he says hes got to go any more Ill get
down there too if I swim and well take and tie him and keep him and
shove out down the river and when Toms done with him well give him
what its worth or all we got and then let him get ashore

So then I crept into a lumberpile to get some sleep and next time I
waked up the sun was away up over my head  I shot out and went for the
doctors house but they told me hed gone away in the night some time or
other and warnt back yet  Well thinks I that looks powerful bad for
Tom and Ill dig out for the island right off  So away I shoved and
turned the corner and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silass stomach
He says

Why TOM  Where you been all this time you rascal

I haint been nowheres I says only just hunting for the runaway
niggerme and Sid

Why where ever did you go he says  Your aunts been mighty uneasy

She neednt I says because we was all right  We followed the men
and the dogs but they outrun us and we lost them but we thought we
heard them on the water so we got a canoe and took out after them and
crossed over but couldnt find nothing of them so we cruised along
upshore till we got kind of tired and beat out and tied up the canoe
and went to sleep and never waked up till about an hour ago then we
paddled over here to hear the news and Sids at the postoffice to see
what he can hear and Im abranching out to get something to eat for us
and then were going home

So then we went to the postoffice to get Sid but just as I
suspicioned he warnt there so the old man he got a letter out of the
office and we waited awhile longer but Sid didnt come so the old man
said come along let Sid foot it home or canoe it when he got done
fooling aroundbut we would ride  I couldnt get him to let me stay and
wait for Sid and he said there warnt no use in it and I must come
along and let Aunt Sally see we was all right

When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried
both and hugged me and give me one of them lickings of hern that dont
amount to shucks and said shed serve Sid the same when he come

And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers wives to dinner and
such another clack a body never heard  Old Mrs Hotchkiss was the worst
her tongue was agoing all the time  She says

Well Sister Phelps Ive ransacked thatair cabin over an I blieve

HOUSEthieves as well as

Goodnessgracioussakes Id a ben afeard to live in sich a

Fraid to LIVEwhy I was that scared I dasnt hardly go to bed or
get up or lay down or SET down Sister Ridgeway  Why theyd steal the
verywhy goodness sakes you can guess what kind of a fluster I was
in by the time midnight come last night  I hope to gracious if I warnt
afraid theyd steal some o the family  I was just to that pass I didnt
have no reasoning faculties no more  It looks foolish enough NOW in the
daytime but I says to myself theres my two poor boys asleep way up
stairs in that lonesome room and I declare to goodness I was that uneasy
t I crep up there and locked em in  I DID  And anybody would
Because you know when you get scared that way and it keeps running on
and getting worse and worse all the time and your wits gets to addling
and you get to doing all sorts o wild things and by and by you think to
yourself sposn I was a boy and was away up there and the door aint
locked and you She stopped looking kind of wondering and then she
turned her head around slow and when her eye lit on meI got up and
took a walk

Says I to myself I can explain better how we come to not be in that room
this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little  So I
done it  But I dasnt go fur or shed a sent for me  And when it was
late in the day the people all went and then I come in and told her the
noise and shooting waked up me and Sid and the door was locked and we
wanted to see the fun so we went down the lightningrod and both of us
got hurt a little and we didnt never want to try THAT no more  And
then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas before and then
she said shed forgive us and maybe it was all right enough anyway and
about what a body might expect of boys for all boys was a pretty
harumscarum lot as fur as she could see and so as long as no harm
hadnt come of it she judged she better put in her time being grateful
we was alive and well and she had us still stead of fretting over what
was past and done  So then she kissed me and patted me on the head and
dropped into a kind of a brown study and pretty soon jumps up and says

Why lawsamercy its most night and Sid not come yet  What HAS become
of that boy

I see my chance so I skips up and says

Ill run right up to town and get him I says

No you wont she says  Youll stay right wher you are ONES enough
to be lost at a time  If he aint here to supper your uncle ll go

Well he warnt there to supper so right after supper uncle went

He come back about ten a little bit uneasy hadnt run across Toms
track Aunt Sally was a good DEAL uneasy but Uncle Silas he said there
warnt no occasion to beboys will be boys he said and youll see this
one turn up in the morning all sound and right  So she had to be
satisfied  But she said shed set up for him a while anyway and keep a
light burning so he could see it

And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her
candle and tucked me in and mothered me so good I felt mean and like I
couldnt look her in the face and she set down on the bed and talked
with me a long time and said what a splendid boy Sid was and didnt
seem to want to ever stop talking about him and kept asking me every now
and then if I reckoned he could a got lost or hurt or maybe drownded
and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead and she
not by him to help him and so the tears would drip down silent and I
would tell her that Sid was all right and would be home in the morning
sure and she would squeeze my hand or maybe kiss me and tell me to say
it again and keep on saying it because it done her good and she was in
so much trouble  And when she was going away she looked down in my eyes
so steady and gentle and says

The door aint going to be locked Tom and theres the window and the
rod but youll be good WONT you  And you wont go  For MY sake

Laws knows I WANTED to go bad enough to see about Tom and was all
intending to go but after that I wouldnt a went not for kingdoms

But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind so I slept very restless
And twice I went down the rod away in the night and slipped around
front and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her
eyes towards the road and the tears in them and I wished I could do
something for her but I couldnt only to swear that I wouldnt never do
nothing to grieve her any more  And the third time I waked up at dawn
and slid down and she was there yet and her candle was most out and
her old gray head was resting on her hand and she was asleep




CHAPTER XLII

THE old man was uptown again before breakfast but couldnt get no track
of Tom and both of them set at the table thinking and not saying
nothing and looking mournful and their coffee getting cold and not
eating anything And by and by the old man says

Did I give you the letter

What letter

The one I got yesterday out of the postoffice

No you didnt give me no letter

Well I must a forgot it

So he rummaged his pockets and then went off somewheres where he had
laid it down and fetched it and give it to her  She says

Why its from St Petersburgits from Sis

I allowed another walk would do me good but I couldnt stir  But before
she could break it open she dropped it and runfor she see something
And so did I It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress and that old doctor and
Jim in HER calico dress with his hands tied behind him and a lot of
people  I hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy and
rushed  She flung herself at Tom crying and says

Oh hes dead hes dead I know hes dead

And Tom he turned his head a little and muttered something or other
which showed he warnt in his right mind then she flung up her hands
and says

Hes alive thank God  And thats enough and she snatched a kiss of
him and flew for the house to get the bed ready and scattering orders
right and left at the niggers and everybody else as fast as her tongue
could go every jump of the way

I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim and the old
doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house  The men was
very huffy and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to all the
other niggers around there so they wouldnt be trying to run away like
Jim done and making such a raft of trouble and keeping a whole family
scared most to death for days and nights  But the others said dont do
it it wouldnt answer at all he aint our nigger and his owner would
turn up and make us pay for him sure  So that cooled them down a
little because the people thats always the most anxious for to hang a
nigger that haint done just right is always the very ones that aint the
most anxious to pay for him when theyve got their satisfaction out of
him

They cussed Jim considerble though and give him a cuff or two side the
head once in a while but Jim never said nothing and he never let on to
know me and they took him to the same cabin and put his own clothes on
him and chained him again and not to no bedleg this time but to a big
staple drove into the bottom log and chained his hands too and both
legs and said he warnt to have nothing but bread and water to eat after
this till his owner come or he was sold at auction because he didnt
come in a certain length of time and filled up our hole and said a
couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every
night and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime and about this time
they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl
goodbye cussing and then the old doctor comes and takes a look and
says

Dont be no rougher on him than youre obleeged to because he aint a
bad nigger  When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldnt cut the
bullet out without some help and he warnt in no condition for me to
leave to go and get help and he got a little worse and a little worse
and after a long time he went out of his head and wouldnt let me come
anigh him any more and said if I chalked his raft hed kill me and no
end of wild foolishness like that and I see I couldnt do anything at
all with him so I says I got to have HELP somehow and the minute I
says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says hell help and
he done it too and done it very well  Of course I judged he must be a
runaway nigger and there I WAS and there I had to stick right straight
along all the rest of the day and all night  It was a fix I tell you
I had a couple of patients with the chills and of course Id of liked to
run up to town and see them but I dasnt because the nigger might get
away and then Id be to blame and yet never a skiff come close enough
for me to hail  So there I had to stick plumb until daylight this
morning and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller
and yet he was risking his freedom to do it and was all tired out too
and I see plain enough hed been worked main hard lately  I liked the
nigger for that I tell you gentlemen a nigger like that is worth a
thousand dollarsand kind treatment too  I had everything I needed
and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at homebetter
maybe because it was so quiet but there I WAS with both of m on my
hands and there I had to stick till about dawn this morning then some
men in a skiff come by and as good luck would have it the nigger was
setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep so
I motioned them in quiet and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and
tied him before he knowed what he was about and we never had no trouble
And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep too we muffled the oars
and hitched the raft on and towed her over very nice and quiet and the
nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start  He aint
no bad nigger gentlemen thats what I think about him

Somebody says

Well it sounds very good doctor Im obleeged to say

Then the others softened up a little too and I was mighty thankful to
that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn and I was glad it was
according to my judgment of him too because I thought he had a good
heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him  Then they all
agreed that Jim had acted very well and was deserving to have some
notice took of it and reward  So every one of them promised right out
and hearty that they wouldnt cuss him no more

Then they come out and locked him up  I hoped they was going to say he
could have one or two of the chains took off because they was rotten
heavy or could have meat and greens with his bread and water but they
didnt think of it and I reckoned it warnt best for me to mix in but I
judged Id get the doctors yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon
as Id got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me
explanations I mean of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot
when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling
around hunting the runaway nigger

But I had plenty time  Aunt Sally she stuck to the sickroom all day and
all night and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged him

Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better and they said Aunt Sally
was gone to get a nap  So I slips to the sickroom and if I found him
awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash
But he was sleeping and sleeping very peaceful too and pale not
firefaced the way he was when he come  So I set down and laid for him
to wake  In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in and there I
was up a stump again  She motioned me to be still and set down by me
and begun to whisper and said we could all be joyful now because all
the symptoms was firstrate and hed been sleeping like that for ever so
long and looking better and peacefuller all the time and ten to one
hed wake up in his right mind

So we set there watching and by and by he stirs a bit and opened his
eyes very natural and takes a look and says

Hellowhy Im at HOME  Hows that  Wheres the raft

Its all right I says

And JIM

The same I says but couldnt say it pretty brash  But he never
noticed but says

Good  Splendid  NOW were all right and safe Did you tell Aunty

I was going to say yes but she chipped in and says  About what Sid

Why about the way the whole thing was done

What whole thing

Why THE whole thing  There aint but one how we set the runaway
nigger freeme and Tom

Good land  Set the runWhat IS the child talking about  Dear dear
out of his head again

NO I aint out of my HEAD I know all what Im talking about  We DID
set him freeme and Tom  We laid out to do it and we DONE it  And we
done it elegant too  Hed got a start and she never checked him up
just set and stared and stared and let him clip along and I see it
warnt no use for ME to put in  Why Aunty it cost us a power of work
weeks of ithours and hours every night whilst you was all asleep
And we had to steal candles and the sheet and the shirt and your
dress and spoons and tin plates and caseknives and the warmingpan
and the grindstone and flour and just no end of things and you cant
think what work it was to make the saws and pens and inscriptions and
one thing or another and you cant think HALF the fun it was  And we
had to make up the pictures of coffins and things and nonnamous letters
from the robbers and get up and down the lightningrod and dig the hole
into the cabin and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a
pie and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket

Mercy sakes

and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on for company for
Jim and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that
you come near spiling the whole business because the men come before we
was out of the cabin and we had to rush and they heard us and let drive
at us and I got my share and we dodged out of the path and let them go
by and when the dogs come they warnt interested in us but went for the
most noise and we got our canoe and made for the raft and was all
safe and Jim was a free man and we done it all by ourselves and WASNT
it bully Aunty

Well I never heard the likes of it in all my born days  So it was YOU
you little rapscallions thats been making all this trouble and turned
everybodys wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death  Ive
as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out o you this very
minute  To think here Ive been night after night aYOU just get
well once you young scamp and I lay Ill tan the Old Harry out o both
o ye

But Tom he WAS so proud and joyful he just COULDNT hold in and his
tongue just WENT itshe achipping in and spitting fire all along and
both of them going it at once like a cat convention and she says

WELL you get all the enjoyment you can out of it NOW for mind I tell
you if I catch you meddling with him again

Meddling with WHO  Tom says dropping his smile and looking surprised

With WHO  Why the runaway nigger of course  Whod you reckon

Tom looks at me very grave and says

Tom didnt you just tell me he was all right  Hasnt he got away

HIM says Aunt Sally the runaway nigger  Deed he hasnt  Theyve
got him back safe and sound and hes in that cabin again on bread and
water and loaded down with chains till hes claimed or sold

Tom rose square up in bed with his eye hot and his nostrils opening and
shutting like gills and sings out to me

They haint no RIGHT to shut him up  SHOVEand dont you lose a
minute  Turn him loose he aint no slave hes as free as any cretur
that walks this earth

What DOES the child mean

I mean every word I SAY Aunt Sally and if somebody dont go ILL go
Ive knowed him all his life and so has Tom there  Old Miss Watson
died two months ago and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him
down the river and SAID so and she set him free in her will

Then what on earth did YOU want to set him free for seeing he was
already free

Well that IS a question I must say and just like women  Why I
wanted the ADVENTURE of it and Id a waded neckdeep in blood to
goodness alive AUNT POLLY

If she warnt standing right there just inside the door looking as
sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie I wish I may never

Aunt Sally jumped for her and most hugged the head off of her and cried
over her and I found a good enough place for me under the bed for it
was getting pretty sultry for us seemed to me  And I peeped out and in
a little while Toms Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there
looking across at Tom over her spectacleskind of grinding him into the
earth you know  And then she says

Yes you BETTER turn yr head awayI would if I was you Tom

Oh deary me says Aunt Sally IS he changed so  Why that aint TOM
its Sid TomsTomswhy where is Tom  He was here a minute ago

You mean wheres Huck FINNthats what you mean  I reckon I haint
raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I SEE
him  That WOULD be a pretty howdydo  Come out from under that bed
Huck Finn

So I done it  But not feeling brash

Aunt Sally she was one of the mixedupestlooking persons I ever see
except one and that was Uncle Silas when he come in and they told it
all to him  It kind of made him drunk as you may say and he didnt
know nothing at all the rest of the day and preached a prayermeeting
sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation because the oldest
man in the world couldnt a understood it  So Toms Aunt Polly she told
all about who I was and what and I had to up and tell how I was in such
a tight place that when Mrs Phelps took me for Tom Sawyershe chipped
in and says Oh go on and call me Aunt Sally Im used to it now and
taint no need to changethat when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I
had to stand itthere warnt no other way and I knowed he wouldnt
mind because it would be nuts for him being a mystery and hed make an
adventure out of it and be perfectly satisfied  And so it turned out
and he let on to be Sid and made things as soft as he could for me

And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting
Jim free in her will and so sure enough Tom Sawyer had gone and took
all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free and I couldnt
ever understand before until that minute and that talk how he COULD
help a body set a nigger free with his bringingup

Well Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and
SID had come all right and safe she says to herself

Look at that now  I might have expected it letting him go off that
way without anybody to watch him  So now I got to go and trapse all the
way down the river eleven hundred mile and find out what that creeturs
up to THIS time as long as I couldnt seem to get any answer out of you
about it

Why I never heard nothing from you says Aunt Sally

Well I wonder  Why I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean
by Sid being here

Well I never got em Sis

Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe and says

You Tom

WellWHAT he says kind of pettish

Don t you what ME you impudent thinghand out them letters

What letters

THEM letters  I be bound if I have to take aholt of you Ill

Theyre in the trunk  There now  And theyre just the same as they
was when I got them out of the office  I haint looked into them I
haint touched them  But I knowed theyd make trouble and I thought if
you warnt in no hurry Id

Well you DO need skinning there aint no mistake about it  And I
wrote another one to tell you I was coming and I spose he

No it come yesterday I haint read it yet but ITS all right Ive
got that one

I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadnt but I reckoned maybe it
was just as safe to not to  So I never said nothing




CHAPTER THE LAST

THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea time
of the evasionwhat it was hed planned to do if the evasion worked all
right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before
And he said what he had planned in his head from the start if we got
Jim out all safe was for us to run him down the river on the raft and
have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river and then tell him about
his being free and take him back up home on a steamboat in style and
pay him for his lost time and write word ahead and get out all the
niggers around and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight
procession and a brassband and then he would be a hero and so would
we  But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was

We had Jim out of the chains in no time and when Aunt Polly and Uncle
Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom
they made a heap of fuss over him and fixed him up prime and give him
all he wanted to eat and a good time and nothing to do  And we had him
up to the sickroom and had a high talk and Tom give Jim forty dollars
for being prisoner for us so patient and doing it up so good and Jim
was pleased most to death and busted out and says

DAH now Huck what I tell youwhat I tell you up dah on Jackson
islan  I TOLE you I got a hairy breas en whats de sign un it en I
TOLE you I ben rich wunst en gwineter to be rich AGIN en its come
true en heah she is  DAH now doan talk to MEsigns is SIGNS mine I
tell you en I knowed jis s well at I uz gwineter be rich agin as Is
astannin heah dis minute

And then Tom he talked along and talked along and says les all three
slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit and go for
howling adventures amongst the Injuns over in the Territory for a
couple of weeks or two and I says all right that suits me but I aint
got no money for to buy the outfit and I reckon I couldnt get none from
home because its likely paps been back before now and got it all away
from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up

No he haint Tom says its all there yetsix thousand dollars and
more and your pap haint ever been back since  Hadnt when I come away
anyhow

Jim says kind of solemn

He aint acomin back no mo Huck

I says

Why Jim

Nemmine why Huckbut he aint comin back no mo

But I kept at him so at last he says

Doan you member de house dat was floatn down de river en dey wuz a
man in dah kivered up en I went in en unkivered him and didn let you
come in  Well den you kin git yo money when you wants it kase dat
wuz him

Toms most well now and got his bullet around his neck on a watchguard
for a watch and is always seeing what time it is and so there aint
nothing more to write about and I am rotten glad of it because if Id a
knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldnt a tackled it and
aint agoing to no more  But I reckon I got to light out for the
Territory ahead of the rest because Aunt Sally shes going to adopt me
and sivilize me and I cant stand it  I been there before
