THE LOVES OF ALONZO FITZ CLARENCE AND ROSANNAH ETHELTON

It was well along in the forenoon of a bitter winters day The town of
Eastport in the state of Maine lay buried under a deep snow that was
newly fallen The customary bustle in the streets was wanting One
could look long distances down them and see nothing but a deadwhite
emptiness with silence to match Of course I do not mean that you could
see the silenceno you could only hear it The sidewalks were merely
long deep ditches with steep snow walls on either side Here and there
you might hear the faint far scrape of a wooden shovel and if you
were quick enough you might catch a glimpse of a distant black figure
stooping and disappearing in one of those ditches and reappearing the
next moment with a motion which you would know meant the heaving out of
a shovelful of snow But you needed to be quick for that black figure
would not linger but would soon drop that shovel and scud for the
house thrashing itself with its arms to warm them Yes it was too
venomously cold for snowshovelers or anybody else to stay out long

Presently the sky darkened then the wind rose and began to blow in
fitful vigorous gusts which sent clouds of powdery snow aloft and
straight ahead and everywhere Under the impulse of one of these gusts
great white drifts banked themselves like graves across the streets a
moment later another gust shifted them around the other way driving a
fine spray of snow from their sharp crests as the gale drives the spume
flakes from wavecrests at sea a third gust swept that place as clean
as your hand if it saw fit This was fooling this was play but each
and all of the gusts dumped some snow into the sidewalk ditches for
that was business

Alonzo Fitz Clarence was sitting in his snug and elegant little parlor
in a lovely blue silk dressinggown with cuffs and facings of crimson
satin elaborately quilted The remains of his breakfast were before
him and the dainty and costly little table service added a harmonious
charm to the grace beauty and richness of the fixed appointments of
the room A cheery fire was blazing on the hearth

A furious gust of wind shook the windows and a great wave of snow
washed against them with a drenching sound so to speak The handsome
young bachelor murmured

That means no going out today Well I am content But what to do for
company Mother is well enough Aunt Susan is well enough but these
like the poor I have with me always On so grim a day as this
one needs a new interest a fresh element to whet the dull edge of
captivity That was very neatly said but it doesnt mean anything One
doesnt want the edge of captivity sharpened up you know but just the
reverse

He glanced at his pretty French mantelclock

That clocks wrong again That clock hardly ever knows what time it
is and when it does know it lies about itwhich amounts to the same
thing Alfred

There was no answer

Alfred Good servant but as uncertain as the clock

Alonzo touched an electric bell button in the wall He waited a moment
then touched it again waited a few moments more and said

Battery out of order no doubt But now that I have started I will
find out what time it is He stepped to a speakingtube in the wall
blew its whistle and called Mother and repeated it twice

Well thats no use Mothers battery is out of order too Cant raise
anybody downstairsthat is plain

He sat down at a rosewood desk leaned his chin on the lefthand edge of
it and spoke as if to the floor Aunt Susan

A low pleasant voice answered Is that you Alonzo

Yes Im too lazy and comfortable to go downstairs I am in extremity
and I cant seem to scare up any help

Dear me what is the matter

Matter enough I can tell you

Oh dont keep me in suspense dear What is it

I want to know what time it is

You abominable boy what a turn you did give me Is that all

Allon my honor Calm yourself Tell me the time and receive my
blessing

Just five minutes after nine No chargekeep your blessing

Thanks It wouldnt have impoverished me aunty nor so enriched you
that you could live without other means

He got up murmuring Just five minutes after nine and faced his
clock Ah said he you are doing better than usual You are only
thirtyfour minutes wrong Let me see let me see Thirtythree
and twentyone are fiftyfour four times fiftyfour are two hundred and
thirtysix One off leaves two hundred and thirtyfive Thats right

He turned the hands of his clock forward till they marked twentyfive
minutes to one and said Now see if you cant keep right for a
whileelse Ill raffle you

He sat down at the desk again and said Aunt Susan

Yes dear

Had breakfast

Yes indeed an hour ago

Busy

Noexcept sewing Why

Got any company

No but I expect some at half past nine

I wish I did Im lonesome I want to talk to somebody

Very well talk to me

But this is very private

Dont be afraidtalk right along theres nobody here but me

I hardly know whether to venture or not but

But what Oh dont stop there You know you can trust me Alonzoyou
know you can

I feel it aunt but this is very serious It affects me deeplyme
and all the familyeven the whole community

Oh Alonzo tell me I will never breathe a word of it What is it

Aunt if I might dare

Oh please go on I love you and feel for you Tell me all Confide in
me What is it

The weather

Plague take the weather I dont see how you can have the heart to
serve me so Lon

There there aunty dear Im sorry I am on my honor I wont do it
again Do you forgive me

Yes since you seem so sincere about it though I know I oughtnt to
You will fool me again as soon as I have forgotten this time

No I wont honor bright But such weather oh such weather Youve
got to keep your spirits up artificially It is snowy and blowy and
gusty and bitter cold How is the weather with you

Warm and rainy and melancholy The mourners go about the streets with
their umbrellas running streams from the end of every whalebone Theres
an elevated double pavement of umbrellas stretching down the sides of
the streets as far as I can see Ive got a fire for cheerfulness and
the windows open to keep cool But it is vain it is useless nothing
comes in but the balmy breath of December with its burden of mocking
odors from the flowers that possess the realm outside and rejoice in
their lawless profusion whilst the spirit of man is low and flaunt
their gaudy splendors in his face while his soul is clothed in sackcloth
and ashes and his heart breaketh

Alonzo opened his lips to say You ought to print that and get it
framed but checked himself for he heard his aunt speaking to some
one else He went and stood at the window and looked out upon the wintry
prospect The storm was driving the snow before it more furiously than
ever windowshutters were slamming and banging a forlorn dog with
bowed head and tail withdrawn from service was pressing his quaking
body against a windward wall for shelter and protection a young girl
was plowing kneedeep through the drifts with her face turned from the
blast and the cape of her waterproof blowing straight rearward over her
head Alonzo shuddered and said with a sigh Better the slop and the
sultry rain and even the insolent flowers than this

He turned from the window moved a step and stopped in a listening
attitude The faint sweet notes of a familiar song caught his ear He
remained there with his head unconsciously bent forward drinking in
the melody stirring neither hand nor foot hardly breathing There was
a blemish in the execution of the song but to Alonzo it seemed an added
charm instead of a defect This blemish consisted of a marked flatting
of the third fourth fifth sixth and seventh notes of the refrain or
chorus of the piece When the music ended Alonzo drew a deep breath
and said Ah I never have heard In the Sweet Byandby sung like
that before

He stepped quickly to the desk listened a moment and said in a
guarded confidential voice Aunty who is this divine singer

She is the company I was expecting Stays with me a month or two I
will introduce you Miss

For goodness sake wait a moment Aunt Susan You never stop to think
what you are about

He flew to his bedchamber and returned in a moment perceptibly changed
in his outward appearance and remarking snappishly

Hang it she would have introduced me to this angel in that skyblue
dressinggown with redhot lapels Women never think when they get
agoing

He hastened and stood by the desk and said eagerly Now Aunty I am
ready and fell to smiling and bowing with all the persuasiveness and
elegance that were in him

Very well Miss Rosannah Ethelton let me introduce to you my favorite
nephew Mr Alonzo Fitz Clarence There You are both good people and
I like you so I am going to trust you together while I attend to a
few household affairs Sit down Rosannah sit down Alonzo Goodby I
shant be gone long

Alonzo had been bowing and smiling all the while and motioning
imaginary young ladies to sit down in imaginary chairs but now he took
a seat himself mentally saying Oh this is luck Let the winds blow
now and the snow drive and the heavens frown Little I care

While these young people chat themselves into an acquaintanceship let
us take the liberty of inspecting the sweeter and fairer of the two She
sat alone at her graceful ease in a richly furnished apartment which
was manifestly the private parlor of a refined and sensible lady
if signs and symbols may go for anything For instance by a low
comfortable chair stood a dainty topheavy workstand whose summit was
a fancifully embroidered shallow basket with varicolored crewels and
other strings and odds and ends protruding from under the gaping lid and
hanging down in negligent profusion On the floor lay bright shreds of
Turkey red Prussian blue and kindred fabrics bits of ribbon a spool
or two a pair of scissors and a roll or so of tinted silken stuffs
On a luxurious sofa upholstered with some sort of soft Indian goods
wrought in black and gold threads interwebbed with other threads not
so pronounced in color lay a great square of coarse white stuff upon
whose surface a rich bouquet of flowers was growing under the deft
cultivation of the crochetneedle The household cat was asleep on this
work of art In a baywindow stood an easel with an unfinished picture
on it and a palette and brushes on a chair beside it There were books
everywhere Robertsons Sermons Tennyson Moody and Sankey Hawthorne
Rab and His Friends cookbooks prayerbooks patternbooksand books
about all kinds of odious and exasperating pottery of course There was
a piano with a deckload of music and more in a tender There was
a great plenty of pictures on the walls on the shelves of the
mantelpiece and around generally where coigns of vantage offered
were statuettes and quaint and pretty gimcracks and rare and costly
specimens of peculiarly devilish china The baywindow gave upon a
garden that was ablaze with foreign and domestic flowers and flowering
shrubs

But the sweet young girl was the daintiest thing these premises within
or without could offer for contemplation delicately chiseled features
of Grecian cast her complexion the pure snow of a japonica that is
receiving a faint reflected enrichment from some scarlet neighbor of
the garden great soft blue eyes fringed with long curving lashes an
expression made up of the trustfulness of a child and the gentleness of
a fawn a beautiful head crowned with its own prodigal gold a lithe
and rounded figure whose every attitude and movement was instinct with
native grace

Her dress and adornment were marked by that exquisite harmony that can
come only of a fine natural taste perfected by culture Her gown was of
a simple magenta tulle cut bias traversed by three rows of lightblue
flounces with the selvage edges turned up with ashesofroses
chenille overdress of dark bay tarlatan with scarlet satin lambrequins
corncolored polonaise en panier looped with motherofpearl buttons
and silver cord and hauled aft and made fast by buff velvet lashings
basque of lavender reps picked out with valenciennes low neck short
sleeves maroon velvet necktie edged with delicate pink silk inside
handkerchief of some simple threeply ingrain fabric of a soft saffron
tint coral bracelets and locketchain coiffure of forgetmenots and
liliesofthevalley massed around a noble calla

This was all yet even in this subdued attire she was divinely
beautiful Then what must she have been when adorned for the festival or
the ball

All this time she had been busily chatting with Alonzo unconscious of
our inspection The minutes still sped and still she talked But by and
by she happened to look up and saw the clock A crimson blush sent its
rich flood through her cheeks and she exclaimed

There goodby Mr Fitz Clarence I must go now

She sprang from her chair with such haste that she hardly heard the
young mans answering goodby She stood radiant graceful beautiful
and gazed wondering upon the accusing clock Presently her pouting
lips parted and she said

Five minutes after eleven Nearly two hours and it did not seem twenty
minutes Oh dear what will he think of me

At the selfsame moment Alonzo was staring at his clock And presently
he said

Twentyfive minutes to three Nearly two hours and I didnt believe
it was two minutes Is it possible that this clock is humbugging again
Miss Ethelton Just one moment please Are you there yet

Yes but be quick Im going right away

Would you be so kind as to tell me what time it is

The girl blushed again murmured to herself Its right down cruel
of him to ask me and then spoke up and answered with admirably
counterfeited unconcern Five minutes after eleven

Oh thank you You have to go now have you

Im sorry

No reply

Miss Ethelton

Well

Youyoure there yet aint you

Yes but please hurry What did you want to say

Well Iwell nothing in particular Its very lonesome here Its
asking a great deal I know but would you mind talking with me again by
and bythat is if it will not trouble you too much

I dont know but Ill think about it Ill try

Oh thanks Miss Ethelton Ah me shes gone and here are the
black clouds and the whirling snow and the raging winds come again But
she said goodby She didnt say good morning she said goodby  The
clock was right after all What a lightningwinged two hours it was

He sat down and gazed dreamily into his fire for a while then heaved a
sigh and said

How wonderful it is Two little hours ago I was a free man and now my
hearts in San Francisco

About that time Rosannah Ethelton propped in the windowseat of her
bedchamber book in hand was gazing vacantly out over the rainy seas
that washed the Golden Gate and whispering to herself How different
he is from poor Burley with his empty head and his single little antic
talent of mimicry

II

Four weeks later Mr Sidney Algernon Burley was entertaining a gay
luncheon company in a sumptuous drawingroom on Telegraph Hill with
some capital imitations of the voices and gestures of certain popular
actors and San Franciscan literary people and Bonanza grandees He was
elegantly upholstered and was a handsome fellow barring a trifling
cast in his eye He seemed very jovial but nevertheless he kept his eye
on the door with an expectant and uneasy watchfulness By and by a nobby
lackey appeared and delivered a message to the mistress who nodded her
head understandingly That seemed to settle the thing for Mr Burley
his vivacity decreased little by little and a dejected look began to
creep into one of his eyes and a sinister one into the other

The rest of the company departed in due time leaving him with the
mistress to whom he said

There is no longer any question about it She avoids me She
continually excuses herself If I could see her if I could speak to her
only a momentbut this suspense

Perhaps her seeming avoidance is mere accident Mr Burley Go to
the small drawingroom upstairs and amuse yourself a moment I will
despatch a household order that is on my mind and then I will go to her
room Without doubt she will be persuaded to see you

Mr Burley went upstairs intending to go to the small drawingroom
but as he was passing Aunt Susans private parlor the door of which
stood slightly ajar he heard a joyous laugh which he recognized so
without knock or announcement he stepped confidently in But before he
could make his presence known he heard words that harrowed up his soul
and chilled his young blood he heard a voice say

Darling it has come

Then he heard Rosannah Ethelton whose back was toward him say

So has yours dearest

He saw her bowed form bend lower he heard her kiss somethingnot
merely once but again and again His soul raged within him The
heartbreaking conversation went on

Rosannah I knew you must be beautiful but this is dazzling this is
blinding this is intoxicating

Alonzo it is such happiness to hear you say it I know it is not true
but I am so grateful to have you think it is nevertheless I knew you
must have a noble face but the grace and majesty of the reality beggar
the poor creation of my fancy

Burley heard that rattling shower of kisses again

Thank you my Rosannah The photograph flatters me but you must not
allow yourself to think of that Sweetheart

Yes Alonzo

I am so happy Rosannah

Oh Alonzo none that have gone before me knew what love was none that
come after me will ever know what happiness is I float in a gorgeous
cloud land a boundless firmament of enchanted and bewildering ecstasy

Oh my Rosannahfor you are mine are you not

Wholly oh wholly yours Alonzo now and forever All the day long
and all through my nightly dreams one song sings itself and its sweet
burden is Alonzo Fitz Clarence Alonzo Fitz Clarence Eastport state
of Maine

Curse him Ive got his address anyway roared Burley inwardly and
rushed from the place

Just behind the unconscious Alonzo stood his mother a picture of
astonishment She was so muffled from head to heel in furs that nothing
of herself was visible but her eyes and nose She was a good allegory of
winter for she was powdered all over with snow

Behind the unconscious Rosannah stood Aunt Susan another picture of
astonishment She was a good allegory of summer for she was lightly
clad and was vigorously cooling the perspiration on her face with a
fan

Both of these women had tears of joy in their eyes

Soho exclaimed Mrs Fitz Clarence this explains why nobody has been
able to drag you out of your room for six weeks Alonzo

So ho exclaimed Aunt Susan this explains why you have been a hermit
for the past six weeks Rosannah

The young couple were on their feet in an instant abashed and standing
like detected dealers in stolen goods awaiting judge Lynchs doom

Bless you my son I am happy in your happiness Come to your mothers
arms Alonzo

Bless you Rosannah for my dear nephews sake Come to my arms

Then was there a mingling of hearts and of tears of rejoicing on
Telegraph Hill and in Eastport Square

Servants were called by the elders in both places Unto one was given
the order Pile this fire high with hickory wood and bring me a
roastinghot lemonade

Unto the other was given the order Put out this fire and bring me two
palmleaf fans and a pitcher of icewater

Then the young people were dismissed and the elders sat down to talk
the sweet surprise over and make the wedding plans

Some minutes before this Mr Burley rushed from the mansion on Telegraph
Hill without meeting or taking formal leave of anybody He hissed
through his teeth in unconscious imitation of a popular favorite in
melodrama Him shall she never wed I have sworn it Ere great Nature
shall have doffed her winters ermine to don the emerald gauds of
spring she shall be mine

III

Two weeks later Every few hours during same three or four days a very
prim and devoutlooking Episcopal clergyman with a cast in his eye had
visited Alonzo According to his card he was the Rev Melton Hargrave
of Cincinnati He said he had retired from the ministry on account of
his health If he had said on account of illhealth he would probably
have erred to judge by his wholesome looks and firm build He was the
inventor of an improvement in telephones and hoped to make his bread
by selling the privilege of using it At present he continued a man
may go and tap a telegraph wire which is conveying a song or a concert
from one state to another and he can attach his private telephone and
steal a hearing of that music as it passes along My invention will stop
all that

Well answered Alonzo if the owner of the music could not miss what
was stolen why should he care

He shouldnt care said the Reverend

Well said Alonzo inquiringly

Suppose replied the Reverend suppose that instead of music that
was passing along and being stolen the burden of the wire was loving
endearments of the most private and sacred nature

Alonzo shuddered from head to heel Sir it is a priceless invention
 said he I must have it at any cost

But the invention was delayed somewhere on the road from Cincinnati
most unaccountably The impatient Alonzo could hardly wait The thought
of Rosannahs sweet words being shared with him by some ribald thief was
galling to him The Reverend came frequently and lamented the delay and
told of measures he had taken to hurry things up This was some little
comfort to Alonzo

One forenoon the Reverend ascended the stairs and knocked at Alonzos
door There was no response He entered glanced eagerly around closed
the door softly then ran to the telephone The exquisitely soft and
remote strains of the Sweet Byandby came floating through the
instrument The singer was flatting as usual the five notes that
follow the first two in the chorus when the Reverend interrupted her
with this word in a voice which was an exact imitation of Alonzos
with just the faintest flavor of impatience added

Sweetheart

Yes Alonzo

Please dont sing that any more this weektry something modern

The agile step that goes with a happy heart was heard on the stairs
and the Reverend smiling diabolically sought sudden refuge behind the
heavy folds of the velvet windowcurtains Alonzo entered and flew to
the telephone Said he

Rosannah dear shall we sing something together

Something modern asked she with sarcastic bitterness

Yes if you prefer

Sing it yourself if you like

This snappishness amazed and wounded the young man He said

Rosannah that was not like you

I suppose it becomes me as much as your very polite speech became you
Mr Fitz Clarence

Mister Fitz Clarence Rosannah there was nothing impolite about my
speech

Oh indeed Of course then I misunderstood you and I most humbly
beg your pardon hahaha No doubt you said Dont sing it any more
today

Sing what any more today

The song you mentioned of course How very obtuse we are all of a
sudden

I never mentioned any song

Oh you didnt

No I didnt

I am compelled to remark that you did

And I am obliged to reiterate that I didnt

A second rudeness That is sufficient sir I will never forgive you
All is over between us

Then came a muffled sound of crying Alonzo hastened to say

Oh Rosannah unsay those words There is some dreadful mystery here
some hideous mistake I am utterly earnest and sincere when I say I
never said anything about any song I would not hurt you for the whole
world Rosannah dear speak to me wont you

There was a pause then Alonzo heard the girls sobbings retreating
and knew she had gone from the telephone He rose with a heavy sigh and
hastened from the room saying to himself I will ransack the charity
missions and the haunts of the poor for my mother She will persuade her
that I never meant to wound her

A minute later the Reverend was crouching over the telephone like a cat
that knoweth the ways of the prey He had not very many minutes to wait
A soft repentant voice tremulous with tears said

Alonzo dear I have been wrong You could not have said so cruel a
thing It must have been some one who imitated your voice in malice or
in jest

The Reverend coldly answered in Alonzos tones

You have said all was over between us So let it be I spurn your
proffered repentance and despise it

Then he departed radiant with fiendish triumph to return no more with
his imaginary telephonic invention forever

Four hours afterward Alonzo arrived with his mother from her favorite
haunts of poverty and vice They summoned the San Francisco household
but there was no reply They waited and continued to wait upon the
voiceless telephone

At length when it was sunset in San Francisco and three hours and
a half after dark in Eastport an answer to the oftrepeated cry of
Rosannah

But alas it was Aunt Susans voice that spake She said

I have been out all day just got in I will go and find her

The watchers waited two minutesfive minutesten minutes Then came
these fatal words in a frightened tone

She is gone and her baggage with her To visit another friend she
told the servants But I found this note on the table in her room
Listen I am gone seek not to trace me out my heart is broken you
will never see me more Tell him I shall always think of him when I sing
my poor Sweet Byandby but never of the unkind words he said about
it That is her note Alonzo Alonzo what does it mean What has
happened

But Alonzo sat white and cold as the dead His mother threw back
the velvet curtains and opened a window The cold air refreshed the
sufferer and he told his aunt his dismal story Meantime his mother
was inspecting a card which had disclosed itself upon the floor when
she cast the curtains back It read Mr Sidney Algernon Burley San
Francisco

The miscreant shouted Alonzo and rushed forth to seek the false
Reverend and destroy him for the card explained everything since in
the course of the lovers mutual confessions they had told each other
all about all the sweethearts they had ever had and thrown no end of
mud at their failings and foibles for lovers always do that It has a
fascination that ranks next after billing and cooing

IV

During the next two months many things happened It had early transpired
that Rosannah poor suffering orphan had neither returned to her
grandmother in Portland Oregon nor sent any word to her save a
duplicate of the woeful note she had left in the mansion on Telegraph
Hill Whosoever was sheltering herif she was still alivehad been
persuaded not to betray her whereabouts without doubt for all efforts
to find trace of her had failed

Did Alonzo give her up Not he He said to himself She will sing
that sweet song when she is sad I shall find her So he took his
carpetsack and a portable telephone and shook the snow of his native
city from his arctics and went forth into the world He wandered far
and wide and in many states Time and again strangers were astounded to
see a wasted pale and woeworn man laboriously climb a telegraphpole
in wintry and lonely places perch sadly there an hour with his ear at
a little box then come sighing down and wander wearily away Sometimes
they shot at him as peasants do at aeronauts thinking him mad and
dangerous Thus his clothes were much shredded by bullets and his person
grievously lacerated But he bore it all patiently

In the beginning of his pilgrimage he used often to say Ah if I could
but hear the Sweet Byandby But toward the end of it he used to
shed tears of anguish and say Ah if I could but hear something else

Thus a month and three weeks drifted by and at last some humane people
seized him and confined him in a private madhouse in New York He made
no moan for his strength was all gone and with it all heart and all
hope The superintendent in pity gave up his own comfortable parlor
and bedchamber to him and nursed him with affectionate devotion

At the end of a week the patient was able to leave his bed for the first
time He was lying comfortably pillowed on a sofa listening to the
plaintive Miserere of the bleak March winds and the muffled sound of
tramping feet in the street below for it was about six in the evening
and New York was going home from work He had a bright fire and the
added cheer of a couple of studentlamps So it was warm and snug
within though bleak and raw without it was light and bright within
though outside it was as dark and dreary as if the world had been lit
with Hartford gas Alonzo smiled feebly to think how his loving vagaries
had made him a maniac in the eyes of the world and was proceeding to
pursue his line of thought further when a faint sweet strain the very
ghost of sound so remote and attenuated it seemed struck upon his ear
His pulses stood still he listened with parted lips and bated
breath The song flowed onhe waiting listening rising slowly and
unconsciously from his recumbent position At last he exclaimed

It is it is she Oh the divine hated notes

He dragged himself eagerly to the corner whence the sounds proceeded
tore aside a curtain and discovered a telephone He bent over and as
the last note died away he burst forthwith the exclamation

Oh thank Heaven found at last Speak to me Rosannah dearest The
cruel mystery has been unraveled it was the villain Burley who mimicked
my voice and wounded you with insolent speech

There was a breathless pause a waiting age to Alonzo then a faint
sound came framing itself into language

Oh say those precious words again Alonzo

They are the truth the veritable truth my Rosannah and you shall
have the proof ample and abundant proof

Oh Alonzo stay by me Leave me not for a moment Let me feel that you
are near me Tell me we shall never be parted more Oh this happy hour
this blessed hour this memorable hour

We will make record of it my Rosannah every year as this dear hour
chimes from the clock we will celebrate it with thanksgivings all the
years of our life

We will we will Alonzo

Four minutes after six in the evening my Rosannah shall
henceforth

Twentythree minutes after twelve afternoon shall

Why Rosannah darling where are you

In Honolulu Sandwich Islands And where are you Stay by me do not
leave me for a moment I cannot bear it Are you at home

No dear I am in New Yorka patient in the doctors hands

An agonizing shriek came buzzing to Alonzos ear like the sharp buzzing
of a hurt gnat it lost power in traveling five thousand miles Alonzo
hastened to say

Calm yourself my child It is nothing Already I am getting well under
the sweet healing of your presence Rosannah

Yes Alonzo Oh how you terrified me Say on

Name the happy day Rosannah

There was a little pause Then a diffident small voice replied I
blushbut it is with pleasure it is with happiness Wouldwould you
like to have it soon

This very night Rosannah Oh let us risk no more delays Let it be
nowthis very night this very moment

Oh you impatient creature I have nobody here but my good old uncle
a missionary for a generation and now retired from servicenobody but
him and his wife I would so dearly like it if your mother and your Aunt
Susan

Our mother and our Aunt Susan my Rosannah

Yes our mother and our Aunt SusanI am content to word it so if it
pleases you I would so like to have them present

So would I Suppose you telegraph Aunt Susan How long would it take
her to come

The steamer leaves San Francisco day after tomorrow The passage is
eight days She would be here the st of March

Then name the st of April do Rosannah dear

Mercy it would make us April fools Alonzo

So we be the happiest ones that that days suit looks down upon in the
whole broad expanse of the globe why need we care Call it the st of
April dear

Then the st of April at shall be with all my heart

Oh happiness Name the hour too Rosannah

I like the morning it is so blithe Will eight in the morning do
Alonzo

The loveliest hour in the daysince it will make you mine

There was a feeble but frantic sound for some little time as if
woollipped disembodied spirits were exchanging kisses then Rosannah
said Excuse me just a moment dear I have an appointment and am
called to meet it

The young girl sought a large parlor and took her place at a window
which looked out upon a beautiful scene To the left one could view the
charming Nuuana Valley fringed with its ruddy flush of tropical flowers
and its plumed and graceful cocoa palms its rising foothills clothed
in the shining green of lemon citron and orange groves its storied
precipice beyond where the first Kamehameha drove his defeated foes
over to their destruction a spot that had forgotten its grim history
no doubt for now it was smiling as almost always at noonday under the
glowing arches of a succession of rainbows In front of the window one
could see the quaint town and here and there a picturesque group of
dusky natives enjoying the blistering weather and far to the right lay
the restless ocean tossing its white mane in the sunshine

Rosannah stood there in her filmy white raiment fanning her flushed
and heated face waiting A Kanaka boy clothed in a damaged blue
necktie and part of a silk hat thrust his head in at the door and
announced Frisco haole

Show him in said the girl straightening herself up and assuming a
meaning dignity Mr Sidney Algernon Burley entered clad from head to
heel in dazzling snowthat is to say in the lightest and whitest of
Irish linen He moved eagerly forward but the girl made a gesture and
gave him a look which checked him suddenly She said coldly I am
here as I promised I believed your assertions I yielded to your
importune lies and said I would name the day I name the st of
Aprileight in the morning NOW GO

Oh my dearest if the gratitude of a lifetime

Not a word Spare me all sight of you all communication with you
until that hour Nono supplications I will have it so

When he was gone she sank exhausted in a chair for the long siege of
troubles she had undergone had wasted her strength Presently she
said What a narrow escape If the hour appointed had been an hour
earlierOh horror what an escape I have made And to think I had come
to imagine I was loving this beguiling this truthless this treacherous
monster Oh he shall repent his villainy

Let us now draw this history to a close for little more needs to be
told On the d of the ensuing April the Honolulu Advertiser contained
this notice

The New York papers of the same date contained this notice

     MARRIEDIn this city yesterday by telephone at halfpast two in
     the morning by Rev  Nathaniel Davis assisted by Rev Nathan Hays
     of Honolulu Mr Alonzo Fitz Clarence of Eastport Maine and Miss
     Rosannah Ethelton of Portland Oregon  The parents and several
     friends of the bridegroom were present and enjoyed a sumptuous
     breakfast and much festivity until nearly sunrise and then departed
     on a bridal trip to the Aquarium the bridegrooms state of health
     not admitting of a more extended journey

Toward the close of that memorable day Mr and Mrs Alonzo Fitz Clarence
were buried in sweet converse concerning the pleasures of their several
bridal tours when suddenly the young wife exclaimed Oh Lonny I
forgot I did what I said I would

Did you dear

Indeed I did I made him the April fool And I told him so too
Ah it was a charming surprise There he stood sweltering in a black
dresssuit with the mercury leaking out of the top of the thermometer
waiting to be married You should have seen the look he gave when I
whispered it in his ear Ah his wickedness cost me many a heartache
and many a tear but the score was all squared up then So the vengeful
feeling went right out of my heart and I begged him to stay and said
I forgave him everything But he wouldnt He said he would live to be
avenged said he would make our lives a curse to us But he cant can
he dear

Never in this world my Rosannah

Aunt Susan the Oregonian grandmother and the young couple and their
Eastport parents are all happy at this writing and likely to remain
so Aunt Susan brought the bride from the islands accompanied her
across our continent and had the happiness of witnessing the rapturous
meeting between an adoring husband and wife who had never seen each
other until that moment

A word about the wretched Burley whose wicked machinations came so
near wrecking the hearts and lives of our poor young friends will be
sufficient In a murderous attempt to seize a crippled and helpless
artisan who he fancied had done him some small offense he fell into a
caldron of boiling oil and expired before he could be extinguished




ON THE DECAY OF THE ART OF LYING

ESSAY FOR DISCUSSION READ AT A MEETING OF THE HISTORICAL AND
ANTIQUARIAN CLUB OF HARTFORD AND OFFERED FOR THE THIRTYDOLLAR PRIZE
NOW FIRST PUBLISHEDDid not take the prize

Observe I do not mean to suggest that the custom of lying has suffered
any decay or interruptionno for the Lie as a Virtue a Principle is
eternal the Lie as a recreation a solace a refuge in time of need
the fourth Grace the tenth Muse mans best and surest friend is
immortal and cannot perish from the earth while this Club remains My
complaint simply concerns the decay of the art of lying No highminded
man no man of right feeling can contemplate the lumbering and
slovenly lying of the present day without grieving to see a noble art so
prostituted In this veteran presence I naturally enter upon this scheme
with diffidence it is like an old maid trying to teach nursery matters
to the mothers in Israel It would not become me to criticize you
gentlemen who are nearly all my eldersand my superiors in this
thingand so if I should here and there seem to do it I trust it will
in most cases be more in a spirit of admiration than of faultfinding
indeed if this finest of the fine arts had everywhere received the
attention encouragement and conscientious practice and development
which this Club has devoted to it I should not need to utter this lament
or shed a single tear I do not say this to flatter I say it in a
spirit of just and appreciative recognition

It had been my intention at this point to mention names and give
illustrative specimens but indications observable about me admonished
me to beware of particulars and confine myself to generalities

No fact is more firmly established than that lying is a necessity of
our circumstancesthe deduction that it is then a Virtue goes without
saying No virtue can reach its highest usefulness without careful and
diligent cultivationtherefore it goes without saying that this one
ought to be taught in the public schoolsat the firesideeven in the
newspapers What chance has the ignorant uncultivated liar against the
educated expert What chance have I against Mr Per against a lawyer
Judicious lying is what the world needs I sometimes think it were
even better and safer not to lie at all than to lie injudiciously An
awkward unscientific lie is often as ineffectual as the truth

Now let us see what the philosophers say Note that venerable
proverb Children and fools always speak the truth The deduction is
plainadults and wise persons never speak it Parkman the historian
says The principle of truth may itself be carried into an absurdity
 In another place in the same chapter he says The saying is old
that truth should not be spoken at all times and those whom a sick
conscience worries into habitual violation of the maxim are imbeciles
and nuisances It is strong language but true None of us could live
with an habitual truthteller but thank goodness none of us has to
An habitual truthteller is simply an impossible creature he does not
exist he never has existed Of course there are people who think they
never lie but it is not soand this ignorance is one of the very
things that shame our socalled civilization Everybody liesevery day
every hour awake asleep in his dreams in his joy in his mourning
if he keeps his tongue still his hands his feet his eyes his
attitude will convey deceptionand purposely Even in sermonsbut
that is a platitude

In a far country where I once lived the ladies used to go around paying
calls under the humane and kindly pretense of wanting to see each
other and when they returned home they would cry out with a glad
voice saying We made sixteen calls and found fourteen of them
outnot meaning that they found out anything against the fourteenno
that was only a colloquial phrase to signify that they were not at
homeand their manner of saying itexpressed their lively satisfaction
in that fact Now their pretense of wanting to see the fourteenand
the other two whom they had been less lucky withwas that commonest and
mildest form of lying which is sufficiently described as a deflection
from the truth Is it justifiable Most certainly It is beautiful
it is noble for its object is not to reap profit but to convey a
pleasure to the sixteen The ironsouled truthmonger would plainly
manifest or even utter the fact that he didnt want to see those
peopleand he would be an ass and inflict a totally unnecessary pain
And next those ladies in that far countrybut never mind they had a
thousand pleasant ways of lying that grew out of gentle impulses and
were a credit to their intelligence and an honor to their hearts Let
the particulars go

The men in that far country were liars every one Their mere howdydo
was a lie because they didnt care how you did except they were
undertakers To the ordinary inquirer you lied in return for you made
no conscientious diagnosis of your case but answered at random and
usually missed it considerably You lied to the undertaker and said
your health was failinga wholly commendable lie since it cost you
nothing and pleased the other man If a stranger called and interrupted
you you said with your hearty tongue Im glad to see you and said
with your heartier soul I wish you were with the cannibals and it was
dinnertime When he went you said regretfully Must you go and
followed it with a Call again but you did no harm for you did not
deceive anybody nor inflict any hurt whereas the truth would have made
you both unhappy

I think that all this courteous lying is a sweet and loving art and
should be cultivated The highest perfection of politeness is only a
beautiful edifice built from the base to the dome of graceful and
gilded forms of charitable and unselfish lying

What I bemoan is the growing prevalence of the brutal truth Let us do
what we can to eradicate it An injurious truth has no merit over an
injurious lie Neither should ever be uttered The man who speaks an
injurious truth lest his soul be not saved if he do otherwise should
reflect that that sort of a soul is not strictly worth saving The man
who tells a lie to help a poor devil out of trouble is one of whom the
angels doubtless say Lo here is an heroic soul who casts his own
welfare into jeopardy to succor his neighbors let us exalt this
magnanimous liar

An injurious lie is an uncommendable thing and so also and in the
same degree is an injurious trutha fact which is recognized by the
law of libel

Among other common lies we have the silent liethe deception which one
conveys by simply keeping still and concealing the truth Many obstinate
truthmongers indulge in this dissipation imagining that if they speak
no lie they lie not at all In that far country where I once lived
there was a lovely spirit a lady whose impulses were always high and
pure and whose character answered to them One day I was there at
dinner and remarked in a general way that we are all liars She was
amazed and said Not all It was before Pinafores time so I did
not make the response which would naturally follow in our day but
frankly said Yes allwe are all liars there are no exceptions She
looked almost offended and said Why do you include me Certainly
 I said I think you even rank as an expert She said Shsh the
children

So the subject was changed in deference to the childrens presence and
we went on talking about other things But as soon as the young people
were out of the way the lady came warmly back to the matter and said
I have made it the rule of my life to never tell a lie and I have
never departed from it in a single instance I said I dont mean the
least harm or disrespect but really you have been lying like smoke
ever since Ive been sitting here It has caused me a good deal of pain
because I am not used to it She required of me an instancejust a
single instance So I said

Well here is the unfilled duplicate of the blank which the Oakland
hospital people sent to you by the hand of the sicknurse when she came
here to nurse your little nephew through his dangerous illness This
blank asks all manner of questions as to the conduct of that sicknurse
Did she ever sleep on her watch Did she ever forget to give the
medicine and so forth and so on You are warned to be very careful and
explicit in your answers for the welfare of the service requires that
the nurses be promptly fined or otherwise punished for derelictions
You told me you were perfectly delighted with that nursethat she had
a thousand perfections and only one fault you found you never could
depend on her wrapping Johnny up half sufficiently while he waited in
a chilly chair for her to rearrange the warm bed You filled up the
duplicate of this paper and sent it back to the hospital by the hand of
the nurse How did you answer this questionWas the nurse at any
time guilty of a negligence which was likely to result in the patients
taking cold Comeeverything is decided by a bet here in California
ten dollars to ten cents you lied when you answered that question She
said I didnt I left it blank Just soyou have told a silent lie
you have left it to be inferred that you had no fault to find in that
matter She said Oh was that a lie And how could I mention her one
single fault and she so goodit would have been cruel I said One
ought always to lie when one can do good by it your impulse was right
but your judgment was crude this comes of unintelligent practice Now
observe the result of this inexpert deflection of yours You know
Mr Joness Willie is lying very low with scarlet fever well your
recommendation was so enthusiastic that that girl is there nursing him
and the wornout family have all been trustingly sound asleep for the
last fourteen hours leaving their darling with full confidence in
those fatal hands because you like young George Washington have a
reputaHowever if you are not going to have anything to do I will
come around tomorrow and well attend the funeral together for of
course youll naturally feel a peculiar interest in Willies caseas
personal a one in fact as the undertaker

But that was all lost Before I was halfway through she was in a
carriage and making thirty miles an hour toward the Jones mansion to
save what was left of Willie and tell all she knew about the deadly
nurse All of which was unnecessary as Willie wasnt sick I had been
lying myself But that same day all the same she sent a line to the
hospital which filled up the neglected blank and stated the facts too
in the squarest possible manner

Now you see this ladys fault was not in lying but only in lying
injudiciously She should have told the truth there and made it up to
the nurse with a fraudulent compliment further along in the paper She
could have said In one respect the sicknurse is perfectionwhen she
is on watch she never snores Almost any little pleasant lie would
have taken the sting out of that troublesome but necessary expression of
the truth

Lying is universalwe all do it we all must do it Therefore the
wise thing is for us diligently to train ourselves to lie thoughtfully
judiciously to lie with a good object and not an evil one to lie
for others advantage and not our own to lie healingly charitably
humanely not cruelly hurtfully maliciously to lie gracefully
and graciously not awkwardly and clumsily to lie firmly frankly
squarely with head erect not haltingly tortuously with pusillanimous
mien as being ashamed of our high calling Then shall we be rid of
the rank and pestilent truth that is rotting the land then shall we be
great and good and beautiful and worthy dwellers in a world where
even benign Nature habitually lies except when she promises execrable
weather Thenbut I am but a new and feeble student in this gracious
art I can not instruct this Club

Joking aside I think there is much need of wise examination into what
sorts of lies are best and wholesomest to be indulged seeing we must
all lie and do all lie and what sorts it may be best to avoidand this
is a thing which I feel I can confidently put into the hands of this
experienced Cluba ripe body who may be termed in this regard and
without undue flattery Old Masters




ABOUT MAGNANIMOUSINCIDENT LITERATURE

All my life from boyhood up I have had the habit of reading a certain
set of anecdotes written in the quaint vein of The Worlds ingenious
Fabulist for the lesson they taught me and the pleasure they gave me
They lay always convenient to my hand and whenever I thought meanly of
my kind I turned to them and they banished that sentiment whenever
I felt myself to be selfish sordid and ignoble I turned to them and
they told me what to do to win back my selfrespect Many times I wished
that the charming anecdotes had not stopped with their happy climaxes
but had continued the pleasing history of the several benefactors and
beneficiaries This wish rose in my breast so persistently that at last
I determined to satisfy it by seeking out the sequels of those anecdotes
myself So I set about it and after great labor and tedious research
accomplished my task I will lay the result before you giving you each
anecdote in its turn and following it with its sequel as I gathered it
through my investigations

                           THE GRATEFUL POODLE

One day a benevolent physician who had read the books having found a
stray poodle suffering from a broken leg conveyed the poor creature
to his home and after setting and bandaging the injured limb gave the
little outcast its liberty again and thought no more about the matter
But how great was his surprise upon opening his door one morning some
days later to find the grateful poodle patiently waiting there and in
its company another stray dog one of whose legs by some accident had
been broken The kind physician at once relieved the distressed animal
nor did he forget to admire the inscrutable goodness and mercy of God
who had been willing to use so humble an instrument as the poor outcast
poodle for the inculcating of etc etc etc

                                  SEQUEL

The next morning the benevolent physician found the two dogs
beaming with gratitude waiting at his door and with them two other
dogscripples The cripples were speedily healed and the four went
their way leaving the benevolent physician more overcome by pious
wonder than ever The day passed the morning came There at the door
sat now the four reconstructed dogs and with them four others requiring
reconstruction This day also passed and another morning came and now
sixteen dogs eight of them newly crippled occupied the sidewalk and
the people were going around By noon the broken legs were all set but
the pious wonder in the good physicians breast was beginning to get
mixed with involuntary profanity The sun rose once more and exhibited
thirtytwo dogs sixteen of them with broken legs occupying the
sidewalk and half of the street the human spectators took up the rest
of the room The cries of the wounded the songs of the healed brutes
and the comments of the onlooking citizens made great and inspiring
cheer but traffic was interrupted in that street The good physician
hired a couple of assistant surgeons and got through his benevolent
work before dark first taking the precaution to cancel his
church membership so that he might express himself with the latitude
which the case required

But some things have their limits When once more the morning dawned
and the good physician looked out upon a massed and farreaching
multitude of clamorous and beseeching dogs he said I might as well
acknowledge it I have been fooled by the books they only tell the
pretty part of the story and then stop Fetch me the shotgun this
thing has gone along far enough

He issued forth with his weapon and chanced to step upon the tail of
the original poodle who promptly bit him in the leg Now the great and
good work which this poodle had been engaged in had engendered in him
such a mighty and augmenting enthusiasm as to turn his weak head at last
and drive him mad A month later when the benevolent physician lay in
the deaththroes of hydrophobia he called his weeping friends about
him and said

Beware of the books They tell but half of the story Whenever a poor
wretch asks you for help and you feel a doubt as to what result may
flow from your benevolence give yourself the benefit of the doubt and
kill the applicant

And so saying he turned his face to the wall and gave up the ghost

                          THE BENEVOLENT AUTHOR

A poor and young literary beginner had tried in vain to get his
manuscripts accepted At last when the horrors of starvation were
staring him in the face he laid his sad case before a celebrated
author beseeching his counsel and assistance This generous man
immediately put aside his own matters and proceeded to peruse one of
the despised manuscripts Having completed his kindly task he shook the
poor young man cordially by the hand saying I perceive merit in
this come again to me on Monday At the time specified the celebrated
author with a sweet smile but saying nothing spread open a
magazine which was damp from the press What was the poor young mans
astonishment to discover upon the printed page his own article How
can I ever said he falling upon his knees and bursting into tears
testify my gratitude for this noble conduct

The celebrated author was the renowned Snodgrass the poor young
beginner thus rescued from obscurity and starvation was the afterward
equally renowned Snagsby Let this pleasing incident admonish us to turn
a charitable ear to all beginners that need help

                                  SEQUEL

The next week Snagsby was back with five rejected manuscripts The
celebrated author was a little surprised because in the books the
young struggler had needed but one lift apparently However he plowed
through these papers removing unnecessary flowers and digging up some
acres of adjectivestumps and then succeeded in getting two of the
articles accepted

A week or so drifted by and the grateful Snagsby arrived with another
cargo The celebrated author had felt a mighty glow of satisfaction
within himself the first time he had successfully befriended the poor
young struggler and had compared himself with the generous people in
the books with high gratification but he was beginning to suspect now
that he had struck upon something fresh in the nobleepisode line
His enthusiasm took a chill Still he could not bear to repulse this
struggling young author who clung to him with such pretty simplicity
and trustfulness

Well the upshot of it all was that the celebrated author presently
found himself permanently freighted with the poor young beginner All
his mild efforts to unload this cargo went for nothing He had to give
daily counsel daily encouragement he had to keep on procuring
magazine acceptances and then revamping the manuscripts to make them
presentable When the young aspirant got a start at last he rode into
sudden fame by describing the celebrated authors private life with such
a caustic humor and such minuteness of blistering detail that the book
sold a prodigious edition and broke the celebrated authors heart with
mortification With his latest gasp he said Alas the books deceived
me they do not tell the whole story Beware of the struggling
young author my friends Whom God sees fit to starve let not man
presumptuously rescue to his own undoing

                           THE GRATEFUL HUSBAND

One day a lady was driving through the principal street of a great city
with her little boy when the horses took fright and dashed madly away
hurling the coachman from his box and leaving the occupants of the
carnage paralyzed with terror But a brave youth who was driving a
grocerywagon threw himself before the plunging animals and succeeded
in arresting their flight at the peril of his ownThis is probably a
misprintM TThe grateful lady took his number and upon arriving
at her home she related the heroic act to her husband who had read the
books who listened with streaming eyes to the moving recital and who
after returning thanks in conjunction with his restored loved ones to
Him who suffereth not even a sparrow to fall to the ground unnoticed
sent for the brave young person and placing a check for five hundred
dollars in his hand said Take this as a reward for your noble act
William Ferguson and if ever you shall need a friend remember that
Thompson McSpadden has a grateful heart Let us learn from this that a
good deed cannot fail to benefit the doer however humble he may be

                                  SEQUEL

William Ferguson called the next week and asked Mr McSpadden to use his
influence to get him a higher employment he feeling capable of
better things than driving a grocers wagon Mr McSpadden got him an
underclerkship at a good salary

Presently William Fergusons mother fell sick and WilliamWell to
cut the story short Mr McSpadden consented to take her into his house
Before long she yearned for the society of her younger children so Mary
and Julia were admitted also and little Jimmy their brother Jimmy had
a pocket knife and he wandered into the drawingroom with it one
day alone and reduced ten thousand dollars worth of furniture to an
indeterminable value in rather less than threequarters of an hour A
day or two later he fell downstairs and broke his neck and seventeen
of his familys relatives came to the house to attend the funeral This
made them acquainted and they kept the kitchen occupied after that and
likewise kept the McSpaddens busy hunting up situations of various sorts
for them and hunting up more when they wore these out The old woman
drank a good deal and swore a good deal but the grateful McSpaddens
knew it was their duty to reform her considering what her son had done
for them so they clave nobly to their generous task William came
often and got decreasing sums of money and asked for higher and
more lucrative employmentswhich the grateful McSpadden more or less
promptly procured for him McSpadden consented also after some demur
to fit William for college but when the first vacation came and the
hero requested to be sent to Europe for his health the persecuted
McSpadden rose against the tyrant and revolted He plainly and squarely
refused William Fergusons mother was so astounded that she let her
ginbottle drop and her profane lips refused to do their office When
she recovered she said in a halfgasp Is this your gratitude Where
would your wife and boy be now but for my son

William said Is this your gratitude Did I save your wifes life or
not Tell me that

Seven relations swarmed in from the kitchen and each said And this is
his gratitude

Williams sisters stared bewildered and said And this is his
grat but were interrupted by their mother who burst into tears and
exclaimed

To think that my sainted little Jimmy threw away his life in the
service of such a reptile

Then the pluck of the revolutionary McSpadden rose to the occasion and
he replied with fervor Out of my house the whole beggarly tribe
of you I was beguiled by the books but shall never be beguiled
againonce is sufficient for me And turning to William he shouted
Yes you did save my wifes life and the next man that does it shall
die in his tracks

Not being a clergyman I place my text at the end of my sermon instead
of at the beginning Here it is from Mr Noah Brookss Recollections of
President Lincoln in Scribners Monthly

     J  H  Hackett in his part of Falstaff was an actor who gave Mr
     Lincoln great delight  With his usual desire to signify to others
     his sense of obligation Mr Lincoln wrote a genial little note to
     the actor expressing his pleasure at witnessing his performance
     Mr Hackett in reply sent a book of some sort perhaps it was one
     of his own authorship  He also wrote several notes to the
     President  One night quite late when the episode had passed out
     of my mind I went to the White House in answer to a message
     Passing into the Presidents office I noticed to my surprise
     Hackett sitting in the anteroom as if waiting for an audience  The
     President asked me if any one was outside  On being told he said
     half sadly Oh I cant see him I cant see him I was in hopes he
     had gone away  Then he added Now this just illustrates the
     difficulty of having pleasant friends and acquaintances in this
     place  You know how I liked Hackett as an actor and how I wrote to
     tell him so  He sent me that book and there I thought the matter
     would end  He is a master of his place in the profession I
     suppose and well fixed in it but just because we had a little
     friendly correspondence such as any two men might have he wants
     something  What do you suppose he wants  I could not guess and
     Mr Lincoln added well he wants to be consul to London  Oh
     dear

I will observe in conclusion that the William Ferguson incident
occurred and within my personal knowledgethough I have changed the
nature of the details to keep William from recognizing himself in it

All the readers of this article have in some sweet and gushing hour of
their lives played the role of MagnanimousIncident hero I wish I knew
how many there are among them who are willing to talk about that episode
and like to be reminded of the consequences that flowed from it




PUNCH BROTHERS PUNCH

               CHORUS

               Punch brothers punch with care
               Punch in the presence of the passenjare

I came across these jingling rhymes in a newspaper a little while ago
and read them a couple of times They took instant and entire possession
of me All through breakfast they went waltzing through my brain and
when at last I rolled up my napkin I could not tell whether I had
eaten anything or not I had carefully laid out my days work the day
beforethrilling tragedy in the novel which I am writing I went to my
den to begin my deed of blood I took up my pen but all I could get it
to say was Punch in the presence of the passenjare I fought hard for
an hour but it was useless My head kept humming A blue trip slip for
an eightcent fare a buff trip slip for a sixcent fare and so on and
so on without peace or respite The days work was ruinedI could
see that plainly enough I gave up and drifted downtown and presently
discovered that my feet were keeping time to that relentless jingle
When I could stand it no longer I altered my step But it did no
good those rhymes accommodated themselves to the new step and went
on harassing me just as before I returned home and suffered all the
afternoon suffered all through an unconscious and unrefreshing dinner
suffered and cried and jingled all through the evening went to bed
and rolled tossed and jingled right along the same as ever got up at
midnight frantic and tried to read but there was nothing visible
upon the whirling page except Punch punch in the presence of the
passenjare By sunrise I was out of my mind and everybody marveled and
was distressed at the idiotic burden of my ravingsPunch oh punch
punch in the presence of the passenjare

Two days later on Saturday morning I arose a tottering wreck and
went forth to fulfil an engagement with a valued friend the Rev
Mr to walk to the Talcott Tower ten miles distant He stared at
me but asked no questions We started Mr talked talked talked
as is his wont I said nothing I heard nothing At the end of a mile
Mr said Mark are you sick I never saw a man look so haggard
and worn and absentminded Say something do

Drearily without enthusiasm I said Punch brothers punch with care
Punch in the presence of the passenjare

My friend eyed me blankly looked perplexed then said

I do not think I get your drift Mark There does not seem to be any
relevancy in what you have said certainly nothing sad and yetmaybe
it was the way you said the wordsI never heard anything that sounded
so pathetic What is

But I heard no more I was already far away with my pitiless
heartbreaking blue trip slip for an eightcent fare buff trip slip
for a sixcent fare pink trip slip for a threecent fare punch in
the presence of the passenjare I do not know what occurred during the
other nine miles However all of a sudden Mr laid his hand on my
shoulder and shouted

Oh wake up wake up wake up Dont sleep all day Here we are at the
Tower man I have talked myself deaf and dumb and blind and never got
a response Just look at this magnificent autumn landscape Look at
it look at it Feast your eye on it You have traveled you have seen
boasted landscapes elsewhere Come now deliver an honest opinion What
do you say to this

I sighed wearily and murmured

A buff trip slip for a sixcent fare a pink trip slip for a threecent
fare punch in the presence of the passenjare

Rev Mr  stood there very grave full of concern apparently
and looked long at me then he said

Mark there is something about this that I cannot understand Those are
about the same words you said before there does not seem to be anything
in them and yet they nearly break my heart when you say them Punch in
thehow is it they go

I began at the beginning and repeated all the lines

My friends face lighted with interest He said

Why what a captivating jingle it is It is almost music It flows
along so nicely I have nearly caught the rhymes myself Say them over
just once more and then Ill have them sure

I said them over Then Mr  said them He made one little mistake
which I corrected The next time and the next he got them right Now a
great burden seemed to tumble from my shoulders That torturing jingle
departed out of my brain and a grateful sense of rest and peace
descended upon me I was lighthearted enough to sing and I did sing
for half an hour straight along as we went jogging homeward Then my
freed tongue found blessed speech again and the pent talk of many
a weary hour began to gush and flow It flowed on and on joyously
jubilantly until the fountain was empty and dry As I wrung my friends
hand at parting I said

Havent we had a royal good time But now I remember you havent said
a word for two hours Come come out with something

The Rev Mr turned a lacklustre eye upon me drew a deep sigh
and said without animation without apparent consciousness

Punch brothers punch with care Punch in the presence of the
passenjare

A pang shot through me as I said to myself Poor fellow poor fellow
he has got it now

I did not see Mr for two or three days after that Then on
Tuesday evening he staggered into my presence and sank dejectedly into
a seat He was pale worn he was a wreck He lifted his faded eyes to
my face and said

Ah Mark it was a ruinous investment that I made in those heartless
rhymes They have ridden me like a nightmare day and night hour after
hour to this very moment Since I saw you I have suffered the torments
of the lost Saturday evening I had a sudden call by telegraph and
took the night train for Boston The occasion was the death of a valued
old friend who had requested that I should preach his funeral sermon I
took my seat in the cars and set myself to framing the discourse But I
never got beyond the opening paragraph for then the train started
and the carwheels began their clack clackclackclackclack
clackclackclackclackclack and right away those odious rhymes
fitted themselves to that accompaniment For an hour I sat there and
set a syllable of those rhymes to every separate and distinct clack
the carwheels made Why I was as fagged out then as if I had been
chopping wood all day My skull was splitting with headache It seemed
to me that I must go mad if I sat there any longer so I undressed and
went to bed I stretched myself out in my berth andwell you
know what the result was The thing went right along just the same
Clackclack clack a blue trip slip clackclackclack for an
eightcent fare clackclackclack a buff trip slip clack clackclack for a
sixcent fare and so on and so on and so on punch in the presence of
the passenjare Sleep Not a single wink I was almost a lunatic when
I got to Boston Dont ask me about the funeral I did the best I could
but every solemn individual sentence was meshed and tangled and woven in
and out with Punch brothers punch with care punch in the presence
of the passenjare And the most distressing thing was that my delivery
dropped into the undulating rhythm of those pulsing rhymes and I could
actually catch absentminded people nodding time to the swing of it with
their stupid heads And Mark you may believe it or not but before I
got through the entire assemblage were placidly bobbing their heads in
solemn unison mourners undertaker and all The moment I had finished
I fled to the anteroom in a state bordering on frenzy Of course
it would be my luck to find a sorrowing and aged maiden aunt of the
deceased there who had arrived from Springfield too late to get into
the church She began to sob and said

Oh oh he is gone he is gone and I didnt see him before he died

Yes I said he is gone he is gone he is goneoh will this
suffering never cease

You loved him then Oh you too loved him

Loved him Loved who

Why my poor George my poor nephew

this misery will kill me

Bless you bless you sir for these sweet words I too suffer in
this dear loss Were you present during his last moments

leave me to my madness my misery my despaira buff trip slip for a

My friends hopeless eyes rested upon mine a pregnant minute and then
he said impressively

Mark you do not say anything You do not offer me any hope But ah

good The time has long gone by when words could comfort me Something
tells me that my tongue is doomed to wag forever to the jigger of that
remorseless jingle Therethere it is coming on me again a blue trip

Thus murmuring faint and fainter my friend sank into a peaceful trance
and forgot his sufferings in a blessed respite

How did I finally save him from an asylum I took him to a neighboring
university and made him discharge the burden of his persecuting rhymes
into the eager ears of the poor unthinking students How is it with
them now The result is too sad to tell Why did I write this article
It was for a worthy even a noble purpose It was to warn you reader
if you should came across those merciless rhymes to avoid themavoid

THE GREAT REVOLUTION IN PITCAIRN

Let me refresh the readers memory a little Nearly a hundred years ago
the crew of the British ship Bounty mutinied set the captain and his
officers adrift upon the open sea took possession of the ship and
sailed southward They procured wives for themselves among the natives
of Tahiti then proceeded to a lonely little rock in midPacific called
Pitcairns Island wrecked the vessel stripped her of everything that
might be useful to a new colony and established themselves on shore
Pitcairns is so far removed from the track of commerce that it was many
years before another vessel touched there It had always been considered
an uninhabited island so when a ship did at last drop its anchor there
in  the captain was greatly surprised to find the place peopled
Although the mutineers had fought among themselves and gradually killed
each other off until only two or three of the original stock remained
these tragedies had not occurred before a number of children had been
born so in  the island had a population of twentyseven persons
John Adams the chief mutineer still survived and was to live many
years yet as governor and patriarch of the flock From being mutineer
and homicide he had turned Christian and teacher and his nation of
twentyseven persons was now the purest and devoutest in Christendom
Adams had long ago hoisted the British flag and constituted his island
an appanage of the British crown

Today the population numbers ninety personssixteen men nineteen
women twentyfive boys and thirty girlsall descendants of the
mutineers all bearing the family names of those mutineers and all
speaking English and English only The island stands high up out of
the sea and has precipitous walls It is about threequarters of a mile
long and in places is as much as half a mile wide Such arable land as
it affords is held by the several families according to a division made
many years ago There is some live stockgoats pigs chickens and
cats but no dogs and no large animals There is one church building
used also as a capitol a schoolhouse and a public library The title
of the governor has been for a generation or two Magistrate and Chief
Ruler in subordination to her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain It
was his province to make the laws as well as execute them His office
was elective everybody over seventeen years old had a voteno matter
about the sex

The sole occupations of the people were farming and fishing their
sole recreation religious services There has never been a shop in the
island nor any money The habits and dress of the people have always
been primitive and their laws simple to puerility They have lived in
a deep Sabbath tranquillity far from the world and its ambitions and
vexations and neither knowing nor caring what was going on in the
mighty empires that lie beyond their limitless ocean solitudes Once in
three or four years a ship touched there moved them with aged news
of bloody battles devastating epidemics fallen thrones and ruined
dynasties then traded them some soap and flannel for some yams and
breadfruit and sailed away leaving them to retire into their peaceful
dreams and pious dissipations once more

On the th of last September Admiral de Horsey commanderinchief of
the British fleet in the Pacific visited Pitcairns Island and speaks
as follows in his official report to the admiralty

     They have beans carrots turnips cabbages and a little maize
     pineapples figtrees custardapples and oranges lemons and
     cocoanuts  Clothing is obtained alone from passing ships in barter
     for refreshments  There are no springs on the island but as it
     rains generally once a month they have plenty of water although at
     times in former years they have suffered from drought  No alcoholic
     liquors except for medicinal purposes are used and a drunkard is
     unknown

     The necessary articles required by the islanders are best shown by
     those we furnished in barter for refreshments namely flannel
     serge drill halfboots combs tobacco and soap  They also stand
     much in need of maps and slates for their school and tools of any
     kind are most acceptable  I caused them to be supplied from the
     public stores with a Union jack for display on the arrival of
     ships and a pitsaw of which they were greatly in need  This I
     trust will meet the approval of their lordships  If the munificent
     people of England were only aware of the wants of this most
     deserving little colony they would not long go unsupplied

     Divine service is held every Sunday at  AM  and at  PM
     in the house built and used by John Adams for that purpose until he
     died in   It is conducted strictly in accordance with the
     liturgy of the Church of England by Mr Simon Young their selected
     pastor who is much respected  A Bible class is held every
     Wednesday when all who conveniently can attend  There is also a
     general meeting for prayer on the first Friday in every month
     Family prayers are said in every house the first thing in the
     morning and the last thing in the evening and no food is partaken
     of without asking Gods blessing before and afterward  Of these
     islanders religious attributes no one can speak without deep
     respect  A people whose greatest pleasure and privilege is to
     commune in prayer with their God and to join in hymns of praise
     and who are moreover cheerful diligent and probably freer from
     vice than any other community need no priest among them

Now I come to a sentence in the admirals report which he dropped
carelessly from his pen no doubt and never gave the matter a second
thought He little imagined what a freight of tragic prophecy it bore
This is the sentence

     One stranger an American has settled on the islanda doubtful
     acquisition

A doubtful acquisition indeed Captain Ormsby in the American ship
Hornet touched at Pitcairns nearly four months after the admirals
visit and from the facts which he gathered there we now know all about
that American Let us put these facts together in historical form The
Americans name was Butterworth Stavely As soon as he had become
well acquainted with all the peopleand this took but a few days of
coursehe began to ingratiate himself with them by all the arts he
could command He became exceedingly popular and much looked up to for
one of the first things he did was to forsake his worldly way of life
and throw all his energies into religion He was always reading his
Bible or praying or singing hymns or asking blessings In prayer no
one had such liberty as he no one could pray so long or so well

At last when he considered the time to be ripe he began secretly to
sow the seeds of discontent among the people It was his deliberate
purpose from the beginning to subvert the government but of course he
kept that to himself for a time He used different arts with different
individuals He awakened dissatisfaction in one quarter by calling
attention to the shortness of the Sunday services he argued that there
should be three threehour services on Sunday instead of only two
Many had secretly held this opinion before they now privately banded
themselves into a party to work for it He showed certain of the women
that they were not allowed sufficient voice in the prayermeetings
thus another party was formed No weapon was beneath his notice he
even descended to the children and awoke discontent in their breasts
becauseas he discovered for themthey had not enough Sundayschool
This created a third party

Now as the chief of these parties he found himself the strongest power
in the community So he proceeded to his next movea no less important
one than the impeachment of the chief magistrate James Russell Nickoy
a man of character and ability and possessed of great wealth he being
the owner of a house with a parlor to it three acres and a half of
yam land and the only boat in Pitcairns a whaleboat and most
unfortunately a pretext for this impeachment offered itself at just the
right time

One of the earliest and most precious laws of the island was the law
against trespass It was held in great reverence and was regarded
as the palladium of the peoples liberties About thirty years ago an
important case came before the courts under this law in this wise a
chicken belonging to Elizabeth Young aged at that time fiftyeight
a daughter of John Mills one of the mutineers of the Bounty trespassed
upon the grounds of Thursday October Christian aged twentynine a
grandson of Fletcher Christian one of the mutineers Christian killed
the chicken According to the law Christian could keep the chicken or
if he preferred he could restore its remains to the owner and receive
damages in produce to an amount equivalent to the waste and injury
wrought by the trespasser The court records set forth that the said
Christian aforesaid did deliver the aforesaid remains to the said
Elizabeth Young and did demand one bushel of yams in satisfaction of the
damage done But Elizabeth Young considered the demand exorbitant the
parties could not agree therefore Christian brought suit in the courts
He lost his case in the justices court at least he was awarded only
a halfpeck of yams which he considered insufficient and in the
nature of a defeat He appealed The case lingered several years in an
ascending grade of courts and always resulted in decrees sustaining the
original verdict and finally the thing got into the supreme court and
there it stuck for twenty years But last summer even the supreme court
managed to arrive at a decision at last Once more the original verdict
was sustained Christian then said he was satisfied but Stavely was
present and whispered to him and to his lawyer suggesting as a mere
form that the original law be exhibited in order to make sure that
it still existed It seemed an odd idea but an ingenious one So the
demand was made A messenger was sent to the magistrates house he
presently returned with the tidings that it had disappeared from among
the state archives

The court now pronounced its late decision void since it had been made
under a law which had no actual existence

Great excitement ensued immediately The news swept abroad over the
whole island that the palladium of the public liberties was lostmaybe
treasonably destroyed Within thirty minutes almost the entire nation
were in the courtroomthat is to say the church The impeachment of
the chief magistrate followed upon Stavelys motion The accused met
his misfortune with the dignity which became his great office He did
not plead or even argue he offered the simple defense that he had not
meddled with the missing law that he had kept the state archives in
the same candlebox that had been used as their depository from the
beginning and that he was innocent of the removal or destruction of the
lost document

But nothing could save him he was found guilty of misprision of
treason and degraded from his office and all his property was
confiscated

The lamest part of the whole shameful matter was the reason suggested
by his enemies for his destruction of the law to wit that he did it to
favor Christian because Christian was his cousin Whereas Stavely was
the only individual in the entire nation who was not his cousin The
reader must remember that all these people are the descendants of half
a dozen men that the first children intermarried together and bore
grandchildren to the mutineers that these grandchildren intermarried
after them great and greatgreatgrandchildren intermarried so that
today everybody is blood kin to everybody Moreover the relationships
are wonderfully even astoundingly mixed up and complicated A
stranger for instance says to an islander

You speak of that young woman as your cousin a while ago you called
her your aunt

Well she is my aunt and my cousin too And also my stepsister my
niece my fourth cousin my thirtythird cousin my fortysecond cousin
my greataunt my grandmother my widowed sisterinlawand next week
she will be my wife

So the charge of nepotism against the chief magistrate was weak But
no matter weak or strong it suited Stavely Stavely was immediately
elected to the vacant magistracy and oozing reform from every pore
he went vigorously to work In no long time religious services raged
everywhere and unceasingly By command the second prayer of the Sunday
morning service which had customarily endured some thirtyfive or forty
minutes and had pleaded for the world first by continent and then by
national and tribal detail was extended to an hour and a half and
made to include supplications in behalf of the possible peoples in the
several planets Everybody was pleased with this everybody said Now
this is something like By command the usual threehour sermons were
doubled in length The nation came in a body to testify their gratitude
to the new magistrate The old law forbidding cooking on the Sabbath was
extended to the prohibition of eating also By command Sundayschool
was privileged to spread over into the week The joy of all classes was
complete In one short month the new magistrate had become the peoples
idol

The time was ripe for this mans next move He began cautiously at
first to poison the public mind against England He took the chief
citizens aside one by one and conversed with them on this topic
Presently he grew bolder and spoke out He said the nation owed it to
itself to its honor to its great traditions to rise in its might and
throw off this galling English yoke

But the simple islanders answered

We had not noticed that it galled How does it gall England sends
a ship once in three or four years to give us soap and clothing and
things which we sorely need and gratefully receive but she never
troubles us she lets us go our own way

She lets you go your own way So slaves have felt and spoken in all the
ages This speech shows how fallen you are how base how brutalized
you have become under this grinding tyranny What has all manly pride
forsaken you Is liberty nothing Are you content to be a mere appendage
to a foreign and hateful sovereignty when you might rise up and take
your rightful place in the august family of nations great free
enlightened independent the minion of no sceptered master but the
arbiter of your own destiny and a voice and a power in decreeing the
destinies of your sistersovereignties of the world

Speeches like this produced an effect byandby Citizens began to feel
the English yoke they did not know exactly how or whereabouts they
felt it but they were perfectly certain they did feel it They got to
grumbling a good deal and chafing under their chains and longing for
relief and release They presently fell to hating the English flag that
sign and symbol of their nations degradation they ceased to glance
up at it as they passed the capitol but averted their eyes and grated
their teeth and one morning when it was found trampled into the mud at
the foot of the staff they left it there and no man put his hand to
it to hoist it again A certain thing which was sure to happen sooner or
later happened now Some of the chief citizens went to the magistrate by
night and said

We can endure this hated tyranny no longer How can we cast it off

By a coup detat

How

A coup detat It is like this everything is got ready and at the
appointed moment I as the official head of the nation publicly and
solemnly proclaim its independence and absolve it from allegiance to
any and all other powers whatsoever

That sounds simple and easy We can do that right away Then what will
be the next thing to do

Seize all the defenses and public properties of all kinds establish
martial law put the army and navy on a war footing and proclaim the
empire

This fine program dazzled these innocents They said

This is grandthis is splendid but will not England resist

Let her This rock is a Gibraltar

True But about the empire Do we need an empire and an emperor

What you need my friends is unification Look at Germany look at
Italy They are unified Unification is the thing It makes living dear
That constitutes progress We must have a standing army and a navy
Taxes follow as a matter of course All these things summed up make
grandeur With unification and grandeur what more can you want Very
wellonly the empire can confer these boons

So on the th day of December Pitcairns Island was proclaimed a free
and independent nation and on the same day the solemn coronation of
Butterworth I Emperor of Pitcairns Island took place amid great
rejoicings and festivities The entire nation with the exception of
fourteen persons mainly little children marched past the throne in
single file with banners and music the procession being upward of
ninety feet long and some said it was as much as threequarters of a
minute passing a given point Nothing like it had ever been seen in the
history of the island before Public enthusiasm was measureless

Now straightway imperial reforms began Orders of nobility were
instituted A minister of the navy was appointed and the whaleboat put
in commission A minister of war was created and ordered to proceed at
once with the formation of a standing army A first lord of the treasury
was named and commanded to get up a taxation scheme and also open
negotiations for treaties offensive defensive and commercial with
foreign powers Some generals and admirals were appointed also
some chamberlains some equerries in waiting and some lords of the
bedchamber

At this point all the material was used up The Grand Duke of Galilee
minister of war complained that all the sixteen grown men in the empire
had been given great offices and consequently would not consent to
serve in the ranks wherefore his standing army was at a standstill The
Marquis of Ararat minister of the navy made a similar complaint He
said he was willing to steer the whaleboat himself but he must have
somebody to man her

The emperor did the best he could in the circumstances he took all the
boys above the age of ten years away from their mothers and pressed
them into the army thus constructing a corps of seventeen privates
officered by one lieutenantgeneral and two majorgenerals This pleased
the minister of war but procured the enmity of all the mothers in the
land for they said their precious ones must now find bloody graves in
the fields of war and he would be answerable for it Some of the more
heartbroken and unappeasable among them lay constantly wait for the
emperor and threw yams at him unmindful of the bodyguard

On account of the extreme scarcity of material it was found necessary
to require the Duke of Bethany postmastergeneral to pull strokeoar
in the navy and thus sit in the rear of a noble of lower degree namely
Viscount Canaan lordjustice of the common pleas This turned the Duke
of Bethany into tolerably open malcontent and a secret conspiratora
thing which the emperor foresaw but could not help

Things went from bad to worse The emperor raised Nancy Peters to the
peerage on one day and married her the next notwithstanding for
reasons of state the cabinet had strenuously advised him to marry
Emmeline eldest daughter of the Archbishop of Bethlehem This caused
trouble in a powerful quarterthe church The new empress secured the
support and friendship of twothirds of the thirtysix grown women in
the nation by absorbing them into her court as maids of honor but this
made deadly enemies of the remaining twelve The families of the maids
of honor soon began to rebel because there was nobody at home to keep
house The twelve snubbed women refused to enter the imperial kitchen
as servants so the empress had to require the Countess of Jericho and
other great court dames to fetch water sweep the palace and perform
other menial and equally distasteful services This made bad blood in
that department

Everybody fell to complaining that the taxes levied for the support
of the army the navy and the rest of the imperial establishment were
intolerably burdensome and were reducing the nation to beggary The
emperors replyLookLook at Germany look at Italy Are you better
than they and havent you unificationdid not satisfy them They
said People cant eat unification and we are starving Agriculture
has ceased Everybody is in the army everybody is in the navy
everybody is in the public service standing around in a uniform with
nothing whatever to do nothing to eat and nobody to till the fields

Look at Germany look at Italy It is the same there Such is
unification and theres no other way to get itno other way to keep it
after youve got it said the poor emperor always

But the grumblers only replied We cant stand the taxeswe cant
stand them

Now right on top of this the cabinet reported a national debt amounting
to upward of fortyfive dollarshalf a dollar to every individual in
the nation And they proposed to fund something They had heard that
this was always done in such emergencies They proposed duties on
exports also on imports And they wanted to issue bonds also paper
money redeemable in yams and cabbages in fifty years They said the pay
of the army and of the navy and of the whole governmental machine was
far in arrears and unless something was done and done immediately
national bankruptcy must ensue and possibly insurrection and
revolution The emperor at once resolved upon a highhanded measure and
one of a nature never before heard of in Pitcairns Island He went in
state to the church on Sunday morning with the army at his back and
commanded the minister of the treasury to take up a collection

That was the feather that broke the camels back First one citizen and
then another rose and refused to submit to this unheardof outrageand
each refusal was followed by the immediate confiscation of the
malcontents property This vigor soon stopped the refusals and the
collection proceeded amid a sullen and ominous silence As the emperor
withdrew with the troops he said I will teach you who is master
here Several persons shouted Down with unification They were at
once arrested and torn from the arms of their weeping friends by the
soldiery

But in the mean time as any prophet might have foreseen a Social
Democrat had been developed As the emperor stepped into the gilded
imperial wheelbarrow at the church door the social democrat stabbed at
him fifteen or sixteen times with a harpoon but fortunately with such a
peculiarly social democratic unprecision of aim as to do no damage

That very night the convulsion came The nation rose as one manthough
fortynine of the revolutionists were of the other sex The infantry
threw down their pitchforks the artillery cast aside their cocoanuts
the navy revolted the emperor was seized and bound hand and foot in
his palace He was very much depressed He said

I freed you from a grinding tyranny I lifted you up out of your
degradation and made you a nation among nations I gave you a strong
compact centralized government and more than all I gave you the
blessing of blessingsunification I have done all this and my reward
is hatred insult and these bonds Take me do with me as you will
I here resign my crown and all my dignities and gladly do I release
myself from their too heavy burden For your sake I took them up for
your sake I lay them down The imperial jewel is no more now bruise and
defile as ye will the useless setting

By a unanimous voice the people condemned the exemperor and the social
democrat to perpetual banishment from church services or to perpetual
labor as galleyslaves in the whaleboatwhichever they might prefer
The next day the nation assembled again and rehoisted the British flag
reinstated the British tyranny reduced the nobility to the condition of
commoners again and then straightway turned their diligent attention
to the weeding of the ruined and neglected yam patches and the
rehabilitation of the old useful industries and the old healing and
solacing pieties The exemperor restored the lost trespass law and
explained that he had stolen itnot to injure any one but to further
his political projects Therefore the nation gave the late chief
magistrate his office again and also his alienated Property

Upon reflection the exemperor and the social democrat chose perpetual
banishment from religious services in preference to perpetual labor as
galleyslaves with perpetual religious services as they phrased
it wherefore the people believed that the poor fellows troubles had
unseated their reason and so they judged it best to confine them for
the present Which they did

Such is the history of Pitcairns doubtful acquisition




THE CANVASSERS TALE

Poor sadeyed stranger There was that about his humble mien his tired
look his decayedgentility clothes that almost reached the
mustardseed of charity that still remained remote and lonely in the
empty vastness of my heart notwithstanding I observed a portfolio under
his arm and said to myself Behold Providence hath delivered his
servant into the hands of another canvasser

Well these people always get one interested Before I well knew how it
came about this one was telling me his history and I was all attention
and sympathy He told it something like this

My parents died alas when I was a little sinless child My uncle
Ithuriel took me to his heart and reared me as his own He was my only
relative in the wide world but he was good and rich and generous He
reared me in the lap of luxury I knew no want that money could satisfy

In the fullness of time I was graduated and went with two of my
servantsmy chamberlain and my valetto travel in foreign countries
During four years I flitted upon careless wing amid the beauteous
gardens of the distant strand if you will permit this form of speech in
one whose tongue was ever attuned to poesy and indeed I so speak with
confidence as one unto his kind for I perceive by your eyes that you
too sir are gifted with the divine inflation In those far lands I
reveled in the ambrosial food that fructifies the soul the mind the
heart But of all things that which most appealed to my inborn esthetic
taste was the prevailing custom there among the rich of making
collections of elegant and costly rarities dainty objets de vertu
and in an evil hour I tried to uplift my uncle Ithuriel to a plane of
sympathy with this exquisite employment

I wrote and told him of one gentlemans vast collection of shells
anothers noble collection of meerschaum pipes anothers elevating and
refining collection of undecipherable autographs anothers
priceless collection of old china anothers enchanting collection of
postagestampsand so forth and so on Soon my letters yielded fruit
My uncle began to look about for something to make a collection of
You may know perhaps how fleetly a taste like this dilates His soon
became a raging fever though I knew it not He began to neglect his
great pork business presently he wholly retired and turned an elegant
leisure into a rabid search for curious things His wealth was vast and
he spared it not First he tried cowbells He made a collection which
filled five large salons and comprehended all the different sorts of
cowbells that ever had been contrived save one That onean antique
and the only specimen extantwas possessed by another collector My
uncle offered enormous sums for it but the gentleman would not sell
Doubtless you know what necessarily resulted A true collector attaches
no value to a collection that is not complete His great heart
breaks he sells his hoard he turns his mind to some field that seems
unoccupied

Thus did my uncle He next tried brickbats After piling up a vast and
intensely interesting collection the former difficulty supervened
his great heart broke again he sold out his souls idol to the retired
brewer who possessed the missing brick Then he tried flint hatchets
and other implements of Primeval Man but by and by discovered that the
factory where they were made was supplying other collectors as well
as himself He tried Aztec inscriptions and stuffed whalesanother
failure after incredible labor and expense When his collection seemed
at last perfect a stuffed whale arrived from Greenland and an Aztec
inscription from the Cundurango regions of Central America that made all
former specimens insignificant My uncle hastened to secure these
noble gems He got the stuffed whale but another collector got the
inscription A real Cundurango as possibly you know is a possession of
such supreme value that when once a collector gets it he will rather
part with his family than with it So my uncle sold out and saw his
darlings go forth never more to return and his coalblack hair turned
white as snow in a single night

Now he waited and thought He knew another disappointment might kill
him He was resolved that he would choose things next time that no other
man was collecting He carefully made up his mind and once more entered
the fieldthis time to make a collection of echoes

Of what said I

Echoes sir His first purchase was an echo in Georgia that repeated
four times his next was a sixrepeater in Maryland his next was a
thirteenrepeater in Maine his next was a ninerepeater in Kansas
his next was a twelverepeater in Tennessee which he got cheap so
to speak because it was out of repair a portion of the crag which
reflected it having tumbled down He believed he could repair it at a
cost of a few thousand dollars and by increasing the elevation with
masonry treble the repeating capacity but the architect who undertook
the job had never built an echo before and so he utterly spoiled
this one Before he meddled with it it used to talk back like a
motherinlaw but now it was only fit for the deafanddumb asylum
Well next he bought a lot of cheap little doublebarreled echoes
scattered around over various states and territories he got them
at twenty per cent off by taking the lot Next he bought a perfect
Gatlinggun of an echo in Oregon and it cost a fortune I can tell
you You may know sir that in the echo market the scale of prices
is cumulative like the caratscale in diamonds in fact the same
phraseology is used A singlecarat echo is worth but ten dollars over
and above the value of the land it is on a twocarat or doublebarreled
echo is worth thirty dollars a fivecarat is worth nine hundred and
fifty a tencarat is worth thirteen thousand My uncles Oregonecho
which he called the Great Pitt Echo was a twentytwo carat gem and
cost two hundred and sixteen thousand dollarsthey threw the land in
for it was four hundred miles from a settlement

Well in the mean time my path was a path of roses I was the accepted
suitor of the only and lovely daughter of an English earl and was
beloved to distraction In that dear presence I swam in seas of bliss
The family were content for it was known that I was sole heir to an
uncle held to be worth five millions of dollars However none of us
knew that my uncle had become a collector at least in anything more
than a small way for esthetic amusement

Now gathered the clouds above my unconscious head That divine echo
since known throughout the world as the Great Kohinoor or Mountain
of Repetitions was discovered It was a sixtyfive carat gem You could
utter a word and it would talk back at you for fifteen minutes when the
day was otherwise quiet But behold another fact came to light at the
same time another echocollector was in the field The two rushed to
make the peerless purchase The property consisted of a couple of
small hills with a shallow swale between out yonder among the back
settlements of New York State Both men arrived on the ground at the
same time and neither knew the other was there The echo was not all
owned by one man a person by the name of Williamson Bolivar Jarvis
owned the east hill and a person by the name of Harbison J Bledso
owned the west hill the swale between was the dividingline So while
my uncle was buying Jarviss hill for three million two hundred and
eightyfive thousand dollars the other party was buying Bledsos hill
for a shade over three million

Now do you perceive the natural result Why the noblest collection of
echoes on earth was forever and ever incomplete since it possessed but
the onehalf of the king echo of the universe Neither man was content
with this divided ownership yet neither would sell to the other
There were jawings bickerings heartburnings And at last that other
collector with a malignity which only a collector can ever feel toward
a man and a brother proceeded to cut down his hill

You see as long as he could not have the echo he was resolved that
nobody should have it He would remove his hill and then there would be
nothing to reflect my uncles echo My uncle remonstrated with him but
the man said I own one end of this echo I choose to kill my end you
must take care of your own end yourself

Well my uncle got an injunction put on him The other man appealed and
fought it in a higher court They carried it on up clear to the Supreme
Court of the United States It made no end of trouble there Two of
the judges believed that an echo was personal property because it was
impalpable to sight and touch and yet was purchasable salable and
consequently taxable two others believed that an echo was real estate
because it was manifestly attached to the land and was not removable
from place to place other of the judges contended that an echo was not
property at all

It was finally decided that the echo was property that the hills were
property that the two men were separate and independent owners of the
two hills but tenants in common in the echo therefore defendant was at
full liberty to cut down his hill since it belonged solely to him but
must give bonds in three million dollars as indemnity for damages which
might result to my uncles half of the echo This decision also debarred
my uncle from using defendants hill to reflect his part of the echo
without defendants consent he must use only his own hill if his part
of the echo would not go under these circumstances it was sad of
course but the court could find no remedy The court also debarred
defendant from using my uncles hill to reflect his end of the echo
without consent You see the grand result Neither man would give
consent and so that astonishing and most noble echo had to cease from
its great powers and since that day that magnificent property is tied
up and unsalable

A week before my weddingday while I was still swimming in bliss and
the nobility were gathering from far and near to honor our espousals
came news of my uncles death and also a copy of his will making me
his sole heir He was gone alas my dear benefactor was no more The
thought surcharges my heart even at this remote day I handed the will
to the earl I could not read it for the blinding tears The earl read
it then he sternly said Sir do you call this wealthbut doubtless
you do in your inflated country Sir you are left sole heir to a vast
collection of echoesif a thing can be called a collection that is
scattered far and wide over the huge length and breadth of the American
continent sir this is not all you are head and ears in debt there
is not an echo in the lot but has a mortgage on it sir I am not a hard
man but I must look to my childs interest if you had but one echo
which you could honestly call your own if you had but one echo which
was free from incumbrance so that you could retire to it with my child
and by humble painstaking industry cultivate and improve it and thus
wrest from it a maintenance I would not say you nay but I cannot marry
my child to a beggar Leave his side my darling go sir take your
mortgageridden echoes and quit my sight forever

My noble Celestine clung to me in tears with loving arms and swore she
would willingly nay gladly marry me though I had not an echo in the
world But it could not be We were torn asunder she to pine and die
within the twelvemonth I to toil lifes long journey sad and alone
praying daily hourly for that release which shall join us together
again in that dear realm where the wicked cease from troubling and the
weary are at rest Now sir if you will be so kind as to look at these
maps and plans in my portfolio I am sure I can sell you an echo for
less money than any man in the trade Now this one which cost my uncle
ten dollars thirty years ago and is one of the sweetest things in
Texas I will let you have for

Let me interrupt you I said My friend I have not had a moments
respite from canvassers this day I have bought a sewingmachine which I
did not want I have bought a map which is mistaken in all its details
I have bought a clock which will not go I have bought a moth poison
which the moths prefer to any other beverage I have bought no end of
useless inventions and now I have had enough of this foolishness I
would not have one of your echoes if you were even to give it to me I
would not let it stay on the place I always hate a man that tries to
sell me echoes You see this gun Now take your collection and move on
let us not have bloodshed

But he only smiled a sad sweet smile and got out some more diagrams
You know the result perfectly well because you know that when you have
once opened the door to a canvasser the trouble is done and you have
got to suffer defeat

I compromised with this man at the end of an intolerable hour I bought
two doublebarreled echoes in good condition and he threw in another
which he said was not salable because it only spoke German He said
She was a perfect polyglot once but somehow her palate got down




AN ENCOUNTER WITH AN INTERVIEWER

The nervous dapper peart young man took the chair I offered him and
said he was connected with the Daily Thunderstorm and added

Hoping its no harm Ive come to interview you

Come to what

Interview you

Ah I see Yesyes Um Yesyes

I was not feeling bright that morning Indeed my powers seemed a bit
under a cloud However I went to the bookcase and when I had been
looking six or seven minutes I found I was obliged to refer to the young
man I said

How do you spell it

Spell what

Interview

Oh my goodness what do you want to spell it for

I dont want to spell it I want to see what it means

Well this is astonishing I must say I can tell you what it means if

Oh all right That will answer and much obliged to you too

In in ter ter inter

Then you spell it with an I

Why certainly

Oh that is what took me so long

Why my dear sir what did you propose to spell it with

Well IIhardly know I had the Unabridged and I was ciphering
around in the back end hoping I might tree her among the pictures But
its a very old edition

Why my friend they wouldnt have a picture of it in even the latest
e My dear sir I beg your pardon I mean no harm in the world but
you do not look asasintelligent as I had expected you would No
harmI mean no harm at all

Oh dont mention it It has often been said and by people who would
not flatter and who could have no inducement to flatter that I am quite
remarkable in that way Yesyes they always speak of it with rapture

I can easily imagine it But about this interview You know it is the
custom now to interview any man who has become notorious

Indeed I had not heard of it before It must be very interesting What
do you do it with

Ah wellwellwellthis is disheartening It ought to be done with
a club in some cases but customarily it consists in the interviewer
asking questions and the interviewed answering them It is all the rage
now Will you let me ask you certain questions calculated to bring out
the salient points of your public and private history

Oh with pleasurewith pleasure I have a very bad memory but I
hope you will not mind that That is to say it is an irregular
memorysingularly irregular Sometimes it goes in a gallop and then
again it will be as much as a fortnight passing a given point This is a
great grief to me

Oh it is no matter so you will try to do the best you can

I will I will put my whole mind on it

Thanks Are you ready to begin

Ready

Q How old are you

A Nineteen in June

Q Indeed I would have taken you to be thirtyfive or six Where were
you born

A In Missouri

Q When did you begin to write

A In 

Q Why how could that be if you are only nineteen now

A I dont know It does seem curious somehow

Q It does indeed Whom do you consider the most remarkable man you
ever met

A Aaron Burr

Q But you never could have met Aaron Burr if you are only nineteen
years

A Now if you know more about me than I do what do you ask me for

Q Well it was only a suggestion nothing more How did you happen to
meet Burr

A Well I happened to be at his funeral one day and he asked me to
make less noise and

Q But good heavens if you were at his funeral he must have been
dead and if he was dead how could he care whether you made a noise or
not

A I dont know He was always a particular kind of a man that way

Q Still I dont understand it at all You say he spoke to you and
that he was dead

A I didnt say he was dead

Q But wasnt he dead

A Well some said he was some said he wasnt

Q What did you think

A Oh it was none of my business It wasnt any of my funeral

Q Did youHowever we can never get this matter straight Let me ask
about something else What was the date of your birth

A Monday October  

Q What Impossible That would make you a hundred and eighty years old
How do you account for that

A I dont account for it at all

Q But you said at first you were only nineteen and now you make
yourself out to be one hundred and eighty It is an awful discrepancy

A Why have you noticed that Shaking hands Many a time it has
seemed to me like a discrepancy but somehow I couldnt make up my mind
How quick you notice a thing

Q Thank you for the compliment as far as it goes Had you or have
you any brothers or sisters

A Eh III think soyesbut I dont remember

Q Well that is the most extraordinary statement I ever heard

A Why what makes you think that

Q How could I think otherwise Why look here Who is this a picture of
on the wall Isnt that a brother of yours

A Oh yes yes yes Now you remind me of it that was a brother of
mine Thats WilliamBill we called him Poor old Bill

Q Why Is he dead then

A Ah well I suppose so We never could tell There was a great
mystery about it

Q That is sad very sad He disappeared then

A Well yes in a sort of general way We buried him

Q Buried him Buried him without knowing whether he was dead or not

A Oh no Not that He was dead enough

Q Well I confess that I cant understand this If you buried him and
you knew he was dead

A No no We only thought he was

Q Oh I see He came to life again

A I bet he didnt

Q Well I never heard anything like this Somebody was dead Somebody
was buried Now where was the mystery

A Ah thats just it Thats it exactly You see we were
twinsdefunct and Iand we got mixed in the bathtub when we were only
two weeks old and one of us was drowned But we didnt know which Some
think it was Bill Some think it was me

Q Well that is remarkable What do you think

A Goodness knows I would give whole worlds to know This solemn this
awful mystery has cast a gloom over my whole life But I will tell you
a secret now which I never have revealed to any creature before One of
us had a peculiar marka large mole on the back of his left hand that
was me That child was the one that was drowned

Q Very well then I dont see that there is any mystery about it
after all

A You dont Well I do Anyway I dont see how they could ever have
been such a blundering lot as to go and bury the wrong child But
shdont mention it where the family can hear of it Heaven knows
they have heartbreaking troubles enough without adding this

Q Well I believe I have got material enough for the present and I am
very much obliged to you for the pains you have taken But I was a good
deal interested in that account of Aaron Burrs funeral Would you mind
telling me what particular circumstance it was that made you think Burr
was such a remarkable man

A Oh it was a mere trifle Not one man in fifty would have noticed it
at all When the sermon was over and the procession all ready to start
for the cemetery and the body all arranged nice in the hearse he said
he wanted to take a last look at the scenery and so he got up and rode
with the driver

Then the young man reverently withdrew He was very pleasant company
and I was sorry to see him go




PARIS NOTES

     Crowded out of A Tramp Abroad to make room for more
     vital statisticsM T

The Parisian travels but little he knows no language but his own reads
no literature but his own and consequently he is pretty narrow and
pretty selfsufficient However let us not be too sweeping there are
Frenchmen who know languages not their own these are the waiters
Among the rest they know English that is they know it on the European
planwhich is to say they can speak it but cant understand it They
easily make themselves understood but it is next to impossible to word
an English sentence in such a way as to enable them to comprehend it
They think they comprehend it they pretend they do but they dont
Here is a conversation which I had with one of these beings I wrote it
down at the time in order to have it exactly correct

I These are fine oranges Where are they grown

He More Yes I will bring them

I No do not bring any more I only want to know where they are
fromwhere they are raised

He Yes with imperturbable mien and rising inflection

I Yes Can you tell me what country they are from

He Yes blandly with rising inflection

I disheartened They are very nice

He Good night Bows and retires quite satisfied with himself

That young man could have become a good English scholar by taking
the right sort of pains but he was French and wouldnt do that How
different is the case with our people they utilize every means that
offers There are some alleged French Protestants in Paris and they
built a nice little church on one of the great avenues that lead away
from the Arch of Triumph and proposed to listen to the correct thing
preached in the correct way there in their precious French tongue and
be happy But their little game does not succeed Our people are always
there ahead of them Sundays and take up all the room When the minister
gets up to preach he finds his house full of devout foreigners each
ready and waiting with his little book in his handa moroccobound
Testament apparently But only apparently it is Mr Bellowss
admirable and exhaustive little FrenchEnglish dictionary which in look
and binding and size is just like a Testament and those people are there
to study French The building has been nicknamed The Church of the
Gratis French Lesson

These students probably acquire more language than general information
for I am told that a French sermon is like a French speechit never
names a historical event but only the date of it if you are not up in
dates you get left A French speech is something like this

     Comrades citizens brothers noble parts of the only sublime and
     perfect nation let us not forget that the st January cast off our
     chains that the th August relieved us of the shameful presence of
     foreign spies that the th September was its own justification
     before heaven and humanity that the th Brumaire contained the
     seeds of its own punishment that the th July was the mighty voice
     of liberty proclaiming the resurrection the new day and inviting
     the oppressed peoples of the earth to look upon the divine face of
     France and live and let us here record our everlasting curse
     against the man of the d December and declare in thunder tones
     the native tones of France that but for him there had been no th
     March in history no th October no th January no d April
     no th November no th September no d July no th February
     no th June no th August no st Maythat but for him France
     the pure the grand the peerless had had a serene and vacant
     almanac today

I have heard of one French sermon which closed in this odd yet eloquent
way

     My hearers we have sad cause to remember the man of the th
     January  The results of the vast crime of the th January have
     been in just proportion to the magnitude of the set itself  But for
     it there had been no  Novembersorrowful spectacle  The grisly
     deed of the th June had not been done but for it nor had the man
     of the th June known existence to it alone the d September was
     due also the fatal th October  Shall we then be grateful for
     the th January with its freight of death for you and me and all
     that breathe  Yes my friends for it gave us also that which had
     never come but for it and it alonethe blessed th December

It may be well enough to explain though in the case of many of my
readers this will hardly be necessary The man of the th January is
Adam the crime of that date was the eating of the apple the sorrowful
spectacle of the th November was the expulsion from Eden the
grisly deed of the th June was the murder of Abel the act of the d
September was the beginning of the journey to the land of Nod the th
day of October the last mountaintops disappeared under the flood

LEGEND OF SAGENFELD IN GERMANY

		Left out of A Tramp Abroad because its authenticity seemed
		doubtful and could not at that time be provedM T


More than a thousand years ago this small district was a kingdoma
little bit of a kingdom a sort of dainty little toy kingdom as one
might say It was far removed from the jealousies strifes and turmoils
of that old warlike day and so its life was a simple life its people
a gentle and guileless race it lay always in a deep dream of peace a
soft Sabbath tranquillity there was no malice there was no envy there
was no ambition consequently there were no heartburnings there was no
unhappiness in the land

In the course of time the old king died and his little son Hubert came
to the throne The peoples love for him grew daily he was so good and
so pure and so noble that by and by his love became a passion almost
a worship Now at his birth the soothsayers had diligently studied the
stars and found something written in that shining book to this effect

     In Huberts fourteenth year a pregnant event will happen the animal
     whose singing shall sound sweetest in Huberts ear shall save
     Huberts life  So long as the king and the nation shall honor this
     animals race for this good deed the ancient dynasty shall not fail
     of an heir nor the nation know war or pestilence or poverty  But
     beware an erring choice

All through the kings thirteenth year but one thing was talked of by
the soothsayers the statesmen the little parliament and the general
people That one thing was this How is the last sentence of the
prophecy to be understood What goes before seems to mean that the
saving animal will choose itself at the proper time but the closing
sentence seems to mean that the king must choose beforehand and say
what singer among the animals pleases him best and that if he choose
wisely the chosen animal will save his life his dynasty his people
but that if he should make an erring choicebeware

By the end of the year there were as many opinions about this matter
as there had been in the beginning but a majority of the wise and the
simple were agreed that the safest plan would be for the little king to
make choice beforehand and the earlier the better So an edict was sent
forth commanding all persons who owned singing creatures to bring them
to the great hall of the palace in the morning of the first day of the
new year This command was obeyed When everything was in readiness for
the trial the king made his solemn entry with the great officers of the
crown all clothed in their robes of state The king mounted his golden
throne and prepared to give judgment But he presently said

These creatures all sing at once the noise is unendurable no one can
choose in such a turmoil Take them all away and bring back one at a
time

This was done One sweet warbler after another charmed the young kings
ear and was removed to make way for another candidate The precious
minutes slipped by among so many bewitching songsters he found it hard
to choose and all the harder because the promised penalty for an error
was so terrible that it unsettled his judgment and made him afraid to
trust his own ears He grew nervous and his face showed distress His
ministers saw this for they never took their eyes from him a moment
Now they began to say in their hearts

He has lost couragethe cool head is gonehe will errhe and his
dynasty and his people are doomed

At the end of an hour the king sat silent awhile and then said

Bring back the linnet

The linnet trilled forth her jubilant music In the midst of it the king
was about to uplift his scepter in sign of choice but checked himself
and said

But let us be sure Bring back the thrush let them sing together

The thrush was brought and the two birds poured out their marvels of
song together The king wavered then his inclination began to settle
and strengthenone could see it in his countenance Hope budded in the
hearts of the old ministers their pulses began to beat quicker the
scepter began to rise slowly when There was a hideous interruption It
was a sound like thisjust at the door

Waw he waw he wawhewaw hewawhe

Everybody was sorely startledand enraged at himself for showing it

The next instant the dearest sweetest prettiest little peasantmaid
of nine years came tripping in her brown eyes glowing with childish
eagerness but when she saw that august company and those angry faces
she stopped and hung her head and put her poor coarse apron to her
eyes Nobody gave her welcome none pitied her Presently she looked up
timidly through her tears and said

My lord the king I pray you pardon me for I meant no wrong I have no
father and no mother but I have a goat and a donkey and they are all
in all to me My goat gives me the sweetest milk and when my dear good
donkey brays it seems to me there is no music like to it So when my
lord the kings jester said the sweetest singer among all the animals
should save the crown and nation and moved me to bring him here

All the court burst into a rude laugh and the child fled away crying
without trying to finish her speech The chief minister gave a private
order that she and her disastrous donkey be flogged beyond the precincts
of the palace and commanded to come within them no more

Then the trial of the birds was resumed The two birds sang their best
but the scepter lay motionless in the kings hand Hope died slowly out
in the breasts of all An hour went by two hours still no decision
The day waned to its close and the waiting multitudes outside the
palace grew crazed with anxiety and apprehension The twilight came
on the shadows fell deeper and deeper The king and his court could no
longer see each others faces No one spokenone called for lights The
great trial had been made it had failed each and all wished to hide
their faces from the light and cover up their deep trouble in their own
hearts

Finallyhark A rich full strain of the divinest melody streamed forth
from a remote part of the hallthe nightingales voice

Up shouted the king let all the bells make proclamation to the
people for the choice is made and we have not erred King dynasty
and nation are saved From henceforth let the nightingale be honored
throughout the land forever And publish it among all the people that
whosoever shall insult a nightingale or injure it shall suffer death
The king hath spoken

All that little world was drunk with joy The castle and the city blazed
with bonfires all night long the people danced and drank and sang and
the triumphant clamor of the bells never ceased

From that day the nightingale was a sacred bird Its song was heard in
every house the poets wrote its praises the painters painted it its
sculptured image adorned every arch and turret and fountain and public
building It was even taken into the kings councils and no grave
matter of state was decided until the soothsayers had laid the thing
before the state nightingale and translated to the ministry what it was
that the bird had sung about it

II

The young king was very fond of the chase When the summer was come he
rode forth with hawk and hound one day in a brilliant company of his
nobles He got separated from them by and by in a great forest and
took what he imagined a near cut to find them again but it was a
mistake He rode on and on hopefully at first but with sinking courage
finally Twilight came on and still he was plunging through a lonely
and unknown land Then came a catastrophe In the dim light he forced
his horse through a tangled thicket overhanging a steep and rocky
declivity When horse and rider reached the bottom the former had a
broken neck and the latter a broken leg The poor little king lay there
suffering agonies of pain and each hour seemed a long month to him
He kept his ear strained to hear any sound that might promise hope of
rescue but he heard no voice no sound of horn or bay of hound So at
last he gave up all hope and said Let death come for come it must

Just then the deep sweet song of a nightingale swept across the still
wastes of the night

Saved the king said Saved It is the sacred bird and the prophecy
is come true The gods themselves protected me from error in the
choice

He could hardly contain his joy he could not word his gratitude Every
few moments now he thought he caught the sound of approaching succor
But each time it was a disappointment no succor came The dull hours
drifted on Still no help camebut still the sacred bird sang on He
began to have misgivings about his choice but he stifled them Toward
dawn the bird ceased The morning came and with it thirst and hunger
but no succor The day waxed and waned At last the king cursed the
nightingale

Immediately the song of the thrush came from out the wood The king said
in his heart This was the truebirdmy choice was falsesuccor will
come now

But it did not come Then he lay many hours insensible When he came to
himself a linnet was singing He listened with apathy His faith was
gone These birds he said can bring no help I and my house and my
people are doomed He turned him about to die for he was grown very
feeble from hunger and thirst and suffering and felt that his end was
near In truth he wanted to die and be released from pain For long
hours he lay without thought or feeling or motion Then his senses
returned The dawn of the third morning was breaking Ah the world
seemed very beautiful to those worn eyes Suddenly a great longing to
live rose up in the lads heart and from his soul welled a deep and
fervent prayer that Heaven would have mercy upon him and let him see
his home and his friends once more In that instant a soft a faint a
faroff sound but oh how inexpressibly sweet to his waiting ear came
floating out of the distance

Waw he waw he Wawhewawhewawhe

That oh that song is sweeter a thousand times sweeter than the voice
of the nightingale thrush or linnet for it brings not mere hope but
certainty of succor and now indeed am I saved The sacred singer has
chosen itself as the oracle intended the prophecy is fulfilled and my
life my house and my people are redeemed The ass shall be sacred from
this day

The divine music grew nearer and nearer strongerand stronger and ever
sweeter and sweeter to the perishing sufferers ear Down the declivity
the docile little donkey wandered cropping herbage and singing as he
went and when at last he saw the dead horse and the wounded king he
came and snuffed at them with simple and marveling curiosity The king
petted him and he knelt down as had been his wont when his little
mistress desired to mount With great labor and pain the lad drew
himself upon the creatures back and held himself there by aid of the
generous ears The ass went singing forth from the place and carried
the king to the little peasantmaids hut She gave him her pallet for
a bed refreshed him with goats milk and then flew to tell the great
news to the first scoutingparty of searchers she might meet

The king got well His first act was to proclaim the sacredness and
inviolability of the ass his second was to add this particular ass to
his cabinet and make him chief minister of the crown his third was to
have all the statues and effigies of nightingales throughout his kingdom
destroyed and replaced by statues and effigies of the sacred donkey
and his fourth was to announce that when the little peasant maid should
reach her fifteenth year he would make her his queen and he kept his
word

Such is the legend This explains why the moldering image of the ass
adorns all these old crumbling walls and arches and it explains why
during many centuries an ass was always the chief minister in that
royal cabinet just as is still the case in most cabinets to this day
and it also explains why in that little kingdom during many centuries
all great poems all great speeches all great books all public
solemnities and all royal proclamations always began with these
stirring words

SPEECH ON THE BABIES

AT THE BANQUET IN CHICAGO GIVEN BY THE ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE TO THEIR
FIRST COMMANDER GENERAL U S GRANT NOVEMBER 

     The fifteenth regular toast was The Babiesas they comfort us in
     our sorrows let us not forget them in our festivities

I like that We have not all had the good fortune to be ladies We have
not all been generals or poets or statesmen but when the toast works
down to the babies we stand on common ground It is a shame that for a
thousand years the worlds banquets have utterly ignored the baby as
if he didnt amount to anything If you will stop and think a minuteif
you will go back fifty or one hundred years to your early married life
and recontemplate your first babyyou will remember that he amounted to
a great deal and even something over You soldiers all know that when
the little fellow arrived at family headquarters you had to hand in your
resignation He took entire command You became his lackey his mere
bodyservant and you had to stand around too He was not a commander
who made allowances for time distance weather or anything else You
had to execute his order whether it was possible or not And there was
only one form of marching in his manual of tactics and that was
the doublequick He treated you with every sort of insolence and
disrespect and the bravest of you didnt dare to say a word You could
face the deathstorm at Donelson and Vicksburg and give back blow
for blow but when he clawed your whiskers and pulled your hair and
twisted your nose you had to take it When the thunders of war were
sounding in your ears you set your faces toward the batteries and
advanced with steady tread but when he turned on the terrors of his
warwhoop you advanced in the other direction and mighty glad of the
chance too When he called for soothingsyrup did you venture to throw
out any side remarks about certain services being unbecoming an
officer and a gentleman No You got up and got it When he ordered his
papbottle and it was not warm did you talk back Not you You went to
work and warmed it You even descended so far in your menial office as
to take a suck at that warm insipid stuff yourself to see if it was
rightthree parts water to one of milk a touch of sugar to modify the
colic and a drop of peppermint to kill those hiccoughs I can taste
that stuff yet And how many things you learned as you went along
Sentimental young folks still take stock in that beautiful old saying
that when the baby smiles in his sleep it is because the angels
are whispering to him Very pretty but too thinsimply wind on the
stomach my friends If the baby proposed to take a walk at his usual
hour two oclock in the morning didnt you rise up promptly and
remark with a mental addition which would not improve a Sundayschool
book much that that was the very thing you were about to propose
yourself Oh you were under good discipline and as you went fluttering
up and down the room in your undress uniform you not only prattled
undignified babytalk but even tuned up your martial voices and
tried to singRockaby baby in the treetop for instance What a
spectacle for an Army of the Tennessee And what an affliction for the
neighbors too for it is not everybody within a mile around that likes
military music at three in the morning And when you had been keeping
this sort of thing up two or three hours and your little velvethead
intimated that nothing suited him like exercise and noise what did you
do Go on You simply went on until you dropped in the last ditch
The idea that a baby doesnt amount to anything Why one baby is just
a house and a front yard full by itself One baby can furnish more
business than you and your whole Interior Department can attend to He
is enterprising irrepressible brimful of lawless activities Do what
you please you cant make him stay on the reservation Sufficient unto
the day is one baby As long as you are in your right mind dont you
ever pray for twins Twins amount to a permanent riot And there aint
any real difference between triplets and an insurrection

Yes it was high time for a toastmaster to recognize the importance
of the babies Think what is in store for the present crop Fifty years
from now we shall all be dead I trust and then this flag if it still
survive and let us hope it may will be floating over a Republic
numbering  souls according to the settled laws of our
increase Our present schooner of State will have grown into a political
leviathana Great Eastern The cradled babies of today will be on
deck Let them be well trained for we are going to leave a big contract
on their hands Among the three or four million cradles now rocking in
the land are some which this nation would preserve for ages as sacred
things if we could know which ones they are In one of those cradles the
unconscious Farragut of the future is at this moment teethingthink
of itand putting in a world of dead earnest unarticulated but
perfectly justifiable profanity over it too In another the future
renowned astronomer is blinking at the shining Milky Way with but a
languid interestpoor little chapand wondering what has become of
that other one they call the wetnurse In another the future great
historian is lyingand doubtless will continue to lie until his earthly
mission is ended In another the future President is busying himself

to grapple with that same old problem a second time And in still

SPEECH ON THE WEATHER

AT THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETYS SEVENTYFIRST ANNUAL DINNER NEW YORK CITY

     The next toast was The Oldest InhabitantThe Weather of New
     England

                    Who can lose it and forget it
                    Who can have it and regret it

                    Be interposer twixt us Twain

                                   Merchant of Venice

     To this Samuel L Clemens Mark Twain replied as follows

I reverently believe that the Maker who made us all makes everything in
New England but the weather I dont know who makes that but I think
it must be raw apprentices in the weatherclerks factory who experiment
and learn how in New England for board and clothes and then are
promoted to make weather for countries that require a good article
and will take their custom elsewhere if they dont get it There is
a sumptuous variety about the New England weather that compels the
strangers admirationand regret The weather is always doing something
there always attending strictly to business always getting up new
designs and trying them on the people to see how they will go But it
gets through more business in spring than in any other season In the
spring I have counted one hundred and thirtysix different kinds of
weather inside of fourandtwenty hours It was I that made the fame
and fortune of that man that had that marvelous collection of weather on
exhibition at the Centennial that so astounded the foreigners He
was going to travel all over the world and get specimens from all the
climes I said Dont you do it you come to New England on a favorable
spring day I told him what we could do in the way of style variety
and quantity Well he came and he made his collection in four days As
to variety why he confessed that he got hundreds of kinds of weather
that he had never heard of before And as to quantitywell after he
had picked out and discarded all that was blemished in any way he not
only had weather enough but weather to spare weather to hire out
weather to sell to deposit weather to invest weather to give to the
poor The people of New England are by nature patient and forbearing
but there are some things which they will not stand Every year they
kill a lot of poets for writing about Beautiful Spring These are
generally casual visitors who bring their notions of spring from
somewhere else and cannot of course know how the natives feel about
spring And so the first thing they know the opportunity to inquire
how they feel has permanently gone by Old Probabilities has a mighty
reputation for accurate prophecy and thoroughly well deserves it You
take up the paper and observe how crisply and confidently he checks off
what todays weather is going to be on the Pacific down South in the
Middle States in the Wisconsin region See him sail along in the joy
and pride of his power till he gets to New England and then see his
tail drop He doesnt know what the weather is going to be in New
England Well he mulls over it and by and by he gets out something
about like this Probable northeast to southwest winds varying to the
southward and westward and eastward and points between high and low
barometer swapping around from place to place probable areas of rain
snow hail and drought succeeded or preceded by earthquakes with
thunder and lightning Then he jots down this postscript from his
wandering mind to cover accidents But it is possible that the program
may be wholly changed in the mean time Yes one of the brightest gems
in the New England weather is the dazzling uncertainty of it There is
only one thing certain about it you are certain there is going to be
plenty of ita perfect grand review but you never can tell which end
of the procession is going to move first You fix up for the drought
you leave your umbrella in the house and sally out and two to one you
get drowned You make up your mind that the earthquake is due you stand
from under and take hold of something to steady yourself and the
first thing you know you get struck by lightning These are great
disappointments but they cant be helped The lightning there is
peculiar it is so convincing that when it strikes a thing it doesnt
leave enough of that thing behind for you to tell whetherWell youd
think it was something valuable and a Congressman had been there And
the thunder When the thunder begins to merely tune up and scrape and
saw and key up the instruments for the performance strangers say
Why what awful thunder you have here But when the baton is raised
and the real concert begins youll find that stranger down in the
cellar with his head in the ashbarrel Now as to the size of the
weather in New England lengthways I mean It is utterly disproportioned
to the size of that little country Half the time when it is packed as
full as it can stick you will see that New England weather sticking out
beyond the edges and projecting around hundreds and hundreds of miles
over the neighboring states She cant hold a tenth part of her weather
You can see cracks all about where she has strained herself trying to
do it I could speak volumes about the inhuman perversity of the New
England weather but I will give but a single specimen I like to hear
rain on a tin roof So I covered part of my roof with tin with an eye
to that luxury Well sir do you think it ever rains on that tin No
sir skips it every time Mind in this speech I have been trying merely
to do honor to the New England weatherno language could do it justice
But after all there is at least one or two things about that weather
or if you please effects produced by it which we residents would
not like to part with If we hadnt our bewitching autumn foliage
we should still have to credit the weather with one feature which
compensates for all its bullying vagariesthe icestorm when a
leafless tree is clothed with ice from the bottom to the topice that
is as bright and clear as crystal when every bough and twig is strung
with icebeads frozen dewdrops and the whole tree sparkles cold and
white like the Shah of Persias diamond plume Then the wind waves the
branches and the sun comes out and turns all those myriads of beads and
drops to prisms that glow and burn and flash with all manner of colored
fires which change and change again with inconceivable rapidity from
blue to red from red to green and green to goldthe tree becomes a
spraying fountain a very explosion of dazzling jewels and it stands
there the acme the climax the supremest possibility in art or nature
of bewildering intoxicating intolerable magnificence One cannot make
the words too strong




CONCERNING THE AMERICAN LANGUAGE 

Being part of a chapter which was
     crowded out of A Tramp AbroadMT


There was as Englishman in our compartment and he complimented me
onon what But you would never guess He complimented me on my
English He said Americans in general did not speak the English language
as correctly as I did I said I was obliged to him for his compliment
since I knew he meant it for one but that I was not fairly entitled to
it for I did not speak English at allI only spoke American

He laughed and said it was a distinction without a difference I said
no the difference was not prodigious but still it was considerable We
fell into a friendly dispute over the matter I put my case as well as I
could and said

The languages were identical several generations ago but our changed
conditions and the spread of our people far to the south and far to
the west have made many alterations in our pronunciation and have
introduced new words among us and changed the meanings of many old ones
English people talk through their noses we do not We say know English
people say nao we say cow the Briton says kaow we

Oh come that is pure Yankee everybody knows that

Yes it is pure Yankee that is true One cannot hear it in America
outside of the little corner called New England which is Yankee land
The English themselves planted it there two hundred and fifty years
ago and there it remains it has never spread But England talks
through her nose yet the Londoner and the backwoods NewEnglander
pronounce know and cow alike and then the Briton unconsciously
satirizes himself by making fun of the Yankees pronunciation

We argued this point at some length nobody won but no matter the fact
remains Englishmen say nao and kaow for know and cow and that is
what the rustic inhabitant of a very small section of America does

You conferred your a upon New England too and there it remains it
has not traveled out of the narrow limits of those six little states
in all these two hundred and fifty years All England uses it New
Englands small populationsay four millionsuse it but we have
fortyfive millions who do not use it You say glahs of wawtah so
does New England at least New England says glahs America at large
flattens the a and says glass of water These sounds are pleasanter
than yours you may think they are not rightwell in English they are
not right but in American they are You say flahsk and bahsket and
jackahss we say flask basket jackasssounding the a as it
is in tallow fallow and so on Up to as late as  Mr Websters
Dictionary had the impudence to still pronounce basket bahsket when
he knew that outside of his little New England all America shortened the
a and paid no attention to his English broadening of it However it
called itself an English Dictionary so it was proper enough that it
should stick to English forms perhaps It still calls itself an English
Dictionary today but it has quietly ceased to pronounce basket as if
it were spelt bahsket In the American language the h is respected
the h is not dropped or added improperly

The same is the case in EnglandI mean among the educated classes of
course

Yes that is true but a nations language is a very large matter It
is not simply a manner of speech obtaining among the educated handful
the manner obtaining among the vast uneducated multitude must be
considered also Your uneducated masses speak English you will not deny
that our uneducated masses speak American it wont be fair for you to
deny that for you can see yourself that when your stableboy says
It isnt the unting that urts the orse but the ammer ammer
ammer on the ard ighway and our stableboy makes the same remark
without suffocating a single h these two people are manifestly talking
two different languages But if the signs are to be trusted even your
educated classes used to drop the h They say humble now and heroic
and historic etc but I judge that they used to drop those hs because
your writers still keep up the fashion of putting an AN before those words
instead of A This is what Mr Darwin might call a rudimentary sign
that as an was justifiable once and useful when your educated classes
used to say umble and eroic and istorical Correct writers of the
American language do not put an before those words

The English gentleman had something to say upon this matter but
never mind what he saidIm not arguing his case I have him at a
disadvantage now I proceeded

In England you encourage an orator by exclaiming Hyaah hyaah We
pronounce it heer in some sections hyer in others and so on but
our whites do not say hyaah pronouncing the as like the a in ah
I have heard English ladies say dont youmaking two separate and
distinct words of it your Mr Burnand has satirized it But we always
say dontchu This is much better Your ladies say Oh its oful
nice Ours say Oh its awful nice We say Four hundred you say
Foras in the word or Your clergymen speak of the Lawd ours of
the Lord yours speak of the gawds of the heathen ours of the gods
of the heathen When you are exhausted you say you are knocked
up We dont When you say you will do a thing directly you mean
immediately in the American languagegenerally speakingthe word
signifies after a little When you say clever you mean capable
with us the word used to mean accommodating but I dont know what it
means now Your word stout means fleshy our word stout usually
means strong Your words gentleman and lady have a very restricted
meaning with us they include the barmaid butcher burglar harlot and
horsethief You say I havent got any stockings on I havent got
any memory I havent got any money in my purse we usually say I
havent any stockings on I havent any memory I havent any money
in my purse You say out of window we always put in a the If
one asks How old is that man the Briton answers He will be about
forty in the American language we should say He is about forty
However I wont tire you sir but if I wanted to I could pile
up differences here until I not only convinced you that English and
American are separate languages but that when I speak my native tongue
in its utmost purity an Englishman cant understand me at all

I dont wish to flatter you but it is about all I can do to understand
you now

That was a very pretty compliment and it put us on the pleasantest
terms directlyI use the word in the English sense

Later Esthetes in many of our schools are now beginning to teach
the pupils to broaden the a and to say dont you in the elegant
foreign way




ROGERS

This Man Rogers happened upon me and introduced himself at the town of
 in the South of England where I stayed awhile His stepfather
had married a distant relative of mine who was afterward hanged and so
he seemed to think a blood relationship existed between us He came
in every day and sat down and talked Of all the bland serene human
curiosities I ever saw I think he was the chiefest He desired to look
at my new chimneypot hat I was very willing for I thought he would
notice the name of the great Oxford Street hatter in it and respect
me accordingly But he turned it about with a sort of grave compassion
pointed out two or three blemishes and said that I being so recently
arrived could not be expected to know where to supply myself Said he
would send me the address of his hatter Then he said Pardon me and
proceeded to cut a neat circle of red tissue paper daintily notched the
edges of it took the mucilage and pasted it in my hat so as to cover
the manufacturers name He said No one will know now where you got
it I will send you a hattip of my hatter and you can paste it over
this tissue circle It was the calmest coolest thingI never admired
a man so much in my life Mind he did this while his own hat sat
offensively near our noses on the tablean ancient extinguisher of
the slouch pattern limp and shapeless with age discolored by
vicissitudes of the weather and banded by an equator of bears grease
that had stewed through

Another time he examined my coat I had no terrors for over my tailors
door was the legend By Special Appointment Tailor to H R H the
Prince of Wales etc I did not know at the time that the most of
the tailor shops had the same sign out and that whereas it takes nine
tailors to make an ordinary man it takes a hundred and fifty to make a
prince He was full of compassion for my coat Wrote down the address
of his tailor for me Did not tell me to mention my nom de plume and the
tailor would put his best work on my garment as complimentary people
sometimes do but said his tailor would hardly trouble himself for an
unknown person unknown person when I thought I was so celebrated in
Englandthat was the cruelest cut but cautioned me to mention his
name and it would be all right Thinking to be facetious I said

But he might sit up all night and injure his health

Well let him said Rogers Ive done enough for him for him to show
some appreciation of it

I might as well have tried to disconcert a mummy with my facetiousness
Said Rogers I get all my coats theretheyre the only coats fit to be
seen in

I made one more attempt I said I wish you had brought one with youI
would like to look at it

Bless your heart havent I got one onthis article is Morgans
make

I examined it The coat had been bought readymade of a Chatham Street
Jew without any questionabout  It probably cost four dollars
when it was new It was ripped it was frayed it was napless and
greasy I could not resist showing him where it was ripped It so
affected him that I was almost sorry I had done it First he seemed
plunged into a bottomless abyss of grief Then he roused himself made
a feint with his hands as if waving off the pity of a nation and
saidwith what seemed to me a manufactured emotionNo matter no
matter dont mind me do not bother about it I can get another

When he was thoroughly restored so that he could examine the rip and
command his feelings he said ah now he understood ithis servant
must have done it while dressing him that morning

His servant There was something aweinspiring in effrontery like this

Nearly every day he interested himself in some article of my clothing
One would hardly have expected this sort of infatuation in a man who
always wore the same suit and it a suit that seemed coeval with the
Conquest

It was an unworthy ambition perhaps but I did wish I could make this
man admire something about me or something I didyou would have felt
the same way I saw my opportunity I was about to return to London
and had listed my soiled linen for the wash It made quite an imposing
mountain in the corner of the roomfiftyfour pieces I hoped he would
fancy it was the accumulation of a single week I took up the washlist
as if to see that it was all right and then tossed it on the table
with pretended forgetfulness Sure enough he took it up and ran his
eye along down to the grand total Then he said You get off easy and
laid it down again

His gloves were the saddest ruin but he told me where I could get some
like them His shoes would hardly hold walnuts without leaking but he
liked to put his feet up on the mantelpiece and contemplate them
He wore a dim glass breastpin which he called a morphylitic
diamondwhatever that may meanand said only two of them had ever
been foundthe Emperor of China had the other one

Afterward in London it was a pleasure to me to see this fantastic
vagabond come marching into the lobby of the hotel in his grandducal
way for he always had some new imaginary grandeur to developthere
was nothing stale about him but his clothes If he addressed me when
strangers were about he always raised his voice a little and called me
Sir Richard or General or Your Lordshipand when people began
to stare and look deferential he would fall to inquiring in a casual
way why I disappointed the Duke of Argyll the night before and then
remind me of our engagement at the Duke of Westminsters for the
following day I think that for the time being these things were
realities to him He once came and invited me to go with him and spend
the evening with the Earl of Warwick at his town house I said I had
received no formal invitation He said that that was of no consequence
the Earl had no formalities for him or his friends I asked if I could
go just as I was He said no that would hardly do evening dress was
requisite at night in any gentlemans house He said he would wait while
I dressed and then we would go to his apartments and I could take a
bottle of champagne and a cigar while he dressed I was very willing to
see how this enterprise would turn out so I dressed and we started to
his lodgings He said if I didnt mind we would walk So we tramped some
four miles through the mud and fog and finally found his apartments
they consisted of a single room over a barbers shop in a back street
Two chairs a small table an ancient valise a washbasin and pitcher
both on the floor in a corner an unmade bed a fragment of a
lookingglass and a flowerpot with a perishing little rose geranium
in it which he called a century plant and said it had not bloomed now
for upward of two centuriesgiven to him by the late Lord
Palmerstonbeen offered a prodigious sum for itthese were
the contents of the room Also a brass candlestick and a part of a
candle Rogers lit the candle and told me to sit down and make myself
at home He said he hoped I was thirsty because he would surprise my
palate with an article of champagne that seldom got into a commoners
system or would I prefer sherry or port Said he had port in bottles
that were swathed in stratified cobwebs every stratum representing a
generation And as for his cigarswell I should judge of them
myself Then he put his head out at the door and called

Sackville No answer

HiSackville No answer

Now what the devil can have become of that butler I never allow a
servant toOh confound that idiot hes got the keys Cant get into
the other rooms without the keys

I was just wondering at his intrepidity in still keeping up the
delusion of the champagne and trying to imagine how he was going to get
out of the difficulty

Now he stopped calling Sackville and began to call Anglesy But
Anglesy didnt come He said This is the second time that that equerry
has been absent without leave Tomorrow Ill discharge him Now
he began to whoop for Thomas but Thomas didnt answer Then for
Theodore but no Theodore replied

Well I give it up said Rogers The servants never expect me at
this hour and so theyre all off on a lark Might get along without
the equerry and the page but cant have any wine or cigars without the
butler and cant dress without my valet

I offered to help him dress but he would not hear of it and besides
he said he would not feel comfortable unless dressed by a practised
hand However he finally concluded that he was such old friends with
the Earl that it would not make any difference how he was dressed So we
took a cab he gave the driver some directions and we started By and
by we stopped before a large house and got out I never had seen this
man with a collar on He now stepped under a lamp and got a venerable
paper collar out of his coat pocket along with a hoary cravat and put
them on He ascended the stoop and entered Presently he reappeared
descended rapidly and said

Comequick

We hurried away and turned the corner

Now were safe he said and took off his collar and cravat and
returned them to his pocket

Made a mighty narrow escape said he

How said I

B George the Countess was there

Well what of thatdont she know you

Know me Absolutely worships me I just did happen to catch a glimpse
of her before she saw meand out I shot Havent seen her for two
monthsto rush in on her without any warning might have been fatal She
could not have stood it I didnt know she was in townthought she
was at the castle Let me lean on youjust a momentthere now I
am betterthank you thank you ever so much Lord bless me what an
escape

So I never got to call on the Earl after all But I marked the house
for future reference It proved to be an ordinary family hotel with
about a thousand plebeians roosting in it

In most things Rogers was by no means a fool In some things it was
plain enough that he was a fool but he certainly did not know it He
was in the deadest earnest in these matters He died at sea last
summer as the Earl of Ramsgate
