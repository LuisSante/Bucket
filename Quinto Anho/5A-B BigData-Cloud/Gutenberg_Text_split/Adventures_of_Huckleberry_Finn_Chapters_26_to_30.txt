CHAPTER XXVI

WELL when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off
for spare rooms and she said she had one spare room which would do for
Uncle William and shed give her own room to Uncle Harvey which was a
little bigger and she would turn into the room with her sisters and
sleep on a cot and up garret was a little cubby with a pallet in it
The king said the cubby would do for his valleymeaning me

So Mary Jane took us up and she showed them their rooms which was plain
but nice  She said shed have her frocks and a lot of other traps took
out of her room if they was in Uncle Harveys way but he said they
warnt  The frocks was hung along the wall and before them was a
curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor  There was an old
hair trunk in one corner and a guitarbox in another and all sorts of
little knickknacks and jimcracks around like girls brisken up a room
with  The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for
these fixings and so dont disturb them  The dukes room was pretty
small but plenty good enough and so was my cubby

That night they had a big supper and all them men and women was there
and I stood behind the king and the dukes chairs and waited on them and
the niggers waited on the rest  Mary Jane she set at the head of the
table with Susan alongside of her and said how bad the biscuits was
and how mean the preserves was and how ornery and tough the fried
chickens wasand all that kind of rot the way women always do for to
force out compliments and the people all knowed everything was tiptop
and said sosaid How DO you get biscuits to brown so nice and Where
for the lands sake DID you get these amazn pickles and all that kind
of humbug talkytalk just the way people always does at a supper you
know

And when it was all done me and the harelip had supper in the kitchen
off of the leavings whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up
the things  The harelip she got to pumping me about England and blest
if I didnt think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes  She says

Did you ever see the king

Who  William Fourth  Well I bet I havehe goes to our church  I
knowed he was dead years ago but I never let on  So when I says he goes
to our church she says

Whatregular

Yesregular  His pews right over opposite ournon tother side the
pulpit

I thought he lived in London

Well he does  Where WOULD he live

But I thought YOU lived in Sheffield

I see I was up a stump  I had to let on to get choked with a chicken
bone so as to get time to think how to get down again  Then I says

I mean he goes to our church regular when hes in Sheffield  Thats
only in the summer time when he comes there to take the sea baths

Why how you talkSheffield aint on the sea

Well who said it was

Why you did

I DIDNT nuther

You did

I didnt

You did

I never said nothing of the kind

Well what DID you say then

Said he come to take the sea BATHSthats what I said

Well then hows he going to take the sea baths if it aint on the
sea

Looky here I says did you ever see any Congresswater

Yes

Well did you have to go to Congress to get it

Why no

Well neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea
bath

How does he get it then

Gets it the way people down here gets Congresswaterin barrels  There
in the palace at Sheffield theyve got furnaces and he wants his water
hot  They cant bile that amount of water away off there at the sea
They havent got no conveniences for it

Oh I see now  You might a said that in the first place and saved
time

When she said that I see I was out of the woods again and so I was
comfortable and glad  Next she says

Do you go to church too

Yesregular

Where do you set

Why in our pew

WHOSE pew

Why OURNyour Uncle Harveys

Hisn  What does HE want with a pew

Wants it to set in  What did you RECKON he wanted with it

Why I thought hed be in the pulpit

Rot him I forgot he was a preacher  I see I was up a stump again so I
played another chicken bone and got another think  Then I says

Blame it do you suppose there aint but one preacher to a church

Why what do they want with more

Whatto preach before a king  I never did see such a girl as you
They dont have no less than seventeen

Seventeen  My land  Why I wouldnt set out such a string as that not
if I NEVER got to glory  It must take em a week

Shucks they dont ALL of em preach the same dayonly ONE of em

Well then what does the rest of em do

Oh nothing much  Loll around pass the plateand one thing or
another  But mainly they dont do nothing

Well then what are they FOR

Why theyre for STYLE  Dont you know nothing

Well I dont WANT to know no such foolishness as that  How is servants
treated in England  Do they treat em better n we treat our niggers

NO  A servant aint nobody there  They treat them worse than dogs

Dont they give em holidays the way we do Christmas and New Years
week and Fourth of July

Oh just listen  A body could tell YOU haint ever been to England by
that  Why Harelwhy Joanna they never see a holiday from years end
to years end never go to the circus nor theater nor nigger shows nor
nowheres

Nor church

Nor church

But YOU always went to church

Well I was gone up again  I forgot I was the old mans servant  But
next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was
different from a common servant and HAD to go to church whether he wanted
to or not and set with the family on account of its being the law  But
I didnt do it pretty good and when I got done I see she warnt
satisfied  She says

Honest injun now haint you been telling me a lot of lies

Honest injun says I

None of it at all

None of it at all  Not a lie in it says I

Lay your hand on this book and say it

I see it warnt nothing but a dictionary so I laid my hand on it and
said it  So then she looked a little better satisfied and says

Well then Ill believe some of it but I hope to gracious if Ill
believe the rest

What is it you wont believe Joe says Mary Jane stepping in with
Susan behind her  It aint right nor kind for you to talk so to him
and him a stranger and so far from his people  How would you like to be
treated so

Thats always your way Maimalways sailing in to help somebody before
theyre hurt  I haint done nothing to him  Hes told some stretchers
I reckon and I said I wouldnt swallow it all and thats every bit and
grain I DID say  I reckon he can stand a little thing like that cant
he

I dont care whether twas little or whether twas big hes here in our
house and a stranger and it wasnt good of you to say it  If you was in
his place it would make you feel ashamed and so you oughtnt to say a
thing to another person that will make THEM feel ashamed

Why Maim he said

It dont make no difference what he SAIDthat aint the thing  The
thing is for you to treat him KIND and not be saying things to make him
remember he aint in his own country and amongst his own folks

I says to myself THIS is a girl that Im letting that old reptle rob her
of her money

Then Susan SHE waltzed in and if youll believe me she did give
Harelip hark from the tomb

Says I to myself and this is ANOTHER one that Im letting him rob her of
her money

Then Mary Jane she took another inning and went in sweet and lovely
againwhich was her way but when she got done there warnt hardly
anything left o poor Harelip  So she hollered

All right then says the other girls you just ask his pardon

She done it too and she done it beautiful  She done it so beautiful it
was good to hear and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies so she
could do it again

I says to myself this is ANOTHER one that Im letting him rob her of her
money  And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to
make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends  I felt so ornery
and low down and mean that I says to myself my minds made up Ill hive
that money for them or bust

So then I lit outfor bed I said meaning some time or another  When I
got by myself I went to thinking the thing over  I says to myself shall
I go to that doctor private and blow on these frauds  Nothat wont
do He might tell who told him then the king and the duke would make it
warm for me  Shall I go private and tell Mary Jane  NoI dasnt do
it Her face would give them a hint sure theyve got the money and
theyd slide right out and get away with it  If she was to fetch in help
Id get mixed up in the business before it was done with I judge  No
there aint no good way but one  I got to steal that money somehow and
I got to steal it some way that they wont suspicion that I done it
Theyve got a good thing here and they aint agoing to leave till
theyve played this family and this town for all theyre worth so Ill
find a chance time enough Ill steal it and hide it and by and by when
Im away down the river Ill write a letter and tell Mary Jane where
its hid  But I better hive it tonight if I can because the doctor
maybe hasnt let up as much as he lets on he has he might scare them out
of here yet

So thinks I Ill go and search them rooms  Upstairs the hall was dark
but I found the dukes room and started to paw around it with my hands
but I recollected it wouldnt be much like the king to let anybody else
take care of that money but his own self so then I went to his room and
begun to paw around there  But I see I couldnt do nothing without a
candle and I dasnt light one of course  So I judged Id got to do the
other thinglay for them and eavesdrop  About that time I hears their
footsteps coming and was going to skip under the bed I reached for it
but it wasnt where I thought it would be but I touched the curtain that
hid Mary Janes frocks so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in
amongst the gowns and stood there perfectly still

They come in and shut the door and the first thing the duke done was to
get down and look under the bed  Then I was glad I hadnt found the bed
when I wanted it  And yet you know its kind of natural to hide under
the bed when you are up to anything private  They sets down then and
the king says

Well what is it  And cut it middlin short because its better for us
to be down there awhoopin up the mournin than up here givin em a
chance to talk us over

Well this is it Capet  I aint easy I aint comfortable  That
doctor lays on my mind  I wanted to know your plans  Ive got a notion
and I think its a sound one

What is it duke

That we better glide out of this before three in the morning and clip
it down the river with what weve got  Specially seeing we got it so
easyGIVEN back to us flung at our heads as you may say when of
course we allowed to have to steal it back  Im for knocking off and
lighting out

That made me feel pretty bad  About an hour or two ago it would a been a
little different but now it made me feel bad and disappointed The king
rips out and says

What  And not sell out the rest o the property  March off like a
passel of fools and leave eight or nine thousn dollars worth o
property layin around jest sufferin to be scooped inand all good
salable stuff too

The duke he grumbled said the bag of gold was enough and he didnt want
to go no deeperdidnt want to rob a lot of orphans of EVERYTHING they
had

Why how you talk says the king  We shant rob em of nothing at
all but jest this money  The people that BUYS the property is the
suffrers because as soon s its found out at we didnt own itwhich
wont be long after weve slidthe sale wont be valid and it ll all
go back to the estate  These yer orphans ll git their house back agin
and thats enough for THEM theyre young and spry and kn easy earn a
livin  THEY aint agoin to suffer  Why jest thinktheres thousns
and thousns that aint nigh so well off  Bless you THEY aint got
nothn to complain of

Well the king he talked him blind so at last he give in and said all
right but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay and that
doctor hanging over them  But the king says

Cuss the doctor  What do we kyer for HIM  Haint we got all the fools
in town on our side  And aint that a big enough majority in any town

So they got ready to go down stairs again  The duke says

I dont think we put that money in a good place

That cheered me up  Id begun to think I warnt going to get a hint of
no kind to help me  The king says

Why

Because Mary Jane ll be in mourning from this out and first you know
the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up
and put em away and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not
borrow some of it

Your heads level agin duke says the king and he comes afumbling
under the curtain two or three foot from where I was  I stuck tight to
the wall and kept mighty still though quivery and I wondered what them
fellows would say to me if they catched me and I tried to think what Id
better do if they did catch me  But the king he got the bag before I
could think more than about a half a thought and he never suspicioned I
was around  They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick
that was under the featherbed and crammed it in a foot or two amongst
the straw and said it was all right now because a nigger only makes up
the featherbed and dont turn over the straw tick only about twice a
year and so it warnt in no danger of getting stole now

But I knowed better  I had it out of there before they was halfway down
stairs  I groped along up to my cubby and hid it there till I could get
a chance to do better  I judged I better hide it outside of the house
somewheres because if they missed it they would give the house a good
ransacking  I knowed that very well  Then I turned in with my clothes
all on but I couldnt a gone to sleep if Id a wanted to I was in such
a sweat to get through with the business  By and by I heard the king and
the duke come up so I rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the
top of my ladder and waited to see if anything was going to happen  But
nothing did

So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadnt
begun yet and then I slipped down the ladder




CHAPTER XXVII

I CREPT to their doors and listened they was snoring  So I tiptoed
along and got down stairs all right  There warnt a sound anywheres  I
peeped through a crack of the diningroom door and see the men that was
watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs  The door was open
into the parlor where the corpse was laying and there was a candle in
both rooms I passed along and the parlor door was open but I see there
warnt nobody in there but the remainders of Peter so I shoved on by
but the front door was locked and the key wasnt there  Just then I
heard somebody coming down the stairs back behind me  I run in the
parlor and took a swift look around and the only place I see to hide the
bag was in the coffin  The lid was shoved along about a foot showing
the dead mans face down in there with a wet cloth over it and his
shroud on  I tucked the moneybag in under the lid just down beyond
where his hands was crossed which made me creep they was so cold and
then I run back across the room and in behind the door

The person coming was Mary Jane  She went to the coffin very soft and
kneeled down and looked in then she put up her handkerchief and I see
she begun to cry though I couldnt hear her and her back was to me  I
slid out and as I passed the diningroom I thought Id make sure them
watchers hadnt seen me so I looked through the crack and everything
was all right  They hadnt stirred

I slipped up to bed feeling ruther blue on accounts of the thing
playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much
resk about it  Says I if it could stay where it is all right because
when we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to
Mary Jane and she could dig him up again and get it but that aint the
thing thats going to happen the thing thats going to happen is the
money ll be found when they come to screw on the lid  Then the king ll
get it again and it ll be a long day before he gives anybody another
chance to smouch it from him Of course I WANTED to slide down and get it
out of there but I dasnt try it  Every minute it was getting earlier
now and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir and I
might get catchedcatched with six thousand dollars in my hands that
nobody hadnt hired me to take care of  I dont wish to be mixed up in
no such business as that I says to myself

When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up and the
watchers was gone  There warnt nobody around but the family and the
widow Bartley and our tribe  I watched their faces to see if anything
had been happening but I couldnt tell

Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man and they
set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs and then
set all our chairs in rows and borrowed more from the neighbors till the
hall and the parlor and the diningroom was full  I see the coffin lid
was the way it was before but I dasnt go to look in under it with
folks around

Then the people begun to flock in and the beats and the girls took seats
in the front row at the head of the coffin and for a half an hour the
people filed around slow in single rank and looked down at the dead
mans face a minute and some dropped in a tear and it was all very
still and solemn only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to
their eyes and keeping their heads bent and sobbing a little  There
warnt no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and
blowing nosesbecause people always blows them more at a funeral than
they do at other places except church

When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black
gloves with his softy soothering ways putting on the last touches and
getting people and things all shipshape and comfortable and making no
more sound than a cat  He never spoke he moved people around he
squeezed in late ones he opened up passageways and done it with nods
and signs with his hands  Then he took his place over against the wall
He was the softest glidingest stealthiest man I ever see and there
warnt no more smile to him than there is to a ham

They had borrowed a melodeuma sick one and when everything was ready a
young woman set down and worked it and it was pretty skreeky and
colicky and everybody joined in and sung and Peter was the only one
that had a good thing according to my notion  Then the Reverend Hobson
opened up slow and solemn and begun to talk and straight off the most
outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard it was only
one dog but he made a most powerful racket and he kept it up right
along the parson he had to stand there over the coffin and waityou
couldnt hear yourself think  It was right down awkward and nobody
didnt seem to know what to do  But pretty soon they see that
longlegged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say
Dont you worryjust depend on me  Then he stooped down and begun to
glide along the wall just his shoulders showing over the peoples heads
So he glided along and the powwow and racket getting more and more
outrageous all the time and at last when he had gone around two sides
of the room he disappears down cellar  Then in about two seconds we
heard a whack and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or
two and then everything was dead still and the parson begun his solemn
talk where he left off  In a minute or two here comes this undertakers
back and shoulders gliding along the wall again and so he glided and
glided around three sides of the room and then rose up and shaded his
mouth with his hands and stretched his neck out towards the preacher
over the peoples heads and says in a kind of a coarse whisper HE HAD
A RAT  Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his
place  You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people because
naturally they wanted to know  A little thing like that dont cost
nothing and its just the little things that makes a man to be looked up
to and liked  There warnt no more popular man in town than what that
undertaker was

Well the funeral sermon was very good but pison long and tiresome and
then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage and at
last the job was through and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the
coffin with his screwdriver  I was in a sweat then and watched him
pretty keen But he never meddled at all just slid the lid along as soft
as mush and screwed it down tight and fast  So there I was  I didnt
know whether the money was in there or not  So says I spose somebody
has hogged that bag on the slynow how do I know whether to write to
Mary Jane or not Spose she dug him up and didnt find nothing what
would she think of me Blame it I says I might get hunted up and
jailed Id better lay low and keep dark and not write at all the
things awful mixed now trying to better it Ive worsened it a hundred
times and I wish to goodness Id just let it alone dad fetch the whole
business

They buried him and we come back home and I went to watching faces
againI couldnt help it and I couldnt rest easy  But nothing come
of it the faces didnt tell me nothing

The king he visited around in the evening and sweetened everybody up
and made himself ever so friendly and he give out the idea that his
congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him so he must
hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home  He was
very sorry he was so pushed and so was everybody they wished he could
stay longer but they said they could see it couldnt be done  And he
said of course him and William would take the girls home with them and
that pleased everybody too because then the girls would be well fixed
and amongst their own relations and it pleased the girls tootickled
them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world and told
him to sell out as quick as he wanted to they would be ready  Them poor
things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting
fooled and lied to so but I didnt see no safe way for me to chip in and
change the general tune

Well blamed if the king didnt bill the house and the niggers and all
the property for auction straight offsale two days after the funeral
but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to

So the next day after the funeral along about noontime the girls joy
got the first jolt  A couple of nigger traders come along and the king
sold them the niggers reasonable for threeday drafts as they called it
and away they went the two sons up the river to Memphis and their
mother down the river to Orleans  I thought them poor girls and them
niggers would break their hearts for grief they cried around each other
and took on so it most made me down sick to see it  The girls said they
hadnt ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the
town  I cant ever get it out of my memory the sight of them poor
miserable girls and niggers hanging around each others necks and crying
and I reckon I couldnt a stood it all but would a had to bust out and
tell on our gang if I hadnt knowed the sale warnt no account and the
niggers would be back home in a week or two

The thing made a big stir in the town too and a good many come out
flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the
children that way  It injured the frauds some but the old fool he
bulled right along spite of all the duke could say or do and I tell you
the duke was powerful uneasy

Next day was auction day  About broad day in the morning the king and
the duke come up in the garret and woke me up and I see by their look
that there was trouble  The king says

Was you in my room night before last

No your majestywhich was the way I always called him when nobody but
our gang warnt around

Was you in there yisterday er last night

No your majesty

Honor bright nowno lies

Honor bright your majesty Im telling you the truth  I haint been
anear your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed it
to you

The duke says

Have you seen anybody else go in there

No your grace not as I remember I believe

Stop and think

I studied awhile and see my chance then I says

Well I see the niggers go in there several times

Both of them gave a little jump and looked like they hadnt ever
expected it and then like they HAD  Then the duke says

What all of them

Noleastways not all at oncethat is I dont think I ever see them
all come OUT at once but just one time

Hello  When was that

It was the day we had the funeral  In the morning  It warnt early
because I overslept  I was just starting down the ladder and I see
them

Well go on GO on  What did they do  Howd they act

They didnt do nothing  And they didnt act anyway much as fur as I
see They tiptoed away so I seen easy enough that theyd shoved in
there to do up your majestys room or something sposing you was up
and found you WARNT up and so they was hoping to slide out of the way
of trouble without waking you up if they hadnt already waked you up

Great guns THIS is a go says the king and both of them looked pretty
sick and tolerable silly  They stood there athinking and scratching
their heads a minute and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy
chuckle and says

It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand  They let on to
be SORRY they was going out of this region  And I believed they WAS
sorry and so did you and so did everybody  Dont ever tell ME any more
that a nigger aint got any histrionic talent  Why the way they played
that thing it would fool ANYBODY  In my opinion theres a fortune in
em  If I had capital and a theater I wouldnt want a better layout
than thatand here weve gone and sold em for a song  Yes and aint
privileged to sing the song yet  Say where IS that songthat draft

In the bank for to be collected  Where WOULD it be

Well THATS all right then thank goodness

Says I kind of timidlike

Is something gone wrong

The king whirls on me and rips out

None o your business  You keep your head shet and mind yr own
affairsif you got any  Long as youre in this town dont you forgit
THATyou hear  Then he says to the duke We got to jest swaller it
and say nothn  mums the word for US

As they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again and
says

Quick sales AND small profits  Its a good businessyes

The king snarls around on him and says

I was trying to do for the best in sellin em out so quick  If the
profits has turned out to be none lackin considable and none to carry
is it my fault any moren its yourn

Well THEYD be in this house yet and we WOULDNT if I could a got my
advice listened to

The king sassed back as much as was safe for him and then swapped around
and lit into ME again  He give me down the banks for not coming and
TELLING him I see the niggers come out of his room acting that waysaid
any fool would a KNOWED something was up  And then waltzed in and cussed
HIMSELF awhile and said it all come of him not laying late and taking
his natural rest that morning and hed be blamed if hed ever do it
again  So they went off ajawing and I felt dreadful glad Id worked it
all off on to the niggers and yet hadnt done the niggers no harm by it




CHAPTER XXVIII

BY and by it was gettingup time  So I come down the ladder and started
for downstairs but as I come to the girls room the door was open and
I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk which was open and shed
been packing things in itgetting ready to go to England  But she had
stopped now with a folded gown in her lap and had her face in her hands
crying  I felt awful bad to see it of course anybody would  I went in
there and says

Miss Mary Jane you cant abear to see people in trouble and I cant
most always  Tell me about it

So she done it  And it was the niggersI just expected it  She said
the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her she didnt
know HOW she was ever going to be happy there knowing the mother and the
children warnt ever going to see each other no moreand then busted out
bitterer than ever and flung up her hands and says

Oh dear dear to think they aint EVER going to see each other any
more

But they WILLand inside of two weeksand I KNOW it says I

Laws it was out before I could think  And before I could budge she
throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it AGAIN say it AGAIN
say it AGAIN

I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much and was in a close place
I asked her to let me think a minute and she set there very impatient
and excited and handsome but looking kind of happy and easedup like a
person thats had a tooth pulled out  So I went to studying it out  I
says to myself I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is
in a tight place is taking considerable many resks though I aint had no
experience and cant say for certain but it looks so to me anyway and
yet heres a case where Im blest if it dont look to me like the truth
is better and actuly SAFER than a lie  I must lay it by in my mind and
think it over some time or other its so kind of strange and unregular
I never see nothing like it  Well I says to myself at last Im agoing
to chance it Ill up and tell the truth this time though it does seem
most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see
where youll go to Then I says

Miss Mary Jane is there any place out of town a little ways where you
could go and stay three or four days

Yes Mr Lothrops  Why

Never mind why yet  If Ill tell you how I know the niggers will see
each other again inside of two weekshere in this houseand PROVE how I
know itwill you go to Mr Lothrops and stay four days

Four days she says Ill stay a year

All right I says I dont want nothing more out of YOU than just your
wordI druther have it than another mans kisstheBible  She smiled
and reddened up very sweet and I says If you dont mind it Ill shut
the doorand bolt it

Then I come back and set down again and says

Dont you holler  Just set still and take it like a man  I got to tell
the truth and you want to brace up Miss Mary because its a bad kind
and going to be hard to take but there aint no help for it  These
uncles of yourn aint no uncles at all theyre a couple of frauds
regular deadbeats  There now were over the worst of it you can stand
the rest middling easy

It jolted her up like everything of course but I was over the shoal
water now so I went right along her eyes ablazing higher and higher
all the time and told her every blame thing from where we first struck
that young fool going up to the steamboat clear through to where she
flung herself on to the kings breast at the front door and he kissed her
sixteen or seventeen timesand then up she jumps with her face afire
like sunset and says

The brute  Come dont waste a minutenot a SECONDwell have them
tarred and feathered and flung in the river

Says I

Certnly  But do you mean BEFORE you go to Mr Lothrops or

Oh she says what am I THINKING about she says and set right down
again  Dont mind what I saidplease dontyou WONT now WILL you
Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that I said I would
die first  I never thought I was so stirred up she says now go on
and I wont do so any more  You tell me what to do and whatever you say
Ill do it

Well I says its a rough gang them two frauds and Im fixed so I
got to travel with them a while longer whether I want to or notI
druther not tell you why and if you was to blow on them this town would
get me out of their claws and Id be all right but thered be another
person that you dont know about whod be in big trouble  Well we got
to save HIM haint we  Of course  Well then we wont blow on them

Saying them words put a good idea in my head  I see how maybe I could
get me and Jim rid of the frauds get them jailed here and then leave
But I didnt want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard
to answer questions but me so I didnt want the plan to begin working
till pretty late tonight  I says

Miss Mary Jane Ill tell you what well do and you wont have to stay
at Mr Lothrops so long nuther  How fur is it

A little short of four milesright out in the country back here

Well that ll answer  Now you go along out there and lay low till
nine or halfpast tonight and then get them to fetch you home again
tell them youve thought of something  If you get here before eleven put
a candle in this window and if I dont turn up wait TILL eleven and
THEN if I dont turn up it means Im gone and out of the way and safe
Then you come out and spread the news around and get these beats
jailed

Good she says Ill do it

And if it just happens so that I dont get away but get took up along
with them you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand and
you must stand by me all you can

Stand by you indeed I will  They shant touch a hair of your head
she says and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said
it too

If I get away I shant be here I says to prove these rapscallions
aint your uncles and I couldnt do it if I WAS here  I could swear
they was beats and bummers thats all though thats worth something
Well theres others can do that better than what I can and theyre
people that aint going to be doubted as quick as Id be  Ill tell you
how to find them  Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper  ThereRoyal
Nonesuch Bricksville  Put it away and dont lose it  When the court
wants to find out something about these two let them send up to
Bricksville and say theyve got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch
and ask for some witnesseswhy youll have that entire town down here
before you can hardly wink Miss Mary  And theyll come abiling too

I judged we had got everything fixed about right now  So I says

Just let the auction go right along and dont worry  Nobody dont have
to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on
accounts of the short notice and they aint going out of this till they
get that money and the way weve fixed it the sale aint going to count
and they aint going to get no money  Its just like the way it was with
the niggersit warnt no sale and the niggers will be back before
long  Why they cant collect the money for the NIGGERS yettheyre in
the worst kind of a fix Miss Mary

Well she says Ill run down to breakfast now and then Ill start
straight for Mr Lothrops

Deed THAT aint the ticket Miss Mary Jane I says by no manner of
means go BEFORE breakfast

Why

What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for Miss Mary

Well I never thoughtand come to think I dont know  What was it

Why its because you aint one of these leatherface people  I dont
want no better book than what your face is  A body can set down and read
it off like coarse print  Do you reckon you can go and face your uncles
when they come to kiss you goodmorning and never

There there dont  Yes Ill go before breakfastIll be glad to
And leave my sisters with them

Yes never mind about them  Theyve got to stand it yet a while  They
might suspicion something if all of you was to go  I dont want you to
see them nor your sisters nor nobody in this town if a neighbor was to
ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something  No
you go right along Miss Mary Jane and Ill fix it with all of them
Ill tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say youve went
away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change or to see a
friend and youll be back tonight or early in the morning

Gone to see a friend is all right but I wont have my love given to
them

Well then it shant be  It was well enough to tell HER sono harm
in it  It was only a little thing to do and no trouble and its the
little things that smooths peoples roads the most down here below it
would make Mary Jane comfortable and it wouldnt cost nothing  Then I
says  Theres one more thingthat bag of money

Well theyve got that and it makes me feel pretty silly to think HOW
they got it

No youre out there  They haint got it

Why whos got it

I wish I knowed but I dont  I HAD it because I stole it from them
and I stole it to give to you and I know where I hid it but Im afraid
it aint there no more  Im awful sorry Miss Mary Jane Im just as
sorry as I can be but I done the best I could I did honest  I come
nigh getting caught and I had to shove it into the first place I come
to and runand it warnt a good place

Oh stop blaming yourselfits too bad to do it and I wont allow it
you couldnt help it it wasnt your fault  Where did you hide it

I didnt want to set her to thinking about her troubles again and I
couldnt seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that
corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach  So
for a minute I didnt say nothing then I says

Id ruther not TELL you where I put it Miss Mary Jane if you dont
mind letting me off but Ill write it for you on a piece of paper and
you can read it along the road to Mr Lothrops if you want to  Do you
reckon that ll do

Oh yes

So I wrote  I put it in the coffin  It was in there when you was
crying there away in the night  I was behind the door and I was mighty
sorry for you Miss Mary Jane

It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by
herself in the night and them devils laying there right under her own
roof shaming her and robbing her and when I folded it up and give it to
her I see the water come into her eyes too and she shook me by the
hand hard and says

GOODbye  Im going to do everything just as youve told me and if I
dont ever see you again I shant ever forget you and Ill think of
you a many and a many a time and Ill PRAY for you tooand she was
gone

Pray for me  I reckoned if she knowed me shed take a job that was more
nearer her size  But I bet she done it just the sameshe was just that
kind  She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notionthere
warnt no backdown to her I judge  You may say what you want to but
in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see in my
opinion she was just full of sand  It sounds like flattery but it aint
no flattery  And when it comes to beautyand goodness tooshe lays
over them all  I haint ever seen her since that time that I see her go
out of that door no I haint ever seen her since but I reckon Ive
thought of her a many and a many a million times and of her saying she
would pray for me and if ever Id a thought it would do any good for me
to pray for HER blamed if I wouldnt a done it or bust

Well Mary Jane she lit out the back way I reckon because nobody see
her go  When I struck Susan and the harelip I says

Whats the name of them people over on tother side of the river that
you all goes to see sometimes

They says

Theres several but its the Proctors mainly

Thats the name I says I most forgot it  Well Miss Mary Jane she
told me to tell you shes gone over there in a dreadful hurryone of
thems sick

Which one

I dont know leastways I kinder forget but I thinks its

Sakes alive I hope it aint HANNER

Im sorry to say it I says but Hanners the very one

My goodness and she so well only last week  Is she took bad

It aint no name for it  They set up with her all night Miss Mary Jane
said and they dont think shell last many hours

Only think of that now  Whats the matter with her

I couldnt think of anything reasonable right off that way so I says

Mumps

Mumps your granny  They dont set up with people thats got the mumps

They dont dont they  You better bet they do with THESE mumps  These
mumps is different  Its a new kind Miss Mary Jane said

Hows it a new kind

Because its mixed up with other things

What other things

Well measles and whoopingcough and erysiplas and consumption and
yaller janders and brainfever and I dont know what all

My land  And they call it the MUMPS

Thats what Miss Mary Jane said

Well what in the nation do they call it the MUMPS for

Why because it IS the mumps  Thats what it starts with

Well ther aint no sense in it  A body might stump his toe and take
pison and fall down the well and break his neck and bust his brains
out and somebody come along and ask what killed him and some numskull
up and say Why he stumped his TOE  Would ther be any sense in that
NO  And ther aint no sense in THIS nuther  Is it ketching

Is it KETCHING  Why how you talk  Is a HARROW catchingin the dark
If you dont hitch on to one tooth youre bound to on another aint
you And you cant get away with that tooth without fetching the whole
harrow along can you  Well these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow
as you may sayand it aint no slouch of a harrow nuther you come to
get it hitched on good

Well its awful I think says the harelip  Ill go to Uncle Harvey
and

Oh yes I says I WOULD  Of COURSE I would  I wouldnt lose no
time

Well why wouldnt you

Just look at it a minute and maybe you can see  Haint your uncles
obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can  And do you
reckon theyd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that
journey by yourselves  YOU know theyll wait for you  So fur so good
Your uncle Harveys a preacher aint he  Very well then is a PREACHER
going to deceive a steamboat clerk is he going to deceive a SHIP CLERK
so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard  Now YOU know he
aint  What WILL he do then  Why hell say Its a great pity but
my church matters has got to get along the best way they can for my
niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribusunum mumps and so its
my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to
show on her if shes got it  But never mind if you think its best to
tell your uncle Harvey

Shucks and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good
times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Janes
got it or not  Why you talk like a muggins

Well anyway maybe youd better tell some of the neighbors

Listen at that now  You do beat all for natural stupidness  Cant you
SEE that THEYD go and tell  Ther aint no way but just to not tell
anybody at ALL

Well maybe youre rightyes I judge you ARE right

But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey shes gone out a while
anyway so he wont be uneasy about her

Yes Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that  She says Tell them to
give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss and say Ive run over
the river to see MrMrwhat IS the name of that rich family your
uncle Peter used to think so much ofI mean the one that

Why you must mean the Apthorps aint it

Of course bother them kind of names a body cant ever seem to remember
them half the time somehow  Yes she said say she has run over for to
ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house
because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had it than anybody
else and shes going to stick to them till they say theyll come and
then if she aint too tired shes coming home and if she is shell be
home in the morning anyway  She said dont say nothing about the
Proctors but only about the Apthorpswhich ll be perfectly true
because she is going there to speak about their buying the house I know
it because she told me so herself

All right they said and cleared out to lay for their uncles and give
them the love and the kisses and tell them the message

Everything was all right now  The girls wouldnt say nothing because
they wanted to go to England and the king and the duke would ruther Mary
Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of Doctor
Robinson  I felt very good I judged I had done it pretty neatI
reckoned Tom Sawyer couldnt a done it no neater himself  Of course he
would a throwed more style into it but I cant do that very handy not
being brung up to it

Well they held the auction in the public square along towards the end
of the afternoon and it strung along and strung along and the old man
he was on hand and looking his level pisonest up there longside of the
auctioneer and chipping in a little Scripture now and then or a little
goodygoody saying of some kind and the duke he was around googooing
for sympathy all he knowed how and just spreading himself generly

But by and by the thing dragged through and everything was sold
everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard  So theyd got
to work that offI never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting
to swallow EVERYTHING  Well whilst they was at it a steamboat landed
and in about two minutes up comes a crowd awhooping and yelling and
laughing and carrying on and singing out

HERES your opposition line heres your two sets o heirs to old Peter
Wilksand you pays your money and you takes your choice




CHAPTER XXIX


THEY was fetching a very nicelooking old gentleman along and a
nicelooking younger one with his right arm in a sling  And my souls
how the people yelled and laughed and kept it up  But I didnt see no
joke about it and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some to
see any  I reckoned theyd turn pale  But no nary a pale did THEY
turn The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up but just went
a googooing around happy and satisfied like a jug thats googling out
buttermilk and as for the king he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful
on them newcomers like it give him the stomachache in his very heart to
think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world  Oh he done
it admirable  Lots of the principal people gethered around the king to
let him see they was on his side  That old gentleman that had just come
looked all puzzled to death  Pretty soon he begun to speak and I see
straight off he pronounced LIKE an Englishmannot the kings way though
the kings WAS pretty good for an imitation  I cant give the old gents
words nor I cant imitate him but he turned around to the crowd and
says about like this

This is a surprise to me which I wasnt looking for and Ill
acknowledge candid and frank I aint very well fixed to meet it and
answer it for my brother and me has had misfortunes hes broke his arm
and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night
by a mistake  I am Peter Wilks brother Harvey and this is his brother
William which cant hear nor speakand cant even make signs to amount
to much nowt hes only got one hand to work them with  We are who we
say we are and in a day or two when I get the baggage I can prove it
But up till then I wont say nothing more but go to the hotel and wait

So him and the new dummy started off and the king he laughs and
blethers out

Broke his armVERY likely AINT itand very convenient too for a
fraud thats got to make signs and aint learnt how  Lost their
baggage Thats MIGHTY goodand mighty ingeniousunder the
CIRCUMSTANCES

So he laughed again and so did everybody else except three or four or
maybe half a dozen  One of these was that doctor another one was a
sharplooking gentleman with a carpetbag of the oldfashioned kind made
out of carpetstuff that had just come off of the steamboat and was
talking to him in a low voice and glancing towards the king now and then
and nodding their headsit was Levi Bell the lawyer that was gone up to
Louisville and another one was a big rough husky that come along and
listened to all the old gentleman said and was listening to the king
now And when the king got done this husky up and says

Say looky here if you are Harvey Wilks whend you come to this town

The day before the funeral friend says the king

But what time o day

In the eveninbout an hour er two before sundown

HOWD you come

I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati

Well then howd you come to be up at the Pint in the MORNINin a
canoe

I warnt up at the Pint in the mornin

Its a lie

Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an
old man and a preacher

Preacher be hanged hes a fraud and a liar  He was up at the Pint that
mornin  I live up there dont I  Well I was up there and he was up
there  I see him there  He come in a canoe along with Tim Collins and
a boy

The doctor he up and says

Would you know the boy again if you was to see him Hines

I reckon I would but I dont know  Why yonder he is now  I know him
perfectly easy

It was me he pointed at  The doctor says

Neighbors I dont know whether the new couple is frauds or not but if
THESE two aint frauds I am an idiot thats all  I think its our duty
to see that they dont get away from here till weve looked into this
thing Come along Hines come along the rest of you  Well take these
fellows to the tavern and affront them with tother couple and I reckon
well find out SOMETHING before we get through

It was nuts for the crowd though maybe not for the kings friends so we
all started  It was about sundown  The doctor he led me along by the
hand and was plenty kind enough but he never let go my hand

We all got in a big room in the hotel and lit up some candles and
fetched in the new couple  First the doctor says

I dont wish to be too hard on these two men but I think theyre
frauds and they may have complices that we dont know nothing about  If
they have wont the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter Wilks
left  It aint unlikely  If these men aint frauds they wont object
to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove theyre
all rightaint that so

Everybody agreed to that  So I judged they had our gang in a pretty
tight place right at the outstart  But the king he only looked
sorrowful and says

Gentlemen I wish the money was there for I aint got no disposition to
throw anything in the way of a fair open outandout investigation o
this misable business but alas the money aint there you kn send and
see if you want to

Where is it then

Well when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it
inside o the straw tick o my bed not wishin to bank it for the few
days wed be here and considerin the bed a safe place we not bein
used to niggers and supposn em honest like servants in England  The
niggers stole it the very next mornin after I had went down stairs and
when I sold em I hadnt missed the money yit so they got clean away
with it  My servant here kn tell you bout it gentlemen

The doctor and several said Shucks and I see nobody didnt altogether
believe him  One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it  I said no
but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away and I never
thought nothing only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my
master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them  That
was all they asked me  Then the doctor whirls on me and says

Are YOU English too

I says yes and him and some others laughed and said Stuff

Well then they sailed in on the general investigation and there we had
it up and down hour in hour out and nobody never said a word about
supper nor ever seemed to think about itand so they kept it up and
kept it up and it WAS the worst mixedup thing you ever see  They made
the king tell his yarn and they made the old gentleman tell hisn and
anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a SEEN that the old
gentleman was spinning truth and tother one lies  And by and by they
had me up to tell what I knowed  The king he give me a lefthanded look
out of the corner of his eye and so I knowed enough to talk on the right
side  I begun to tell about Sheffield and how we lived there and all
about the English Wilkses and so on but I didnt get pretty fur till
the doctor begun to laugh and Levi Bell the lawyer says

Set down my boy I wouldnt strain myself if I was you  I reckon you
aint used to lying it dont seem to come handy what you want is
practice  You do it pretty awkward

I didnt care nothing for the compliment but I was glad to be let off
anyway

The doctor he started to say something and turns and says

If youd been in town at first Levi Bell The king broke in and
reached out his hand and says

Why is this my poor dead brothers old friend that hes wrote so often
about

The lawyer and him shook hands and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased
and they talked right along awhile and then got to one side and talked
low and at last the lawyer speaks up and says

That ll fix it  Ill take the order and send it along with your
brothers and then theyll know its all right

So they got some paper and a pen and the king he set down and twisted
his head to one side and chawed his tongue and scrawled off something
and then they give the pen to the dukeand then for the first time the
duke looked sick  But he took the pen and wrote  So then the lawyer
turns to the new old gentleman and says

You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names

The old gentleman wrote but nobody couldnt read it  The lawyer looked
powerful astonished and says

Well it beats MEand snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket
and examined them and then examined the old mans writing and then THEM
again and then says  These old letters is from Harvey Wilks and
heres THESE two handwritings and anybody can see they didnt write
them the king and the duke looked sold and foolish I tell you to see
how the lawyer had took them in and heres THIS old gentlemans hand
writing and anybody can tell easy enough HE didnt write themfact
is the scratches he makes aint properly WRITING at all  Now heres
some letters from

The new old gentleman says

If you please let me explain  Nobody can read my hand but my brother
thereso he copies for me  Its HIS hand youve got there not mine

WELL says the lawyer this IS a state of things  Ive got some of
Williams letters too so if youll get him to write a line or so we can
com

He CANT write with his left hand says the old gentleman  If he
could use his right hand you would see that he wrote his own letters and
mine too  Look at both pleasetheyre by the same hand

The lawyer done it and says

I believe its soand if it aint so theres a heap stronger
resemblance than Id noticed before anyway  Well well well  I
thought we was right on the track of a solution but its gone to grass
partly  But anyway one thing is provedTHESE two aint either of em
Wilksesand he wagged his head towards the king and the duke

Well what do you think  That muleheaded old fool wouldnt give in THEN
Indeed he wouldnt  Said it warnt no fair test  Said his brother
William was the cussedest joker in the world and hadnt tried to write
HE see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the
pen to paper  And so he warmed up and went warbling right along till he
was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying HIMSELF but pretty
soon the new gentleman broke in and says

Ive thought of something  Is there anybody here that helped to lay out
my brhelped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying

Yes says somebody me and Ab Turner done it  Were both here

Then the old man turns towards the king and says

Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast

Blamed if the king didnt have to brace up mighty quick or hed a
squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under it took him
so sudden and mind you it was a thing that was calculated to make most
ANYBODY sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice
because how was HE going to know what was tattooed on the man  He
whitened a little he couldnt help it and it was mighty still in there
and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him  Says I to
myself NOW hell throw up the spongethere aint no more use  Well
did he  A body cant hardly believe it but he didnt  I reckon he
thought hed keep the thing up till he tired them people out so theyd
thin out and him and the duke could break loose and get away  Anyway
he set there and pretty soon he begun to smile and says

Mf  Its a VERY tough question AINT it  YES sir I kn tell you
whats tattooed on his breast  Its jest a small thin blue arrow
thats what it is and if you dont look clost you cant see it  NOW
what do you sayhey

Well I never see anything like that old blister for clean outandout
cheek

The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard and his
eye lights up like he judged hed got the king THIS time and says

Thereyouve heard what he said  Was there any such mark on Peter
Wilks breast

Both of them spoke up and says

We didnt see no such mark

Good says the old gentleman  Now what you DID see on his breast was
a small dim P and a B which is an initial he dropped when he was
young and a W with dashes between them so  PBWand he marked
them that way on a piece of paper  Come aint that what you saw

Both of them spoke up again and says

No we DIDNT  We never seen any marks at all

Well everybody WAS in a state of mind now and they sings out

The whole BILIN of m s frauds  Les duck em les drown em les
ride em on a rail and everybody was whooping at once and there was a
rattling powwow  But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells and
says

GentlemengentleMEN  Hear me just a wordjust a SINGLE wordif you
PLEASE  Theres one way yetlets go and dig up the corpse and look

That took them

Hooray they all shouted and was starting right off but the lawyer
and the doctor sung out

Hold on hold on  Collar all these four men and the boy and fetch THEM
along too

Well do it they all shouted and if we dont find them marks well
lynch the whole gang

I WAS scared now I tell you  But there warnt no getting away you
know They gripped us all and marched us right along straight for the
graveyard which was a mile and a half down the river and the whole town
at our heels for we made noise enough and it was only nine in the
evening

As we went by our house I wished I hadnt sent Mary Jane out of town
because now if I could tip her the wink shed light out and save me and
blow on our deadbeats

Well we swarmed along down the river road just carrying on like
wildcats and to make it more scary the sky was darking up and the
lightning beginning to wink and flitter and the wind to shiver amongst
the leaves This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever
was in and I was kinder stunned everything was going so different from
what I had allowed for stead of being fixed so I could take my own time
if I wanted to and see all the fun and have Mary Jane at my back to
save me and set me free when the closefit come here was nothing in the
world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoomarks  If they
didnt find them

I couldnt bear to think about it and yet somehow I couldnt think
about nothing else  It got darker and darker and it was a beautiful
time to give the crowd the slip but that big husky had me by the wrist
Hinesand a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip  He dragged
me right along he was so excited and I had to run to keep up

When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it
like an overflow  And when they got to the grave they found they had
about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted but nobody hadnt
thought to fetch a lantern  But they sailed into digging anyway by the
flicker of the lightning and sent a man to the nearest house a half a
mile off to borrow one

So they dug and dug like everything and it got awful dark and the rain
started and the wind swished and swushed along and the lightning come
brisker and brisker and the thunder boomed but them people never took
no notice of it they was so full of this business and one minute you
could see everything and every face in that big crowd and the shovelfuls
of dirt sailing up out of the grave and the next second the dark wiped
it all out and you couldnt see nothing at all

At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid and then
such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was to
scrouge in and get a sight you never see and in the dark that way it
was awful  Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so and I
reckon he clean forgot I was in the world he was so excited and panting

All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare and
somebody sings out

By the living jingo heres the bag of gold on his breast

Hines let out a whoop like everybody else and dropped my wrist and give
a big surge to bust his way in and get a look and the way I lit out and
shinned for the road in the dark there aint nobody can tell

I had the road all to myself and I fairly flewleastways I had it all
to myself except the solid dark and the nowandthen glares and the
buzzing of the rain and the thrashing of the wind and the splitting of
the thunder and sure as you are born I did clip it along

When I struck the town I see there warnt nobody out in the storm so I
never hunted for no back streets but humped it straight through the main
one and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set it
No light there the house all darkwhich made me feel sorry and
disappointed I didnt know why  But at last just as I was sailing by
FLASH comes the light in Mary Janes window and my heart swelled up
sudden like to bust and the same second the house and all was behind me
in the dark and wasnt ever going to be before me no more in this world
She WAS the best girl I ever see and had the most sand

The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the
towhead I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow and the first time
the lightning showed me one that wasnt chained I snatched it and shoved
It was a canoe and warnt fastened with nothing but a rope  The towhead
was a rattling big distance off away out there in the middle of the
river but I didnt lose no time and when I struck the raft at last I
was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp if I could
afforded it  But I didnt  As I sprung aboard I sung out

Out with you Jim and set her loose  Glory be to goodness were shut
of them

Jim lit out and was acoming for me with both arms spread he was so
full of joy but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in
my mouth and I went overboard backwards for I forgot he was old King
Lear and a drownded Arab all in one and it most scared the livers and
lights out of me  But Jim fished me out and was going to hug me and
bless me and so on he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the
king and the duke but I says

Not now have it for breakfast have it for breakfast  Cut loose and
let her slide

So in two seconds away we went asliding down the river and it DID seem
so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river and
nobody to bother us  I had to skip around a bit and jump up and crack
my heels a few timesI couldnt help it but about the third crack I
noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well and held my breath and
listened and waited and sure enough when the next flash busted out over
the water here they comeand just alaying to their oars and making
their skiff hum  It was the king and the duke

So I wilted right down on to the planks then and give up and it was all
I could do to keep from crying




CHAPTER XXX

WHEN they got aboard the king went for me and shook me by the collar
and says

Tryin to give us the slip was ye you pup  Tired of our company
hey

I says

No your majesty we warntPLEASE dont your majesty

Quick then and tell us what WAS your idea or Ill shake the insides
out o you

Honest Ill tell you everything just as it happened your majesty  The
man that had aholt of me was very good to me and kept saying he had a
boy about as big as me that died last year and he was sorry to see a boy
in such a dangerous fix and when they was all took by surprise by
finding the gold and made a rush for the coffin he lets go of me and
whispers Heel it now or theyll hang ye sure and I lit out  It
didnt seem no good for ME to stayI couldnt do nothing and I didnt
want to be hung if I could get away  So I never stopped running till I
found the canoe and when I got here I told Jim to hurry or theyd catch
me and hang me yet and said I was afeard you and the duke wasnt alive
now and I was awful sorry and so was Jim and was awful glad when we
see you coming you may ask Jim if I didnt

Jim said it was so and the king told him to shut up and said Oh yes
its MIGHTY likely and shook me up again and said he reckoned hed
drownd me  But the duke says

Leggo the boy you old idiot  Would YOU a done any different  Did you
inquire around for HIM when you got loose  I dont remember it

So the king let go of me and begun to cuss that town and everybody in
it But the duke says

You better a blame sight give YOURSELF a good cussing for youre the
one thats entitled to it most  You haint done a thing from the start
that had any sense in it except coming out so cool and cheeky with that
imaginary bluearrow mark  That WAS brightit was right down bully and
it was the thing that saved us  For if it hadnt been for that theyd a
jailed us till them Englishmens baggage comeand thenthe
penitentiary you bet But that trick took em to the graveyard and the
gold done us a still bigger kindness for if the excited fools hadnt let
go all holts and made that rush to get a look wed a slept in our cravats
tonightcravats warranted to WEAR toolonger than WED need em

They was still a minutethinking then the king says kind of
absentminded like

Mf  And we reckoned the NIGGERS stole it

That made me squirm

Yes says the duke kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic WE did

After about a half a minute the king drawls out

Leastways I did

The duke says the same way

On the contrary I did

The king kind of ruffles up and says

Looky here Bilgewater whatr you referrin to

The duke says pretty brisk

When it comes to that maybe youll let me ask what was YOU referring
to

Shucks says the king very sarcastic but I dont knowmaybe you was
asleep and didnt know what you was about

The duke bristles up now and says

Oh let UP on this cussed nonsense do you take me for a blame fool
Dont you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin

YES sir  I know you DO know because you done it yourself

Its a lieand the duke went for him  The king sings out

Take yr hands offleggo my throatI take it all back

The duke says

Well you just own up first that you DID hide that money there
intending to give me the slip one of these days and come back and dig it
up and have it all to yourself

Wait jest a minute dukeanswer me this one question honest and fair
if you didnt put the money there say it and Ill blieve you and take
back everything I said

You old scoundrel I didnt and you know I didnt  There now

Well then I blieve you  But answer me only jest this one morenow
DONT git mad didnt you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide
it

The duke never said nothing for a little bit then he says

Well I dont care if I DID I didnt DO it anyway  But you not only
had it in mind to do it but you DONE it

I wisht I never die if I done it duke and thats honest  I wont say
I warnt goin to do it because I WAS but youI mean somebodygot in
ahead o me

Its a lie  You done it and you got to SAY you done it or

The king began to gurgle and then he gasps out

NoughI OWN UP

I was very glad to hear him say that it made me feel much more easier
than what I was feeling before  So the duke took his hands off and says

If you ever deny it again Ill drown you  Its WELL for you to set
there and blubber like a babyits fitten for you after the way youve
acted I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything
and I atrusting you all the time like you was my own father  You ought
to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot
of poor niggers and you never say a word for em  It makes me feel
ridiculous to think I was soft enough to BELIEVE that rubbage  Cuss you
I can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisityou wanted
to get what money Id got out of the Nonesuch and one thing or another
and scoop it ALL

The king says timid and still asnuffling

Why duke it was you that said make up the deffisit it warnt me

Dry up  I dont want to hear no more out of you says the duke  And
NOW you see what you GOT by it  Theyve got all their own money back
and all of OURN but a shekel or two BESIDES  Glong to bed and dont
you deffersit ME no more deffersits long s YOU live

So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort
and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle and so in about a half an
hour they was as thick as thieves again and the tighter they got the
lovinger they got and went off asnoring in each others arms  They
both got powerful mellow but I noticed the king didnt get mellow enough
to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the moneybag again  That
made me feel easy and satisfied  Of course when they got to snoring we
had a long gabble and I told Jim everything
