CHAPTER I

MISS DOYLE INTERFERES


Daddy said Patricia Doyle at the breakfast table in her cosy New York
apartment here is something that will make you sit up and take
notice

My dear Patsy was the reply its already sitting up I am an
taking waffles If anything at all would make me take notice its your
own pretty phiz

Major remarked Uncle John helping himself to waffles from a fresh
plate Nora brought in you Irish are such confirmed flatterers that you
flatter your own daughters Patsy isnt at all pretty this morning
Shes too red and freckled

Patsy laughed and her blue eyes danced

That comes from living on your old farm at Millville she retorted
Weve only been back three days and the sunburn sticks to me like a
burr to a kitten

Pay no attention to the ould rascal Patsy advised the Major
composedly An stop wavin that letter like a white flag of surrender
Whos it from

Kenneth

Aha An how is our lad

Why hes got himself into a peck of trouble Thats what I want to
talk to you and Uncle John about she replied her happy face growing
as serious as it could ever become

Cant he wiggle out asked Uncle John

Out of what

His trouble

It seems not Listen

Oh tell us about it lassie said the Major If I judge right
theres some sixty pages in that epistle Dont bother to read it
again

But every word is important declared Patsy turning the letter over
except the last page with a swift flush

Uncle John laughed His shrewd old eyes saw everything

Then read us the last page my dear

Ill tell you about it said Patsy quickly Its this way you see
Kenneth has gone into politics

More power to his elbow exclaimed the Major

I cant imagine it in Kenneth said Uncle John soberly Whats he in
for

Forforlets see Oh here it is For member of the House of
Representatives from the Eighth District

Hes flying high for a fledgling observed the Major But Kenneths
a bright lad and a big gun in his county Hell win hands down

Patsy shook her head

Hes afraid not she said and its worrying him to death He doesnt
like to be beaten and thats whats troubling him

Uncle John pushed back his chair

Poor boy he said What ever induced him to attempt such a thing

He wanted to defeat a bad man who now represents Kenneths district
explained Patsy whose wise little head was full of her friends
difficulties and

And the bad man objects to the idea and wont be defeated added the
Major Its a way these bad men have

Uncle John was looking very serious indeed and Patsy regarded him
gratefully Her father never would be serious where Kenneth was
concerned Perhaps in his heart the grizzled old Major was a bit jealous
of the boy

I think said the girl that Mr Watson got Ken into politics for he
surely wouldnt have undertaken such a thing himself And now hes in
he finds hes doomed to defeat and its breaking his heart Uncle
John

The little man nodded silently His chubby face was for once destitute
of a smile That meant a good deal with Uncle John and Patsy knew she
had interested him in Kenneths troubles

Once said the Major from behind the morning paper I was in
politics meself I ran for coroner an got two whole votesme own an
the undertakers Its because the publics so indiscriminating that
Ive not run for anything sinceexcept th streetcar

But its a big game said Uncle John standing at the window with his
hands deep in his pockets and an important game Every good American
should take an interest in politics and Kenneth especially who has
such large landed interests ought to direct the political affairs of
his district

Im much interested in politics too Uncle declared the girl If I
were a man IdIdbe President

An Id vote fer ye twenty times a day mavourneen cried the Major
But luckily yell be no presidentunless its of a womans club

Theres the bell cried Patsy It must be the girls No one else
would call so early

Its Beths voice talking to Nora added her father listening and
then the door flew open and in came two girls whose bright and eager
faces might well warrant the warm welcome they received

Oh Louise cried Patsy however did you get up so early

Ive got a letter from Kenneth was the answer and Im so excited I
couldnt wait a minute

Imagine Louise being excited said Beth calmly as she kissed Uncle
John and sat down by Patsys side She read her letter in bed and
bounced out of bed like a cannonball We dressed like the lightning
change artist at the vaudeville and Im sure our hats are not on
straight

This bids fair to be a strenuous day observed the Major Patsys had
a letter from the boy herself

Oh did you inquired Louise and do you know all about it dear

She knows sixty pages about it replied Major Doyle

Well then whats to be done

The question was addressed to Patsy who was not prepared to reply The
three cousins first exchanged inquiring glances and then turned their
eager eyes upon the broad chubby back of Uncle John who maintained his
position at the window as if determined to shut out the morning
sunlight

Louise Merrick lived with her mother a few blocks away from Patsys
apartment and her cousin Beth DeGraf was staying with her for a time
They had all spent the summer with Uncle John at Millville and had only
returned to New York a few days before Beths home was in Ohio but
there was so little sympathy between the girl and her parents that she
was happy only when away from them Her mother was Uncle Johns sister
but as selfish and cold as Uncle John was generous and genial Beths
father was a genius and a professor of musicone of those geniuses
who live only in their own atmosphere and forget there is a world around
them So Beth had a loveless and disappointed childhood and only after
Uncle John arrived from the far west and took his three nieces under
his wing as he said did her life assume any brightness or interest

Her new surroundings however had developed Beths character
wonderfully and although she still had her periods of sullen depression
she was generally as gay and lovable as her two cousins but in a
quieter and more selfpossessed way

Louise was the eldesta fair dainty creature with that indescribable
air which invariably wins the admiring regard of all beholders
Whatever gown the girl wore looked appropriate and becoming and her
manner was as delightful as her appearance She was somewhat frivolous
and designing in character but warmhearted and staunch in her
friendships Indeed Louise was one of those girls who are so complex as
to be a puzzle to everyone including themselves

Beth DeGraf was the beauty of the group of three and she also possessed
great depth of character Beth did not like herself very well and was
always afraid others would fail to like her so she did not win friends
as easily as did Louise But those who knew the beautiful girl
intimately could read much to admire in the depth of her great dark
eyes and she was not the least interesting of the three nieces whose
fortunes had been so greatly influenced by Aunt Jane and Uncle John
Merrick

But Patricia Doyleusually called Patsy by her friendswas after all
the general favorite with strangers and friends alike There was a
subtle magnetism about the girls laughing freckled face and dancing
blue eyes that could not well be resisted Patsy was not beautiful she
was not accomplished she had no especial air of distinction But she
was winning from the top of her red hair to the tips of her toes and so
absolutely unaffected that she won all hearts

And for wisdom shes got Solomon beat to a frazzle declared the Major
to Uncle John in discussing his daughters character But it is
possible that Major Doyle was prejudiced

Well whats to be done demanded Louise for the second time

We dont vote in Kens district remarked the Major or there would
be six votes to his credit and that would beat my own record by four

Ken is so impressionable that Im afraid this defeat will ruin his
life said Beth softly I wish we could get him away Couldnt we get
him to withdraw

He might be suddenly called to Europe suggested Louise That would
take him away from the place and give him a change of scene

Patsy shook her head

Kenneth isnt a coward she said He wont run away He must accept
his defeat like a man and some time try again Eh Uncle John

Uncle John turned around and regarded his three nieces critically

What makes you think he will be defeated he asked

He says so himself answered Patsy

He writes me he can see no hope for the people are all against him
added Louise

Pah said Uncle John contemptuously What else does the idiot say

That hes lonely and discouraged and had to pour out his heart to some
one or go wild said Patsy the tears of sympathy filling her eyes

And you girls propose to sit down and allow all this inquired their
uncle sternly

We answered Louise lifting her brows and making a pretty gesture
What can we do

Go to work said Uncle John

How asked Patsy eagerly

Politics is a game declared Mr Merrick Its never won until the
last card is played And success doesnt lie so much in the cards as the
way you play em Here are three girls with plenty of shrewdness and
energy Why dont you take a hand in the game and win it

Oh Uncle John

The proposition was certainly disconcerting at first

Yes yes laughed the Major derisively Put on some blue stockings
read the history of womans suffrage cultivate a liking for depraved
eggs and then face Kenneths enraged constituents

I shouldnt mind daddy if it would help Kenneth any declared Patsy
stoutly

Go on Uncle John said Beth encouragingly

Women in politics observed their uncle have often been a tremendous
power You wont need to humiliate yourselves my dears All youll need
to do is to exercise your wits and work earnestly for the cause There
are a hundred ways to do that

Mention a few proposed the Major

I will when I get to Elmhurst and look over the ground answered Uncle
John

Youre going on then

Yes

Ill go with you said Patsy promptly

So will I said Beth Kenneth needs moral encouragement and support
as much as anything else just now

Hes imagining all sorts of horrors and making himself miserable said
Louise Lets all go Uncle and try to cheer him up

By this time Uncle John was smiling genially

Why I was sure of you my dears from the first he said The
Majors an old croaker but hed go too if it were not necessary for
him to stay in New York and attend to business But we mustnt lose any
time if were going to direct the politics of the Eighth District
Election the eighth of November

I can go any time and so can Beth said Louise

All I need is the blue stockings laughed Patsy

It wont be play This means work said Uncle John seriously

Well I believe were capable of a certain amount of work replied
Beth Arent we girls

We are

All right said Mr Merrick Ill go and look up the next train Go
home Louise and pack up Ill telephone you

That bad man d better look out chuckled the Major He doesnt
suspect that an army of invasion is coming

Daddy cried Patsy you hush up We mean business

If you win said the Major Ill run for alderman on a petticoat
platform and hire your services




CHAPTER II

THE ARTIST


To most people the great rambling mansion at Elmhurst with its ample
grounds and profusion of flowers and shrubbery would afford endless
delight But Kenneth Forbes the youthful proprietor was at times
dreadfully bored by the loneliness of it all though no one could better
have appreciated the beauties of his fine estate

The town an insignificant village was five miles distant and
surrounding the mansion were many broad acres which rather isolated it
from its neighbors Moreover Elmhurst was the one important estate in
the county and the simple hardworking farmers in its vicinity
considered justly enough that the owner was wholly out of their class

This was not the owners fault and Kenneth had brooded upon the matter
until he had come to regard it as a distinct misfortune For it isolated
him and deprived him of any social intercourse with his neighbors

The boy had come to live at Elmhurst when he was a mere child but only
as a dependent upon the charities of Aunt Jane who had accepted the
charge of the orphan because he was a nephew of her dead lover who had
bequeathed her his estate of Elmhurst Aunt Jane was Kenneths aunt
merely in name since she had never even married the uncle to whom she
had been betrothed and who had been killed in an accident before the
boy was born

She was an irritable old woman as Kenneth knew her and had never shown
him any love or consideration He grew up in a secluded corner of the
great house tended merely by servants and suffered to play in those
quarters of the ample grounds which Aunt Jane did not herself visit The
neglect which Kenneth had suffered and his lonely life had influenced
the youths temperament and he was far from being an agreeable
companion at the time Aunt Jane summoned her three nieces to Elmhurst in
order to choose one of them as her heiress These girls bright cheery
and wholesome as they were penetrated the boys reserve and drew him
out of his misanthropic moods They discovered that he had remarkable
talent as an artist and encouraged him to draw and paint something he
had long loved to do in secret

Then came the great surprise of the boys life which changed his
condition from one of dependency into affluence Aunt Jane died and it
was discovered that she had no right to transfer the estate to one of
her nieces because by the terms of his uncles deed to her the property
reverted on her death to Kenneth himself Louise Merrick Beth DeGraf
and Patsy Doyle the three nieces were really glad that the boy
inherited Elmhurst and returned to their eastern homes with the most
cordial friendship existing between them all

Kenneth was left the master of Elmhurst and possessor of considerable
wealth besides and at first he could scarcely realize his good fortune
or decide how to take advantage of it He had one good and helpful
friend an old lawyer named Watson who had not only been a friend of
his uncle and the confidant of Aunt Jane for years but had taken an
interest in the lonely boy and had done his best to make his life
brighter and happier

When Kenneth became a landed proprietor Mr Watson was appointed his
guardian and the genial old lawyer abandoned the practice of law and
henceforth devoted himself to his wards welfare and service

They made a trip to Europe together where Kenneth studied the pictures
of the old masters and obtained instruction from some of the foremost
living artists of the old world

It was while they were abroad a year before the time of this story
that the boy met Aunt Janes three nieces again They were doing
Europe in company with a wealthy bachelor uncle John Merrick a
generous kindhearted and simpleminded old gentleman who had taken the
girls under his wing as he expressed it and had really provided for
their worldly welfare better than Aunt Jane his sister could have
done

This Uncle John was indeed a whimsical character as the reader will
presently perceive Becoming a millionaire against his will as he
declared he had learned to know his nieces late in life and found in
their society so much to enjoy that he was now wholly devoted to their
interests His one friend was Major Doyle Patsys father a dignified
but agreeable old Irish gentleman who amused Uncle John nearly as much
as the girls delighted him The Major managed John Merricks financial
affairs leaving the old millionaire free to do as he pleased

So he took the girls to Europe and the four had a fine adventurous
trip as may be imagined Kenneth and Mr Watson met them in Sicily and
afterward in the Italian cities and the friendship already existing
between the young people was more firmly cemented than before

In the spring Kenneth returned with his guardian to Elmhurst where he
devoted himself largely to painting from the sketches he had made
abroad while Mr Watson sat beside him comfortably smoking his pipe and
reading his favorite authors The elder man was contented enough in his
condition but the boy grew restless and impatient and longed for
social intercourse His nature was moody and he had a tendency to brood
if left much to himself

Uncle John had carried his nieces to a farm at Millville in the
Adirondack region for the summer so that Kenneth heard but seldom from
his friends

Such was the disposition of the characters when our story opens

Kenneth Forbes although I have called him a boy had attained his
majority on the fifteenth day of May At this time Mr Watson rendered
his accounts and turned over the estate to its owner He would then have
retired but Kenneth would not let him go Twentyone years of age
sounds mature but the owner of Elmhurst was as boyish and inexperienced
as it is possible for one twentyone years old to be He had grown
accustomed moreover to depend much on Mr Watsons legal acumen in the
management of his affairs and would have been embarrassed and
bewildered if obliged to shoulder the burden all at once

The lawyer who had always had an affection for the young man perceived
this clearly so an arrangement was made that he should remain with his
young friend indefinitely and strive to teach him such elements of
business as would enable him in time to attend to his extensive
interests understandingly and wisely

The country around Elmhurst is thickly settled with agriculturists for
the farms are rich and productive in that part of the state But it is
not a flat country and Nature has given it many pretty woodland glades
and rocky glens to add to its charm

From the hill country at the west came several rushing streams which
tumbled along rocky paths to the river nine miles below Elmhurst and
there are scenes along these routes that might well delight the eye of
an artist Kenneth had often wandered into these outoftheway places
when a halfforgotten neglected lad but had not visited them for
years Now however with the spirit of loneliness upon him he suddenly
thought of a glen that would make an interesting study for a picture so
one morning he mounted his horse and rode away to pay the place a
preliminary visit

The farmers along the road nodded at the young fellow goodnaturedly as
he passed them Everyone knew him well by sight yet Kenneth could not
have named many of his neighbors having held little intercourse with
them It struck him this morning that they had little cause to be
interested in him He had been an unsociable lad and since he had
become master of Elmhurst had done little to cultivate acquaintance with
the people who lived around him

One reason for this was that they held little in common with him The
neighboring farmers were honest thrifty souls and among them were many
both shrewd and thoughtful but they naturally would not force
themselves upon the society of the one really rich man in their
community especially as that man had shown no desire to know them

Kenneth was the subject of much speculation among them and opinions
widely differed concerning his character Some called him a prig and
declared that he was stuck up and conceited Others said he was a
nambypamby without brains or wit But there were a few who had
occasionally talked with the boy who understood him better and hinted
that he might develop into quite a man in time

Kenneth surprised himself this morning by greeting several of his
neighbors with unusual cordiality He even stopped a man who was driving
along the highway to inquire about his horse which he perceived was
very lame The boy knew something about horses and suggested a method of
treatment that he thought would help the nag a suggestion the farmer
received with real gratitude

This simple incident cheered Kenneth more than you might suppose and he
was actually whistling as he rode through the glen where the country
road wound its way beside the noisy rushing stream

Pausing in front of the picturesque table rock that he had come to
inspect the boy uttered an exclamation of chagrin and disappointment
Painted broadly upon the face of the rock in great white letters was
the advertisement of a patent medicine The beauty of the scene was
ruinedonly the glaring advertisement caught and held the eye of the
observer

At first Kenneths mind held only a feeling of disgust that such a
desecration of Natures gifts to humanity should be allowed Then he
remembered another place further along the glen which was almost as
pretty as this had been before the defiling brush of the advertiser had
ruined it So he spurred his horse and rode up the winding way to the
spot There a redlettered announcement of Simpsons Soap stared him
in the face

This was too much for his temper and his disappointment quickly turned
to resentment While he sat on his mare considering the matter the man
with the lame horse whom he had passed overtook him

Can you tell me Kenneth asked who owns this property

Why I do replied the man reining up

And you permitted these vile signs to be painted on the rocks
demanded the boy angrily

O course replied the man with a grin of amusement I cant farm
the rocks can I An these ere signs pays me ten dollars a year
each

Kenneth groaned

Ill give you fifteen dollars a year each if youll let me wash off the
letters and restore the scene to its original beauty he declared

Im willin was the response But ye see theyre contracted Id git
into trouble with the signpainter

Who is he

Lives in Cleveland Ive got his name up t th house if youll come
along He comes up here every spring and paints fences an rocks payin
spot cash fer th privilege

Oh I see

Then he contracts with the soap man an the medicine man to paint up
their ads Youre the young un from Elmhurst aint ye

Yes

Well Id like to earn that extra five well enough My names Parsons
Ive got three signs let on my property in the glen Ef yell jest ride
up t the house Ill giv ye the fellers name

All right Come along said Kenneth with sudden resolve

The farmer rode a time in silent thought He could not go fast for the
beast was very lame Finally he remarked

Ef ye buy up the sign painters sos ye can wash off the letters like
enough yell hev to pay him fer th paint an paintin too

I dont mind was the response

The farmer chuckled Here was an interesting adventure for a fact What
on earth could possess the young un from Elmhurst to object to signs
and be willing to pay for having them erased

Like enough yell hev to pay back the money the soap an medicine men
guv th painter too he hazarded

Like enough said Kenneth grimly

One of his stubborn moods had seized him At all hazards he was resolved
to eliminate those ugly signs

He got the name of the sign painter accepted a glass of buttermilk at
the farm house and then rode slowly home by another route so that he
might not have to face the signs again

But on this route he saw even more They were painted on the fences and
barns as he passed along He scowled at each one but they did not
appear to him quite so inharmonious as those which marred the more
picturesque and retired spots which were his favorite haunts




CHAPTER III

DON QUIXOTE


When Kenneth got home he told Mr Watson of his discovery and asked the
old gentleman to write to the sign painter and find out what could be
done The lawyer laughed heartily at his young friends whim but agreed
to help him

If you are going to try to prevent rural advertising he remarked
youll find your hands full

Kenneth looked up smiling

Thank you he said

For what

For finding me something to do Im sick of this inaction

Again the lawyer laughed

What is your idea he asked

To remove such eyesores as advertising signs from the neighborhood of
Elmhurst

Its a Titans task Ken

So much the better

The lawyer grew thoughtful

I believe its impossible he ventured

Better yet I dont say Ill succeed but I promise to try I want
something to occupy myselfsomething really difficult so that I may
test my own powers

But my dear boy This foolish proposition isnt worthy your effort If
you want to be up and doing well find something else to occupy your
mind

No Mr Watson Im set on this Its a crime to allow these signs to
flaunt themselves in our prettiest scenes My instinct revolts at the
desecration Besides no one else seems to have undertaken the task of
exterminating them

True enough If youre serious Ken Ill frankly say the thing cant
be done You may perhaps buy the privilege of maintaining the rocks of
the glen free from advertising but the advertisers will paint more
signs on all the approaches and you wont have gained much

Ill drive every advertising sign out of this country

Impossible The great corporations who control these industries make
their fortunes by this style of advertising The rural districts are
their strongholds And they must advertise or they cant sell their
products

Let them advertise in decent ways then What right has any soap maker
to flaunt his wares in my face whether Im interested in them or not

The right of custom People have submitted to these things so long that
the manufacturers consider themselves justified in covering every barn
rock and fence with their signs I see no way to stop them

Nor I at present But there must be a way

Drive out one and another will take his place They pay liberally for
locations

Pshaw Ten dollars a year for a rock as big as a barn

But they rent thousands of such positions and in the aggregate our
farmers get large sums from them

And ruin the appearance of their homes and farms

Mr Watson smiled

Theyre not artists Ken They cant realize on appearances but they
can use the money the signs bring them

They need to be educated thats all These farmers seem very honest
decent fellows

They are Ken I wish you knew them better

So do I Mr Watson This campaign ought to bring us closer together
for I mean to get them to help me

Youll have to buy them Im afraid

Not all of them There must be some refinement among them

But the lawyer was not convinced However it was not his desire to
stifle this newborn enthusiasm of Kenneths even though he believed it
misdirected He wanted the young man to rouse himself and take an
interest in life and if his antagonism to advertising signs would
effect this the futile fight against them was to be welcomed It would
cost the boy something but he would gain his moneys worth in
experience

After a few days the sign painter answered the letter He would
relinquish the three signs in the glen for a payment of fifty dollars
each with the understanding that no other competing signs were to take
their place Kenneth promptly mailed a check for the amount demanded and
early next morning started for the glen with what he called his
eliminators

These eliminators consisted of two men with cans of turpentine and
gasoline and an equipment of scrubbing brushes Parsons the farmer
came over to watch this novel proceeding happy in the possession of
three crisp fivedollar notes given in accordance with the agreement
made with him All day the two men scrubbed the rocks faithfully
assisted at odd times by their impatient employer but the thick
splashes of paint clung desperately to the rugged surface of the rock
and the task was a hard one When evening came the letters had almost
disappeared when viewed closely but when Kenneth rode to the mouth of
the glen on his way home and paused to look back he could see the
injunction Take Smiths Liver Pills staring at him in grim defiance
of the scrubbing brushes

But his energy was not exhausted No one ever knew what it cost in labor
and material to erase those three signs but after ten days they had
vanished completely and the boy heaved a sigh of satisfaction and
turned his attention to extending the campaign

On the farm nearest to Elmhurst at the north which belonged to a man
named Webb was a barn facing the road that displayed on its side a
tobacco sign Kenneth interviewed Mr Webb and found that he received no
money for the sign but the man contended that the paint preserved his
barn from the weather on that side So Kenneth agreed to repaint the
entire barn for him and actually had the work done As it took many
coats of paint to blot out the sign it was rather a expensive operation

By this time the campaign of the youthful proprietor of Elmhurst against
advertising signs began to be talked of throughout the county and was
the subject of much merriment among the farmers Some of them were
intelligent enough to admire the young Quixote and acknowledged frankly
that it was a pity to decorate their premises with signs of patent
medicines and questionable soaps

But the majority of them sneered at the champion and many refused
pointblank to consider any proposition to discard the advertisements
Indeed some were proud of them and believed it a mark of distinction
to have their fences and sheds announce an eyeremedy or several
varieties of pickles

Mr Watson at first an amused observer of the campaign soon became
indignant at the way that Kenneth was ridiculed and reviled and he took
a hand in the fight himself He decided to call a meeting of the
neighboring farmers at the district schoolhouse on Saturday night
where Kenneth could address them with logical arguments and endeavor to
win them over to his way of thinking

The invitation was promptly accepted by the rural population not so
much because they were interested in the novel ideas of the young artist
as because they expected to be amused by hearing the boyish master of
Elmhurst lecture at em So they filled the little room to
overflowing and to add to the dignity of the proceedings the Hon
Erastus Hopkins State Representative for the district lent his
presence to the assemblage

Not that the Honorable Erastus cared a fig about this foolish talk of
exterminating advertising signs He was himself a large stockholder in a
breakfastfood factory which painted signs wherever it could secure
space These signs were not works of art but they were distinctly
helpful to business and only a fool in the opinion of the Honorable
Erastus would protest against the inevitable

What brought the legislator to the meeting was the fact that he was
coming forward for reelection in November and believed that this
afforded a good chance to meet some of his constituents and make a
favorable impression So he came early and shook hands with everyone
that arrived and afterward took as prominent a seat as possible

Indeed the gathering had at first the appearance of being a political
one so entirely did the Representative dominate it But Mr Watson took
the platform and shyly introduced the speaker of the evening

The farmers all knew Mr Watson and liked him so when Kenneth rose
they prepared to listen in respectful silence

Usually a young man making his maiden speech is somewhat diffident but
young Forbes was so thoroughly in earnest and so indignant at the
opposition that his plans had encountered that he forgot that it was his
first public speech and thought only of impressing his hearers with his
views exulting in the fact that on this occasion they could not talk
back as they usually did in private when he tried to argue with them
So he exhorted them earnestly to keep their homes beautiful and free
from the degradation of advertising and never to permit glaring
commercialism to mar the scenery around them He told them what he had
been able to accomplish by himself in a short time how he had redeemed
the glen from its disgraceful condition and restored it to its former
beauty He asked them to observe Webbs pretty homestead no longer
marred by the unsightly sign upon the barn And then he appealed to them
to help him in driving all the advertising signs out of the community

When he ended they applauded his speech mildly but it was chiefly for
the reason that he had spoken so forcibly and well

Then the Honorable Erastus Hopkins quick to catch the lack of sympathy
in the audience stood up and begged leave to reply to young Forbes

He said the objection to advertising signs was only a rich mans
aristocratic hobby and that it could not be indulged in a democratic
community of honest people His own firm he said bought thousands of
bushels of oats from the farmers and converted them into the celebrated
EagleEye Breakfast Food three packages for a quarter They sold this
breakfast food to thousands of farmers to give them health and strength
to harvest another crop of oats Thus he benefited the community going
and coming What Should he not advertise this mutualbenefit commodity
wherever he pleased and especially among the farmers What aristocratic
notion could prevent him It was a mighty good thing for the farmers to
be reminded by means of the signs on their barns and fences of the
things they needed in daily life

If the young man at Elmhurst would like to be of public service he might
find some better way to do so than by advancing such crazy ideas But
this continued the Representative was a subject of small importance
What he wished especially to call their attention to was the fact that
he had served the district faithfully as Representative and deserved
their suffrages for renomination And then he began to discuss political
questions in general and his own merits in particular so that Kenneth
and Mr Watson disgusted at the way in which the Honorable Erastus had
captured the meeting left the schoolhouse and indignantly returned to
Elmhurst

This man Hopkins said Mr Watson angrily is not a gentleman Hes
an impertinent meddler

He ruined any good effect my speech might have created said Kenneth
gloomily

Give it up my boy advised the elder man laying a kindly hand on the
youths shoulder It really isnt worth the struggle

But I cant give it up and acknowledge myself beaten protested
Kenneth almost ready to weep with disappointment

Well well lets think it over Ken and see what can be done Perhaps
that rascally Hopkins was right when he advised you to find some other
way to serve the community

I cant do better than to make it cleanto do away with these
disreputable signs said the boy stubbornly

You made a fine speech declared Mr Watson gravely puffing his pipe
I am very proud of you my lad

Kenneth flushed red He was by nature shy and retiring to a degree Only
his pentup enthusiasm had carried him through the ordeal and now that
it was over he was chagrined to think that the speech had been so
ineffective He was modest enough to believe that another speaker might
have done better




CHAPTER IV

KENNETH TAKES A BOLD STEP


This man Hopkins gets on my nerves said Mr Watson a week or two
after the eventful meeting in the schoolhouse He was at the breakfast
table opposite Kenneth and held up a big glaring postcard which was
in his mail

What is it now asked the boy rousing himself from a fit of
abstraction

An announcement offering himself for renomination at the primaries
Its like a circus advertisement Isnt it a shame to think that modern
politics has descended to such a level in our free and enlightened
republic

Kenneth nodded stirring his coffee thoughtfully He had lost his spirit
and enthusiasm since the meeting and was fast relapsing into his old
state of apathy and boredom It grieved Mr Watson to note this

Hopkins isnt fit to be the Representative for this district observed
the old gentleman with sudden energy

The boy looked at him

Who is Hopkins he asked

His mother once kept a stationery shop in town and he was stable boy
at the hotel But he was shrewd and prospered and when he grew up
became a countyclerk or taxcollector then an assessor and finally he
ran last term for State Representative from this district and was
elected by a mighty small majority

Why small asked Kenneth

Because hes a Democrat and the district is strongly Republican But
Thompson ran against him on the Republican ticket and couldnt win his
party vote

Whos Thompson

The general store keeper He has a reputation for short weights and
measures

The boy sipped his coffee thoughtfully

Tell me sir how did you happen to know all this he asked

Ive been looking up Hopkinss record I have disliked the man ever
since he treated us so shabbily on the night of the meeting

Never mind him Weve done with him

Mr Watson shifted uneasily in his chair

I wonder if we have he said

Why not sir

Well Kenneth we have to reside at Elmhurst which is Hopkinss
district Also I believe Elmhurst to be the most important estate in the
district and you to be the largest taxpayer This man wishes to go to
the State Legislature and make laws for you to obey

Well

Well its our duty to watch him If he isnt a fit man its our duty
to prevent him from representing us

The young man nodded somewhat dreamily

Some of these country yokels must represent us he observed It
doesnt matter much whether its Hopkins or someone else

Except that you being a prominent man owe it to the community to
protect its interests added the lawyer

Do you want me to mix in these petty politics asked the boy
irritably

Oh do as you like my boy If you can shirk your duties with a clear
conscience Ive nothing to say

For a time the young man was silent Finally he asked

Why isnt Hopkins a good Representative

Hes what is called a grafter a term signifying that he is willing
to vote for any measure that he is paid to vote for whether it benefits
his constituents or not

Oh Is he singular in this

By no means The grafter is all too common in politics

Again the boy fell into a thoughtful mood

Mr Watson am I a Democrat or a Republican

The old gentleman laughed outright

Dont you know Ken

No sir I havent asked myself before

Then I advise you to be a Republican

Why

Because Hopkins is a Democrat and we may then fight him openly

What is the difference sir between the two parties

There is no difference of importance All Americans are loyal citizens
whichever side they adopt in politics But the two parties are the
positive and negative poles that provide the current of electricity for
our nation and keep it going properly Also they safeguard our
interests by watching one another

What is your preference sir

Ive always been a Republican whenever I dabbled in politics which
hasnt been often

Then I will be a Republican

Very good

I am sorry to say that I know nothing about politics and have no
convictions on the subject Who is to oppose the Honorable Erastus on
theon our side

I dont know yet The primaries for the nomination are not to be held
for two weeks and the Republican candidates seem shy about coming
forward

Didnt you say the district was Republican

Yes but since Hopkins defeated them last term they seem to be
terrified and no one likes to offer himself as a possible sacrifice

That feeling will probably elect Mr Hopkins declared Kenneth with
conviction

Unless

Unless what sir

Unless we come to the rescue of the Republicans and take a hand in
local politics ourselves my lad

Kenneth pushed back his chair and rose from the table He walked to the
window and stood there whistling for a few moments and then left the
room without a word

For a time Mr Watson sat silently musing

Perhaps Im inviting trouble he murmured but I am sure I am doing
right The boy needs a good shaking up and more knowledge of his
fellowmen If I can get Kenneth interested this plan of mine will be
of great benefit to him

Then he too left the breakfast table and wandering into the garden
saw Kenneth busy at his easel in a shady corner

For a day or so the subject was not resumed and then Mr Watson
casually introduced it

A law could be passed in the State Legislature forbidding the display
of all advertising signs in public places in this county he suggested

The boy looked at him eagerly

Are you sure he asked

I am positive was the answer It is merely a question of privilege

And you think we might hire Hopkins to pass such a law

No we couldnt trust him

Then what do you propose

Ill think it over my lad and let you know

Then he walked away leaving Kenneth much pleased with the idea he had
advanced Indeed he was so much interested in the suggestion that he
himself referred to the subject at the first opportunity

I dont like to be beaten sir once Ive undertaken to do a thing he
said So if such a law can be passed Ill do all I can to elect the man
who will pass it

I thought as much the old lawyer replied smiling But theres only
one man who could go to the legislature with enough influence to win the
votes to carry such a unique measure through

And who is that sir

Kenneth Forbes the owner of Elmhurst and the largest taxpayer in the
county

Me sir

Youre the man

A State Representative

Its an honorable office Its an important office properly filled
You might not only beautify your district by having those objectionable
signs prohibited but do many other things to better the condition of
the farmers And that isnt all

Whats the rest Mr Watson

You owe something to yourself lad All your young life youve been too
selfcontained and exclusive in your habits The noblest study of
mankind is man It would broaden you to go into politics for a time
and do much to develop your character and relieve the monotony of your
existence

Kenneth frowned

It wont be easy you know Itll be a fight and a hard one for
Hopkins wont give up his job if he can help it

The boy brightened again

I like a good fight he said wistfully If I thoughtif I believed
I could fill the position with creditI might undertake it

Ill answer for that retorted the old man highly pleased with his
easy victory You win the fight Ken and Ill guarantee youll
outclass the majority of your fellow Representatives Its a good state
too

So the thing was undertaken and both the young man and the old threw
themselves into the contest with energy and determination

Mr Watson rode in his buggy all over their district during the next
fortnight and interviewed the farmers and townsmen of the legislative
district When it became noised about that the young owner of Elmhurst
now barely twentyone had determined to enter politics and asked for
the nomination of Representative no other Republican ventured to oppose
him

It was understood to mean a hard fight and even the most sturdy
Republican was inclined to fear that the present incumbent of the office
would be elected to succeed himself

So the primaries were held and Kenneth attended and made a speech and
was warmly applauded His nomination was a matter of course and he went
home the unanimous choice of his party because none of the older and
more discreet politicians ventured to risk defeat

The Hon Erastus Hopkins well knew this feeling and smiled in his
pompous and most sardonic manner when he learned who was his opponent
Having conquered an old and tried Republican warrior in the last
campaign he had no fears in regard to this mere boy who could know
little of political intrigue

He wont put up enough of a fight to make it interesting Im afraid
Mr Hopkins confided to his cronies

But he didnt intend to take chances so he began the campaign with his
usual vigor

It was now the middle of September and the election was to be early in
November




CHAPTER V

PLANNING THE WORK


The Honorable Erastus Hopkins was thoroughly enjoying his campaign

He was not an especially popular man in his district and he knew it
Physically he was big and stout with a florid face and small eyes that
blinked continually His head was bald his hands fat and red and his
feet enormous

To offset this Mr Hopkins wore a silk hat and a Prince Albert coat
morning noon and night His gold watchchain was huge and imposing he
had a big diamond shirtstud and upon his puffy fingers several rings
He conveyed nevertheless the impression that he was more prosperous
than refined and the farmers and townsmen were as quick to recognize
this as was Mr Watson himself

Moreover the Honorable Erastus was dubbed closefisted by his
neighbors He never spent a penny on anyone but himself and being
unscrupulous in politics he was naturally unscrupulous in smaller things
of a business nature But since he had risen from a stableboy to his
present affluent position he had never been unwise or careless enough to
be caught in any crooked action and while his acquaintances had an
indefinite fear of dealing with him they could not accuse him openly

It seems strange that such a man should have been chosen to represent a
wealthy and important district in the State Legislature but politics
can show many a similar case In the first place Mr Hopkins was
aggressive and knew political methods thoroughly He had usurped the
position of Democratic leader in his community and the others were
afraid to antagonize him openly When he was nominated for
Representative he managed to dictate by shrewd methods the nomination
of Thompson the storekeeper on the Republican ticket Thompson owed
Hopkins a large sum of money and Hopkins held a mortgage on the stock
Therefore Thompson dared not make a fight and although the Republican
vote was normally the largest in the district Hopkins had managed to
win enough of them to his side to win

He had been a little anxious about his renomination because he knew
that he had not represented his district very satisfactorily but when
Kenneth Forbes received the nomination on the Republican ticket he felt
that all was over but the shouting and that he would win in a walk
Had it been an issue between the personality of the two men Hopkins
would have had little chance of success but young Forbes had already
raised another issue by his antisign speech at the schoolhouse and
Hopkins intended to force that issue and so defeat Kenneth because of
the ridicule the latters position had already brought upon him

He began to circulate humorous stories about Kenneths antipathy to
signboards saying that the young man demanded that the signs be taken
off the Zodiac and that he wouldnt buy goods of the village grocer
because the man had a sign out

Mr Hopkins also printed thousands of large handbills reading The
Signs of the Times vs Aristocratic Snobbery Vote for the Hon Erastus
Hopkins the man who believes in advertising

These things had their effect upon all classes of people There were
many goodnatured laughs at young Forbess expense All this was soon
realized at Elmhurst and had the effect of plunging the youthful
aspirant for political honors into the depths of despair The campaign
was hot against him but Kenneth made no defense

At this juncture with election but three weeks away he received a
telegram asking him to send the drag and baggage wagon to the noon
train It was signed by John Merrick and the boy was overjoyed at the
prospect of seeing his jolly old friend again And the girls Well some
of them surely must be coming or Uncle John wouldnt have asked for the
drag

Now then the election can go to blazes said Kenneth cheerfully to
Mr Watson The sight of some friendly faces will be a great relief

The old lawyer sighed His attempt to wake up Kenneth had resulted in
failure mainly because the boy had become discouraged so early in the
game Kenneth felt keenly the humiliating experiences he had passed
through and had sunk back into his old moody reserve

But here was a welcome diversion The visitors whoever they might prove
to be would afford relief to the situation and brighten the dullness of
life at the big house So both Kenneth and Mr Watson were with the drag
at the station when the noon train drew in

And there were Patsy Doyle Beth DeGraf and Louise Merrick a bevy of
dainty and sprightly girls alighting eagerly from the coaches with
Uncle John handing out the grips and packages and giving the checks for
the baggage with businesslike celerity to Thomas the groom

Weve come for a visit Ken cried Palsy laughing at his eager
delight Are you glad to see us boy And do you suppose old Martha has
our rooms aired

And its a long visit too added Uncle John as youll believe when
you see the pile of baggage Youd think these minxes were prepared for
a tour of the world Each one of em brought a carload of clothes

But they couldnt phase Kenneth in that way His sensitive face had not
beamed with so much animation for months

The guests were helped into the tall drag and merrily they drove the
five miles to Elmhurst not a word of politics being spoken on the way

The girls had not been to the house since Aunt Janes death two years
ago and after a hasty luncheon they began an inspection of every room
as well as the garden grounds and stables The horses cows pig and
chickens were alike inspected the roses and dahlias visited and
admired and after all this they returned to their rooms with old
Martha the housekeeper and proceeded to unpack their trunks and get
settled Kenneth had been their guide and companion in these various
explorations but when the girls went to their rooms he wandered into
the library where Uncle John and Mr Watson had been having a quiet talk
over their pipes of tobacco They welcomed the young man but adroitly
turned the topic of conversation and again the subject of was rejoined

It was a merry dinner party that graced the table during dinner that
evening and the boy forgot his troubles and was as jolly and sociable
as he had ever been in his life

But when they were all assembled in the long living room where they
grouped themselves around the fireplace a sudden change took place in
the demeanor of the young ladies Patsy the delegated leader looked
gravely at the boy and asked

How goes the campaign Ken

Whwhat campaign he stammered to gain time

Why this election business Tell us about it said Patsy

Some other time girls answered the boy red and distressed Itit
wouldnt interest you a bit

Why not asked Louise softly

Because it doesnt interest me he replied

Are you so sure of election inquired Beth

Im sure of defeat if you must know he declared scowling at the
recollection of his predicament

You havent been cowardly enough to give up asked Patricia boldly

What do you mean by that Patsy Doyle he asked the scowl deepening

Just what I say Ken A brave man doesnt know when hes beaten much
less beforehand

He looked at her fixedly

Im not brave my dear he replied more gently than they had
expected The people here dont understand me nor I them Im laughed
at and reviled a subject for contemptuous jeers andand it hurts me
I dont like to be beaten Id fight to the last gasp if I had any show
to win But these conditions which I foolishly but honestly brought
about myself have defeated me so far in advance that I have absolutely
no hope to redeem myself Thats all Dont speak of it again girls
Play me that nocturne that I like Beth

Weve got to speak of this Kenneth and speak of it often For we
girls have come down here to electioneer and for no other reason on
earth declared Patsy

What You electioneera slight smile curled his lips

Exactly Were here to brace up and get to work

And to win added Beth quietly

And to put you in the Legislature where you belong declared Louise

Kenneth turned to Mr Merrick

Talk to them Uncle John he begged

I have said the little man smiling and theyve convinced me that
they mean business Its all up with you my boy as a private citizen
Youre as good as elected

Kens eyes filled

Youre all very kind sir he said as you were bound to be Andand
I appreciate it allvery much But Mr Watson will tell you that the
case is hopeless and theres nothing to be done

How about it Watson inquired Uncle John turning to the lawyer

Ill explain the proposition sir so you will all understand it he
replied and drew his chair into the circle To begin with Kenneth
visited the glen one day to make a sketch and found his old tablerock
covered with an advertising sign

How preposterous exclaimed Louise

There were three of these huge signs in different parts of the glen
and they ruined its natural beauty Kenneth managed to buy up the spaces
and then he scrubbed away the signs By that time he had come to detest
the unsightly advertisements that confronted him every time he rode out
and he began a war of extermination against them

Quite right said Patsy nodding energetically

But our friend made little headway because the sympathies of the people
were not with him

Why not sir inquired Beth while Kenneth sat inwardly groaning at
this baring of his terrible experiences

Because through custom they had come to tolerate such things and could
see no harm in them replied the lawyer They permit their buildings
which face the roads to be covered with big advertisements and the
fences are decorated in the same way In some places a signboard has
been built in their yards or fields advertising medicines or groceries
or tobacco In other words our country roads and country homes have
become mere advertising mediums to proclaim the goods of more or less
unscrupulous manufacturers and so all their attractiveness is
destroyed Kenneth being a man of artistic instincts and loving country
scenes resented this invasion of commercialism and tried to fight it

And so ran my head against a stone wall added the young man with a
bitter laugh

But you were quite right said Patsy decidedly Such things ought
not to be permitted

The people think differently he replied

Then we must educate the people to a different way of thinking
announced Louise

In three weeks

That is long enough if we get to work Isnt it girls said Beth

Kenneth accepted the nomination with the idea of having a law passed
prohibiting such signs explained the lawyer But Mr Hopkins his
opponent has used this very thing to arouse public sentiment against
him Farmers around here are thrifty people and they fear to lose the
trifling sums paid them for the privilege of painting signs on their
premises

Patsy nodded gravely

We will change all that she said The thing is really more serious
than we expected and more difficult But we came here to work and win
and were going to do it Arent we Uncle John

Ill bet on your trio Patsy replied her uncle But I wont bet all
Im worth

Its all foolishness declared Kenneth

I do not think so said the lawyer gravely The girls have a fine
show to win I know our country people and they are more intelligent
than you suppose Once they are brought to a proper way of thinking they
will support Kenneth loyally

Then we must bring them to a proper way of thinking said Patsy with
decision From this time on Ken we become your campaign managers
Dont worry any more about the matter Go on with your painting and be
happy We may require you to make a few speeches but all the details
will be arranged for you

Do you intend to permit this Uncle John asked Kenneth

Im wholly in sympathy with the girls Ken and I believe in them

But consider the humiliation to which they will subject themselves
Ive had a taste of that medicine myself

Were going to be the most popular young ladies in this district
exclaimed Patsy Dont you worry about us Ken But tell me how big is
your district

It includes parts of three countiesMonroe Washington and Jackson
Counties

What county is this

Monroe

Any cities

No only a few towns Its mostly a rural district Fairview just
across the border in Washington County is the biggest village

Have you an automobile

No I dont like the things Ive always loved horses and prefer them
to machines

How much money are you prepared to spend

How muchwhats that he asked bewildered

You cant win a political election without spending money declared
Patsy wisely Ill bet the bad man is scattering money in every
direction It will cost something on our side to run this campaign in a
way to win

The young man frowned

I dont mind spending money Patsy he said but I dont approve of
buying votes and I wont allow it either

Tuttut Who said anything about buying votes But were going to work
on a broad and liberal basis I assure you and we need money

Spend all you like then so long as you dont try to corrupt the
voters

Very good Now then how much land do you own at Elmhurst

Kenneth looked inquiringly at the lawyer

About twelve hundred acres said Mr Watson It is divided into small
farms which are let out on shares

How many votes do you control among your servants and tenants
proceeded Patsy in a businesslike tone

Perhaps thirty or forty

And what is the total vote of the district

Thirtyfive hundred

Patsy gasped

So many

Fully that many said Mr Watson smiling

Then weve got to have over seventeen hundred and fifty votes to elect
Kenneth

Exactly

The girl drew a long breath and looked at Beth and Louise Then they all
laughed

Suppose you resign as campaign managers said Kenneth beginning to be
amused

Oh no Itsits easier than we expected Isnt it girls

Its childs play observed Louise languidly

The boy was astonished

Very well said he Try it and see

Of course said Patsy cheerfully Tomorrow morning we begin work




CHAPTER VI

A GOOD START


At an early breakfast next morning Patsy announced the program for the
day

Uncle John and I will drive over to the village she said and
perhaps well be gone all day Dont worry if were not back for
luncheon Louise and Mr Watson are going in the phaeton to visit some
of the nearby farmers Take one road dear and follow it straight
along as far as it keeps within our legislative district and visit
every farmhouse on the way

The farmers will all be busy in the fields said Kenneth

Louise doesnt care about the farmers retorted Patsy Shes going to
talk to their wives

Wives dont vote Patsy

They tell their husbands how to vote though declared Louise with a
laugh Let me win the women and Ill win the men

What am I to do asked Beth

Youre to stay at home and write several articles for the newspapers
There are seven important papers in our district and five of them are
Republican Make a strong argument Beth Youre our publicity
department Also get up copy for some handhills and circular letters I
want to get a circular letter to every voter in the district

All right said Beth I know what you want

There was an inspiring air of business about these preparations and the
girls were all eager to begin work Scarcely was breakfast finished when
the two equipages were at the door Louise and Mr Watson at once
entered the phaeton and drove away the girl delighted at the prospect
of visiting the farmers wives and winning them by her plausible
speeches Conversation was Louises strong point She loved to talk and
argue and her manner was so confiding and gracious that she seldom
failed to interest her listeners

Patsy and Uncle John drove away In Kenneths buggy to the town and
during the fivemile drive Patsy counseled gravely with her shrewd uncle
in regard to ways and means

This thing requires prompt action Patsy he said and if were going
to do things that count theyve got to be done on a big scale

True she admitted But oughtnt we to be a little careful about
spending Kenneths money

Ill be your temporary banker said the old gentleman and keep track
of the accounts If we win well present Kenneth our bill and if we
fail Ill have the satisfaction of getting rid of some of that dreadful
income that is swamping me

This was always Uncle Johns cry His enormous fortune was a constant
bugbear to him He had been so interested in his business enterprises
for many years that he had failed to realize how his fortune was
growing and it astounded him to wake up one day and find himself
possessed of many millions He had at once retired from active business
and invested his millions in ways that would cause him the least
annoyance but the income on so large a sum was more than he could take
care of and even Major Doyle who managed these affairs for his
brotherinlaw was often puzzled to know what to do with the money that
accumulated

Doubtless no one will ever know how much good these two kindly men
accomplished between them in their quiet secretive way Dozens of
deserving young men were furnished capital to start them in business
dozens more were being educated at universities at Uncle Johns expense
Managers of worthy charities were familiar with John Merricks signature
on checks and yet the vast fortune grew with leaps and bounds Mr
Merricks life was so simple and unostentatious that his personal
expenses however erratic some of his actions could not make much
headway against his interest account and nothing delighted him more
than to find a way to get even with fate by reckless squandering as
he quaintly expressed it He was far too shrewd to become the prey of
designing people but welcomed any legitimate channel in which to unload
his surplus

So Mr Merrick had been revolving the possibilities of this unique
political campaign in his mind and had decided to do some things that
would open the bucolic eyes of Kenneths constituents in wonder He did
not confide all his schemes to Patsy but having urged his nieces to
attempt this conquest he had no intention of allowing them to suffer
defeat if he could help it

The little town of Elmwood was quiet and practically deserted when they
drove into it The farmers were too busy with the harvest to come to
town for trading except on Saturdays and the arrival and departure of
the two daily trains did not cause more than a ripple of excitement in
the village

Patsy decided she would shop at each and every store in the place and
engage the storekeepers in conversation about the election

Its important to win these people she declared because they are
close to every farmer who comes to town to trade and their own votes
count too

Ill run over to the bank said Uncle John and get acquainted
there

So he tied the horses to a post and let Patsy proceed alone upon her
mission while he wandered over to a little brick building of neat
appearance which bore the inscription Bank in gold letters on its
plateglass window

Mr Warren in he asked the clerk at the window

The banker a dignified old gentleman of considerable ability came out
of his private office and greeted his visitor very cordially He had
known Uncle John when the millionaire visited Elmhurst two years before
and since then had learned more particulars concerning him So there was
no need of an introduction and Mr Warren was delighted at the prospect
of business relations with this famous personage

The bank although small and only one story high was the most modern
and imposing building in the village and it was fitted with modern
conveniences for Mr Warren had been successful and prosperous In his
private office were local and long distance telephones a direct
connection with the telegraph operator at the station and other
facilities for accomplishing business promptly Uncle John had
remembered this fact and it had a prominent place in his plans

He followed the banker into his private office and told him briefly his
intention to forward the interests of his young friend Kenneth Forbes
for Member of the Legislature

The old gentleman shook his head at first predicting failure Young
Forbes was his most important customer and he respected him highly but
this antisign issue bade fair to ruin all his chances

The idea is too progressive and advanced to be considered at this
time he stated positively The encroachments of advertisers on
personal property may lead to a revolt in the future but it is still
too early to direct popular opinion against them

Isnt Forbes a better man for the place than Hopkins asked Uncle
John

Undoubtedly sir And I think Forbes would have won had not Hopkins
forced this unfortunate issue upon him As it is our young friend
cannot avoid the consequences of his quixotic action

He doesnt wish to avoid them was the quiet reply Were going to
win on that issue or not at all

Im afraid its hopeless sir

May I count on your assistance

In every way

Thank you Mr Warren Im going to spend a lot of money Put this
draft for fifty thousand to my credit as a starter

Ah I begin to understand But

You dont understand at all yet May I use your long distance
telephone

Of course sir

Uncle John had secured considerable information from Mr Watson and
this enabled him to act comprehensively The advertising sign business
in this part of the state was controlled by two firms who contracted
directly with the advertisers and then had the signs painted upon spaces
secured from the farmers by their wideawake agents These signs were
contracted for by the year but the firms controlling the spaces always
inserted protective clauses that provided for the removal of any sign
when certain conditions required such removal In such cases a rebate
was allowed to the advertiser This protective clause was absolutely
necessary in case of fire alteration or removal of buildings or
destruction of fences and signboards by weather or the requirements of
the owners It was this saving clause in the contracts of which Uncle
John had decided to take advantage The contracting sign painters were
merely in the business to make money

Mr Merrick got the head of the concern in Cleveland over the telephone
within half an hour He talked with the man at length and talked with
the convincing effect that the mention of money has When he hung up the
receiver Uncle John was smiling Then he called for the Chicago firm
With this second advertising company he met with more difficulties and
Mr Warren had to come to the telephone and assure the man that Mr
Merrick was able to pay all he agreed to and that the money was on
deposit in his bank That enabled Mr Merrick to conclude his
arrangements He knew that he was being robbed but the cooperation of
the big Chicago firm was necessary to his plans

Then the telephone having served its purpose Mr Warren took Uncle
John across the street to the newspaper office and introduced him to
Charley Briggs the editor

Briggs was a man with one eye a sallow complexion and sandy hair that
stuck straight up from his head He set type for his paper besides
editing it and Uncle John found him wearing a much soiled apron with
his bare arms and fingers smeared with printers ink

Mr Merrick wants to see you on business Charley said the banker
Whatever he agrees to I will guarantee to the full resources of my
bank

The editor pricked up his ears and dusted a chair for his visitor with
his apron It wasnt easy to make a living running a paper in Elmwood
and if there was any business pending he was anxious to secure it

Uncle John waited until Mr Warren had left him alone with the newspaper
man Then he said

I understand your paper is Democratic Mr Briggs

Thats a mistake sir replied the editor evasively The Herald is
really independent but in political campaigns we adopt the side we
consider the most deserving of support

Youre supporting Hopkins just now

Only mildly only mildly sir

What is he paying you

Why Rast and I havent come to a definite settlement yet I ought to
get a hundred dollars out of this campaign but Rast thinks fifty is
enough You see he plans on my support anyhow and dont like to spend
more than hes obliged to

Why does he plan on your support

Hes the only live one in the game Mr Merrick Rast is one of
ushes one of the peopleand its policy for me to support him
instead of the icicle up at Elmhurst who dont need the job and dont
care whether he gets it or not

Is that true

I think so And theres another thing Young Forbes is dead against
advertising and advertising is the life of a newspaper Why there
isnt a paper in the district thats supporting Forbes this year

Youve a wrong idea of the campaign Mr Briggs said Uncle John It
is because Mr Forbes believes in newspaper advertising and wants to
protect it that hes against these signs Thats one reason anyhow
Cant you understand that every dollar spent for painting signs takes
that much away from your newspapers

Why perhaps theres something in that Mr Merrick Id never looked
at it that way before

Now see here Mr Briggs Ill make you a proposition Ill give you
two hundred and fifty to support Mr Forbes in this campaign and if
hes elected Ill give you five hundred extra

Do you mean that sir asked the editor scarcely able to believe the
evidence of his ears

I do Draw up a contract and Ill sign it And heres a check for your
twofifty in advance

The editor drew up the agreement with a pen that trembled a little

And now said Uncle John get busy and hustle for Kenneth Forbes

I will sir said Briggs with unexpected energy I mean to win that
extra five hundred




CHAPTER VII

PATSY MAKES PROGRESS


Meantime Patsy was in the thick of the fray The druggist was a
deepdyed Democrat and sniffed when she asked him what he thought of
Forbes for Representative

Hes no politician at alljust an aristocrat declared Latham a
dapper little man with his hair slicked down to his ears and a waxed
moustache And hes got fool notions too If he stopped the
advertising signs I wouldnt sell half as many painkillers and
liverpills

Hes my cousin said Patsy mendaciously for although they called
themselves cousins there was no relationship even of marriage as
Patsys Aunt Jane had merely been betrothed to Kenneths uncle when he
died

Im sorry for that miss replied the druggist Hes going to be
badly beaten

I think Ill take two ounces of this perfumery It is really
delightful Some druggists have so little taste in selecting such
things

Yes miss I do rather pride myself on my perfumes replied Latham
graciously Now heres a sachet powder that gives fine satisfaction

Ill take a couple of packets of that too since you recommend it

Latham began doing up the purchases There was no other customer in the
store

You know miss I havent anything against Mr Forbes myself His
people are good customers Its his ideas I object to and hes a
Republican

Havent you ever voted for a Republican asked the girl Dont you
think it better to vote for the best man rather than the best party in
a case like this

Why perhaps it is But in what way is Mr Forbes the best man

Hes honest He doesnt want to make any money out of the office On
the contrary hes willing and able to spend a good deal in passing laws
that will benefit his district

And Hopkins

Dont you know Mr Hopkins she asked pointedly

Yes miss I do And Latham frowned a little

As regards the advertising signs continued the girl Ive heard you
spoken of as a man of excellent taste and I can believe it since Ive
examined the class of goods you keep And your store is as neat and
attractive as can be The fight is not against the signs themselves but
against putting them on fences and barns and so making great glaring
spots in a landscape where all should be beautiful and harmonious I
suppose a man of your refinement and good taste has often thought of
that and said the same thing

Whyahemyes of course miss I agree with you that the signs are
often out of place andand inharmonious

To be sure and so you must sympathize with Mr Forbess campaign

In that way yes of course said Mr Latham puzzled to find himself
changing front so suddenly

Mr Hopkins has taken a lot of money out of this town remarked Patsy
examining a new kind of tooth wash But I cant find that hes ever
given much of it back

Thats true He buys his cigars of Thompson the general store man and
I keep the finest line ever brought to this town

Oh that reminds me exclaimed Patsy Mr Forbes wanted me to
purchase a box of your choicest brand and have you just hand them out
to your customers with his compliments He thinks he ought to show a
little cordiality to the men who vote for him and he said you would
know just the people to give them to

Latham gasped but he assumed an air of much importance

I know every man that comes to this town miss as well as any youll
find he said

The best brand mind you Mr Latham said the girl How much will
they be

Why the very bestthese imported perfectos you knoware worth six
dollars a box of fifty Perhaps for election purposes something a little
cheaper

Oh no the best is none too good for the friends of Mr Forbes you
know And fiftywhy fifty will scarcely go around Ill pay for a
hundred Mr Latham and youll see they go to the right persons

Of course of course miss And much obliged You see young Forbes is
well liked and hes quite a decent fellow I wouldnt be surprised if
he gave Hopkins a hard fight

Ill tell you a secret said Patsy sweetly Mr Forbes is bound to
be elected Why its all arranged in advance Mr Latham and the
better element like yourself is sure to support him By the way you
wont forget to tell people about those signs I hope That the fight is
not against advertising but for beautiful rural homes and scenes

Oh Ill fix that Miss

Doyle Im Miss Doyle Mr Forbess cousin

Ill see that the people understand this campaign Miss Doyle You can
depend on me

And if the cigars give out dont hesitate to open more boxes Ill
call in now and then and settle for them

I really think this young lady might have been ashamed of herself but
she wasnt She smiled sweetly upon the druggist when he bowed her out
and Mr Latham from that moment began to seek for friends of Mr Forbes
to give cigars to If they were not friends he argued with them until
they were for he was an honest little man in his way and tried to act
in good faith

So the girl went from one shop to another making liberal purchases and
seeking for every opening that would enable her to make a convert And
her shrewd Irish wit made her quick to take advantage of any weakness
she discovered in the characters of the people she interviewed

When noon came Uncle John hunted her up which was not difficult in
Elmwood and together they went to the village hotel to get something
to eat The midday dinner was not very inviting but Patsy praised the
cooking to the landlords wife who waited upon the table and Uncle
John bought one of the landlords cigars after the meal and talked
politics with him while he smoked it

Then Patsy went over to the general store and there she met her first
rebuff Thompson the proprietor was a sourvisaged man tall and lanky
and evidently a dyspeptic Having been beaten by Hopkins at the last
election when he ran against him on the Republican ticket Thompson had
no desire to see Forbes more successful than he had been himself And
there were other reasons that made it necessary for him to support
Hopkins

So he was both gruff and disagreeable when Patsy after buying a lot of
ribbons of him broached the subject of politics He told her plainly
that her cousin hadnt a ghost of a show and that he was glad of it

The young fool had no business to monkey with politics he added and
this will teach him to keep his fingers out of someone elses pie

It isnt Mr Hopkinss pie declared Patsy stoutly It belongs to
whoever gets the votes

Well thats Hopkins He knows the game and Forbes dont

Cant he learn asked the girl

No Hes an idiot Always was a crank and an unsociable cuss when a
boy and hes worse now hes grown up Oh I know Forbes all right and
I havent got no use for him neither

Argument was useless in this case The girl sighed gathered up her
purchases and went into the hardware store

Immediately her spirits rose Here was a man who knew Kenneth believed
in him and was going to vote for him She had a nice talk with the
hardware man and he gave her much useful information about the most
important people in the neighborhoodthose it would be desirable to win
for their candidate When he mentioned Thompson she said

Oh hes impossible Ive talked with him

Thompson is really a good Republican replied Mr Andrews the
hardware man But hes under Hopkinss thumb and doesnt dare defy
him

Doesnt he like Mr Hopkins asked Patsy in surprise

No he really hates him You see Thompson isnt a very successful
merchant He has needed money at times and borrowed it of Hopkins at a
high rate of interest Its a pretty big sum now and Hopkins holds a
mortgage on the stock If he ever forecloses as he will do some day
Thompson will be ruined So hes obliged to shout for Hopkins whether
he believes in him or not

I think I understand him now said Patsy smiling But he neednt
have been so disagreeable

Hes a disagreeable man at any time returned Mr Andrews

Has he any political influence asked the girl

Yes considerable Otherwise he couldnt have secured the nomination
when he pretended to run against Hopkinsfor it was only a pretense
You see hes a well known Republican and when he sides for Hopkins
hes bound to carry many Republicans with him

But there were other important people whom Mr Andrews thought might be
influenced and he gave Patsy a list of their names He seemed much
amused at the earnestness of this girlish champion of the Republican
candidate

I do not think we can win he said as she left him but we ought to
make a good showing for your cousin and Ill do my very best to help
you

As she rode home with Uncle John in the afternoon after a day of really
hard work Patsy sized up the situation and declared that she was
satisfied that she had made progress She told Mr Merrick of the
mortgage held over Thompson by Mr Hopkins and the little man made a
mental note of the fact He also was satisfied with his days work and
agreed to ride over to Fairview the next day with her and carry the war
into this the largest village in Kenneths district

Meantime Louise and Mr Watson were having some interesting interviews
with the farmers wives along the Marville road The old lawyer knew
nearly everyone in this part of the country for he had lived here all
his life But he let Louise do the talking and was much pleased at the
tact and good nature she displayed in dealing with the widely different
types of character she encountered

Her method was quite simple and for that reason doubly effective She
sat down in Mrs Simmonss kitchen where the good woman was ironing
and said

Im a cousin of Mr Forbes up at Elmhurst you know Hes running for
a political office so as to do some good for his county and district
and Ive come to see if youll help me get votes for him

Law sakes child exclaimed Mrs Simmons I aint got nuthin to do
with politics

No but youve got a lot to do with Mr Simmons and thats where we
need your help You see Mr Forbes thinks Mr Simmons is one of the
most important men in this district and hes very anxious to win his
vote

Why dont you see Dan then Hes outn the rye field replied the
woman

Its because Im only a girl and he wouldnt listen to me replied
Louise sweetly But he takes your advice about everything I hear

He dont take it as often as he orter dont Dan interrupted Mrs
Simmons pausing to feel whether her iron was hot

Perhaps not agreed Louise but in important things such as this
hes sure to listen to you and we women must stick together if we want
to win this election

But I dont know nothin about it protested Mrs Simmons an I
dont believe Dan does

You dont need to know much Mrs Simmons replied the girl What a
pretty baby that is All you need do is to tell Dan he must vote for Mr
Forbes and see that he agrees to do so

Why was the pointed query

Well there are several reasons One is that Mr HopkinsMr Erastus
Hopkins you know is the other candidate and a person must vote for
either one or the other of them

Dans a friend o Rastus said the woman thoughtfully I seen em
talkin together the other day

But this isnt a matter of friendship its business and Mr Forbes is
very anxious to have your husband with him If Mr Forbes is elected it
means lighter taxes better roads and good schools If Mr Hopkins is
elected it does not mean anything good except for Mr Hopkins

I guess youre right about that laughed the woman Rast dont let
much get away from him

Youre very clever Mrs Simmons You have discovered the fact without
being told

Oh I know Rast Hopkins an so does Dan

Then I can depend on you to help us asked the girl patting the
tousled head of a little girl who stood by staring at the pretty lady

Ill talk to him but I dunno what good itll do said Mrs Simmons
thoughtfully

I know He wont refuse to do what you ask him for a man always
listens to his wife when he knows shes right Youll win Mrs Simmons
and I want to thank you for saving the election for us If we get Mr
Simmons on our side I believe well be sure to defeat Hopkins

Oh Ill do what I kin was the ready promise and after a few more
remarks about the children and the neatness of the house Louise took
her leave

Will she win him over asked the girl of Mr Watson when they were
jogging on to the next homestead

I really cant say my dear replied the old lawyer thoughtfully
but I imagine shell try to and if Dan doesnt give in Mrs Simmons
will probably make his life miserable for a time You flattered them
both outrageously but that will do no harm

And so it went on throughout the day Sometimes the farmer himself was
around the house and then they held a sort of conference Louise asked
his advice about the best way to win votes and said she depended a
great deal upon his judgment She never asked a man which side he
favored but took it for granted that he was anxious to support Mr
Forbes and this subtle flattery was so acceptable that not one declared
outright that he was for Hopkins whatever his private views might have
been

When evening came and they had arrived at Elmhurst again Louise was
enthusiastic over her work of the day and had many amusing tales to
tell of her experiences

How many votes did you win asked Uncle John smiling at her

I cant say she replied but I didnt lose any If one sows plenty
of seed some of it is bound to sprout

We can tell better after election said Mr Watson But Im satisfied
that this is the right sort of work Mr Merrick to get results

So am I returned Uncle John heartily Are you willing to keep it up
Louise

Of course she exclaimed We start again bright and early tomorrow
morning




CHAPTER VIII

THE HONORABLE ERASTUS IS ASTONISHED


The Honorable Erastus Hopkins had been absent at the state capital for
several days looking after various matters of business for he was a
thrifty man and watched his investments carefully

Whenever his acquaintances asked about his chances for reelection the
Honorable Erastus Hopkins winked laughed and declared its a regular
walkover

Who is opposing you once asked a grayhaired Senator of much
political experience who had met Mr Hopkins at luncheon

Young feller named Forbesa boy sirwith no notion about the game at
all He was pledged to an unpopular issue so I was mighty glad to have
him run against me

What issue is he pledged to asked the Senator

Oh hes agin putting advertising signs on fences and barns and wants
to have them prohibited like the infernal fool he is

Indeed Then hes a progressive fellow And you say his issue is
unpopular

Thats what it is Itll kill his chancesif he ever had any

Strange mused the Senator That issue has been a winning one
usually

What do you mean asked the astonished Hopkins

Why the antisign fight has won in several places throughout the
country and local laws have been passed prohibiting them Didnt you
know that

No said Hopkins

Well its true Of course I do not know the temper of your people but
in a country district such as yours I would think an issue of that sort
very hard to combat

Nonsense exclaimed the Honorable Erastus Evry man Jacks agin the
fool notion

Then perhaps the people dont understand it

Forbes has given up already continued Hopkins laughing at the
recollection Hes gone back into his shell like a turtle an wont
come out to fight I tell you Senator hes the worst licked candidate
that ever ran for office

Nevertheless the suggestion that the antisign issue had been
successful in other localities made Mr Hopkins a trifle uneasy and he
decided to return home and keep the fight going until after election
whether young Forbes came out of his shell or not

He arrived at Hilldale on the early morning train and went to his house
for breakfast To his amazement he found two great banners strung across
the village streets bearing the words Vote for Forbesthe Peoples
Champion

Who in thunder could a done that murmured Mr Hopkins staring
openmouthed at the great banners Then he scratched his head with a
puzzled air and went home

Mrs Hopkins a tiredlooking woman in a bedraggled morning wrapper was
getting the breakfast She did not participate largely in the prosperity
of her husband and often declared she was worked to death although
there were no children to care for

When did those Forbes banners go up asked Mr Hopkins irritably

I dunno Rast I dont keep track o such things But all the town was
out to the girls meetin last night an I went along to watch the
fun

What girls meeting

The girls thet air workin fer to elect Mr Forbes It was in the town
hall an all three of the girls made speeches

What about

About Mr Forbes and how he orter be elected He wants to beautify the
farm places by doin away with signs an he wants better roads an
three new schoolhouses cause the ones weve got now aint big enough
An

You blamed idiot What are you talking about roared the exasperated
Hopkins

Oh you neednt rave at me Rast Hopkins just cause youre gettin
licked I thought your goose was cooked the minnit these girls got to
work

Mr Hopkins stared at her with a dazed expression

Be sensible Mary and tell me who these girls are I havent heard of
em

Why theyre cousins o Kenneth Forbes it seems an come from New
York to git him elected

What are they like

Theyre swell dressers Rast an nice appearin girls and mighty
sharp with their tongues They had a good meetin last night and
therell be another at the town hall next week

Pah Girls Forbes oughter be ashamed of himself to send a bunch o
girls out electioneerin I never heard of such an irregular thing What
do the boys say

Folks dont say much to me Rast They wouldnt you know But I guess
your game is up

He made no reply Here indeed was information of a startling
character And it came upon him like thunder out of a clear sky Yet the
thing might not be so important as Mrs Hopkins feared

Very thoughtfully he unfolded the morning paper and the next moment
uttered a roar of wrath and vexation Briggs was one of his standbys
and the Herald heretofore had always supported him yet here across
the first page were big black letters saying Vote for Forbes And
the columns were full of articles and paragraphs praising Forbes and
declaring that he could and would do more for the district than Hopkins

I must see Briggs muttered the Honorable Erastus Hes tryin to
make me put up that hundredan I guess Ill have to do it

He looked over the other newspapers which were heaped upon his desk in
the sittingroom and was disgusted to find all but one of the seven
papers in the district supporting Forbes Really the thing began to
look serious And he had only been absent a week

He had not much appetite for breakfast when Mrs Hopkins set it before
him But the Honorable Erastus was a born fighter and his discovery had
only dismayed him for a brief time Already he was revolving ways of
contesting this new activity in the enemys camp and decided that he
must talk with the boys at once

So he hurried away from the breakfast table and walked downtown Latham
was first on his route and he entered the drug store

Hullo Jim

Good morning Mr Hopkins Anything I can do for you asked the polite
druggist

Yes a lot Tell me what these fool girls are up to that are plugging
for Forbes Ive been away for a week you know

Cant say Mr Hopkins Im sure Business is pretty lively these days
and it keeps me hustling Ive no time for politics

But weve got to wake up Jim we Democrats or theyll give us a run
for our money

Oh this is a Republican district sir We cant hope to win it often
and especially in a case like this

Why not

Looks to me as if youd bungled things Hopkins But Im not interested
in this campaign Excuse me if theres nothing you want Ive got a
prescription to fill

Mr Hopkins walked out moodily It was very evident that Latham had
changed front But they had never been very staunch friends and he
could find a way to even scores with the little druggist later

Thompson was behind his desk at the general store when Hopkins walked
in

Look here said the Honorable Representative angrily whats been
going on in Elmwood Whats all this plugging for Forbes mean

Thompson gave him a sour look over the top of his desk

Addressin them remarks to me Rast

Yesto you Youve been loafing on your job old man and it wont
doit wont do at all You should have put a stop to these things What
right have these girls to interfere in a game like this

Oh shut up Rast

Thompson By crickey I wont stand this from you Goin back on me
eh

Im a Republication Rast

So you are said Mr Hopkins slowly his temper at white heat And
that mortgage is two months overdue

Go over to the bank and get your money then Its waiting for you
Hopkinsinterest and all Go and get it and let me alone Im busy

Perhaps the politician had never been so surprised in his life Anger
gave way to sudden fear and he scrutinized the averted countenance of
Thompson carefully

Whered you raise the money Thompson

None of your business I raised it

Forbes eh Forbes has bought you up I see Grateful fellow aint
youwhen I loaned you money to keep you from bankruptcy

You did Hopkins You made me your slave and threatened me every
minute unless I did all your dirty work Grateful Youve led me a
dogs life But Im through with you nowfor good and all

Hopkins turned and walked out without another word In the dentists
office Dr Squiers was sharpening and polishing his instruments

Hello Archie

Hello Rast Bout time you was getting back old man Were having a
big fight on our hands I can tell you

Tell me more said Mr Hopkins taking a chair with a sigh of relief
at finding one faithful friend Whats up Archie

An invasion of girls mostly They took us by surprise the other day
and started a campaign worthy of old political warhorses Theres some
shrewd politician behind them I know or they wouldnt have nailed us
up in our coffins with such businesslike celerity

Talk sense Archie What have they done What can they do Pah
Girls

Dont make a mistake Rast Thats what I did before I understood
When I heard that three girls were electioneering for Forbes I just
laughed Then I made a discovery Theyre young and rich and evidently
ladies Theyre pretty too and the men give in at the first attack
They dont try to roast you Thats their cleverness They tell what
Forbes can do with all his money if hes Representative and they
swear hell do it

Never mind said Hopkins easily Well win the men back again

But these girls are riding all over the country talking to farmers
wives and theyre organizing a womans political club The club is to
meet at Elmhurst and to be fed on the fat of the land so every woman
wants to belong Theyve got two expensive automobiles down from the
city with men to make them go and theyre spending money right and
left

Thats bad said Hopkins shifting uneasily for I havent much to
spend myself But most money is fooled away in politics When I spend a
cent it counts I can tell you

Youll have to spend some Rast to keep your end up Im glad youre
back for we Democrats have been getting demoralized Some of the boys
are out for Forbes already

Hopkins nodded busy with his thoughts

Ive talked with Latham But he didnt count And theyve bought up
Thompson What else theyve done I cant tell yet But one things
certain Doc well win out in a canter Im too old a rat to be caught
in a trap like this Ive got resources they dont suspect

I believe you Rast Theyve caught on to the outside fakes to win
votes but they dont know the inside deals yet

Youre right But I must make a bluff to offset their daylight
campaign so as not to lose ground with the farmers Theyre the ones
that count after all not the town people See here Doc I had an idea
something might happen and so I arranged with my breakfast food company
to let me paint a hundred signs in this neighborhood A hundred mind
you and that means a big laugh on Forbes and the good will of the
farmers who sell their spaces and not a cent out of my pocket Hows
that for a checkmate

Thats fine replied Dr Squiers Theres been considerable talk
about this sign business and Im told that at the meeting last night
one of the girls made a speech about it and said the farmers were being
converted and were now standing out for clean fences and barns

Thats all humbug

I think so myself These people are like a flock of sheep Get them
started a certain way and you cant head them off observed the
dentist

Then we must start them our way declared Hopkins Ive got the order
for these signs in my pocket and Ill have em painted all over the
district in a week Keep your eyes open Doc If weve got to fight we
wont shirk it but I dont look for much trouble from a parcel of
girls

Mr Hopkins was quite cheerful by this time for he had thought out the
situation and his fighting blood was up as he expressed it

He walked away whistling softly to himself and decided that he would go
over to the livery stable get a horse and buggy drive out into the
country and spend the day talking with the farmers

But when he turned the corner into the side street where the livery was
located he was astonished to find a row of horses and wagons lining each
side of the street and in each vehicle two men in white jumpers and
overalls The men were in charge of huge cans of paints assorted
brushes ladders scaffolds and other paraphernalia

There must have been twenty vehicles altogether and some of the rigs
were already starting out and driving briskly away in different
directions

Mr Hopkins was puzzled He approached one of the whiteoveralled men
who was loading cans of paint into a wagon and inquired

Who are you fellows

Sign painters answered the man with an amused look

Who do you work for

The Carson Advertising Sign Company of Cleveland

Oh I see replied Hopkins Got a big job in this neighborhood

Pretty big sir

Whos your foreman

Smith Hes in the livery office

Then the man climbed into his wagon and drove away and Hopkins turned
into the livery office A thinfaced man with sharp eyes was Talking
with the proprietor

Is this Mr Smith asked Hopkins

Yes

Of the Carson Advertising Sign Company

Yes

Well Ive got a big job for you My names Hopkins I want a hundred
big signs painted mighty quick

Sorry sir weve got all we can handle here for two or three weeks

Its got to be done quick or not at all Cant you send for more men

Weve got thirtyeight on this job and cant get any more for love or
money Had to send to Chicago for some of these

Rush job

Yes sir Youll have to excuse me Ive got to get started This is
only our second day and were pretty busy

Wait a minute called the bewildered Hopkins following Smith to his
buggy What concern is your firm doing all this painting for

A man named Merrick

Then the foreman drove away and Mr Hopkins was left greatly puzzled

MerrickMerrick he repeated I dont remember any big advertiser by
that name It must be some new concern Anyhow it all helps in my fight
against Forbes

He again returned to the livery office and asked for a rig

Everything out Mr Hopkins Ive hired everything to be had in town
for this signpainting gang

But Mr Hopkins was not to be balked As long as these signpainters
were doing missionary work for his cause among the farmers he decided
to drive over to Fairview and see the party leaders in that important
town So he went back to Dr Squierss house and borrowed the Doctors
horse and buggy

He drove along the turnpike for a time in silence Then it struck him
that there was a peculiar air of neatness about the places he passed
The barns and fences all seemed newly painted and he remembered that he
hadnt seen an advertising sign since he left town

A mile farther on he came upon a gang of the sign painters who with
their huge brushes were rapidly painting the entire length of a
weatherworn fence with white paint

Mr Hopkins reined in and watched them for a few moments

You signpainters dont seem to be getting any signs started he
observed

No replied one of the men laughing This is a peculiar job for our
firm to tackle Weve made a contract to paint out every sign in the
district

Paint em out

Yes cover them up with new paint and get rid of them

But how about the advertisers Dont they own the spaces now

They did but theyve all been bought up John Merrick owns the spaces
now and were working for John Merrick

Whos he

Some friend of Mr Forbes up at Elmhurst

Mr Hopkins was not a profane man but he said a naughty word And then
he cut his horse so fiercely with the whip that the poor beast gave a
neigh of terror and started down the road at a gallop




CHAPTER IX

OL WILL ROGERS


Beth had her folding table out in the rose garden where Kenneth was
working at his easel and while the boy painted she wrote her campaign
letters and editorials

At first Ken had resented the management of his campaign by his three
girl friends but soon he was grateful for their assistance and proud of
their talents It was at their own request that he refrained from any
active work himself merely appearing at the meetings they planned
where he made his speeches and impressed his hearers with his
earnestness He was really an excellent speaker and his youth and
enthusiasm counted much in his favor

He protested mildly when Louise invited the Womens Political Club to
meet at Elmhurst on Thursday afternoon but Mr Watson assured him that
this was an important play for popularity so he promised to meet them
Tables were to be spread upon the lawn for the late October weather was
mild and delightful and Louise planned to feed the women in a way that
they would long remember

Patsy had charge of the towns and Louise of the country districts but
Beth often aided Louise who had a great deal of territory to cover

The automobiles Uncle John had ordered sent down were a great assistance
to the girls and enabled them to cover twice as much territory in a day
as would have been done with horses

But although they worked so tirelessly and earnestly it was not all
plain sailing with the girl campaigners Yet though they met with many
rebuffs they met very little downright impertinence Twice Louise was
asked to leave a house where she had attempted to make a proselyte and
once a dog was set upon Beth by an irate farmer who resented her
automobile as much as he did her mission As for Patsy she was often
told in the towns that a young girl ought to be in better business than
mixing up in politics and she was sensitive enough once or twice to
cry over these reproaches when alone in her chamber But she maintained
a cheerful front and in truth all the girls enjoyed their work
immensely

While Beth and Kenneth were in the garden this sunny afternoon James
came to say that a man wanted to see one of the politics young ladies

Shall we send him about his business Beth asked the boy

Oh no we cant afford to lose a single vote Bring him here James
please said the girl

So presently a wizened little man in worn and threadbare garments his
hat in his hand came slowly into the garden His sunken cheeks were
covered with stubby gray whiskers his shoulders were stooped and bent
from hard work and his hands bore evidences of a life of toil Yet the
eyes he turned upon Beth as she faced him had a wistful and pleading
look that affected her strangely

Afternoon miss he said in a hesitating voice IIm Rogers miss
ol Will Rogers II spose you haint heerd o me before

Im glad to meet you Mr Rogers replied the girl in her pleasant
voice Have you come to see me about the election

Itsits sumpn bout the lection an then agin it aint But I run
the chanct o seein ye because were in desprit straits an Nell
advised that I hev a talk with ye Frank an outright says Nell
Dont beat about the bush says she Go right to th point an
theyll say yes or no

Beth laughed merrily and the boy smiled as he wielded his brush with
delicate strokes

Ye mustnt mind me miss said Will Rogers in a deprecating tone
ImIm sommut broke up an discouraged an aint th man I used to
be Nell knows that an she orter came herself but it jes made her
cry to think o it an so I says Ill come an do the best I kin

Beth was really interested now

Sit down on this bench Mr Rogers she said and Ill listen to
whatever you have to say

He sat down willingly bent forward as he rested upon the garden bench
and twirled his hat slowly in his hands

Taint easy ye know miss to say some things an this is one o the
hardest he began

Go on said Beth encouragingly for old Will had suddenly stopped
short and seemed unable to proceed

They say miss as you folks is aspendin uv a lot o money on this
election agittin votes an sich like he said in an altered tone

It costs a little to run a political campaign acknowledged Beth

They say moneys bein poured out liken waterto git votes he
persisted

Well Mr Rogers

Well thets how it started ye see Were so agonizin poor Nell
thought we orter git some o the money while its goin

The girl was much amused Such frankness was both unusual and
refreshing

Have you a vote to sell she asked

He did not answer at once but sat slowly twirling his hat

Thats jet what Nell thought yed ask he said finally an she
knew if ye did it was all up with our plan Guess Ill be goin miss

He rose slowly from his seat but the girl did not intend to lose any of
the fun this queer individual might yet furnish

Sit down Mr Rogers she said and tell me why you cant answer my
questions

I guess Ill hev to speak out an tell all said he his voice
trembling a little although I thought fer a minnit I could see my way
without I cant sell my vote miss cause Ive been plannin tvote
fer Mr Forbes anyhow But we wanted some uv th money thats being
wasted an we wanted it mighty bad

Why

Thets the hard part uv it miss but Im goin to tell you Did ye
ever hear o Lucy

No Mr Rogers

Lucys our girlthe ony chick er child we ever had Shes a pretty
girl is Lucy a good deal liken her mother wi the same high spirits
my Nell had afore she broke down Mostly Nell cries nowadays

Yes Go on

Lucy had a schoolin an we worked hard to give it her fer my land
aint much account nohow An when she grew up she had more boys comin
to see her than any gal this side o Fairview an one o em caught
Lucys fancy But she was too young to marry an she wanted to be
earnin money so she got a job workin fer Doc Squiers over to
Elmwood Hes the dentist there an Lucy helped with the housework an
kept the office slicked up an earned evry penny she got

He stopped here and looked vacantly around

Beth tried to help the old man

And then she asked softly

Then come the trouble miss One day ol Mis Squiers the Docs
mother missed a dimon ring She laid it on the mantel an it was
gone an she said as Lucy took it Lucy didnt take it an after
theyd tried to make my gal confess as she was a thief they give er
three days to hand up the ring or the money it was worth or else theyd
hev her arrested and sent t jail Lucy didnt take it ye know She
jes couldnt do sech a thing natcherly

I know said Beth sympathetically

So she comes home heartbroken an told us about it an we didnt hev
th money nuther It were sixty dollars they wanted or th ring an we
didnt hev neither of em

Of course not

Well Tom come over thet night to see Lucy hearin she was home
an

Who is Tom

Thets Tom Gates him thetbut Im comin to thet miss Tom always
loved Lucy an wanted to marry her but his folks is as poor as we are
so the young uns had to wait Tom worked at the mill over t
Fairviewthe big sawmill where they make the lumber an things

I know

He was the bookkeeper fer Tom had schoolin too an he took private
lessons in bookkeepin from ol Cheeseman So he had got hired at the
mill an had a likely job an was doin well An when Tom heerd about
Lucys trouble an thet she had only two days left before goin to
jail he up an says Ill get the money Lucy don you worry a bit
Oh Tom says she hev you got sixty dollars saved already Ive
got it Lucy says he an Ill go over tomorrow an pay Doc Squiers
Don you worry any more Forget all about it Well o course miss
that helped a lot Nell an Lucy both felt the disgrace of the thing
but it wouldnt be a public disgrace like goin to jail so we was all
mighty glad Tom had that sixty dollars

It was very fortunate said Beth filling in another pause

The nex day Tom were as good as his word He paid Doc Squiers an got
a receipt an giv it to Lucy Then we thought th trouble was over but
it had ony just begun Monday mornin Tom was arrested over t the mill
fer passin a forged check an gettin sixty dollars on it Lucy was
near frantic with grief She walked all the way to Fairview an they
let her see Tom in the jail He tol her it was true he forged th
check but he did it to save her He was a man an it wouldnt hurt fer
him to go to jail so much as it would a girl He said he was glad he did
it an didnt mind servin a sentence in prison I think miss as Tom
meant thetevry word uv it But Lucy broke down under the thing an
raved an cried an nuther Nell ner I could do anything with her She
said shed ruined Toms life an all thet an she didnt want to live
herself Then she took sick an Nell an I nursed her as careful as we
could Hown the wurld she ever got away we cant make out nohow

Did she get away asked the girl noting that the old mans eyes were
full of tears and his lips trembling

Yes miss Shes bin gone over ten days now an we dont even know
where to look fer her our girlour poor Lucy She aint right in her
head ye know or shed never a done it Shed never a left us like this
in th world Taint like our Lucy

Kenneth had turned around on his stool and was regarding old Will Rogers
earnestly brush and pallet alike forgotten Beth was trying to keep the
tears out of her own eyes for the old mans voice was even more
pathetic than his words

Ten days ago said Kenneth And she hasnt been found yet

We cant trace her anywhere an Nell has broke down at las an dont
do much but cry Its hard sirI cant bear to see Nell cry Shed
sich high sperrits onct

Wheres the boy Tom asked Kenneth somewhat gruffly

Hes in the jail yet waitin to be tried Court dont set till next

And where do you live Rogers

Five miles up the Fairview road Taint much of a placeNell says Ive

they jes done it I watched em an Nell says if we ony had th money
thet was wasted on thet paint an labor we might find our Lucy Its a

when it might save our poor crazy child I hope it aint wrong sir
but thets what I thought too So we laid plans fer me to come here

Have you got a horse asked Kenneth

Not now I owned one las year but he died on me an I cant get
another nohow

Did you walk here asked Beth

Yes miss o course Ive walked the hull county over atryin to find
Lucy I don mind the walking much

There was another pause while old Will Rogers looked anxiously at the
boy and the girl and they looked at each other Then Beth took out her
purse

I want to hire your services to help us in the election she said
briskly Ill furnish you a horse and buggy and you can drive around
and talk with people and try to find Lucy at the same time This twenty
dollars is to help you pay expenses You neednt account for it just
help us as much as you can

The old man straightened up and his eyes filled again

Nell said if it was a matter o charity I mustnt take a cent he
observed in a low voice

It isnt charity Its business And now that we know your story we
mean to help you find your girl Anyone would do that you know Tell
me what is Lucy like

Shes like Nell used to be

But we dont know your wife Describe Lucy as well as you can Is she
tall

Middlin miss

Light or dark

Heh

Middlin jes middlin miss

Well is she stout or thin

I should say sorter betwixt an between miss

How old is Lucy

Jes turned eighteen miss

Never mind Beth interrupted the boy you wont learn much from old
Wills description But well see what can be done tomorrow Call James
and have him sent home in the rig hes going to use It seems to me
youre disposing rather freely of my horses and carts

Yes Ken Youve nothing to say about your belongings just now But if
you object to this plan

I dont The girl must be found and her father is more likely to find
her than a dozen other searchers He shall have the rig and welcome

So it was that Will Rogers drove back to his heartbroken wife in a smart
topbuggy with twenty dollars in his pocket and a heart full of wonder
and thanksgiving




CHAPTER X

THE FORGED CHECK


Kenneth and Beth refrained from telling the other girls or Uncle John of
old Will Rogerss visit but they got Mr Watson in the library and
questioned him closely about the penalty for forging a check

It was a serious crime indeed Mr Watson told them and Tom Gates bade
fair to serve a lengthy term in states prison as a consequence of his
rash act

But it was a generous act too said Beth

I cant see it in that light said the old lawyer It was a
deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved I do not
doubt the girl was unjustly accused The Squierses are a selfish
hardfisted lot and the old lady especially is a well known virago
But they could not have proven a case against Lucy if she was innocent
and all their threats of arresting her were probably mere bluff So this
boy was doubly foolish in ruining himself to get sixty dollars to pay an
unjust demand

He was softhearted and impetuous said Beth and being in love he
didnt stop to count the cost

That is no excuse my dear declared Mr Watson Indeed there is
never an excuse for crime The young man is guilty and he must suffer
the penalty

Is there no way to save him asked Kenneth

If the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim
of the forged check then the young man would be allowed his freedom
But under the circumstances I doubt if such an arrangement could be
made

Were going to try it anyhow was the prompt decision

So as soon as breakfast was over the next morning Beth and Kenneth took
one of the automobiles the boy consenting unwillingly to this sort of
locomotion because it would save much time Fairview was twelve miles
away but by ten oclock they drew up at the county jail

They were received in the little office by a man named Markham who was
the jailer He was a roundfaced respectable appearing fellow but his
mood was distinctly unsociable

Want to see Tom Gates eh Well what for he demanded

We wish to talk with him answered Kenneth

Talk whats the good Youre no friend of Tom Gates I cant be
bothered this way anyhow

I am Kenneth Forbes of Elmhurst Im running for Representative on the
Republican ticket said Kenneth quietly

Oh say thats different observed Markham altering his demeanor
You mustnt mind my being gruff and grumpy Mr Forbes Ive just
stopped smoking a few days ago and its got on my nerves something
awful

May we see Gates at once asked Kenneth

Surely Ill take you to his cell myself Its just shocking how such
a little thing as stoppin smoking will rile up a fellow Come this way
please

They followed the jailer along a succession of passages

Smoked ever sence I was a boy you know an had to stop last week
because Doc said it would kill me if I didnt remarked the jailer
leading the way Sometimes Im that yearning for a smoke Im nearly
crazy an I dunno which is worst dyin one way or another This is
Gates cellthe best in the shop

He unlocked the door and called

Heres visitors Tom

Thank you Mr Markham replied a quiet voice as a young man came
forward from the dim interior of the cell How are you feeling today

Worse Tom worse n ever replied the jailer gloomily

Well stick it out old man dont give in

I wont Tom Smokin ll kill me sure an theres a faint hope o
livin through this struggle to give it up This visitor is Mr Forbes
of Elmhurst an the young lady is

Miss DeGraf said Kenneth noticing the boys face critically as he
stood where the light from the passage fell upon it Will you leave us
alone please Mr Markham

Surely Mr Forbes Youve got twenty minutes according to
regulations Ill come and get you then Sorry we havent any reception
room in the jail All visits has to be made in the cells

Then he deliberately locked Kenneth and Beth in with the forger and
retreated along the passage

Sit down please said Gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice
Theres a bench here

Weve come to inquire about your case Gates said Kenneth It seems
you have forged a check

Yes sir I plead guilty although Ive been told I ought not to
confess But the fact is that I forged the check and got the money and
Im willing to stand the consequences

Why did you do it asked Beth

He was silent and turned his face away

A fresh wholesome looking boy was Tom Gates with steady gray eyes an
intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth He was of
sturdy athletic build and dressed neatly in a suit that was of coarse
material but well brushed and cared for

Beth thought his appearance pleasing and manly Kenneth decided that he
was ill at ease and in a state of dogged selfrepression

We have heard something of your story said Kenneth and are
interested in it But there is no doubt you have acted very foolishly

Do you know Lucy sir asked the young man

No

Lucy is very proud The thing was killing her and I couldnt bear it
I didnt stop to think whether it was foolish or not I did it and Im
glad I did

You have made her still more unhappy said Beth gently

Yes shell worry about me I know Im disgraced for life but Ive
saved Lucy from any disgrace and shes young Shell forget me before
Ive served my term andand take up with some other young fellow

Would you like that asked Beth

No indeed he replied frankly But it will be best that way I had
to stand by Lucyshes so sweet and gentle and so sensitive I dont
say I did right I only say Id do the same thing again

Couldnt her parents have helped her inquired Kenneth

No Old Will is a fine fellow but poor and helpless since Mrs Rogers
had her accident

Oh did she have an accident asked Beth

Yes Didnt you know Shes blind

Her husband didnt tell us that said the girl

He was fairly prosperous before that for Mrs Rogers was an energetic
and sensible woman and kept old Will hard at work One morning she
tried to light the fire with kerosene and lost her sight Then Rogers
wouldnt do anything but lead her around and wait upon her and the
place went to rack and ruin

I understand now said Beth

Lucy could have looked after her mother said young Bates but old
Will was stubborn and wouldnt let her So the girl saw something must
be done and went to work Thats how all the trouble came about

He spoke simply but paced up and down the narrow cell in front of them
It was evident that his feelings were deeper than he cared to make
evident

Whose name did you sign to the check asked Kenneth

That of John E Marshall the manager of the mill He is supposed to
sign all the checks of the concern Its a stock company and rich I
was bookkeeper so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the
signature As regards my robbing the company Ill say that I saved them
a heavy loss one day I discovered and put out a fire that would have
destroyed the whole plant But Marshall never even thanked me He only
discharged the man who was responsible for the fire

How long ago were you arrested asked Beth

Its nearly two weeks now But Ill have a trial in a few days they
say My crime is so serious that the circuit judge has to sit on the
case

Do you know where Lucy is

Shes at home I suppose I havent heard from her since the day she
came here to see meright after my arrest

They did not think best to enlighten him at that time It was better for
him to think the girl unfeeling than to know the truth

Im going to see Mr Marshall said Kenneth and discover what I can
do to assist you

Thank you sir It wont be much but Im grateful to find a friend
Im guilty you know and theres no one to blame but myself

They left him then for the jailer arrived to unlock the door and
escort them to the office

Toms a very decent lad remarked the jailer on the way He aint a
natural criminal you know just one o them that gives in to temptation
and is foolish enough to get caught Ive seen lots of that kind in my
day You dont smoke do you Mr Forbes

No Mr Markham

Then dont begin it or if you do never try to quit Itsits
awful it is And it ruins a mans disposition

The mill was at the outskirts of the town It was a busy place perhaps
the busiest in the whole of the Eighth District and in it were employed
a large number of men The office was a small brick edifice separated
from the main buildings in which the noise of machinery was so great
that one speaking could scarcely be heard The manager was in Kenneth
and Beth learned but could not see them until he had signed the letters
he had dictated for the noon mail

So they sat on a bench until a summons came to admit them to Mr
Marshalls private office

He looked up rather ungraciously but motioned them to be seated

Mr Forbes of Elmhurst he asked glancing at the card Kenneth had
sent in

Yes sir

Ive been bothered already over your election campaign resumed the
manager arranging his papers in a bored manner Some girl has been
here twice to interview my men and I have refused to admit her You may
as well understand sir that I stand for the Democratic candidate and
have no sympathy with your side

That doesnt interest me especially sir answered Kenneth smiling
Im not electioneering just now Ive come to talk with you about young
Gates

Oh Well sir what about him

Im interested in the boy and want to save him from prosecution

Hes a forger Mr Forbes a deliberate criminal

I admit that But hes very young and his youth is largely responsible
for his folly

He stole my money

It is true Mr Marshall

And he deserves a term in states prison

I agree to all that Nevertheless I should like to save him said
Kenneth His trial has not yet taken place and instead of your
devoting considerable of your valuable time appearing against him it
would be much simpler to settle the matter right here and now

In what way Mr Forbes

Ill make your money loss good

It has cost me twice sixty dollars in annoyance

I can well believe it sir Ill pay twice sixty dollars for the
delivery to me of the forged check and the withdrawal of the
prosecution

And the costs

Ill pay all the costs besides

Youre foolish Why should you do all this

I have my own reasons Mr Marshall Please look at the matter from a
business standpoint If you send the boy to prison you will still suffer
the loss of the money By compromising with me you can recover your loss
and are paid for your annoyance

Youre right Give me a check for a hundred and fifty and Ill turn
over to you the forged check and quash further proceedings

Kenneth hesitated a moment He detested the grasping disposition that
would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help young
Gates He had hoped to find Mr Marshall a man of sympathy but the
manager was as cold as an icicle

Beth uneasy at his silence nudged him

Pay it Ken she whispered

Very well Mr Marshall said he I accept your terms

The check was written and handed over and Marshall took the forged
check from his safe and delivered it with the other papers in the case
to Mr Forbes He also wrote a note to his lawyer directing him to
withdraw the prosecution

Kenneth and Beth went away quite happy with their success and the
manager stood in his little window and watched them depart There was a
grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face

Of all the easy marks I ever encountered muttered Mr Marshall this
young Forbes is the easiest Why hes a fool thats what he is He
might have had that forged check for the face of it if hed been sharp
You wouldnt catch Rast Hopkins doing such a fool stunt Not in a
thousand years

Meantime Beth was pressing Kenneths arm as she sat beside him and
saying happily

Im so glad Kenso glad And to think we can save all that misery and
despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars And now we must
find the girl

Yes replied the boy cheerfully we must find Lucy




CHAPTER XI

A MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE


A woman was sitting in a low room engaged in knitting Her feet were
stretched out toward a small fire that smouldered in an open hearth She
wore a simple calico gown neat and wellfitting and her face bore
traces of much beauty that time and care had been unable wholly to
efface

Suddenly she paused in her work her head turned slightly to one side to
listen

Come in sir she called in a soft but distinct voice come in
miss

So Kenneth and Beth entered at the halfopen porch door and advanced
into the room

Is this Mrs Rogers asked Beth looking at the woman curiously The
womans eyes were closed but the lashes fell in graceful dark curves
over her withered cheeks The girl wondered how she had been able to
know her visitors sex so accurately

Yes I am Mrs Rogers said the sweet sad voice And I think you are
one of the young ladies from Elmhurstperhaps the one Will talked to

You are right Mrs Rogers I am Elizabeth DeGraf

And your companionis it Mr Forbes the woman asked

Yes madam replied Kenneth astonished to find Wills wife speaking
with so much refinement and gracious ease

You are very welcome Will you please find seats My affliction renders
me helpless as you may see

We are very comfortable I assure you Mrs Rogers said Beth We
have come to ask if you have heard anything of your daughter

Not a word as yet Miss DeGraf Will is out with the horse and buggy
doing his best to get information But Lucy has been gone so long now
that I realize it will be difficult to find her if indeed the poor
girl has notis not

Her voice broke

Oh you dont fear that do you Mrs Rogers asked Beth quickly

I fear anythingeverything wailed the poor creature the tears
streaming from between her closed lids My darling was frantic with
grief and she couldnt bear the humiliation and disgrace of her
position Will told you didnt he

Yes of course But it wasnt so bad Mrs Rogers it wasnt a
desperate condition by any means

With poor Tom in prison for yearsand just for trying to help her

Tom isnt in prison you know any more said Beth quietly He has
been released

Released When

Last evening His fault has been forgiven and he is now free

The woman sat silent for a time Then she asked

You have done this Mr Forbes

Why Miss DeGraf and I assisted perhaps The young man is not really
bad and

Toms a fine boy she cried with eagerness Hes honest and true
Mr Forbeshe is indeed

I think so said Kenneth

If he wasnt my Lucy would never have loved him He had a bright future
before him sir and thats why my child went mad when he ruined his
life for her sake

Was she mad do you think asked Beth softly

She must have been said the mother sadly Lucy was a sensible girl
and until this thing happened she was as bright and cheerful as the day
is long But she is very sensitiveshe inherited that from me I
thinkand Toms action drove her distracted At first she raved and
rambled incoherently and Will and I feared brain fever would set in
Then she disappeared in the night without leaving a word or message for
us which was unlike herand weve never heard a word of her since
Thethe river has a strange fascination for people in that condition
At times in my life it has almost drawn me into its depthsand I am
not mad I have never been mad

Let us hope for the best Mrs Rogers said Beth Somehow I have an
idea this trouble will all turn out well in the end

Have you asked the woman earnestly

Yes It all came about through such a little thingmerely an unjust
accusation

The little things are the ones that ruin lives she said Will you
let me tell you something of myself You have been so kind to us my
dear that I feel you ought to know

I shall be glad to know whatever you care to tell me said Beth
simply

I am the wife of a poor farmer began the woman speaking softly and
with some hesitation but gaining strength as she proceeded As a girl
I was considered attractive and my father was a man of great wealth and
social standing We lived in Baltimore Then I fell in love with a young
man who after obtaining my promise to marry him found some one he
loved better and carelessly discarded me As I have said I have a
sensitive nature In my girlhood I was especially susceptible to any
slight and this young mans heartless action made it impossible for me
to remain at home and face the humiliation he had thrust upon me My
father was a hard man and demanded that I marry the man he had himself
chosen but I resented this command and ran away My mother had passed
on long before and there was nothing to keep me at home I came west
and secured a position to teach school in this county and for a time I
was quite contented and succeeded in living down my disappointment I
heard but once from my father He had married again and disinherited me
He forbade me to ever communicate with him again

At that time Will Rogers was one of the most promising and manly of the
country lads around here He was desperately in love with me and at
this period when I seemed completely cut off from my old life and the
future contained no promise I thought it best to wear out the remainder
of my existence in the seclusion of a farmhouse I put all the past
behind me and told Will Rogers I would marry him and be a faithful
wife but that my heart was dead He accepted me on that condition and
it was not until after we were married some time that my husband
realized how impossible it would ever be to arouse my affection Then he
lost courage and became careless and reckless When our child cameour
LucyWill was devoted to her and the baby wakened in me all the old
passionate capacity to love Lucy drew Will and me a little closer
together but he never recovered his youthful ambition He was a
disappointed man and went from bad to worse I dont say Will hasnt
always been tender and true to me and absolutely devoted to Lucy But
he lost all hope of being loved as he loved me and the disappointment
broke him down He became an old man early in life and his lack of
energy kept us very poor I used to take in sewing before the accident
to my eyes and that helped a good deal to pay expenses But now I am
helpless and my husband devotes all his time to me although I beg him
to work the farm and try to earn some money

I wouldnt have minded the poverty I wouldnt mind being blind even
if Lucy had been spared to me I have had to bear so much in my life
that I could even bear my childs death But to have her disappear and
not know what has become of herwhether she is living miserably or
lying at the bottom of the riverit is this that is driving me
distracted

Kenneth and Beth remained silent for a time after Mrs Rogers had
finished her tragic story for their hearts were full of sympathy for
the poor woman It was hard to realize that a refined beautiful and
educated girl had made so sad a mistake of her life and suffered so many
afflictions as a consequence That old Will had never been a fitting
mate for his wife could readily be understood and yet the man was still
devoted to his helpless unresponsive spouse The fault was not his

The boy and the girl both perceived that there was but one way they
could assist Mrs Rogers and that was to discover what had become of
her child

Was Lucy like you or did she resemble her father asked Beth

She isshe was very like me when I was young replied the woman
There is a photograph of her on the wall there between the windows but
it was taken five years ago when she was a child Now she isshe was
eighteen and a welldeveloped young woman

Ive been looking at the picture said Kenneth

And you mustnt think of her as dead Mrs Rogers said Beth
pleadingly Im sure she is alive and that we shall find her Were
going right to work and everything possible shall be done to trace your
daughter Dont worry please Be as cheerful as you can and leave the
search to us

The woman sighed

Will believes she is alive too she said He cant sleep or rest
till he finds her for my husband loves her as well as I do But
sometimes I feel its wicked to hope she is alive I know what she
suffers for I suffered myself and life isnt worth living when
despair and disappointment fills it

I cannot see why Lucy shouldnt yet be happy protested Beth Tom
Gates is now free and can begin life anew

His trouble will follow him everywhere said Mrs Rogers with
conviction Who will employ a bookkeeper or even a clerk who has been
guilty of forgery

I think I shall give him employment replied Kenneth

You Mr Forbes

Yes Im not afraid of a boy who became a criminal to save the girl he
loved

But all the world knows of his crime she exclaimed

The world forgets these things sooner than you suppose he answered
I need a secretary and in that position Tom Gates will quickly be able
to live down this unfortunate affair And if he turns out as well as I
expect he will soon be able to marry Lucy and give her a comfortable
home So now nothing remains but to find your girl and well try to do
that I assure you

Mrs Rogers was crying softly by this time but it was from joy and
relief When they left her she promised to be as cheerful as possible
and to look on the bright side of life

I cant thank you she said so I wont try You must know how
grateful we are to you

As Beth and Kenneth drove back to Elmhurst they were both rather silent
for they had been strongly affected by the scene at the farmhouse

Its so good of you Ken to take Tom Gates into your employ said the
girl pressing her cousins arm And Im sure hell be true and
grateful

I really need him Beth said the boy There is getting to be too
much correspondence for Mr Watson to attend to and I ought to relieve
him of many other details Its a good arrangement and Im glad I
thought of it

They had almost reached Elmhurst when they met the Honorable Erastus
Hopkins driving along the road On the seat beside him was a young girl
and as the vehicles passed each other Beth gave a start and clung to the
boys arm

Oh Ken she cried did you see Did you see that

Yes its my respected adversary

But the girl Its LucyIm sure its Lucy Shes the living image of
Mrs Rogers Stopstopand lets go back

Nonsense Beth said the boy It cant be

But it is Im sure it is

I saw the girl he said She was laughing gaily and talking with the
Honorable Erastus Is that your idea of the mad brokenhearted Lucy
Rogers

Nno She was laughing Ken I noticed it

And she wasnt unhappy a bit You mustnt think that every pretty girl
with dark eyes you meet is Lucy Rogers you know And theres another
thing

What Ken

Any companion of Mr Hopkins can be easily traced

Thats true answered the girl thoughtfully I must have been
mistaken she added with a sigh




CHAPTER XII

BETH MEETS A REBUFF


The campaign was now growing warm Mr Hopkins had come to realize that
he had the fight of his life on his hands and that defeat meant his
political ruin Closefisted and miserly as he was no one knew so well
as the Honorable Erastus how valuable this position of Representative
was to him in a financial way and that by winning reelection he could
find means to reimburse himself for all he had expended in the fight
So to the surprise of the Democratic Committee and all his friends Mr
Hopkins announced that he would oppose Forbess aggressive campaign with
an equal aggressiveness and spend as many dollars in doing so as might
be necessary

He did not laugh at his opponents any longer To himself he admitted
their shrewdness and activity and acknowledged that an experienced head
was managing their affairs

One of Mr Hopkinss first tasks after calling his faithful henchmen
around him was to make a careful canvass of the voters of his district
to see what was still to be accomplished

This canvass was quite satisfactory for final report showed only about
a hundred majority for Forbes The district was naturally Republican by
six hundred majority and Hopkins had previously been elected by a
plurality of eightythree so that all the electioneering of the girl
politicians and the expenditure of vast sums of money in painting
fences and barns buying newspapers and flaunting Forbes banners in the
breezes had not cut into the Hopkins following to any serious extent

But to offset this cheering condition the Democratic agents who made
the canvass reported that there was an air of uncertainty throughout the
district and that many of those who declared for Hopkins were lukewarm
and fainthearted and might easily be induced to change their votes
This was what must be prevented The weakkneed contingency must be
strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or
another secured from the opposition

The Democratic Committee figured out a way to do this Monroe County
where both Forbes and Hopkins resided was one of the Democratic
strongholds of the State The portions of Washington and Jefferson
Counties included in the Eighth District were as strongly Republican
and being more populous gave to the district its natural Republican
majority On the same ticket that was to elect a Representative to the
State Legislature was the candidate for Sheriff of Monroe County A man
named Cummings was the Republican and Seth Reynolds the liveryman the
Democratic nominee Under ordinary conditions Reynolds was sure to be
elected but the Committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to elect
Hopkins The Democrats would bargain with the Republicans to vote for
the Republican Sheriff if the Republicans would vote for the Democratic
Representative This trading votes which was often done was
considered by the politicians quite legitimate The only thing necessary
was to fix Seth Reynolds and this Hopkins arranged personally The
office of Sheriff would pay about two thousand a year and this sum
Hopkins agreed to pay the liveryman and so relieve him of all the
annoyance of earning it

Reynolds saw the political necessity of this sacrifice and consented
readily to the arrangement Mr Cummings who was to profit by the deal
was called to a private consultation and agreed to slaughter Kenneth
Forbes to secure votes for himself It was thought that this clever
arrangement would easily win the fight for Hopkins

But the Honorable Erastus had no intention of taking chances or
monkeying with fate as he tersely expressed it Every scheme known to
politicians must be worked and none knew the intricate game better than
Hopkins This was why he held several long conferences with his friend
Marshall the manager at the mill And this was why Kenneth and Beth
discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy Mr Hopkins
had picked her up from the path leading from the rear gate of the
Elmhurst grounds and she had given him accurate information concerning
the movements of the girl campaigners The description she gave of the
coming reception to the Womans Political League was so humorous and
diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the
young people passed them and thus Mr Hopkins failed to notice who the
occupants of the other vehicle were

He talked for an hour with the girl gave her explicit instructions
thrust some money into her hand and then drove her back to the bend in
the path whence she quickly made her way up to the great house

Louise was making great preparations to entertain the Womans Political
League an organization she had herself founded the members of which
were wives of farmers in the district These women were flattered by the
attention of the young lady and had promised to assist in electing Mr
Forbes Louise hoped for excellent results from this organization and
wished the entertainment to be so effective in winning their goodwill
that they would work earnestly for the cause in which they were
enlisted

Patsy and Beth supported their cousin loyally and assisted in the
preparations The Fairview band was engaged to discourse as much harmony
as it could produce and the resources of the great house were taxed to
entertain the guests Tables were spread on the lawn and a dainty but
substantial repast was to be served

The day of the entertainment was as sunny and mild as heart could
desire

By ten oclock the farm wagons began to drive up loaded with women and
children for all were invited except the grown men This was the first
occasion within a generation when such an entertainment had been given
at Elmhurst and the only one within the memory of man where the
neighbors and country people had been invited guests So all were eager
to attend and enjoy the novel event

The gardens and grounds were gaily decorated with Chinese and Japanese
lanterns streamers and Forbes banners There were great tanks of
lemonade and tables covered with candies and fruits for the children
and maids and other servants distributed the things and looked after the
comfort of the guests The band played briskly and before noon the
scene was one of great animation A speakers stand profusely
decorated had been erected on the lawn and hundreds of folding chairs
provided for seats The attendance was unexpectedly large and the girls
were delighted foreseeing great success for their fte

We ought to have more attendants Beth said Louise approaching her
cousin Wont you run into the house and see if Martha cant spare one
or two more maids

Beth went at once and found the housekeeper in her little room Martha
was old and somewhat feeble in body but her mind was still active and
her long years of experience in directing the household at Elmhurst made
her a very useful and important personage She was very fond of the
young ladies whom she had known when Aunt Jane was the mistress here
and Beth was her especial favorite

So she greeted the girl cordially and said

Maids My dear I havent another one to give you and my legs are too
tottering to be of any use I counted on Eliza Parsons the new girl I
hired for the linen room and to do mending but Eliza said she had a
headache this morning and couldnt stand the sun So I let her off But
she didnt seem very sick to me

Perhaps she is better and will help us until after the luncheon is
served said Beth Where is she Martha Ill go and ask her

Id better show you the way miss Shes in her own room

The housekeeper led the way and Beth followed When she rapped upon the
door a sweet quiet voice said

Come in

The girl entered and gave an involuntary cry of surprise Standing
before her was the young girl she had seen riding with Mr Hopkinsthe
girl she had declared to be the missing daughter of Mrs Rogers

For a moment Beth stood staring while the new maid regarded her with
composure and a slight smile upon her beautiful face She was dressed in
the regulation costume of the maids at Elmhurst a plain black gown with
white apron and cap

II beg your pardon said Beth with a slight gasp for the likeness
to Mrs Rogers was something amazing Arent you Lucy Rogers

The maid raised her eyebrows with a gesture of genuine surprise Then
she gave a little laugh and replied

No Miss Beth Im Elizabeth Parsons

But it cant be protested the girl How do you know my name and why
havent I seen you here before

Im not a very important person at Elmhurst replied Eliza in a
pleasant even tone I obtained the situation only a few days ago I
attend to the household mending you know and care for the linen But
one cant be here without knowing the names of the young ladies so I
recognize you as Miss Beth one of Mr Forbess cousins

You speak like an educated person said Beth wonderingly Where is
your home

For the first time the maid seemed a little confused and her gaze
wandered from the face of her visitor

Will you excuse my answering that question she asked

It is very simple and natural persisted Beth Why cannot you answer
it

Excuse me please II am not well today I have a headache

She sat down in a rocking chair and clasping her hands in her lap
rocked slowly back and forth

Im sorry said Beth I hoped you would be able to assist me on the
lawn There are so many people that we cant give them proper
attention

Eliza Parsons shook her head

I am not able she declared I abhor crowds Theythey excite me in
some way and II cant bear them You must excuse me

Beth looked at the strange girl without taking the hint to retire
Somehow she could not rid herself of the impression that whether or not
she was mistaken in supposing Eliza to be the missing Lucy she had
stumbled upon a sphinx whose riddle was well worth solving

But Eliza bore the scrutiny with quiet unconcern She even seemed mildly
amused at the attention she attracted Beth was a beautiful girlthe
handsomest of the three cousins by far yet Eliza surpassed her in
natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact Her manner was neither
independent nor assertive but rather one of wellbred composure and
calm reliance Beth felt that she was intruding and knew that she ought
to go yet some fascination held her to the spot Her eyes wandered to
the maids hands However her features and form might repress any
evidence of nervousness these hands told a different story The thin
fingers clasped and unclasped in little spasmodic jerks and belied the
quiet smile upon the face above them

I wish said Beth slowly I knew you

A sudden wave of scarlet swept over Elizas face She rose quickly to
her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her
breath

I wish I knew myself she cried fiercely Why do you annoy me in
this manner What am I to you Will you leave me alone in my own room
or must I go away to escape you

I will go said Beth a little frightened at the passionate appeal

Eliza closed the door behind her with a decided slam and a key clicked
in the lock The sound made Beth indignant and she hurried back to
where her cousins were busy with the laughing chattering throng of
visitors




CHAPTER XIII

THE BOOMERANG


The lawn fte was a tremendous success and every farmers wife was
proud of her satin badge bearing the monogram W P L and the
words FORBES FOR REPRESENTATIVE

Certain edibles such as charlotterusse Spanish cream wine jellies
and mousses to say nothing of the caviars and anchovies were wholly
unknown to them but they ate the dainties with a wise disregard of
their inexperience and enjoyed them immensely

The old butler was a general in his way and in view of the fact that
the staff of servants at Elmhurst was insufficient to cope with such a
throng he allowed Louise to impress several farmers daughters into
service and was able to feed everyone without delay and in an abundant
and satisfactory manner

After luncheon began the speechmaking interspersed with music by the
band

Louise made the preliminary address and although her voice was not
very strong the silent attention of her hearers permitted her to be
generally understood

She called attention to the fact that this campaign was important
because it promised more beautiful and attractive houses for the farmers
and townsmen alike

We had all grown so accustomed to advertising signs she said that
we failed to notice how thick they were becoming or how bold and
overpowering From a few scattered announcements on fence boards they
had crowded themselves into more prominent places until the barns and
sheds and the very rocks were daubed with glaring letters asking us to
buy the medicines soaps tobaccos and other wares the manufacturers
were anxious to sell Every country road became an advertising avenue
Scarcely a country house was free from signs of some sort Yet the
people tamely submitted to this imposition because they knew no way to
avoid it When Mr Forbes began his campaign to restore the homesteads
to their former beauty and dignity a cry was raised against him But
this was because the farmers did not understand how much this reform
meant to them So we gave them an object lesson We painted out all the
signs in this section at our own expense that you might see how much
more beautiful your homes are without them We believe that none of you
will ever care to allow advertising signs on your property again and
that the quiet refinement of this part of the country will induce many
other places to follow our example until advertisers are forced to
confine themselves to newspapers magazines and circulars their only
legitimate channels This much Mr Forbes has already done for you and
he will now tell you what else if he is elected he proposes to do

Kenneth then took the platform and was welcomed with a hearty cheer He
modestly assured them that a Representative in the State Legislature
could accomplish much good for his district if he honestly desired to do
so That was what a Representative was forto represent his people It
was folly to elect any man who would forget that duty and promote only
his own interests through the position of power to which the people had
appointed him Mr Forbes admitted that he had undertaken this campaign
because he was opposed to offensive advertising signs but now he had
become interested in other issues and was anxious to be elected so that
he could carry on the work of reform They needed more schoolhouses for
their children and many other things which he hoped to provide as their
Representative

During this oration Beth happened to glance up at the house and her
sharp eyes detected the maid Eliza standing shielded behind the
halfclosed blind of an upper window and listening to as well as
watching the proceedings below Then she remembered how the girl had
been laughing and talking with Mr Hopkins when she first saw her and
with sudden dismay realized that Eliza was a spy in the service of the
enemy

Her first impulse was to denounce the maid at once and have her
discharged but the time was not opportune so she waited until the
festivities were ended

It had been a great day for the families of the neighboring farmers and
they drove homeward in the late afternoon full of enthusiasm over the
royal manner in which they had been entertained and admiration for the
girls who had provided the fun and feasting Indeed there were more
kindly thoughts expressed for the inhabitants of Elmhurst than had ever
before been heard in a single day in the history of the county and the
great and the humble seemed more closely drawn together

When the last guest had departed Beth got her cousins and Kenneth
together and told them of her discovery of the spy

Kenneth was at first greatly annoyed and proposed to call Martha and
have the false maid ejected from the premises but Patsys wise little
head counselled caution in handling the matter

Now that we know her secret she said the girl cannot cause us more
real harm and there may be a way to circumvent this unscrupulous
Hopkins and turn the incident to our own advantage Lets think it over
carefully before we act

Theres another thing said Beth supporting her cousin Im
interested in the mystery surrounding the girl I now think I was wrong
in suspecting her to be the lost Lucy Rogers but there is surely some
romance connected with her and she is not what she seems to be Id
like to study her a little

It was absurd to connect her with Lucy Rogers observed Kenneth for
there is nothing in her character to remind one of the unhappy girl

Except her looks added Beth Shes the living image of Mrs Rogers

That isnt important replied Louise It is probably a mere
coincidence None of us have ever seen the real Lucy and she may not
resemble her mother at all

Mrs Rogers claims she does said Beth But anyhow I have a wish to
keep this girl at the house where I can study her character

Then keep her my dear decided Kenneth Ill set a couple of men to
watch the gates and if she goes out well know whom she meets The most
she can do is to report our movements to Mr Hopkins and theres no
great harm in that

So the matter was left for the time and as if to verify Beths
suspicions Eliza was seen to leave the grounds after dusk and meet Mr
Hopkins in the lane They conversed together a few moments and then the
maid calmly returned and went to her room

The next day Mr Hopkins scattered flaring handbills over the district
which were worded in a way designed to offset any advantage his opponent
had gained from the lawn fte of the previous day They read Hopkins
the Man of the Times is the Champion of the Signs of the Times Forbes
who never earned a dollar in his life but inherited his money is
trying to take the dollars out of the pockets of the farmers by
depriving them of the income derived by selling spaces for advertising
signs He is robbing the farmers while claiming he wants to beautify
their homes The farmers cant eat beauty they want money Therefore
they are going to vote for the Honorable Erastus Hopkins for
Representative Then followed an estimate of the money paid the farmers
of the district by the advertisers during the past five years amounting
to several thousands of dollars in the aggregate The circular ended in
this way Hopkins challenges Forbes to deny these facts Hopkins is
willing to meet Forbes before the public at any time and place he may
select to settle this argument in joint debate

The girls accepted the challenge at once Within two days every farmer
had received a notice that Mr Forbes would meet Mr Hopkins at the
Fairview Opera House on Saturday afternoon to debate the question as to
whether advertising signs brought good or evil to the community

The campaign was now getting hot Because of the activity of the
opposing candidates every voter in the district had become more or less
interested in the fight and people were taking one side or the other
with unusual earnestness

Mr Hopkins was not greatly pleased that his challenge had been
accepted He had imagined that the Forbes party would ignore it and
leave him the prestige of crowing over his opponents timidity But he
remembered how easily he had subdued Kenneth at the schoolhouse meeting
before the nominations and had no doubt of his ability to repeat the
operation

He was much incensed against the girls who were working for Kenneth
Forbes for he realized that they were proving an important factor in
the campaign He even attributed to them more than they deserved for
Uncle Johns telling activities were so quietly conducted that he was
personally lost sight of entirely by Mr Hopkins

Mr Hopkins had therefore become so enraged that against the advice of
his friends he issued a circular sneering at Women in Politics The
newspapers having been subsidized by the opposition so early in the
game Mr Hopkins had driven to employ the circular method of
communicating with the voters Scarcely a day passed now that his corps
of distributors did not leave some of his literature at every dwelling
in the district

His tirade against the girls was neither convincing nor in good taste
He asked the voters if they were willing to submit to petticoat
government and permit a lot of boardingschool girls with more
boldness than modesty to dictate the policies of the community These
frizzleheaded females continued the circular are trying to make
your wives and daughters as rebellious and unreasonable as they are
themselves but no man of sense will permit a woman to influence his
vote It is a disgrace to this district that Mr Forbes allows his
girlish campaign to be run by a lot of misses who should be at home
darning stockings or if they were not able to do that practicing
their musiclessons

Good exclaimed shrewd Miss Patsy when she read this circular If
Im not much mistaken Mr Hopkins has thrown a boomerang Every woman
who attended the fte is now linked with us as an ally and every one of
them will resent this foolish circular

Im sorry said Kenneth that you girls should be forced to endure
this I feared something like it when you insisted on taking a hand in
the game

But they laughed at him and at Mr Hopkins and declared they were not
at all offended

One cannot touch pitch without being defiled said Mr Watson
gravely and politics as Mr Hopkins knows it is little more than
pitch

I cannot see that there is anything my girls have done to forfeit
respect and admiration asserted Uncle John stoutly To accuse them
of boldness or immodesty is absurd They have merely gone to work in a
businesslike manner and used their wits and commonsense in educating
the voters Really my dears Im more proud of you today than Ive ever
been before he concluded

And Uncle John was right There had been no loss of dignity by any one
of the three and their evident refinement as well as their gentleness
and good humor had until now protected them from any reproach It had
remained for Mr Hopkins to accuse them and his circular had a wide
influence in determining the issue of the campaign




CHAPTER XIV

LUCYS GHOST


Kenneth had sent word to Tom Gates asking the young man to come to
Elmhurst but it was not until two days after the lawn party that Tom
appeared and asked permission to see Mr Forbes

Beth and Louise were with Kenneth at the time and were eager to remain
during the interview so the young man was shown into the library

Beth could scarcely recognize in him the calm and cheerful Tom Gates
they had visited in the county jail for his face was drawn with care
and anxiety eyes were bloodshot and his former neat appearance was
changed to one careless and untidy

Kenneth scrutinized him closely

What have you been up to Tom he asked

Ive been searching for Lucy sir night and day I havent slept a
wink since I heard the awful news of her sickness and escape Where do
you think she can be sir

His question was full of agonized entreaty and his manner pitifully
appealing

I dont know answered Kenneth Where have you searched

Everywhere sir that she might be likely to go Ive inquired in every
town and along every road leading out of the county She didnt take a
train because poor Lucy hadnt any moneyand Ive asked at all the
stations Andandalong the river they say no girl answering her
description has been seen

Its strange remarked Kenneth thoughtfully while the girls regarded
the youth with silent sympathy

If you knew Lucy sir youd realize how strange it is went on young
Gates earnestly She was such a gentle shrinking girl as shy and
retiring as a child And she never did a thing that would cause anyone
the least worry or unhappiness But she was out of her head sir and
didnt know what she was about That was the reason she went away And
from the moment she left her home all trace of her was lost

One would think observed Kenneth that a poor demented girl
wandering about the country would be noticed by scores of people Did
she take any clothing with her

Only the dress she had on sir and not even a hat or a shawl

What was her dress like asked Beth quickly

It was a light grey in color and plainly made She wore a white
collar but that is all we can be certain she had on You see her mother
is blind and old Will doesnt observe very closely

Does Lucy resemble her mother inquired Beth

Very much miss She was a beautiful girl everyone acknowledged And
its all my faultall my fault I thought to save her and drove her
mad instead

You might have known that declared Kenneth A girl of her character
sensitive to a fault would be greatly shocked to find the man she loved
a criminal

It was for her sake

That is a poor excuse If you had waited Lucy would have proved her
innocence

They threatened to arrest her sir It would have killed her

They wouldnt dare arrest her on suspicion

The Squierses would dare do anything You dont know old Mrs Squiers

I know the law sir and in any event it was a foolish thing as well
as criminal to forge a check to get the money they demanded

You are right sir replied Tom Gates despondently It was foolish
and criminal I wouldnt mind my own punishment but it drove my Lucy
mad

See here said Kenneth sternly you are getting morbid young man
and pretty soon youll be mad yourself If Lucy is found do you want her
to see you in this condition

Can she be found sir do you think

We are trying to find her replied Kenneth You have failed it
seems and Will Rogers had failed Ive had one of the cleverest
detectives of Chicago trying to find her for the last three days

Oh Kenneth exclaimed Beth I didnt know that How good of you

It must have been the detective that came to see Mrs Rogers said
Tom musingly She told me a strange man had been there from Mr
Forbes to inquire all about Lucy

Yes he makes a report to me every evening remarked Kenneth and Mr
Burke says this is the most mystifying case he has ever encountered So
far there isnt a clew to follow But you may rest assured that what any
man can do Burke will do

Im so grateful sir said Tom

Then you must show it by being a man and not by giving way to your
trouble in this foolish manner

Ill try sir now that theres something to hope for

Theres a good deal to hope for Despair wont help you You must go to
work

I will It wont be very easy to get work for Ive disgraced myself in
this neighborhood and I cant leave here till something is known of
Lucys fate But Ill do somethingany kind of workif I can get it

I need someone to assist me in my correspondence said Kenneth Would
you like to be my secretary

Me Mr Forbesme

Yes Tom Ill pay you twenty dollars a week to start with and more if
you serve me faithfully And youll board here of course

Then Tom Gates broke down and began to cry like a child although he
tried hard to control himself

Youyou must forgive me Mr Forbes he said penitently IIve
been without sleep for so long that I havent any nerves left

Then you must go to sleep now and get a good rest He turned to Beth
Will you see Martha he asked and have her give Tom Gates a room

She went on her errand at once and gradually the young man recovered
his composure

I can do typewriting and stenography Mr Forbes he said and I can
keep accounts Ill serve you faithfully sir

Well talk of all this by and by Tom replied Kenneth kindly Just
now you must have some sleep and get your strength back And dont worry
about Lucy Burke will do everything that can be done and I am
confident he will be able to trace the girl in time

Thank you sir

Then he followed the butler away to his room and after the girls had
discussed him and expressed their sympathy for the unfortunate fellow
they all turned their attention to the important matter of the campaign
The debate with Hopkins was the thing that occupied them just now and
when Patsy joined the group of workers they began to discuss some means
of scoring a decisive victory at the Fairview Opera House The Honorable
Erastus still insisted upon making the antisign fight the prominent
issue of the campaign and they must reply forcibly to the misleading
statements made in his last handbill

Meantime Tom Gates was sunk in the deep sleep of physical exhaustion
and the day wore away before he wakened When at last he regained
consciousness he found the sun sinking in the west and feared he had
been guilty of indiscretion He remembered that he was Mr Forbess
secretary now and that Mr Forbes might want him He was not yet
thoroughly rested but night was approaching and he reflected that he
could obtain all the sleep that he needed then

So greatly refreshed and in a quieter mood than he had been for days
the young man dressed and entered the hall to find his way downstairs

It happened that Beth whose room was near this rear corridor had just
gone there to dress for dinner and as she was closing her door she
heard a wild impassioned cry

Lucy

Quickly she sprang out into the hall and turned the corner in time to
see a strange tableau

Young Gates was standing with his arms outstretched toward Eliza
Parsons who a few paces away had her back to the door of her own
chamber from which she had evidently just stepped She stood
motionless looking curiously at the youth who confronted her

Lucy dont you know me he asked his voice trembling with emotion

To begin with said the girl composedly my name happens to be
Eliza And as weve not been properly introduced I really dont see why
I should know you she added with a light laugh

Tom Gates shrank away from her as if he had been struck

You cant be Lucy he murmured And yetand yetoh you must be
Lucy You must know me Look at me dearIm Tom Im your own Tom
Lucy

Its very gratifying Im sure young man said the girl a touch of
scorn in her tones If youre my own Tom youll perhaps stand out of my
way and let me go to my work

Without another word he backed up again the wall and permitted her to
sweep by him which she did with a gesture of disdain

When Eliza Parsons had disappeared down the back stairs Beth drew a long
breath and approached Tom Gates who still stood by the wall staring at
the place where the girl had disappeared

I overheard said Beth Tell me Tom is she really like Lucy

He looked at her with a dazed expression as if he scarcely comprehended
her words

Could you have been mistaken persisted the questioner

He passed his hand over his eyes and gave a shudder

Either it was Lucy or her ghost he muttered

Eliza Parsons is no ghost declared Beth Shes one of the maids here
at Elmhurst and youre quite likely to see her again

Has she been here long he asked eagerly

No only a few days

Oh

When I first saw her I was struck by her resemblance to Mrs Rogers
continued the girl

But shes so different said Tom choking back a sob Lucy couldnt
be soso airy so heartless She isnt at all that style of a girl
miss

She may be acting suggested Beth

But he shook his head gloomily

No Lucy couldnt act that way Shes quick and impulsive but sheshe
couldnt act And she wouldnt treat me that way either Miss Beth
Lucy and I have been sweethearts for years and I know every expression
of her dear face But the look that this girl gave me was one that my
Lucy never could assume I must have been mistaken IIm sure I was
mistaken

Beth sighed She was disappointed

I suppose continued Tom that Ive thought of Lucy so long and so
much lately and worried so over her disappearance that Im not quite
myself and imagined this girl was more like her than she really is
What did you say her name was

Eliza Parsons

Thank you Can you tell me where Ill find Mr Forbes

Hes getting ready for dinner now and wont need you at present

Then Ill go back to my room Itit was a great shock to me that
likeness Miss DeGraf

I can well believe it said Beth and then she went to her own
apartment greatly puzzled at a resemblance so strong that it had even
deceived Lucy Rogerss own sweetheart




CHAPTER XV

SIGNS OF THE TIMES


If she is really Lucy Rogers shell be missing tomorrow morning said
Beth when she had told her cousins of the encounter in the corridor

But Eliza Parsons was still at Elmhurst the next day calmly pursuing
her duties and evidently having forgotten or decided to ignore the
young man who had so curiously mistaken her for another Beth took
occasion to watch her movements so far as she could and came to the
conclusion that the girl was not acting a part She laughed naturally
and was too lighthearted and gay to harbor a care of any sort in her
frivolous mind

But there was a mystery about her that could not be denied Even if she
were but a paid spy of Erastus Hopkins there was a story in this girls
life brief as it had been

Beth was full of curiosity to know this story

As for Tom Gates he had been so horrified by his mistake that he tried
to avoid meeting Eliza again This was not difficult because the girl
kept pretty closely to the linen room and Tom was chiefly occupied in
the library

Kenneth had little chance to test his secretarys abilities just then
because the girls pounced upon the new recruit and used his services in
a variety of ways Tom Gatess anxiety to give satisfaction made him
willing to do anything but they refrained from sending him often to
town because he was sensitive to the averted looks and evident repulsion
of those who knew he had recently been a jailbird But there was
plenty for him to do at Elmhurst where they were all as busy as bees
and whatever the young man undertook he accomplished in a satisfactory
manner

Saturday forenoon the three girls with Kenneth Mr Watson and Uncle
John rode over to Fairview to prepare for the debate that was to take
place in the afternoon leaving only Tom Gates at home As Mr Hopkins
had thrust upon his opponent the task of naming the place and time the
Republican candidate was obliged to make all the arrangements and pay
all the costs But whatever the girl managers undertook they did well
So the Opera House had been in the hands of a special committee for two
days the orchestra had been hired and the news of the joint debate had
spread far and wide

The party from Elmhurst lunched at the Fairview Hotel and then the
girls hurried to the Opera House while Kenneth remained to attend a
conference of the Republican Committee These gentlemen were much
worried over the discovery of a scheme to trade votes that had been
sprung and that Forbes and Reynolds were being sacrificed for Hopkins
and Cummings Mr Cummings was called into the meeting and he denied
that the trading was being done with his consent but defiantly refused
to make a public announcement to that effect

The matter was really serious because every vote lost in that way
counted as two for the other side and Hopkinss rabid handbills had
influenced many of the more ignorant voters and created endless disputes
that were not of benefit to the Republican party

As nearly as we can figure from our recent canvass said Mr
Cunningham the chairman we are fast losing ground and our chances of
success are smaller than if no interest in the election had been
aroused Hopkins has cut our majority down to nothing and it will be a
hard struggle to carry our ticket through to success This is the more
discouraging because Mr Forbes has spent so much money while Hopkinss
expenses have been very little

I do not mind that said Kenneth quietly It was my desire that the
voters should fully understand the issues of the campaign Then if they
vote against me it is because they are not worthy of honest
representation in the Legislature and I shall in the future leave them
to their own devices

The committee adjourned a little before two oclock with rather grave
faces and prepared to attend the debate at the Opera House Mr
Cunningham feared this debate would prove a mistake as it would give
Hopkins a chance to ridicule and browbeat his opponent in public and
his greatest talent as a speaker lay in that direction

As Kenneth and his supporters approached the Opera House they heard loud
cheering and from a bandwagon covered with bunting and banners in
which he had driven to the meeting descended the Honorable Erastus He
met Kenneth face to face and the latter said pleasantly

Good afternoon Mr Hopkins

Ah its Forbes isnt it replied Hopkins slightingly Ive met you
before somewheres havent I

You have sir

Glad youre here Forbes glad youre here continued the
Representative airily as he made his way through the crowd that
blocked the entrance These meetings are educational to young men
Girls all well I hope

There was a boisterous laugh at this sally and Mr Hopkins smiled and
entered the Opera House while Kenneth followed with the feeling that he
would take great delight in punching the Honorable Erastuss nose at the
first opportunity

The house was packed full of eager spectators who had come to see the
fun Although the girls had taken charge of all the arrangements they
had devoted the left side of the ample stage to the use of the Hopkins
party where a speakers table and chairs for important guests had been
placed The right side was similarly arranged for the Forbes party and
between the two the entire center of the stage was occupied by a group
of fifty young girls Above this group a great banner was suspended
reading The Signs of the Times a catchword Mr Hopkins had employed
throughout the campaign But the most astonishing thing was the
appearance of the group of girls They all wore plain white slips upon
which a variety of signs had been painted in prominent letters Some
costumes advertised bakingpowders others patent medicines others
soaps chewing tobacco breakfast foods etc From where they were
seated in full view of the vast audience the girls appeared as a mass of
advertising signs and the banner above them indicated quite plainly
that these were the Signs of the Times

Mr Hopkins as he observed this scene smiled with satisfaction He
believed some of his friends had prepared this display to assist him and
to disconcert the opposition for nothing could have clinched his
arguments better than the pretty young girls covered with advertisements
of well known products Even the Eagle Eye Breakfast Food was well
represented

After the orchestra had finished a selection Mr Hopkins rose to make
the first argument and was greeted with cheers

We are having a jolly campaign my dear friends he began but you
musnt take it altogether as a joke because while Mr Forbess erratic
views and actions have done little real harm we have been educated to
an appreciation of certain benefits we enjoy which otherwise might have
escaped our attention

This is a progressive strenuous age and no section of the country has
progressed more rapidly than this the Eighth District of our great and
glorious State I may say without danger of contradiction that the
people I have the honor to represent in the State Legislature and
expect to have the honor of representing the next term are the most
intelligent the most thoughtful and the most prosperous to be found in
any like district in the United States Cheers Who then dares to
denounce them as fools Who dares interfere with these liberties who
dares intrude uninvited into their premises and paint out the signs they
have permitted to occupy their fences and barns and sheds Who would do
these things but an impertinent meddler who is so inexperienced in life
that he sets his own flimsy judgment against that of the people

The orator paused impressively to wait for more cheers but the audience
was silent In the outskirts of the crowd a faint hissing began to be
heard It reached the speakers ear and he hurriedly resumed the
oration

I do not say Mr Forbes is not a good citizen said he but that he
is misguided and unreasonable A certain degree of deference is due the
young man because he inherited considerable wealth from his uncle
and

Again the hisses began and Mr Hopkins knew he must abandon personal
attacks or he would himself be discredited before his hearers Kenneth
and his supporters sat silent in their places the three girls who were
now well known in the district forming part of the Republican group
and none of them displayed the least annoyance at the vituperation Mr
Hopkins had employed

I have already called your attention in my circulars resumed the
speaker to the fact that advertising signs are the source of large
income to the farmers of this district I find that three thousand
seven hundred and eightythree dollars have been paid the farmers in the
last five years without the least trouble or expense on their part and
this handsome sum of money belongs to them and should not be taken away
Stop and think for a moment Advertising is the life of every business
and to fight successfully the great army of advertisers whose business
is the lifeblood of our institutions is as impossible as it is absurd
Suppose every farmer in this district refused to permit signs upon his
property what would be the result Why the farmers of other sections
would get that much more money for letting privileges and you would be
that much out of pocket without suppressing the evilif evil can attach
to an industry that pays you good money without requiring either
investment or labor in return

After continuing in this strain for some time Mr Hopkins announced
that he would now give way to his youthful and inexperienced opponent
and asked the audience to be patient with Mr Forbes and considerate of
his extraordinary prejudices

Hopkinss policy of discrediting his opponent in advance was not very
effective for when Kenneth arose he was more enthusiastically cheered
than Hopkins had been The meeting was disposed to be fairminded and
quite willing to give Mr Forbes a chance to explain his position

The arguments of our distinguished Representative are well worthy of
your consideration he began quietly It is only by understanding
fully both sides of an argument that you can hope to arrive at a just
and impartial decision Mr Hopkins has advocated advertising signs on
the ground that your financial gain warrants permitting them to be
placed upon your premises I will not deny his statement that three
thousand seven hundred and eightythree dollars have been paid the
farmers of this district by advertisers in the last five years It is
quite likely to be true I have here the report of the Department of
Agriculture showing that the total amount paid to farmers of the eighth
district in the last five years for produce of all kinds is eleven
millions fivehundred thousand dollars

A murmur of amazement rose from the audience Kenneth waited until it
had subsided

This seems surprising at first he said and proves how startling
aggregate figures are You must remember I have covered five years in
this estimate as did Mr Hopkins in his and if you will figure it out
you will see that the yearly average of earnings is about six hundred
dollars to each farmer That is a good showing for we have a wealthy
district but it is not surprising when reduced to that basis Mr
Hopkins slates that the farmers of this district received three
thousand seven hundred and eightythree dollars during the last five
years for advertising signs Let us examine these figures Onefifth of
that sum is seven hundred and fiftysix dollars and sixty cents as the
income to you per year We have in this district twentyfive hundred
farmers according to the latest reports of the Bureau of Statistics and
dividing seven hundred and fiftysix dollars and sixty cents by
twentyfive hundred we find that each farmer receives an average of
thirty and onequarter cents per year for allowing his fences and
buildings to be smothered in lurid advertising signs So we find that
the money received by the farmers from the advertising amounts to about
onequarter of one per cent of their income a matter so insignificant
that it cannot affect them materially one way or another

But Mr Hopkins states that you give nothing in return for this
onequarter of one per cent while I claim you pay tremendously for it
For you sacrifice the privacy of your homes and lands and lend
yourselves to the selfish desire of advertisers to use your property to
promote their sales You have been given an example of clean barns and
fences and I cannot tell you how proud I am of this district when I
ride through it and see neatly painted barns and fences replacing the
flaring and obtrusive advertising signs that formerly disfigured the
highways Why should you paint advertising signs upon your barns any
more than upon your houses Carry the thing a step farther and you may
as well paint signs upon your childrens dresses in the manner you see
illustrated before you

At this Louise made a signal and the fifty children so grotesquely
covered with signs rose and stepped forward upon the stage The
orchestra struck up an air and the little girls sang the following
ditty

  Teas and soaps
  Pills and dopes
We all must advertise
  Copper cents
  Not common sense
Are the things we prize
  We confess
  Such a dress
Isnt quite becoming
  But we suppose
  Hopkins knows
This keeps business humming

As the girls ceased singing Kenneth said

To the encroaching advertiser these signs of
the times are considered legitimate There is no
respect for personal privacy on the advertisers
part Once they used only the newspapers the
legitimate channels for advertising Then they
began painting their advertising on your fences
When the farmers protested against this the advertisers
gave them a few pennies as a sop to
quiet them After this they gave you small sums
to paint the broad sides of your barns your
board fences and to place signs in your field If
you allowed them to do so they would paint signs
on the dresses of your children and wives so
callous are they to all decency and so regardless
of private rights Look on this picture my
friends and tell me would you prefer to see thisor this

At the word each child pulled away the signpainted
slip and stood arrayed in a pretty gown
of spotless white

The surprise was so complete that the audience
cheered shouted and laughed for several minutes
before silence was restored Then the children
sang another verse as follows

  Now it is clear
  That we appear
Just as we should be
  We are seen
  Sweet and clean
From corruption free
  Were the signs
  Of the times
Fair as heavens orbs
  If we look good
  Then all men should
Vote for Kenneth Forbes

The cheering was renewed at this and Mr Hopkins became angry He tried
to make himself heard but the popular fancy had been caught by the
object lesson so cleverly placed before them and they shouted Forbes
Forbes Forbes until the Honorable Erastus became so furious that he
left the meeting in disgust

This was the most impolite thing he could have done but he vowed that
the meeting had been packed with Forbes partisans and that he was
wasting his time in addressing them

After he was gone Kenneth resumed his speech and created more
enthusiasm The victory was certainly with the Republican candidate and
the Elmhurst people returned home thoroughly satisfied with the result
of the joint debate




CHAPTER XVI

A CLEW AT LAST


The servants at Elmhurst all ate in a pleasant dining room with windows
facing a garden of geraniums Tom Gates had been at the house two days
before he encountered Eliza Parsons at the table for the servants were
not all able to take their meals at the same time

It was at luncheon the day of the joint debate at Fairview that the
young man first met Eliza who sat opposite him The only other person
present was old Donald the coachman who was rather deaf and never paid
any attention to the chatter around him

As he took his seat Tom gave a halffrightened glance into Elizas face
and then turned red as she smiled coquettishly and said

Dear me Its the young man who called me his dear Lucy

Youyoure very like her stammered Tom unable to take his eyes from
her face Even now II cant believe Im mistaken

She laughed merrily in a sweet musical voice and then suddenly stopped
with her hand on her heart and cast at him a startled look that was in
such sharp contrast to her former demeanor that he rose from his chair

Sit down please she said slowly And then she studied his face with
sober earnestnesswith almost wistful longing But she shook her head
presently and sighed and a moment later had regained her lightness of
manner

Its a relief to have a quiet house for a day isnt it she asked
eating her soup calmly Ill be glad when the elections over

Have you been here long he asked although Beth had told him of
Elizas coming to Elmhurst

Only a short time And you

Two days said he But where did you live before you came here

She shook her head

I wish you would answer me he begged I have a reason for asking

What reason she demanded suddenly serious again

Two people have never lived that were so near alike as you and Lucy
Rogers

Indeed

Will you show me your left arm

No

She was again studying his face

If you are Lucy Rogers you have a scar therea scar where you burned
yourself years ago

She seemed frightened for a moment Then she said

I have no scar on my left arm

Will you prove it

No You are annoying me What did you say your name is

Tom Gates

She was thoughtful for a moment and then shook her head

I have never heard of you she declared positively and resumed her
eating

Tom was nonplussed One moment he believed she was Lucy and the next
told himself that it was impossible This girl possessed mannerisms that
Lucy had never exhibited in all the years he had known her She was bold
and unabashed where Lucy was shy and unassuming This girls eyes
laughed while Lucys were grave and serious yet they were the same
eyes

Let me tell you about my lost Lucy he said with a glance at the
unconscious Donald

Go ahead if it will relieve you she answered demurely

She lived on a farm five miles from here and she was my sweetheart
Her mother is blind and her father old and feeble She worked for a
dentist in the town and was accused of stealing a ring and it nearly
broke her heart to be so unjustly suspected In order to make good the
loss of the ring a valuable diamondII got into trouble and Lucy
was so shocked and distressed that sheshe lost her headbecame mad
you knowand left home during the night without a word to any one We
havent been able to find her since

Thats too bad remarked Eliza Parsons buttering her bread

About the time that Lucy went away you appeared at Elmhurst
continued Tom And in face and form youre the image of my Lucy That
is why I asked you to tell me where you came from and how you came
here

Ah you think Im mad do you asked the girl with a quizzical smile
Well Im not going to satisfy your curiosity even to prove my sanity
and Im not anxious to pose as your lost Lucy So please pass the sugar
and try to be sociable instead of staring at me as if I scared you

Tom passed the sugar but he could not eat nor could he tear himself
away from this strange girls presence He tried again to draw her into
conversation but she showed annoyance and resented his persistence
Presently she went away giving him an amused smile as she left the
rooma smile that made him feel that this was indeed a case of mistaken
identity

In fact Tom Gates on sober reflection knew that the girl could not be
Lucy yet he could not still the yearning in his heart whenever he saw
her His heart declared that she was Lucy and his head realized that
she could not be

While he waited in the library for Mr Forbes to return from Fairview a
man was shown into the room and sat down quietly in a corner

He was a small lean man of unassuming appearance with a thin face and
gray eyes set close together When he looked at Tom Gates he scarcely
seemed to see him and his manner conveyed the impression that he
disliked to attract notice

Waiting for Mr Forbes sir asked Tom

Yes was the quiet reply

Suddenly it struck the young man that this might be the detective who
called every evening to give his report and if so Tom was anxious to
talk with him So he ventured to say

Its Mr Burke isnt it

The man nodded and looked out of the window

Im Tom Gates sir

Yes I know

Youve seen me before asked the youth astonished

No Ive heard of you Thats all

Tom flushed remembering his recent crime But he was eager to question
the detective

Have you heard anything of Lucy Rogers Mr Burke

Not yet

Is there no trace of her at all

A slight tracenothing worth mentioning said Mr Burke

For a few moments Tom sat in silence Then he said

I thought Id found her day before yesterday

Yes There was little interest in the tone

Theres a girl in the house sir one of the maids who is the living
image of Lucy Rogers

You ought to be able to identify her suggested the detective his
gaze still out of the window

But they are not alike except in looks Her form and face are identical
with Lucys I was so sure that I begged her to let me see if there was
a scar on her left arm but she refused

Was there a scar on Lucy Rogerss left arm

Yes sir Several years ago when we were children we were making
candy in the kitchen and Lucy burned herself badly It left a broad scar
on her left forearm which she will bear as long as she lives

It is well to know that said Mr Burke

This girl continued Tom musingly says her name is Eliza Parsons
and she says it in Lucys voice But her manner is not the same at all
Eliza laughs at me and quizzes me she is forward and scornful andand
perfectly selfpossessed which Lucy could not be under the
circumstances

Have you seen her closely asked the detective

Yes sir

And are still unable to decide who she is

Thats it sir Im unable to decide Its Lucy and yet it isnt
Lucy

Who is Eliza Parsons

She refuses to say where she came from But it seems she arrived at
Elmhurst only a day or two after Lucy disappeared from home Its that
coincidence that makes me doubt the evidence of my own senses

Who hires the servants here

I dont know sir

Mr Burke abandoned the conversation then and confined his gaze to the
landscape as it showed through the window Tom busied himself addressing
circulars of instruction to the Republicans who were to work at the
polling places This was Saturday and the election was to be on the
following Tuesday The meeting at Fairview was therefore the last
important rally of the campaign

At dusk the party arrived from Fairview in the automobiles the girls
greatly delighted with the success of the meeting They all followed
Kenneth into the library where the butler had just lighted the lamps
The evenings were getting cool now and a grate fire was burning

Kenneth greeted Mr Burke and introduced him to the young ladies who
begged to remain during the interview

We are all alike interested in Lucy Rogers Mr Burke said the boy
so you may speak freely Is there any news

Nothing of importance sir unless a clew has been found in your own
house replied the detective

Here at Elmhurst asked the astonished Kenneth

Yes Tom Gates has seen a girlone of your maidswho so strongly
resembles Lucy Rogers that he at first believed she was the missing
girl

I know said Beth quickly Its Eliza Parsons But Tom was mistaken
He saw her in the dim light of a corridor and the resemblance confused
him

Ive seen her since remarked Tom and the likeness is really
bewildering Its only her manner that is different

When I first saw her before Tom came I was astonished at her
resemblance to Mrs Rogers announced Beth I have never seen Lucy
but I know Mrs Rogers and it seemed to me that Eliza was exactly like
her in features Mr Forbes and I first saw her riding in a buggy with
Mr Hopkins That was before either of us knew she was employed at
Elmhurst You see she isnt one of the servants who come much in contact
with the family she does the mending and takes charge of the linen
room

Beth then related the manner in which they first noticed Eliza and how
they had discovered her to be a spy in the service of Mr Hopkins

The detective was much interested in the recital and seemed surprised
that he had not been informed of this before

Of course said Kenneth the girl is not Lucy Rogers It is not
possible they could be the same

Why not asked Mr Burke

Well Lucy was a gentle sweet country girl of little experience in
life Her nature was so susceptible so very sensitive that when she
discovered Tom Gates whom she loved to be guilty of a forgery she
worried herself into an attack of brainfever or at least she became
insane reproaching herself for having driven the boy to this dreadful
deed Under the influence of her mania she wandered away from her home
and has not been seen since Thats the story of Lucy Rogers Now look
at Eliza Parsons She appeared the very day after Lucys disappearance
to be sure but that proves they are not the same person For Eliza is
not demented She is a cold hard woman of the world in spite of her
tender years She is doing the work of an experienced spy while any
deceit was foreign to Lucys nature Instead of being plunged in grief
Eliza is happy and gay reckless of consequences and fully
selfpossessed She is also well and healthy to all appearances Taking
all these things into consideration it is impossible to connect the two
girls in any waysave the coincidence of personal resemblance

Mr Burke listened to this quietly and then shook his head

Your arguments all tend to make me suspect that she is Lucy Rogers he
said quietly

For a moment there was an impressive silence while everyone eagerly
inquiringly or doubtfully looked at the detective according to their
diverse acceptance of his statement

In pursuance of the task set me began Mr Burke I had met with such
absolute failure to trace the missing girl that I began to suspect no
ordinary conditions were attached to this case In my experience which
covers many years I have had occasion to study sudden dementia caused
by shocks of grief or horror and I have come to comprehend the fact
that the human mind once unbalanced is liable to accomplish many
surprising feats Usually the victim is absolutely transformed and
becomes the very opposite in many ways of the normal personality I
imagine this is what happened to Lucy Rogers

Do you imagine that Lucy would try to deceive me sir asked Tom
reproachfully

I am sure she doesnt know who you are answered the detective
positively She doesnt even know herself I have known instances where
every recollection of the past was wiped out of the patients mind

There was another thoughtful pause for the detectives assertions were
so astonishing that they fairly overwhelmed his hearers

Then Louise asked

Is such a case of dementia hopeless Mr Burke

Not at all hopeless Often I admit it develops into permanent
insanity but there are many examples of complete recovery Our first
business must be to assure ourselves that we are right in this
conjecture I may be entirely wrong for the unexpected is what I have
been taught to look for in every case of mystery that has come under my
observation But I believe I have the material at hand to prove the
personality of this Eliza Parsons and after that I shall know what to
do Who employs your servants Mr Forbes

Martha my housekeeper usually employs the maids

Will you send for her please

Kenneth at once obeyed the request and presently Martha entered the
library

She was a little withered old woman but with a pleasant face and
shrewd but kindly eyes

Martha said Kenneth did you employ the new linen maid Eliza
Parsons

Yes sir she replied apparently surprised at the question

This is Mr Burke Martha Please answer any questions he may ask you

Yes Master Kenneth

Did the girl bring any recommendations asked the detective

Martha reflected

I do not think she did sir

Are you accustomed to hiring maids without recommendations asked Mr
Burke

Oh Eliza had a letter from my cousin Mrs Hopkins who lives in
Elmwood

Is Mrs Hopkins your cousin asked Kenneth

Yes sir She were a Phibbs before she married Erastus and my name is
Phibbs

What did the letter from Mrs Hopkins say

It said she knew Eliza to be a clever and worthy girl and if I had a
place for her I couldnt do better than take her on So I needed a linen
maid and Eliza went right to work Isnt she satisfactory sir Has she
been doing anything wrong

No Please do not mention this interview to her at present Miss
Phibbs said the detective That is all I believe

Would you like to see Eliza asked Kenneth when the housekeeper had
retired

Not at present I want to interview Mrs Hopkins first

Tonight asked Tom eagerly

I will go at once with Mr Forbess permission

Certainly sir said Kenneth Shall we see you tomorrow

Just as soon as I have accomplished anything

Would you like a horse or an automobile

Your man may drive me to the town sir if it is convenient

Kenneth gave the required order and then Mr Burke asked

How far are you prepared to go in this matter sir

In what way

In expending money

Will any large expenditure be required

I cannot say But we may require the services and advice of an expert
physiciana specialist in brain diseases

Do you know of one asked Kenneth

Yes but he must be brought from Buffalo It will be expensive sir
That is why I ask if your interest in the girl warrants our going to the
limit to save her

Kenneth was thoughtful while the girls looked at him expectantly and
Tom Gates with visible anxiety

My original idea was merely to find the missing girl in order to
relieve the anxiety of her blind mother said young Forbes To
accomplish that I was willing to employ your services But as a matter
of fact I have never seen the girl Lucy Rogers nor am I particularly
interested in her

I am declared Beth

And I

And I repeated Patsy and Louise

I think said Uncle John who had been a quiet listener until now
that Kenneth has assumed enough expense in this matter

Oh Uncle The remonstrance was from all three of the girls

Therefore continued Mr Merrick I propose that I undertake any
further expense that may be incurred so as to divide the burden

Thats better declared Patsy But I might have known Uncle John
would do that

You have my authority to wire the physician if necessary or to go to
any expense you deem advisable continued Mr Merrick turning to the
detective We seem to have undertaken to unravel an interesting
mystery and well see it through to the end

Very good sir said Mr Burke and left them with a brief nod of
farewell

Somehow said Beth Ive a lot of confidence in that little man

Why hes a detective replied Uncle John with a smile and the
chief business of detectives is to make mistakes




CHAPTER XVII

MRS HOPKINS GOSSIPS


The home of Representative Hopkins was not a very imposing edifice It
was a modest frame building standing well back in a little yard at the
outskirts of the village and Mrs Hopkins did the housework unaided
to save the expense of a maid It never occurred to the politician who
had risen from the position of a poor stableboy to one of affluence to
save his wife from this drudgery To him poor Mary was merely one of his
possessions and it would have astonished him to know that her sharp
tongue and irritable temper were due to overwork and neglect The
Honorable Erastus was not averse to champagne dinners and other costly
excesses while at the state capital and his fellow legislators
considered him a good fellow although rather lax in keeping his end
up Moreover he employed a good tailor and was careful to keep up an
appearance of sound financial standing But his home which he avoided
as much as possible had little share in his personal prosperity Mary
Hopkinss requests for new and decent gowns were more often refused than
acceded to and he constantly cautioned her to keep down expenses or she
would drive them both to the poorhouse

The woman well knew that Erastus could afford to keep her in luxury if
he would but some women are so constituted that they accept their fate
rather than rebel and Mary Hopkins lived the life of a slave
contenting herself with petty scoldings and bickerings that did nothing
to relieve her hard lot

She had little interest in politics and resented the intrusion of the
many who came to the house to see and consult with her husband during
the tiresome political campaigns On these occasions Mr Hopkins used
the sittingroom as his office and committee headquarters but this did
not materially interfere with his wifes comfort as she was usually
busy in the kitchen

On this Saturday evening however they had an early supper and she
finished her dishes betimes and sat down to darn stockings in the
sittingroom Erastus had hurried away to a meeting of his henchmen in
the town and would not be home until after his wife was in bed

So she was rather surprised when a timid knock sounded upon the door
She opened it to find a little lean man standing upon the porch

Mrs Hopkins he asked quietly

Yes What do you want

Your husband asked me to come here and wait for him Its important or
I wouldnt disturb you

Well then come in she replied tartly Thank the Lord this thing
is nearly over and well have a few weeks of peace

It is rather imposing on you remarked the man following her to the
sittingroom where he sat down with his hat in his hands A political
campaign is trying to everybody Im tired out and sick of the whole
thing myself

Then why dont you chuck it she retorted scornfully and go to work
makin an honest living

Oh this is honest enough he said mildly

I dont believe it All them secret confabs an trickery to win votes
cant be on the square Dont talk to me Politics is another name for
rascality

Perhaps youre right maam perhaps youre right he said with a
sigh

She looked at him sharply

You dont belong in Elmwood

No maam Im from beyond Fairview Ive come to see your husband on
business

She sniffed at that but picked up her darning and relapsed into
silence The little man was patient He sat quietly in his chair and
watched her work

His mildness disarmed Mary Hopkins She was not especially averse to
having him sit there It relieved the loneliness of her occupation On
occasions she loved to talk as Erastus had long ago discovered and
this visitor would not try to shut her up the way Erastus did

You dont often get out maam into society and such like ventured
the caller presently

What makes you think that she demanded

A woman cant keep a house neat and trim like this and be a social
gadder he observed

Youre right about that she returned somewhat mollified If I was
like them girls up at Elmhurst fussin round over politics all the
time this house would go to rack an ruin

Oh them he said with mild scorn Them girls ll never be
housekeepers

Not for a minute she affirmed

There was another pause then but the ice was broken A subtle sympathy
seemed established between the two

What do you think of Rasts chances she asked presently as she
threaded new cotton into her needle

I guess hell win Hes worked hard enough anyhow

Has he

Yes Rasts a good worker He dont leave any stone unturned Hes up
to all the tricks o the trade is Rast Hopkins

Here he began shaking with silent laughter and Mrs Hopkins looked at
him curiously

What are you laughing at she inquired with a sniff of disdain

Atat the way he come it over the gals up at Elmhurst Rasts a
pretty slick one he is

What do you mean

Why settin that Liza to watch em and tell all they does Whod a
thought of it but Rast Hopkins

I dont see anything mighty funny about that declared Mrs Hopkins
contemptuously The girls too pert and forward for anything I told
Rast not to fool with her or shed make him trouble

Did you now exclaimed the man wonderingly

Yes indeed said Mrs Hopkins pleased to have made an impression I
suspected there was something wrong about her the morning she came to
the house here And she changed her name too as brassy as you please

Well I declare said the visitor Did you know her before that Mrs
Hopkins

Why I didnt exactly know her but I seen her workin around Miss
Squierss place many a time and she didnt seem to mount to much even
then One day she stole a dimond ring offn old Miss Squiers and dug
out and I told Nancy thenNancys young Miss Squiersthat Id always
had my suspicions of the hussy She hid the ring in a vase on the mantle
and they found it after she was gone

Well well I didnt know that about her said the man looking with
admiration at Mrs Hopkins

Thats why I told Rast not to have any truck with her when she came
here bright and early one morning and asked for work

Oh she came here did she

While I was gettin breakfast She said her name was Eliza Parsons an
she was looking fer a job I told her I knew her record an to get out
and while we was arguin Rast come out and took a hand in the talk She
laughed and flirted with him outrageous and said she was a stranger in
these parts when Id seen her many a time at Miss Squierss

What was her name then asked the man

I think it was Rosieor Lucy or something Anyhow it wasnt Eliza
and that Ill swear to But the girl laughed at me and made such silly
smiles at Rast that he told me to shut up cause he had a use for her
in politics

Well well repeated the visitor Just see how stories get twisted I
heard you gave the girl a letter to your cousin Martha

Well I did Rast wanted to get her in at Elmhurst to watch what
Forbes was doing to defeat him so he made me write the letter But
howd you know so much about this girl she inquired with sudden
suspicion

Me I only know what Mr Hopkins told me Im one of his confidential
men But he never said how he happened to find the girl or what he knew
about her

He didnt know nothing Hed never seen her till that morning when she
came here But he said she was clever and she is if pertness and a
ready tongue counts for cleverness I suppose he pays her for what she
tells him about Forbes but hed better save his money and fight on the
square I dont like this tricky politics an never did

I dont either declared the man But Im in it and cant get out

Thats what Rast says But some day theyll put him out neck and
crop if he aint careful

Is the girl Eliza much use to him

I cant say He drove her over to Elmhurst that morning and he drives
over two or three evenings a week to meet her on the sly and get her
report That may be politics but it aint very respectable to my
notion

Well the campaign is nearly over Mrs Hopkins

Thank goodness for that she replied

The visitor sat silent after this for he had learned all that the poor
gossiping woman could tell him Finally he said

I guess your husbands going to be late

Yes if he aint more prompt than usual youll have a long spell of
waiting

Perhaps Id better go over to the hotel and look him up I have to get
back to Fairview tonight you know

Do as you please she answered carelessly

So Mr Burke for it was the detective bade her goodnight and took his
leave and it was not until after he had gone that Mary Hopkins
remembered she had forgotten to ask him his name

But it dont matter she decided Hes just one o Rasts
politicians and I probably treated the fellow better than he deserved




CHAPTER XVIII

ELIZA PARSONS


On Sunday morning Mr Burke again appeared at Elmhurst and told Kenneth
he wanted an interview with Eliza Parsons

I dont want you to send for her or anything like that for it would
make her suspicious he said Id like to meet her in some way that
would seem accidental and not startle her

That is rather a hard thing to arrange Mr Burke said the boy with
a smile

Why I think not declared Louise It seems to me quite easy

Thats the woman of it sir laughed Kenneth if its a question of
wits her sex has the advantage of us

What do you propose miss asked the detective turning to Louise

Ill have Martha send the girl into the garden to gather flowers she
replied and you can wander around there and engage her in
conversation

Excellent he exclaimed Can this be arranged now

Ill see sir

She found Martha and asked her to send Eliza Parsons for some roses and
chrysanthemums which were in a retired place shut in by evergreen
hedges

One of the other maids will know the garden better suggested the
housekeeper

But I wish Eliza to go

Very well Miss Louise

From an upper window the girl watched until she saw Eliza Parsons leave
the house with a basket and go into the retired garden she had chosen
Then she returned to the library for Mr Burke and led him toward the
same place

Eliza is just beyond that gap in the hedge she said and turned away

Wait a moment please he said detaining her On second thought I
would like you to come with me for your tact may be of great
assistance Have you spoken much with Eliza

Not at all I think Beth has talked with her but I have scarcely been
near her since she came here

You are willing to come

I shall be glad to

The poet Saxe said Mr Burke walking through the gap beside Louise
has never been properly appreciated by his countrymen although since
his death his verses are in greater demand than while he lived Do you
care for them

I dont know Saxe very well she answered observing that they were
approaching a place where Eliza was bending over a rosebush But one
or two of his poems are so amusing that they linger in my memory

Eliza turned at the sound of their voices and gave them a quick glance
But the next moment she resumed her occupation of cutting roses

The mans greatest fault was his habit of punning remarked the
detective watching the girls form as he drew nearer It is that which
blinded his contemporaries to his real talents What exquisite roses
Miss Merrick May I ask for one for my buttonhole

Yes indeed she replied pausing with him just beside Eliza Will
you cut that bud yonder for Mr Burke my dear

The maid silently obeyed and as the detective took the flower from her
hand he said

Why isnt this Eliza Parsons

Yes sir she replied carelessly

Dont you remember me Eliza

She seemed a little surprised but answered promptly

No sir

Im William Burke your mothers cousin How did you leave your brother
Harry and have you heard from Josephine lately

The girl gave him a startled look and shrank back

Why how nice cried Louise I did not know you knew Elizas family
Mr Burke

Yes she is one of my relatives and came from Roanoke Virginia Isnt
that correct Eliza

Yes sirno II dont remember she said in a low tone

Dont remember Eliza That is strange

The girl stared at him half frightened and drew her hand over her eyes
with a gesture of bewilderment

I hope my dear you are not going to be like your mother said Mr
Burke gently My poor cousin Nora was subject to a strange lapse of
memory at times he remarked to Louise She always recovered in time
but for days she could remember nothing of her former lifenot even her
own name Are you ever affected that way Eliza

She looked up at him pleadingly and murmured in a low voice

Let me go Please let me go

In a moment Eliza

Her hands were clasped together nervously and she had dropped her basket
and scissors on the path before her The man looked intently into her
eyes in a shrewd yet kindly way and she seemed as if fascinated by his
gaze

Tell me my dear have you forgotten your old life he asked

Yes she whispered

Poor girl And you are trying to keep this a secret and not let anyone
know of your trouble

Suddenly she started and sprang away uttering a cry of terror

Youre trying to trap me she panted You know my name is not Eliza
Parsons Youyou want to ruin me

From the position in which they stood in the corner of the garden with
high hedges behind the maid and Mr Burke and Louise blocking the path
in front there was little chance of escape But she looked around
wildly as if about to make the attempt when Louise stepped forward and
gently took Elizas hand in her own

Mr Burke is a good man my dear and means well by you she said in
her sweet sympathetic tones He shall not bother you if you are afraid
of him

IIm not afraid said Eliza with a resumption of her old manner and
a toss of her head

The detective gave Louise a look which she thought she understood

Will you finish cutting these roses Mr Burke she asked with a
smile Eliza and I are going to my room Come my dear and without
waiting for a reply she led the girl whose hand was still clasped in
her own along the path

Eliza came willingly Her manner was a little defiant at first but when
Louise drew her unobserved to the side entrance and up the staircase she
grew gentle and permitted the other girl to take her arm

Once in her room with the strange maid Louise locked the door quietly
and said to her companion with a cheerful smile

Now we are quite alone and can talk at our ease Take that low chair
dear and Ill sit here

Eliza obeyed looking wistfully into the fair face of her new friend

You are very pretty Eliza and Im sure you are as good as youre
pretty announced Louise So you must tell me about yourself and
whether you are happy here or not From this time on Im going to be
your friend you know and keep all your secrets and Ill help you all
I can

This rambling speech seemed to impress Eliza favorably She relaxed
somewhat from the tense alertness that was habitual with her and looked
at the other girl with a softened expression

Im afraid you wont be much interested in me she replied but I
need a friendindeed I need a friend Miss Louise

Im sure you do

At first I thought I could do without one I felt I must stand alone
and let no one suspect ButIm getting puzzled and bewildered and I
dont know what to do next

Of course not Tell me about it dear

I cant for I dont know myself She leaned forward in her chair and
added in a whisper I dont even know who I am But that man with a
shudder tried to trap me He said he knew Eliza Parsons and there is
no Eliza Parsons Its a name II invented

I think I understand said Louise with a little nod You had to have
a name so you took that one

Yes I dont know why I am telling you this Ive tried to hide it all
so carefully And perhaps Im wrong in letting this thing worry me In
the main Ive been very happy and content lately andI have a
feeling I was not happy beforebefore

Before what dear

The girl looked at her steadily and her face grew red

Before I lost my memory

For a few moments they sat silently regarding one another the
expressive features of Louise showing a silent sympathy

Have you really lost your memory she asked

Absolutely Think of it I wakened one morning lying by the roadside
and shivering with cold I had on a simple gray dress with no hat The
sun was just rising and no one was near I examined myself with wonder
for I had no idea who I was or how I came there There was no money in
my pocket and I had no jewels To keep warm I began walking along the
road The scenery was all new to me so far as I knew I had never been
in the place before

The birds were singing and the cows mooed in the meadow I tried to
sing too for my heart was light and gay and I was happy By and bye I
came to a town but no one seemed to be awakened because it was yet so
early As I walked down the street I saw smoke coming from one of the
chimneys and it suddenly occurred to me that I was hungry I entered
the yard and went around to the back door A woman was working in the
kitchen and I laughed joyfully and wished her a good morning She was
not very pleasant but it did me good to talk with her I liked to hear
my own voice and it pleased me to be able to talk easily and well She
grudgingly gave me something to eat and then bade me begone calling me
by some strange name and saying I was a thief It was then that I
invented the name of Eliza Parsons I dont know why but it popped into
my head and I claimed it for my name and have clung to it ever since

Have you no idea what your real name is asked Louise greatly
interested in this terse relation

I have no idea of anything that dates beyond that morning replied
Eliza The first time I looked in the mirror I saw a strange face
reflected there I had to make my own acquaintance she added with one
of her bright laughs I suppose I am between seventeen and twenty years
of age but what my life was during past years is to me a sealed book I
cannot remember a person I knew or associated with yet things outside
of my personal life seem to have clung to me I remembered books I must
have read I can write sing and sewI sew remarkably well and must
have once been trained to it I know all about my countrys history yet
I cannot recollect where I lived and this part of the country is
unknown to me When I came to Elmhurst I knew all about it and about Mr
Forbes but could not connect them with my former life

How did you happen to come here asked Louise

I forgot to tell you that While I was arguing with the woman who was
a Mrs Hopkins her husband heard us and came out into the kitchen He
began to question me about myself and I gave any answer that came into
my head for I could not tell him the truth It pleased me to hear my
voice I seemed to have a keen sense of the humorous and if I said
anything at all clever I laughed as heartily as anyone My heart was
light and free from all care I had no worries or responsibilities at
all I was like the birds who see the sunshine and feel the breeze and
are content to sing and be happy

Mr Hopkins saw I was wholly irresponsible and reckless and he decided
to use me to spy upon the people here at Elmhurst and report to him what
they said and did I agreed to this readily prompted by a spirit of
mischief for I cared nothing for Hopkins and had nothing against Mr
Forbes Also Hopkins paid me money which I had sufficient knowledge to
realize was necessary to me

Oh how happy and gay I was in those first few days There was not a
thought of the past not an ambition or desire of any sort to bother me
Just to live seemed pleasure enough I enjoyed eating and sleeping I
loved to talk and laugh I was glad to have work to occupy meand
that was all Then things began to happen that puzzled me The man
Hopkins declared he could not trust me because I had once been a thief
and I wondered if he could speak truly I resented the thought that I
may once have been a thief although I wouldnt mind stealing even now
if I wanted anything and could take it

Oh Eliza gasped Louise

It sounds wicked doesnt it But it is true Nothing seems to
influence me so strongly as my own whims I know what is good and what
is bad I must have been taught these things once But I am as likely to
do evil as good and this recklessness has begun in the last few days
to worry me

Then I met a young man herehe says his name is Tom Gateswho called
me his dear Lucy and said I used to love him I laughed at him at
first for it seemed very absurd and I do not want him to love me But
then he proved to me there was some truth in his statement He said his
Lucy had a scar on her left arm and that made me afraid because I had
discovered a scar on my own arm I dont know how it got there I dont
know anything about this old Lucy And Im afraid to find out Im
afraid of Lucy

Why dear

I cannot tell I only know I have a horror of her a sudden shrinking
whenever her name is mentioned Who was she do you suppose

Shall I tell you asked Louise

Nono Dont I beg of you cried Eliza starting up II cant
bear it I dont want to know her

The protest was passionate and sincere and Louise marvelled at the
workings of this evidently unbalanced intellect

What would you like to do dear she inquired

Id like to remain Eliza Parsonsalways Id like to get away from
herfar away from anyone who ever heard of that dreadful Lucy who
frightens me so Will you help me to get away to escape to some place
where no one will ever be able to trace me

Do you think you would be happy then

I am sure of it The only thing that makes me unhappy now is the horror
that this past life will be thrust upon me I must have had a past of
course or I shouldnt be a grown woman now But Im afraid of it I
dont want to know anything about it Will you help me to escape

She looked eagerly at Louise as she asked this pitiful question and the
other girl replied softly I will be your friend Eliza Ill think
all this over and we will see what can be done Be patient a little
while and as soon as I find a way to free you from all this trouble Ill
send for you and well talk it over together

Will you keep my secret demanded Eliza uneasily

Louise glanced at the door that communicated with Beths room It stood
open but Eliza had not noticed that as it was behind her Just now a
shadow cast from the other room wavered an instant over the rug and
Louises quick eyes caught it

I promise to keep your secret dear she said earnestly

The two girls rose and stood facing each other Louise kissed the
beautiful Eliza and whispered

Here is one thing for you to rememberthat we are always to be true
friends from this time forward If anyone annoys you come to me and I
will protect you

Thank you Miss Louise said Eliza and then she went away to her own
room in a quieter and more thoughtful mood than usual

When she had gone Louise ran to the door communicating with Beths room
and to her satisfaction found both her cousins with Kenneth Uncle John
and Mr Burke seated in a group where they must have overheard all that
had been said

Well she cried eagerly did you hear And what do you think of it
all

Its Lucy Rogers sure enough said Kenneth

Louise looked at Mr Burke

It is the most singular case that has ever come under my observation
stated that gentleman The girl is perfectly sane but she has suffered
a strange lapse of memory I have two alternatives to advise One is to
telegraph at once for a specialist The other is to permit the girl to
go away as she suggests She will be happier to do so I am sure

Oh no cried the girls

She owes a duty to her parents and friends as well as to herself
said Kenneth and I see no reason why she should be unhappy in the
future as Lucy Rogers

Mr Burke merely shrugged his shoulders

Please wire for the specialist at once said Uncle John




CHAPTER XIX

PATSY INDULGES IN EAVESDROPPING


Miss Patricia Doyle awakened at daybreak next morning with a throbbing
toothache She wasnt accustomed to such pains and found it hard to
bear She tried the application of a hotwater bag and the tooth ached
harder she tried a cold compress and it jumped with renewed activity
So she dressed herself and walked the floor with the persistent ache as
an intimate companion

She tried to find a cavity in the tooth but it seemed perfectly sound
Evidently she had caught cold and the wicked molar was signaling the
fact

To be patient under the torture of a toothache was a virtue Patsy did
not possess Louise and Beth to whom she appealed were sorry for her
but could not relieve the pain After breakfast Uncle John ordered her
to drive to town and see a dentist

Have it pulled or filled or something he said The dentist will
know what to do

So James drove Patsy to town where they arrived about nine oclock this
Monday morning The only dentist at Elmwood was Dr Squiers so the girl
ran up the flight of stairs to his office which was located over the
hardware store

The pain had eased on the journey and now the thought of having the
offending tooth pulled was weighing heavily upon Patsys mind The door
of Dr Squierss office stood ajar and she hesitated whether to enter
or not

The dentists reception room was divided from his operating room by a
thin wooden partition and as Patsy was deciding whether to employ Dr
Squierss services or not she heard high words coming from behind the
partition and the voice was that of the Honorable Erastus Hopkins

Softly she slid into the outer room and sank into a chair

But youre the clerk of the election Squiers you cant deny that
Hopkins was saying in a blustering imperious voice

Thats true enough answered the dentist more calmly

Then youve got the registration books in your possession

I admit that was the reply But youre asking me to incriminate
myself Rast If the thing was discovered it would mean prison for both
of us

Fiddlesticks cried the irascible Hopkins These things are done
every day and no ones the wiser for it Its merely a part of the
political game

Im afraid Rast said Dr Squiers Honest Injun Im afraid

What are you fraid of Ive got the other clerks all fixed and
theyll stand by us All you need do is to add these sixtysix names to
the registration list and then well vote em without opposition and
win out

Patsy gave a gasp which she tried to stifle The toothache was all
forgotten

Where are these men inquired Dr Squiers thoughtfully

Theyre over at the mill Marshall got em from all over the country
and theyll be set to work today so everything will seem reglar

Where do they sleep and eat inquired the doctor

Forty sleep in Hayess barn and the other twentysix in the stock loft
over the planing mill Marshalls got a commissary department and feeds
em regular rations like so many soldiers Of course Im paying for all
this expense acknowledged Mr Hopkins somewhat regretfully

And do you suppose these sixtysix votes will turn the scale asked
Dr Squiers

Theyre sure to We finished the last canvass yesterday and according
to our figures Forbes has about eighteen votes the best of us Thats
getting it down pretty close but we may as well make up our minds were
beaten if we dont vote the men over at the mill Marshall could have
got me a hundred if necessary but sixtysix is more than enough Say
Forbes has twice eighteen for his plurality instead of eighteen these
sixtysix for me would wipe that out and let us win in a walk

When Hopkins ceased there was a brief silence Perhaps Dr Squiers was
thinking

I simply must have those votes Doc resumed the Representative
Its the only way I can win

Youve made a bungle of the whole campaign said Squiers bitterly

Thats a lie Ive done a lot of clever work But these infernal city
girls came down here and stirred up all the trouble

You made a mistake pushing that sign issue The girls beat you on
that

If it hadnt been signs it might have been something worse But I aint
beaten yet Doc Squiers This deal is going to win Its a trick the
boardingschool misses wont understand until after theyve cut their
eyeteeth in politics

Theres a pretty heavy penalty against false registration observed
the dentist gloomily

Theres no penalty unless were found out and there aint the ghost of
a chance of that The books are in your hands I got all the clerks
fixed Not a question will even be raised I know it Do you suppose Id
risk states prison myself if I wasnt sure

Look here Rast said Squiers doggedly youre making a tool of me
in this campaign Why should I be used and abused just to elect Erastus
Hopkins Id like to know You sacrificed me when I might have been
Sheriff

Youre well paid for that Doc

And now you want me to put my neck in a noose for your advantage I
wont do it Rast and thats a fact

Mr Hopkins coughed

How much Doc he inquired

The dentist was silent

State the figure But for mercys sake dont bleed me any more than you
can help This fight has cost me a pretty penny already

I dont want your money growled Squiers

Yes you do Doc I know you better than you know yourself The trouble
with you is youll want too much

Squiers laughed bitterly

Is Marshall to be trusted he asked

Of course If he said a word hed lose his job as manager Marshalls
all right Theres nothing to worry about Doc

Patsys tooth wasnt aching a bit But her heart was throbbing as madly
as the tooth ever did and fortunately there was no pain connected with
the throbbingonly joy

It ought to be worth two thousand dollars Rast said the dentist

What In addition to all other expenses

Why man it means the election It means your whole future If youre
defeated now youre a back number in this district and you know it

Its too much Doc On my word it is

Its too little come to think of it Ill make it three thousand

Doc

If you dont close with me Rast by the jumping Jupiter Ill make it
four thousand cried the dentist with exasperation

Say twentyfive hundred Doc

Right on the nail Give me your check herethis minute

And youll enter the names in the books

Before you leave the office Have you got the list

Yes in my pocket said Mr Hopkins

Then make out your check and Ill get the books

There was a stir behind the partition and a sound of chairs scraping the
floor Patsy slid out the door and flew down the stairs at the imminent
danger of breaking her neck James was seated in the buggy outside
engaged in rumination

Patsy bounded in beside him and startled him

Drive for your life she cried Drive for home

He whipped up the spirited horse and they dashed away Presently the man
asked with a grin

Did it hurt much Miss Patsy

Did what hurt James

The tooth pullin Miss Patsy

The tooth wasnt pulled answered the girl sweetly It didnt need
it James The only thing that was pulled was the Honorable Erastuss
leg




CHAPTER XX

PRICKING A BUBBLE


When Patsy arrived home she called a council of war and related the
conversation she had overheard in the dentists office

It isnt a very nice thing to dolistening to a private conversation
said the girl but when I discovered they were going to play such a
trick on Kenneth I couldnt help eavesdropping

I think you were justified declared Mr Watson with a grave face
for this matter is very serious indeed Tomorrow is election day and
if a toothache hadnt carried you to the dentists office Kenneth would
surely have been defeated

And wed never have known how it happened declared Uncle John

But can the plot be foiled at this late date inquired Louise
anxiously

I think so said Mr Watson Dr Squiers was correct in saying that
such a crime was a states prison offense Our discovery of it will send
both Erastus Hopkins and Dr Squiers to prison Probably Mr Marshall
the manager of the mill will go with them

Oh I dont like that exclaimed Patsy

Nor do I added Kenneth It would be a sad beginning to my political
career to send three such men to prison Id like to avoid it if I
can

Perhaps it may be quietly arranged said the lawyer If they knew you
had discovered the false registration of these men they would never
dare vote them

How would it be to send Mr Burke the detective over to the mill to
talk with Mr Marshall suggested Beth

That is an excellent plan and would be very effective in determining
the manager to abandon the plot

Ill go and see Hopkins myself announced Uncle John I know how to
manage men of his sort

Very good approved the lawyer and Ill see Squiers

If you do said Patsy just ask him to sign a paper saying that Lucy
Rogers was falsely accused of stealing the ring and that his mother
found it in a vase where she had forgotten she put it

Ill do that replied Mr Watson And Ill get the sixty dollars back
that Tom Gates paid him Ill make it a condition of our agreeing not to
prosecute the man

It looks as if we were going to win the election said Uncle John in a
pleased voice If Hopkins was driven to such methods as stuffing
ballotboxes he must know very well hes defeated

He acknowledged it to Dr Squiers said Patsy gaily We have
eighteen sure majority and perhaps more

Its likely to be more predicted Uncle John

I suppose congratulations are in order Ken said Louise

Not yet cousin he replied Wait until tomorrow night and then
dont congratulate me but the campaign managersthree of the nicest
and cleverest girls in existence

Youre right my boy declared Uncle John If you pull through and
take your seat in the Legislature youll owe it all to these girls

That is true smiled the lawyer Kenneth was badly beaten when you
arrived

Of course our girls were very happy at receiving this praise but more
pleased to realize they had actually been of service to their boy
friend They believed that Kenneth would prove a good Representative and
carry out his promises to the voters and if he did that his political
career was assured

Mr Burke appeared in the afternoon with a telegram from Dr Hoyt the
specialist saying that he would be at Elmwood on the noon train
Wednesday His engagements prevented him from coming any sooner and in
the meantime Mr Burke advised keeping a close watch on Eliza Parsons
to see that she did not run away

Ill attend to that said Louise quickly Eliza and I are friends
and Ill take care of her

Arent you going to the polls asked Patsy

No dear why should I go Our work is done now isnt it

Well Im going to the polls and work for every vote declared Patsy
I shant be happy unless Kenneth gets more than eighteen majority

When the Hopkins plot was explained to Mr Burke the detective readily
agreed to go to Fairview and see Mr Marshall As no time was to be lost
he was sent over in an automobile and arrived at the mill just before
the hour for closing

The next day being election day the mill was to be closed and the
manager was very busy in his office when Mr Burke requested to see him

You will have to come around Wednesday said Marshall fussily I
cant attend to you now

Im sorry to disturb you sir replied the detective but my business
wont wait until Wednesday

What is it about sir

About the election

Then I wont be bothered The election doesnt interest me said Mr
Marshall turning away

Very well Ill call Wednesday sir at the jail

Marshall gave him a quick look

Who are you sir he asked

John Burke a detective

The manager hesitated a moment

Come in Mr Burke he said

I represent the Forbes interests said the detective seating himself
in the private office and it has come to our notice that Dr Squiers
has permitted sixtysix fraudulent registrations to be entered on the
books These sixtysix men are supposed to have been imported by you and
are now working at this mill

This is all nonsense protested the manager growing pale

Forty men are sleeping in a nearby barn and twentysix in the
stockroom of the mill added Mr Burke

That isnt criminal sir

No indeed The criminal act is their false registration so far said
the detective blandly

But mark you sir if an attempt is made to vote those men tomorrow I
shall arrest you as well as Mr Hopkins and Dr Squiers

This is preposterous sir blustered the manager There will be no
attempt made to vote them

I am quite sure of it was the reply You may thank Mr Forbes for
warning you in time He wished to save you and so sent me here

Oh he did Mr Marshall was evidently surprised May I ask how you
discovered all this he added

I am not at liberty to give you the details But I may say the exposure
of the plot occurred through Mr Hopkinss own carelessness Ive seen
lots of crooked politicians Mr Marshall but this man is too reckless
and foolish ever to be a success He deserves to be defeated and he will
be

The manager was thoughtful

This is all news to me he declared I needed these extra men to help
me fill a contract on time and so employed them I had no idea Hopkins
and Squiers would try to vote them tomorrow

This was a palpable falsehood but Mr Burke accepted the lame excuse
without question

You are a valuable man in this community Mr Marshall and Mr Forbes
seemed to think the Hopkins people were trying to get you into trouble
Of course it would have caused trouble had these men voted

Of course Mr Burke Im much obliged to Mr Forbes for warning me

Youll find the next Representative a very agreeable man to get along
with Mr Marshall Good day sir

Good day Mr Burke

When the detective had gone Mr Marshall sat in a brown study for a few
moments Then he summoned his superintendent and said

Please ask the men to assemble in the yard before they go home I want
to have a word with them

The request came just in time for the men were already beginning to
stream out of the mill They waited goodnaturedly however grouping
themselves in the big yard

Then Marshall mounted a lumber pile and addressed them briefly

Boys he said I told you all a week or so ago Id like you to vote
for Hopkins for Representative as I believed his election would result
in more work for the mill and better wages for the employees But Ive
been watching matters pretty closely and Ive changed my mind Forbes
is a coming man and hell do more for us all than Hopkins could So
every man who is entitled to vote will please me best by voting for
Kenneth Forbes

There was a cheer at this and when it subsided the manager continued

Of course none of the new men who were not properly registered have a
right to vote at this election and I command them to keep away from the
polls Anyone who attempts to vote illegally will be promptly arrested

This caused more cheering for the workmen had suspected that the new
hands would be voted illegally and they were relieved to find that it
was a square deal all round as one of them remarked with
satisfaction

Meantime Uncle John was having a barrel of fun with Mr Hopkins

The little millionaire although a man of simple and unobtrusive ways
was a shrewd judge of human nature Moreover he had acquired a fund of
experience in dealing with all sorts of people and was delighted to
meet Mr Hopkins under the present circumstances

So he drove over to Elmwood and was fortunate to find Mr Hopkins in his
office at home where he was busily engaged instructing his workers
in their duties at the polls

At sight of Mr Merrick whom he knew by this time to be a friend of
Kenneth Forbes staying at Elmhurst the politician scented some pending
difficulty or at least an argument and was sufficiently interested to
dismiss his men without delay

Ah this is Mr Merrick I believe began Mr Hopkins suavely What
can I do for you sir

Considerable if youre disposed answered the other For one thing
Id like to hire Eliza Parsons away from you

Eliza Parsons gasped the Representative

Yes your spy Elections about over and you wont need her any longer
will you

Sir do you mean to insult me asked the Honorable Erastus
indignantly

By no means I thought you were through with the girl said Uncle John
with a chuckle

Mr Hopkins was distinctly relieved With a full recollection of his
wicked schemes in his mind he had feared some more important attack
than this so he assumed a virtuous look and replied

Sir you wrong me Eliza Parsons was no spy of mine I was merely
trying to encourage her to a higher spiritual life She is rather
flighty and irresponsible sir and I was sorry for the poor girl That
is all If she has been telling tales they are untrue I have found
her I regret to say inclined at times to beahinventive

Perhaps thats so remarked Uncle John carelessly Youre said to be
a good man Mr Hopkins a leetle too honest and straightforward for a
politician but thats an excusable fault

I hope I deserve my reputation Mr Merrick said Erastus
straightening up at this praise I do indeed try to live an upright
life

I guess so Mr Hopkins I guess so You wouldnt try for instance to
encourage false registration

Sir

Anything wrong Mr Hopkins asked Uncle John innocently

Erastus looked at his visitor tremblingly although he tried to control
his nerves Of course Mr Merrick couldnt mean anything by this chance
shot so he must be thrown off the scent

You have a disagreeable way of making remarks sir and I have no time
to listen to foolish speeches Tomorrow is election day and Ive a good
many details yet to arrange

No chance of youre getting in jail is there

What do you mean by that

I only thought that if youd done anything liable to make trouble
youd have to arrange your affairs for a long spell in jail Politicians
sometimes make mistakes But youre such an honest man Mr Hopkins you
couldnt possibly go crooked

Mr Hopkins felt shaky again and looked at his tormentor earnestly
trying to discern whether there was any real knowledge beneath this
innuendo But Uncle John met his gaze with a cheerful smile and
continued

I guess youve got a hard fight ahead of you My young friend Forbes is
trying to get elected himself and you cant both win

Oh yes Forbes said Erastus trying to regain his accustomed ease
A worthy young man sir but Im afraid his chances are slim

Are they now asked Uncle John pretending a mild interest

Pretty thin Mr Merrick Our majority is too great to overcome

What do you think your majority will be About sixtysix

Mr Hopkins gave a start and turned red

About sixtysix he repeated vacantly trying to decide if this was
another chance shot

Yes about sixtysix mill hands

The cat was out of the bag now Hopkins realized that Merrick had some
knowledge or at least suspicion of this plot He tried to think what to
do and it occurred to him that if his visitor positively knew anything
he would not act in this absurd manner but come straight to the point
So he ignored the speech merely saying

Anything else sir

No replied Uncle John Ill go home I guess Folksll be expecting
me Sorry Forbes hasnt got that sixtysix mill hands but Doc Squiers
probably registered em all right and theyll probably vote for
Hopkins

Wait a moment sir cried Erastus as Uncle John was turning away
That speech demands an explanation and I mean to have it

Oh you do Well I dont object You may not know it but Squiers has
registered sixtysix nonvoters and I want to know whether youre
prepared to give half of them to Forbes or mean to keep them all for
yourself

If Squiers has made false registrations he must stand the consequences
I want you to understand sir that I do not countenance any underhand
dealing

Then its all off You wont vote the mill hands

Not a man shall vote who is not properly registered

Im glad to hear it Mr Hopkins Perhaps you can get that twentyfive
hundred back I dont think Squiers has cashed the check yet

The Honorable Erastus gave a roar like a wild bull but Uncle John had
walked quietly out and climbed into his buggy He looked back and
seeing Mr Hopkinss scowling face at the window returned a pleasant
smile as he drove away

Mr Watson had just finished his interview with the dentist when Uncle
John picked him up at the corner The lawyer had accomplished more than
the other two for he had secured a paper exonerating Lucy Rogers and
another incriminating the Honorable Erastus Hopkins as well as the
sixty dollars paid by Tom Gates The dentist was thoroughly frightened
but determined now that the conspiracy was defeated that the man who
had led him to the crime should not escape in case he was himself
arrested So he made a plain statement of the whole matter and signed
it and Mr Watson assured Squiers immunity from arrest pending good
behavior The man had already cashed Hopkinss check and he knew the
Representative could not get the money away from him so after all the
dentist lost nothing by the exposure

It was a jolly party that assembled at the dinnertable in Elmhurst that
evening

You see explained Uncle John the thing looked as big as a balloon
to us at first but it was only a bubble after all and as soon as we
pricked itit disappeared




CHAPTER XXI

THE RETURNS FROM FAIRVIEW


Election day dawned sunny and bright but there was a chill in the air
that betokened the approach of winter

Uncle John had suggested serving coffee to the voters at the different
polling places and Kenneth had therefore arranged for a booth at each
place where excellent coffee was served free all day long These booths
were decorated with Forbes banners and attracted a great deal of
comment as the idea was a distinct innovation in this district

You wouldnt catch Hopkins giving anything away remarked one farmer
to another Rast is too closefisted

Why as fer that was the reply the thing is done to catch votes
You know that as well as I do

Spose it is said the first speaker Id ruther my vote was caught
by a cup of hot coffee on a cold day than by nothin at all If weve
got to bite anyhow why not take a hook thats baited

Patsy and Beth made the rounds of the polling places in an automobile
covered with flags and bunting and wherever they appeared they were
greeted with cordial cheers

Mr Hopkins was noticeable by his absence and this was due not so much
to his cowardice as to an unfortunate accident

Neither Squiers nor Hopkins knew just how their secret had leaked out
for Patsys presence in the dentists office had not been disclosed so
each one suspected the other of culpable foolishness if not downright
rascality After Uncle Johns visit Erastus stormed over to Squierss
office and found his accomplice boiling with indignation at having been
trapped in a criminal undertaking

As the two men angrily faced each other they could not think of any
gentle words to say and Dr Squiers became so excited by the others
reproaches that he indulged in careless gestures One of these gestures
bumped against the Honorable Erastuss right eye with such force that
the eye was badly injured

The candidate for reelection therefore wakened on election morning
with the damaged optic swollen shut and sadly discolored Realizing that
this unfortunate condition would not win votes Mr Hopkins remained at
home all day and nagged his longsuffering spouse whose tongue was her
only defence

The Representative had promptly telephoned to Marshall at Fairview
telling him not to vote the men as arranged He was not especially
charmed with the managers brief reply

Dont be alarmed Were not all fools

I guess Rast remarked Mary Hopkins looking at her damaged and
irritable husband with a blending of curiosity and contempt that
youre bout at the end of your rope

You wait said Erastus grimly This thing aint over yet

The day passed very quietly and without any especial incident A full
vote was polled and by sundown the fate of the candidates had been
decided But the counting seemed to progress slowly and the group
assembled around the telephone in Kenneths library thought the returns
would never arrive

The Republican Committee had given Mr Forbes a table showing what the
vote of each precinct should be according to their canvass

The first report was from Elmwood and showed a gain of seventeen over
the estimate Patsy was delighted for she had worked hard in Elmwood
and this proved that her efforts had been successful Then came a report
from Longville in Jefferson County It showed a gain of fortythree
votes for Hopkins and a consequent loss for Forbes This was a
startling surprise and the next advice from a country precinct in
Washington County showed another gain of twelve for Hopkins

The little group of workers looked at one another with inquiring eyes
and Patsy could hardly refrain from crying

The butler announced dinner but only Louise and Mr Watson could eat
anything The others were too intent on learning their fate and could
not leave the telephone

It seemed queer that the precincts furthest away should be first to
respond but so it was Jefferson County returns began to come in
rapidly and were received in dismal silence Hopkins gained four here
seven there and twentytwo in another precinct

It looks said Kenneth quietly like a landslide for Hopkins and I
wonder how our Committee was so badly informed

You see said Uncle John voters wont usually tell the truth about
how theyve decided to vote Lots of them tell both sides theyre going
to vote their way And people change their minds at the last minute
too You cant do much more than average the thing by means of a
canvass

By nine oclock complete returns from the part of Jefferson County
included in the Eighth District showed a net gain of one hundred and
eight for Hopkinsa lead that it seemed impossible to overcome
Washington County was not so bad Incomplete returns indicated a slight
gain for Hopkins but not more than a dozen votes altogether

Everything now depends upon Dupree and Fairview announced Kenneth
but I cant get any connection with them yet We won in Elmwood
anyhow and Hopkins isnt ahead more than a hundred and sixty as the
thing stands now Cheer up girls A defeat wont hurt us much for
weve all made a good fight Better get to bed and sleep for youre
tired out Well know all about everything in the morning

But they would not move Disappointment unnerved them more than victory
would have done They resolved to wait until the last returns were in

Telephone sir said Tom Gates

Kenneth picked up the receiver

Heres Dupree he said Our majority over Hopkins is two hundred and
eleven Lets see thats a gain of seventyfour votes my dears

Hooray cried Patsy delightedly I dont care a rap now what
happens Old Hopkins wont have much to crow over if

Wait a minute said Kenneth Heres Fairview at last

They held their breaths and watched his face Kenneth flushed red as he
held the receiver to his ear and then grew white He turned around to
the expectant group and Beth knew from the sparkle in his eyes what had
happened

Fairviews six precincts give us six hundred and fortyone majority
announced the boy in an awed tone Thats a gain of nearly four
hundred

They gazed at him in silent wonder Then Uncle John rose slowly and took
the boys hand

That means weve wonand won in a walk said the little man
Kenneth we congratulate you

Patsys face was buried in her handkerchief and Beths great eyes were
bright with unshed tears But Louise laughed her soft musical laugh and
remarked

Why I knew all the time we would win We had the better candidate you
see

And the best campaign managers added Uncle John with a proud smile

That may be true admitted Beth But the thing that really won the
fight was Patsys sore tooth




CHAPTER XXII

THE AWAKENING


James and Mr Burke met the great specialist in brain diseases at the
noon train on Wednesday and drove him to Elmhurst

Dr Hoyt was a handsome grayhaired man with kindly eyes and a
distinguished manner When he was ushered into the library the young
ladies were attracted by the physician at once and from the first
glance were inspired by confidence in his powers Yet Dr Hoyt spoke
rather doubtfully of the case in hand

These cases are not so rare as you might suppose he said yet no two
of them are exactly alike Usually the recovery is slow and tedious but
recovery is not always assured In some instances however the memory
is absolutely restored and from what Mr Burke has explained to me of
Lucy Rogerss history this is what we may expect now Or else we must
trust to time or an accident to awaken her dormant mental faculties The
case is so interesting that I should like with your permission to make
an experiment which can result in no harm if it does not succeed

We put the matter entirely in your hands sir said Uncle John Act
as you think best

I thank you replied Dr Hoyt bowing Then he turned to the girls
Which of you young ladies has won the friendship of Lucy Rogers he
asked

Louise answered that she and Eliza Parsons had become good friends

Will you assist me asked the physician

Willingly sir

I wish to send the girl into a deep sleep to render her unconscious
without her suspecting my intention or realizing the fact Can you
suggest a way to do this

Louise tried to think

What means will you employ sir she asked

There are many ways to accomplish this I prefer to administer a
powerful sleeping potion Have you any confectionery or bonbons at
hand

Yes indeed I have just received a fresh box of bonbons from New
York But Im not sure I can induce Eliza to eat candy

Then let us prepare the potion in various ways But you must be
careful Miss Merrick not to make a mistake and take the dose
yourself

Louise laughed

Ill be careful sir she promised

The two then retired to perfect their plan and in an hour every
arrangement was complete

Louise went to her room donned a wrapper and bandaged her head Then
she summoned Martha and asked the housekeeper to send Eliza Parsons to
sit with her in the darkened room as she was suffering from a headache

The maid came at once to all appearances as happy and careless as
ever After expressing her sympathy she asked what she could do

Just sit down and keep me company dear replied Louise Im not very
bad but Im restless and cant sleep and I want you to talk to me and
amuse me

Eliza laughed

That is easy as far as talking is concerned she said But to amuse
you Miss Louise may be more difficult

But the girls found a topic of conversation in the election in which
Eliza was much interested and they chatted together for an hour or so
before Louise made any move to consummate her plot

I hope my foolish reports to Mr Hopkins did no harm to Mr Forbes
Eliza was saying I really had little to tell him of your conversation
or movements

You did no harm at all for Mr Forbes was elected replied Louise
Then she said carelessly

Martha has sent me this pitcher of lemonade and I dont care for it
Wont you drink a glass Eliza

No thank you she replied shaking her head I never drink
lemonade

Then have one of these sandwiches

Im not hungry Miss Louise

Louise sighed Both the lemonade and the sandwiches had been dosed by
Dr Hoyt Then she picked up the box of bonbons that was beside her

But you will eat some candy dear Every girl likes candy

I dont seem to care for it said Eliza carelessly

Just one piece to please me coaxed Louise and selected a piece from
the box with dainty care Here my dear youll find this sort very
nice

Eliza hesitated but finally reached out her hand and took the bonbon
Louise lay back in her chair and closed her eyes fearing their
eagerness might betray her When after a time she opened them again
Eliza was slowly rocking back and forth and chewing the confection

Dr Hoyts first suggestion had been best The potion had been prepared
in several ways to tempt Eliza but the candy had been the effectual
bait

Louise felt a glow of triumph but managed to continue the conversation
relating in an amusing way the anxiety of the Elmhurst folks when the
first returns seemed to indicate the election of Hopkins

Eliza laughed once or twice her head resting upon the back of her
chair Then the words of Louise began to sound dreamy and indistinct in
her ears The chair rocked with less regularity soon it came to a stop
and Eliza was peacefully sleeping in its ample depths

Louise now rose softly and rang her bell Footsteps approached and a
knock came upon the door She admitted Dr Hoyt Mr Burke and two
servants

The physician approached the sleeping girl and gently lifted the lids of
her eyes Then he nodded with satisfaction

There was no suspicion on her part She made no struggleno attempt to
evade unconsciousness he asked

None at all sir replied Louise She ate the bonbon and was asleep
before she realized it

Excellent said the doctor We will now place her in her own room
upon her bed while Mr Burke and I drive over to her former home to
complete our arrangements

Wont she waken asked Louise

Not until tomorrow morning and when she does I hope for a complete
restoration of her memory

Beth went with Dr Hoyt to the Rogers farm because she knew Mrs
Rogers It was necessary to break the news to the poor blind woman
gently but Beths natural tact stood her in good stead She related the
story of the search for Lucy the discovery that one of the maids at
Elmhurst resembled the missing girl and the detectives conclusion that
Eliza Parsons was none other than Lucy Rogers who was suffering from a
peculiar mental aberration and had forgotten every detail of her former
life

Mrs Rogers followed the tale with intelligent understanding and her
joy at the discovery of her wandering child was only tempered by the
fear that Lucy would never know her mother again or be content to remain
in her humble home

Then Dr Hoyt took up the conversation and related the many instances of
complete recovery that had come under his observation

I am adopting heroic methods in this case said he but I have
reasonable hopes of their success Your child doubtless became mentally
confused while under this roof How many hours she wandered we do not
know but it could not have been long before she lay down by the
roadside and fell asleep When she awakened her mind was a blank as
regards her identity and former history Now in order to effect a
recovery I have reversed these experiences with her She is at present
plunged into a deep sleep under the influence of narcotics that have
rendered her brain absolutely inactive It is really a state of coma
and I wish her to waken in this house amid the scenes with which she
was formerly familiar By this means I hope to induce her mental
faculties to resume their normal functions

Mrs Rogers accepted this proposal with calmness and a confidence in the
physician that was admirable Old Will trembled with nervous excitement
and was so flustered by the importance of the experiment that Dr Hoyt
decided to give him a quieting potion

Lucys room was prepared in the exact manner in which she had left it
and presently the visitors drove back to Elmhurst

In the evening the doctor made the journey a second time accompanying
the unconscious form of Lucy which was attended by a maid Louise had
sent with her

The girl was undressed and put to bed in her own room and then everyone
except Dr Hoyt returned to Elmhurst

The physician sat late in conversation with the blind woman and old
Will and when they retired for the night he lay down upon a lounge in
the little livingroom The question of fees or of comfort was wholly
ignored by the specialist at the moment His sole interest was in his
remarkable case

Mrs Rogers rose at daylight and with old Wills assistance prepared the
breakfast The little table was set in the humble livingroom and the
fragrant odor of coffee pervaded the house Dr Hoyt drank a cup and
then stepped out upon the little porch taking a position of observation
by the window

All right Nell muttered old Will his knees knocking together in
spite of himself

Mrs Rogers rose quietly and walked to the foot of the stairs

Lucy Lucy she called

Yes came a faint reply

Breakfast is ready

Then the two old people sat in suppressed excitement for what seemed to
them an age But the physician calmly stationed at the window knew it
was not very long

Presently a light step sounded upon the stairs and Lucy came into the
room

Good morning mother dear she said a new sweet tenderness in her
voice And then she knelt and kissed the woman upon her brow

The doctor looked at his watch

I must be going he muttered turning away Theres time for me to
catch the early train
