INTRODUCTION


A Vindication of the Press is one of Defoes most characteristic
pamphlets and for this reason as well as for its rarity deserves
reprinting Besides the New York Public Library copy here reproduced
I know of but one copy which is in the Indiana University Library
Neither the Bodleian nor the British Museum has a copy

Like many items in the Defoe canon this tract must be assigned to him
on the basis of internal evidence but this evidence though
circumstantial is convincing WP Trent included A Vindication in
his bibliography of Defoe in the CHEL and later bibliographers of
Defoe have followed him in accepting it Since the copy here
reproduced was the one examined by Professor Trent the following
passage from his ms notes is of interest

     The tract was advertised for this day in the St James
     Evening Post April   It is not included in the
     chief lists of Defoes writings but it has been sold as
     his and the only copy I have seen one kindly loaned me by
     Dr JE Spingarn once belonged to some eighteenth century
     owner who wrote Defoes name upon it I was led by the
     advertisement mentioned above to seek the pamphlet thinking
     it might be Defoes but I failed to secure a sight of it
     until Professor Spingarn asked me whether in my opinion the
     ascription to Defoe was warranted and produced his copy

Perhaps the most striking evidence for Defoes authorship of A
Vindication is the extraordinary reference to his own natural parts
and to the popularity of The TrueBorn Englishman some seventeen
years after that topical poem had appeared pp f Defoe was
justly proud of this verse satire one of his most successful works
and referred to it many times in later writings it is hard to
believe however that anyone but Defoe would have praised it in such
fulsome terms in 

The general homeliness and facility of the style together with
characteristic phrases which occur in his other writings indicate
Defoes hand Likewise homely similitudes and comparisons specific
parallels with his known work and characteristic treatment of matter
familiar in his other works all furnish evidence of his authorship of
this pamphlet

Just what motive caused Defoe to write A Vindication of the Press is
not clear Unlike his earlier An Essay on the Regulation of the
Press  A Vindication does not seem to have been occasioned
by a specific situation and in it Defoe is not alone concerned with
freedom of the press but writes on a more general and discursive
level His opening paragraph states that The very great Clamour
against some late Performances of Authorship and the unprecedented
Criticisms introducd make such an essay as he writes absolutely
necessary Yet there is no clear indication of just what works
occasion this necessity The ironic reference to Mr Dennis at the end
of the first paragraph taken together with the praise of Mr Popes
translation of Homer and the allusion to the malicious and violent
Criticisms of a certain Gentleman in its Disfavour p  might
suggest that Defoe had in mind Dennis Remarks upon Mr Popes
Translation of Homer but even the entire body of writings attacking
Popes Homer would hardly seem sufficient to give point to this
somewhat omnibus and unfocused essay

Equally suggestive perhaps are Defoes references to the Bangorian
controversy and to Bishop Hoadley pp   This controversy raged
from  to  and produced a spate of pamphlets to which Defoe
contributed many of which were marked by heated argument and
acrimony Defoe with his liking for moderation no doubt intended to
make an oblique criticism of the license of many of the Bangorian
tracts But these tracts are certainly not advanced as the prime
occasion for A Vindication

Defoe points out in the first section of his essay how important is
freedom of the press as the foundation of the valuable liberties of
Englishmen I have been unable to find any reference to a specific
threat of regulation of the press at this time that might have
occasioned A Vindication Nevertheless it is possible that
sentiment for control of the press perhaps incited by the Bangorian
controversy was felt in  and may have been a contributing motive
to the composition of this tract Whatever the immediate motives for
writing it may have been the variety of its contents suggests that
Defoe saw an opportunity to turn a penny to express himself on a
number of his pet subjects and to defend his own position as a
professional writer

A Vindication is made up of three clearly marked sections in the
first the author vindicates the usefulness of writing in the second
he discusses the usefulnessit would be more exact to say the
harmfulnessof criticism in the third he expatiates upon the
qualifications of authors One may admit at once the comparative
worthlessness of the pamphlet as a contribution to criticism or
critical theory Defoes comments upon specific writers are thoroughly
conventional and commonplace as may be seen from a glance at his
remarks about Milton Chaucer Spenser Shakespeare and others on p


Of more interest is his very high praise of Dryden a Man for
Learning and universal Writing in Poetry perhaps the greatest that
England has producd p l and his comment upon the critical
detraction from which he suffered He compares Pope interestingly
enough with Dryden remarking that Pope a Person tho Inferior to
Mr Dryden yet speaking Impartially has few Superiors in this Age
also is persecuted by envy and he has generous praise for that poets
translation of Homer One may note that Defoe avoids the shortcomings
of the critics whom he condemns for judging according to party He
distributes his praise indiscriminately between Whig and Tory writers
In short his essay hardly does more than confirm the critical
commonplaces of the time and attest to the catholicity of the authors
taste

Of particular interest for students of Defoe is the paragraph p l
in which Defoe defends the hackwriters who must write for
subsistence One should not expect their writings which are
necessarily numerous to be as correct and finished as they might be
After comparing their pens to prostitutes because of their venality
he claims in a halfironic tone for both authors and booksellers the
liberty of writing and printing for either or both sides without
ignominy After all they must write and print to live Such practice
is certainly he observes no more unjust or disreputable than other
ways of gaining wealth such as one finds in ExchangeAlley

This paragraph gains point when one remembers that Defoe had served
both Whig and Tory governments In  as letters written to Lord
Stanhope in that very year testify he was engaged in the perhaps
dubious business of masquerading as a Tory while actually in the
service of the Whig ministry to take the sting out of the more
violent Tory periodicals and he was much concerned with the danger of
his ambiguous position In December of  he had been identified as
a writer for Mists Weekly Journal the leading Tory paper and was
subjected to growing attacks in the Whig press One can hardly doubt
that this paragraph is a thinly veiled defense of his own practice as
a professional journalist

It is no surprise to find the author of A Vindication in discussing
the qualifications of writers advocating the importance of genius and
Natural Parts above mere learning He instances the author of The
TrueBorn Englishman and Shakespeare the former Characterizd as a
Person of Little Learning but of prodigious Natural Parts and the
latter having but a small share of Literature The further example
of the literary achievements of the Fair Sex who had of course no
university education reminds one of Defoes championship elsewhere of
women The business of a writer is to please and inform and the
general implication is that genius is more necessary to this end than
learning

Also characteristic of Defoe is his emphasis upon the advantage to an
author of conversation the Aliment of Genius the Life of all airy
Performances p Likewise his digression upon education pp
f his charge that people of quality in England all too often
neglect their childrens education his remarks upon the advantages of
travel and the need of training in the vernacular all will be
familiar to readers of Defoe

A Vindication of the Press is chiefly important for the
corroboration of our knowledge of Daniel Defoe It presents nothing
that is new but it gives further evidence of his pride in authorship
of his rationalization of his actions as a professional journalist
and of his belief in the importance of a free press Many of his
characteristic ideas are repeated with his usual consistency in point
of view Although the critical comments in the essay are thoroughly
conventional they offer evidence of contemporary literary judgments
and reveal Defoe as a wellinformed man of moderation and commonsense
though certainly not as a profound critic In the catholicity of his
tastes and interests Defoe is far ahead of his Puritan fellows and
his essay may be taken as one indication of the growing interest of
the middleclasses for whom he wrote in the greater world of
literature As Professor Trent remarks in his ms notes Defoe rarely
wrote a tract without introducing something worthy of attention and
comment and the present pamphlet is no exception to the rule

I should like to thank Dr Henry C Hutchins for his generosity in
making available to me Professor Trents ms notes on A Vindication
and Dr John Robert Moore for his kindness criticisms and
suggestions

Qualification of AUTHORS

Wherein is shewn

That tis for the Advantage of all Governments to encourage Writing
otherwise a Nation would never be secure from the Attempts of its most
secret Enemies Barbarous and prejudicd Criticisms on Writings are
detected and Criticism is justly stated With an Examination into
what Geniuss and Learning are necessary for an AUTHOR in all manner

A Vindication of the PRESS

OR AN ESSAY ON THE Usefulness of Writing c

The very great Clamour against some late Performances or Authorship
and the unpresidented Criticisms introducd render a Treatise on the
Usefulness of Writing in general so absolutely necessary that the
Author of this Essay has not the least Apprehensions of Displeasure
from the most inveterate but on the contrary doubts not an
Approbation even of the Great Mr Dennis

For the Usefulness of Writing in the Church I shall trace back to the
Annals of our Saviour and his Apostles Had not Writing been at that
Time in use what Obscurity might we reasonably have expected the
whole World would have labourd under at this Day when
notwithstanding the Infidels possess such vast Regions and Religion
in its Purity shines but in a small Quarter of the Globe Tis easyto
imagine that without the NewTestament every Person of excellency in
Literature and compleat in Hypocrisy either out of Interest or
other worldly Views would have taken the Liberty to deny the most
Sacred Traditions and to have imposd upon the Populace as many
Religions as they pleasd and that the ignorant Multitude would
easily acquiesce as they do in Turkey and other distant Parts of
the World which deny the Divinity of our Saviour

What fatal Errors Schisms and concomitant Evils would have been
introducd must be apparent to all Persons of the least Penetration
The Quakers might at this Time possibly have been our National Church
and our present Happiness with regard to those Considerations can no
way be more lively and amply demonstrated than in taking a step at
once from Mr Penns Conventicle to the Cathedral Church of St
Pauls

The Regularity and heavenly Decorum of the latter give an Awe and
Transport to the Audience at the same time they ornament Religion and
the Confusion of the former fully shews that as it only serves to
amuse a Crowd of ignorant Wretches unless meerly with temporal Views
Sectarists generally calculating Religion for their Interests so it
gives a License to all manner of Indecencies and the Congregations
usually resort thither with the same Regard as a Rake of the Town
would do to Mother Wybourns or any publick Place of Diversion

Whether it be not natural to have expected a Confusion in the Church
equal to that of the worst Sectaries in the World had not the Use of
Waiting been early attaind and practisd I appeal to the Breast of
every unprejudicd Reader and if so how infinitely happy are we by
the Use of our Sacred Writings which clear up the Cloud of Ignorance
and Error and give a Sanction to our Religion besides the
Satisfaction we of the Church of England have in this felicitous
Contemplation that our Religion since the Reformation strictly
observd is the nearest that of our Saviour and his Apostles of any
Profession of Faith upon Earth

Tis owing to Writing that we enjoy the purest Religion in the World
and exclusive of it there would have been no possibility of
transmitting down entirely those valuable Maxims of Solomon and the
Sufferings of the Righteous Job in the old Testament which are so
extensive to all Parts and Stations of Life that as they are
infinitely preferable to all other Writings of the Kind so they
afford the greatest Comfort and Repose in the Vicisitudes incident to
Humane Nature

How far Theology is improvd from those inestimable Writings I need
not to enlarge since it is highly conspicuous that they are the
Foundation of all Divine Literature and how ignorant and imperfect we
should have been without them is no great difficulty to explain and
who can sufficiently admire the Psalter of David which fills the
Soul with Rapture and gives an Anticipation of sublimest Joys

Besides the Advantages of Sacred Writings in the Cause of Religion
tis chiefly owing to Writing that we have our most valuable
Liberties preservd and tis observable that the Liberty of the
Press is no where restraind but in Roman Catholick Countries or
Kingdoms or States Exercising an Absolute Power

In the Kingdom of France Writings relating to the Church and State
are prohibited upon the severest Penalties and the Consequences of
those Laws are very Obvious to all Persons of Discernment here they
serve to secure the Subject in the utmost Obscurity and as it were
Effect an entire Ignorance whereby an exorbitant Power is chearfully
submitted to and a perfect Obedience paid to Tyranny and the
Ignorance and Superstition of these People so powerfully prevail that
the greatest Oppressor is commonly the most entirely Belovd which I
take to be sufficiently ently Illustrated in the late Lewis the
Fourteenth whose Arbitrary Government was so far from Diminishing the
Affections of his Subjects that it hightend their Esteem for their
Grand Monarch

But of late the populace of France are not so perfectly enclouded
with Superstition and if a young Author can pretend to Divine I
think it is easy to foresee that the papal Power will in a very short
space be considerably lessend if not in a great measure disregarded
in that Kingdom by the intestine Jarrs and Discords of their Parties
for Religion and the Desultory Judgments of the most considerable
Prelates

The best Support of an Arbitrary Power is undoubtedly Ignorance and
this cannot be better cultivated than by an Absolute Denial of
Printing the Oppressions of the Popularity cannot be thoroughly
Stated or Liberty in general Propagated without the use of the Press
in some measure and therefore the Subjects must inevitably submit to
such Ordinances as an Ambitious or Ignorant Monarch and his Tyrannical
Council shall think fit to impose upon them how Arbitrary soever And
the Hands of the Patriots and Men of Eminence who should Illuminate
the Age and open the Eyes of the deluded People are thereby tied up
and the Infelicity of the Populace so compleat that they are incapable
of either seeing their approaching Misery or having a redress of
present Grievances

In Constantinople I think they have no such thing as Printing
allowd on any Account whatsoever all their Publick Acts relating to
the Church and State are recorded in Writing by expert Amanuensiss
so very strict are the Divan and great Council of the Sultan in
prohibiting the Publication of all manner of Writings They are very
sensible had Persons a common Liberty of stating their own Cases they
might Influence the Publick so far that the Yoke of Tyranny must sink
if not be rendred insupportable and this is regarded in all Kingdoms
and Countries upon Earth Governd by a Despotick Power

To what I have already offerd in favour of the Press there may be
Exceptions taken by some Persons in the World and as it is my
Intentions to solve all Objections that may be raisd to what I
advance as I proceed I think I cannot too early make known that I
am apprehensive the following Observations may be made viz that a
general License of the Press is of such a fatal Tendency that it
causes Uneasinesses in the State Confusions in the Church and is
destructive sometimes even to Liberty by putting the ruling Powers
upon making Laws of Severity on a Detection of ill Designs against
the State otherwise never intended

In answer to which I shall give the following Particulars In respect
to Uneasinesses in the State it may not be amiss to premise that it
is esteemd by Men of Penetration no small Wisdom in the present
Administration to bestow Preferments on the brightest and most
enterprising Authors of the Age but whether it be so much out of a
Regard to the Service they are capable of to the State in their
Employs as to their Writing for the Government and to answer
treasonable Pamphlets poisond Pens c I do not take upon me to
determine I must confess where a Faction prevails it gives a
sensible Monarch some Pain to see Disafection propagated by the Press
without any manner of Restraint but then on the other Hand such a
Ruler is thereby let into the Secrets of the Faction he may with
facility penetrate into their deepest Intrigues and be enabled to
avert an impending Storm Upon approach of a Rebellion he will be
thoroughly sensible from what Quarter his greatest Danger is to be
expected whereby it will be entirely his own Fault if he be without
a sufficient Guard against it which he could not be apprizd of with
any certainty without a general Liberty of Writing And tho Slander
must occasion a great deal of Uneasiness to a crownd Head the Power
of bestowing Favours on Friends only is no small Satisfaction to the
Prince and a sufficient Punishment to his Enemies And it is my
Opinion that the Grand Sultan and other Eastern Potentates would be
in a great deal less danger of Deposing a Practice very frequent of
late if in some measure a Liberty of Writing was allowd for the
Eyes of the People would be open as well for as against their Prince
and their fearing a worse Evil should succeed might make them easy
under a present Oppression

As for Confusion in the Church I look upon this to be the greatest
Objection that can be raised but then it must be allowd that
without Writing the Reformation the Glory of our Religion could
never have been effected and in respect to religious Controversies
tho I own they are seldom attended with good Consequences yet I must
beg leave to observe that as the Age we now live in is more bright
and shining in substantial Literature than any preceding Century so
the generality of Mankind are capable of judging with such an
Exactness as to avoid a Bad not but I confess I think many of the
Persons concernd in the Controversy lately on foot with relation to
the Bishop of Bangors Sermon preachd before His Majesty deserve
to be stigmatizd as well for their indecent Heat as for the
Latitude taken with regard to the Holy Scriptures And for the last
Objection I never knew that Writing was any ways destructive to
Liberty unless it was in a Pamphlet entitled KingKilling no
Murder which tis said occasiond the Death of Oliver Cromwel

These are the Uses of Writings in the Church and the State with
Answers to such Objections as may be made against them not to mention
particularly in respect to the former the Writings of the Fathers
and even of some Heathen Philosophers such as Seneca c And
besides the valuable Performances of our most eminent Divines in all
Ages as Dr Taylor Bishop Usher Tillotson Beveridge c and
The whole Duty of Man c in our private Devotions I now proceed
to the Uses in Arts and Sciences

How much Posterity will be obligd to the Great Sir Isaac Newton and
Doctor Flamstead for their Mathematical Writings is more easy to
imagine than the Improvements which may be made from thence theres a
great deal of Reason to believe that if a future Age produces a
Successor to Sir Isaac at present I take it theres none in the
World that not only the Longitude at Sea will be discoverd but the
perpetual Motion so many Ages sought after found out

How much are the Gentlemen of the Law obligd to my Lord Littletons
Institutes and Cokes Commentaries thereupon Writing in this
Profession is esteemd so Essential that theres seldom a Judge quits
the Stage of Life without a voluminous Performance as a Legacy to
the World and theres rarely a Term without some Production of the
Press The Numbers of these Writings are very much augmented by the
various Reports of Cases from Time to Time made and these seem to be
entirely necessary by way of Precedent as a discreet and cautious
Justice will not take upon him to determine a Cause of difficulty
without the Authority of a Precedent

And in the Practice of Physick are not the present Professors
infinitely obliged to the Discoveries and Recipes of Aristotle
Galen c How much the World is obligd to the Declamations of
Tully Cicero for Oratory to the famous Writings of Milton for
the Foundation of Divine Poetry Poetry in general is improvd from
the Writings of Chaucer Spencer and others Dramatick
Entertainments perfected by Shakespear our Language and Poetry
refind by Dryden the Passions raisd by Otway the Inclination
movd by Cowley and the World diverted by Hudibras not to
mention the Perfections of Mr Addison and several others of this
Age I leave to the Determination of every impartial Reader

Tis by Writing that Arts and Sciences are Cultivated Navigation and
Commerce by which alone Wealth is attaind to the most distant parts
of the World Improvd Geography Compleated the Languages Customs
and Manners of Foreign Nations known and there is scarce any one
Mechanick calling of Note or Signification but Treatises have been
written upon to transmit the valuable Observations of Ingenious
Artificers to the latest Posterity

There might be innumerable Instances given of the Advantages of
Writings in all Cases but I shall satisfy my self with the
particulars already advancd and proceed to such Objections as I am
apprehensive may be made relating to the Writings last mentioned
First it may be Objected that the numerous Writings tend more to
confound the Reader than to inform him to this I answer that it is
impossible there can be many Writings produced but there must be some
valuable Informations communicated easy to be Collected by a
judicious Reader tho there may be a great deal superfluous and
notwithstanding it is a considerable Charge to purchase a useful
Library the greatest Grievance yet we had better be at that
Expence than to have no Books publishd and consequently no
Discoveries the same Reason may be given where Books in the Law
Physick c are imperfect in some Part and tend to the misleading
Persons for of two Evils the old Maxim is always chuse the least
The only Objection that I do not take upon me to Defend is that
against Lewd and obscene Poetry in general for sometimes the very
great Wit may make it excuseable which in my Opinion will admit of
but a slender Apology in its Defence

The use of Writing is Illustrated in the following Lines which
conclude my first Head of this Essay

  By ancient Writing Knowledge is conveyd
  Of famous Arts the best Foundation laid
  By these the Cause of Liberty remains
  Are Nations freed from Arbitrary Chains
  From Errors still our Church is purified
  The State maintained with justice on its Side

I now advance to my second Particular Criticism

The fatal Criticism or Damnation which the Writings of some Authors
meet with thro their Obscurity want of Friends and Interest in the
World c is very discouraging to the Productions of Literature
It is the greatest difficulty immaginable for an obscure Person to
Establish a Reputation in any sort of Writing hes a long time in the
same Condition with Sisyphus rolling a heavy Stone against an
aspiring Mount which perpetually descends again it must be to his
benign Stars some lucky Subject suiting the Humour of the Times more
than the Beauty of his Performance which he will be obligd for his
Rise And in this Age Persons in general are so Estrangd from bare
Merit that an Author destitute of Patronage will be equally
Unsuccessful to a Person without Interest at Court and youll as
rarely find the Friendship of an Orestes as the Chastity of
Penelope When a Man of Fortune has no other Task than to give out
a stupid Performance to be of his own Composing and hes immediately
respected as a Celebrated Writer And if a Man has the good Fortune to
hit the capricious Humour of the Age after he has attained a
Reputation with the utmost Difficulty hes sure to meet with the
severest Treatment from a herd of Malicious and Implacable Scriblers

This was the Case of the late Mr Dryden a Man for Learning and
universal Writing in Poetry perhaps the Greatest that England has
producd he was Persecuted by Envy with the utmost Inveteracy for
many Years in Succession And is the Misfortune at this Juncture of
Mr Pope a Person tho Inferior to Mr Dryden yet speaking
Impartially has few Superiors in this Age From these Considerations
it is Evident tho it seems a Paradox that it is a Reputation to be
Scandalizd as a Person in all Cases of this Nature is allowd some
Merit when Envy attacks him and the World might not be sensible of
it in General without a publick Encounter in Criticism and many
Authors would be Buried in Oblivion were they not kept alive by
Clamours against their Performances

The Criticks in this Age are arrivd to that consummate Pitch of
illnature that theyll by no means permit any Person the favour to
Blunder but their mighty selves and are in all respects except the
Office of a Critick in some measure ill Writers I have known an
unnatural Brother of the Quill causless condemn Language in the
Writings of other Persons when his own has really been the meanest
to Accuse others of Inconsistency with the utmost Vehemence when his
own Works have not been without their ras and to find fault with
every Line in a Poem when he has been wholly at a loss to Correct or
at least not capable of Writing one single Page of it

There are another sort of Criticks which are equally illnaturd to
these I have mentiond tho in all other respects vastly inferior to
them They are such as no sooner hear of a Performance composd by a
Juvenile Author or one not hitherto known in the way of Writing he
has undertaken but immediately without reading a Line give it a Stamp
of Damnation not considering that the first Performance of an Author
in any way of Writing done carefully is oftentimes the best and if
they had thoroughly perusd it they were no ways capable of Judging
of either the Sense Language or Beauty of any one Paragraph and
what is still worse these ignorant Slanderers of Writings frequently
take what other Persons report for Authority who know as little or
perhaps are more Ignorant than themselves so little Regard have they
to the Reputation of an Author

And sometimes youll find a pert Bookseller give himself the Airs of
Judging a Performance so far as to Condemn the Correctness of what he
knows nothing of these theres a pretender to Authorship in the City
who Rules the young Fry of Biblioples about the RoyalExchange

But the Booksellers in general tho they commonly Judge of the
Goodness of Writings by the greatness of the Sale are Very sensible
that their greatest Security in respect to the Performance of any
Work is the Qualification of the Person that Composes it the
Confidence they can Repose in him his Capacity Industry and
Veracity And the Authors Reputation is so far concernd in a
Performance which he owns that the Bookseller will sooner rely upon
that than his own Judgment

To descend still to a lower Order of Criticks youll find very few
CoffeeHouses in this opulent City without an illiterate Mechanick
Commenting upon the most material Occurrences and Judging the Actions
of the greatest Councils in Europe and rarely a Victualing House
but you meet with a Tinker a Cobler or a Porter Criticizing upon
the Speeches of Majesty or the Writings of the most celebrated Men of
the Age

This is entirely owing to Party and there is such a Contagion
diffuses it self thro the greatest Part of the World at this Time
that it is impossible for a Man to acquire a universal Character in
Writing as it is inconsistent for him to engage in Writings for both
Parties at one and the same Time whatever he may do alternately
without which such a Character is not attainable and these contending
Parties carry Things to that Extremity that theyll by no means allow
the least Merit in the most perfect Author who adheres to the
opposite Side his Performances will be generally unheeded if not
blasted and frequently damnd as if like Coelus he were capable
of producing nothing but Monsters he shall be in all Respects
depressd and debasd at the same time an illiterate Scribler an
auspicious Ideot of their own with whose Nonsense they are never
sated shall be extolld to the Skies Herein if a Man has all the
Qualifications necessary in Poetry as an Elegance of Style an
Excellency of Wit and a Nobleness of Thought were Master of the most
surprizing Turns fine Similies and of universal Learning yet he
shall be despisd by the Criticks and rangd amongst the damnd
Writers of the Times

The Question first askd is whether an Author is a Whig or a Tory if
he be a Whig or that Party which is in Power his Praise is
resounded hes presently cried up for an excellent Writer if not
hes markd as a Scoundrel a perpetual Gloom hangs over his Head if
he was Master of the sublime Thoughts of Addison the easy flowing
Numbers of Pope the fine Humour of Garth the beautiful Language
of Rowe the Perfection of Prior the Dialogue of Congreve and
the Pastoral of Phillips he must nevertheless submit to a mean
Character if not expect the Reputation of an Illitterate

Writings for the Stage are of late so very much perverted by the
Violence of Party that the finest Performance without Scandal
cannot be supported Shakespear and Ben Johnson were they now
living would be wholly at a Loss in the Composure of a Play suitable
to the Taste of the Town without a promiscuous heap of Scurrility to
expose a Party or what is more detestable perhaps a particular
Person no Play will succeed and the most execrable Language in a
Comedy producd at this Time shall be more applauded than the most
beautiful Turns in a Love for Love Such are the Hardships a
DramatickPoet has to struggle with that either Obscenity Party or
Scandal must be his Theme and after he has performed his utmost in
either of these Ways without a powerful Interest hell have more
Difficulty in the bringing his Play upon the Theatre than in the
Writing and sometimes never be able to accomplish it

These are the Inconveniencies which Writers for the Stage labour
under besides tis observable that an obsequious prolifick Muse
generally meets with a worse Reception than a petulant inanimate
Author and when a Poet has finished his Labours so that he has
brought his Play upon the Stage the best Performance has oftentimes
the worst Success for which I need only instance Mr Congreves Way
of the World a Comedy esteemd by most Persons capable of judging
no way inferior to any of his other Performances

A Choice of Actors next to Interest and Popularity is the greatest
Advantage to a new Play If a StagePoet has the Misfortune not to
have a sufficient Influence over the Managers of the Theatres to make
a Nomination his Performance must very much suffer and if he cannot
entirely Command his Theatre and Season for bringing it on it will
be perfectly slaughterd and a certain Theatre has lately acquird
the Name of a SlaughterHouse but whether more for the Stupidity of
its Poets than its Actors I do not pretend to determine but certain
it is that Acting is the Life of all DramatickPerformances And tho
an indifferent Play may appear tolerable with good Acting it is
impossible a bad one can afford any Entertainment when performd by
an incompleat Set of Comedians

In respect to Writings in general there is an unaccountable Caprice
in abundance of Persons to Condemn or Commend a Performance meerly by
a Name The Names of some Writers will effectually recommend without
making an Examination into the Merit of the Work and the Names of
other Persons equally qualified for Writing and perhaps of greater
Learning than the Former shall be sufficient to Damn it and all this
is owing either to some lucky Accident of writing apposite to the
Humour of the Town wherein an agreeable Season and a proper Subject
are chiefly to be regarded or to Prejudice but most commonly the
Former

It is a Misfortune to Authors both in Prose and Verse who are reducd
to a Necessity of constant writing for a Subsistence that the
numerous Performances publishd by them cannot possibly be so
correct as they might be could more Time be afforded in the
Composure By this Means there is sometimes just room for Criticism
upon the best of their Productions and these Gentlemen
notwithstanding it be never so contrary to their Inclinations are
entirely obligd to prostrate their Pens to the Town as Ladies of
Pleasure do their Bodies tho herein in respect to Party it is to
be observd that a Bookseller and an Author may very well be allowd
occasionally to be of either Party or at least that they should be
permitted the Liberty of Writing and Printing of either Side for
Bread free from Ignominy and as getting Money is the chief Business
of the World so these Measures cannot by any means be esteemd Unjust
or Disreputable with regard to the several Ways of accumulating
Wealth introducd in ExchangeAlley and at the other End of the
Town

It is a common Practice with some Persons in the World either to
prefix the Name of a Mecanas in the Front of their Performances or
to obtain recommendatory Lines from some Person of excellency in
Writing as a Protection against Criticism and there is nothing more
frequent than to see a mean Performance especially if it be done by a
Man of Figure with this Guard

Tis true the worst Performances have the greatest occasion of these
Ramparts but then the Person who takes upon him to Recommend must
have such an absolute Authority and Influence over the generality of
Mankind as to silence all Objections or else it will have a contrary
Turn by promoting a Criticism as well upon the Author as upon
himself for which Reason it is very hazardous for a Person in a
middle Station tho he have never so great a Reputation in Writing
to engage in the Recommendation of the Writings of others

The severe Treatment which the brightest Men of the Age have met with
from the Criticks is sufficient to deter all young Gentlemen from
entring the Lists of Writing and was not the World in general more
goodnaturd and favourable to youthful Performances than the
Criticks there would be no such thing as a Succession of Writings
whereas by that Means and his present Majestys Encouragement
Literature is in a flourishing Condition and Poetry seems to improve
more at this Time than it has done in any preceding Reign except that
of King Charles II when there was a Rochester a Sidley a
Buckingham c And setting aside Party what the World may hope
from a generous Encouragement of polite Writing I take to be very
conspicuous from Mr Popes Translation of Homer notwithstanding
the malicious and violent Criticisms of a certain Gentleman in its
Disfavour

In the religious Controversy of late depending Criticisms have been
carried to that height that some Persons have pretended to fix false
Grammer on one of the most celebrated Writers perhaps at this Time in
Europe but how justly I leave to the Determination of those who
have perused the Bishops incomparable Answer but admitting his
Lordship had permitted an irregularity of Grammer to pass unobserd
typo for unobservd he is not the first of his Sacred Character
that has done it and small Errors of this kind are easily looked
over where the Nominative Case is at a distance from the Verb or a
Performance is done in haste the Case of the Bishop against so many
powerful Adversaries Besides it is apparent and well known that a
certain Person Mr Lessey now with the Chevalier in the World
who has a very great Reputation in Writing never regards the strict
Rules of Grammer in any of his Performances

It is a Satisfaction to Authors of tender Date to see their Superiors
thus roughly handled by the Criticks a young Writer in Divinity will
not think his Case desperate when the shining Bangor has met with
such malevolent Treatment neither must a youthful Poet be uneasy at a
severe Criticism when the Great Mr Addison Rowe and Pope have
been treated with the utmost Scurrility

These Men of Eminence sitting easy with a load of Calumny is a
sufficient Consolation to Inferiors under the most despicable Usage
and there is this satisfactory Reflection that perhaps the most
perfect Work that ever was composd if not so entirely correct but
there may be some room for Criticism by a Man of consummate Learning
for there is nothing more common than to find a Man if not wholly
blind over opiniated in respect to his own Performances and too
exact in a Scrutiny into the Writings of others

The ill Nature attending Criticism I take to be greater now than in
any Age past a Mans Defects in Writing shall not only be exposd
but all the personal Infamy heapd upon him that is possible his
Descent and Education shall be scandalizd as if a fine Performance
was the worse for the Authors Parentage his good Name villified a
History of the Transactions of his whole Life and oftentimes a great
deal more shall be written as if the were a Candidate setting up in
a Burough for Member of Parliament not an airy or loose Action
shall be omitted and neither the Sacred Gown nor the greatest
Dignity shall be exempted but there is this Consideration which sways
the sensible part of Mankind viz a Man of Excellency in Writing
his being generally a Person of more Vivacity than the common Herd
and consequently the more extraordinary Actions in him are allowable
yet nevertheless I think it consistent with Prudence for an Author
when he has the good fortune to compose a Piece which hes assurd
will occasion Envy and Criticism to write his own Life at the same
Time with it tho it be a little extravagant and the method is
unusual to prevent an illnaturd doing thereof by the Hand of
another Person

According to the old Maxim Get a Reputation and lye a Bed not to
mention how many lye a Bed before they can attain it according to the
humorous Turn of the late ingenious Mr Farqubar but theres at
this Time a greater necessity for a Man to be wakeful when he has
acquird a Reputation than at any Time before hell find abundantly
more difficulty attend the Securing than the Attaining of the greatest
Reputation hell meet with Envy from every Quarter Malice will
pursue him in all his undertakings and if he makes any manner of
Defence he cannot commence it too soon tho it is not always
prudential to shew an open Resentment even to the utmost ill
Treatment

If a Man be so considerable as to be thought worthy of Criticism a
luducrous Reprimand is always preferable to a serious Answer
returning Scurrility with ComicSatyr will gaul an illnaturd
Adversary beyond any Treatment whatsoever his Spleen will encrease
equal to any Poison his Rage keep within no Bounds and at length his
Passion will not only destroy his own Performance but himself
likewise And this I take to be natural in our modern Criticks

The Business of these Gentlemen is to set the ignorant Part of Mankind
right In correcting the Errors of pretending Authors and exposing of
Impositions whereby who has Learning and Merit and who has not may
be so apparent that the World may not misplace their Favour but
unless they do it with more Impartiality Temper and Candour than of
late they may with equal prospect of Success endeavour to turn the
current of the Thames as to pervert the Humour of this goodnaturd
Town

I presume to present them with these two Verses

  The learned Criticks learn not to be Civil
  In Spite and Malice personate the Devil

Having now dispatchd the two first Subjects of my Essay viz The
Usefulness of Writing and Criticism I come to my last Head the
Qualification of Authors

I am not of the Opinion of a great many Persons in the World that a
Poet is entirely born such and that Poetry is a particular Gift of
Heaven not but I confess there is a great deal in natural Genius
which I shall mention hereafter

It is consistent with my Reason that any Man having a share of
Learning and acquainted with the Methods of Writing may by an
assiduous Application not only write good Poetry but make a
tollerable Figure in any sort of Writings whatsoever and herein I
could give numerous Instances of Authors who have written all manner
of Ways with success Neither can I acquiesce in the common Notion
that the Person who begins most early in Poetry always arrives to the
greatest Perfection for in my Opinion it is a Matter of no great
difficulty for a Person of any Age before his Vivacity is too much
abated and Fire exhausted to commence a Poet the great Mr Dryden
not beginning to Write till he was above the Age of  and I doubt
not but a great many Persons have lost themselves for want of putting
their Geniuss to the Trial and making particular Writings their
particular Studies

Their is no Practice more frequent than for an Author to misapply his
Genius and there is nothing more common than for a Man after
numerous Trials in almost all sorts of Authorship to make that his
favourite Writing which he is least capable of performing and too
frequently Authors use their Geniuss as Parents do their Children
place them to such Businesses as make the most considerable Figure in
the World without consulting their Qualifications

There are many other Faults equal to these as where Authors through
overmuch Timerity or too great Opinion of their own Performances
permit their Writings to pass with egregious Errors and I take it to
be equally pernicious for a Man to be too diffident of his own
Performances as it is to be presuming There are likewise some
Gentlemen who by a lazy Disposition or through over much Haste an
impatience in dispatch to gain an early Reputation commit Blunders
almost to their immediate Ruin but many of these Errors are commonly
excusd in an Author by a condescending Printer who is obligd to
take the Errata upon himself

In Prose a slight Examination of a Performance may suffice but in
Poetry it cannot be too often repeated and in this way of Writing
haste is attended with a fatal Consequence To compose your Lines in
perfect Harmony of easy flowing Numbers fine Flights and Similies
and at the same Time retain a strong Sense which make Poetry
substantially Beautiful is a Work of Time and requires the most
sedate Perusals And though some Persons think giving Poetry the
Character of easy Lines to be a Disgrace it is rightly considered the
greatest Reputation and Honour they can do it the utmost Difficulty
attending this easy Writing and there are very few Persons that can
ever attain it

But to leave these general Observations I proceed to my Point in
Hand the Qualification of Authors Though I shall first take Notice
that the Business of every Author is to please and inform his Readers
but how difficult it is to please through the prevalence of Parties
Envy and Prejudice needs no Illustration and some Persons in the
World are so very perverse and obstinate that they will not be
informd by a Person they entertain no good Opinion of For writing
Prose a Man ought to have a tollerable Foundation of Learning at
least to be Master of the Latin Tongue to be a good Historian and to
have a perfect Knowledge of the World and besides these
Qualifications in Poetry as I have before observd a Writer should
be Master of the most refind and beautiful Language surprizing
Turns fine adapted Similes a sublimity of Thought and to be a
Person of universal Learning Though I have often observd both in
Prose and Verse that some Persons of strong Genius well acquainted
with the World and but of little Learning have made a better Figure
in some kinds of Writings than Persons of the most consummate
Literature not blessd with natural Genius and a Knowledge of
Mankind

The preference of Genius to Learning is sufficiently Demonstrated in
the Writings of the Author of the True born English Man a Poem
that has Sold beyond the best Performance of any Ancient or Modern
Poet of the greatest Excellency and perhaps beyond any Poetry ever
Printed in the English Language This Author is Characterizd as a
Person of little Learning but of prodigious Natural Parts and the
immortal Shakespear had but a small share of Literature It is
likewise worthy Observation that some of our most entertaining
Comedies Novels and Romances have been Written by the fair Sex who
cannot be supposd to have Learning in any Degree equal to Gentlemen
of a University Education And in North Britain where Literature
shines amongst the Persons of middle Station an Ounce of Natural
Parts speaking in a common way of Comparison is Esteemd of greater
Value than a Pound of Learning

A Person of Learning without Genius and Knowledge of the World is
like an Architects Assistant whose only Business is to Draw the
Draught or Model of a Pile of Building hes at a loss in the
Materials necessary for compleating the Structure tho he can Judge
of its Beauty when Perfected and may be compared to a Man that has
the theory in any Art or Science but wants the Practice

And a meer Scholar is the most unacceptable Companion upon Earth He
is Rude in his Manners Unpolishd in his Literature and generally
IllNaturd to the last Degree hes Company for a very few Persons
and Pleasing to None his Pride exalts him in SelfOpinion beyond all
Mankind And some of the sucking Tribe of Levi think the Gown and
Cassock alone Merit a Respect due to the greatest Personages and
that the broad Hat with the Rose should be Adord tho it covers a
thick and brainless Skull

But these are a few only there are great Numbers of the Clergy who
deserve the utmost Respect and are justly paid more than they desire
and no Person can have a greater Regard for that sacred Body than my
self as I was not only intended for a Clergyman but have several
Relations now in being of that venerable Order Tho I am obligd to
take Notice that the Authors of the Gown in general treat the World
with greater Insolence and Incharity than any LayPersons whatsoever

Theres nothing more frequent than to find the Writings of many of
our Modern Divines not only Stiff and Harsh but full of Rancour and
to find an easy Propensity and Complaisance in the Writings of the
Laity a Gentleman without the Gown commonly Writes with a genteel
Respect to the World abundance of good Temper and a condescension
Endearing when a brawny Priest shall shew a great deal of
Illnature give indecent Reflections and affrontive Language and
oftentimes be Dogmatical in all his Performances

Whether this be owing more to Pride than a want of an Easy Free and
polite Conversation I do not take upon me to Determine but I believe
it must be generally Imputed to the Former as it cannot be supposd
that either of the Universities are at any time without a polite
Converse tho I take leave to observe that there is a great deal of
difference between a finishd Oxonian and a sprightly Senator

This is Demonstrated in the Speeches from Time to Time made in the
Senate and the Synod the Stile and Composure of the one is no way to
be compard to the other tho the Sense be equally strong theres an
Elegancy and Beauty of Expression in the Former not to be met with in
the Latter Oratory no where to be exceeded and an Affluence of Words
not to be met with in any other Speeches whatsoever and I believe it
must be generally allowd that there is a very great difference in the
common Conversation particularly in point of Manners of the Members
of those August Assemblies

A good Conversation is the greatest Advantage an Author can possibly
Enjoy by a variety of Converse a Man is furnishd with a perpetual
Variety of Hints and may acquire a greater Knowledge on some Subjects
in the space of a few Minutes than he can attain by Study in a
Succession of Weeks tho I must allow Study to be the only
Foundation for Writing twas owing to a good Conversation that those
Entertaining Papers the Tatlers were publishd by Sir Richard
Steel the Examiner carried on by Mr Oldsworth and tis
impossible a perfect good Comedy can be written by any Person without
a constant Resort to the best Conversation whereby alone a Man will
be Master of the best Thoughts

In short Conversation is the Aliment of the Genius the Life of all
airy Performances as Learning is the Soul the various Humours of
Mankind upon all Occasions afford the most agreeable Subjects for
all sorts of Writings and I look upon any Performance tho done by a
Person celebrated for Writing without the use of Conversation in
some measure incompleat

If an Author be enclind to write for Reformation of Manners let him
repair to St Pauls or WestminsterAbbey and observe the indecent
Behaviour of multitudes of Persons who make those Sacred Places
Assignations of Vice if you are enclind to lash the Follies and
Vanities of the fair Sex retire to the Tea Table and the Theatre if
your Business be to compose a Sermon or you are engagd in
Theological Studies resort to Childs CoffeeHouse in St Pauls
ChurchYard if you are desirous to depaint the Cheat and the
Trickster I recommend ye to the RoyalExchange and the Court End of
the Town and if you would write a Poem in imitation of Rochester
you need only go to the Hundreds of Drury and youll be
sufficiently furnishd with laudable Themes

But Converse at home falls infinitely short of Conversation abroad
and the Advantages attending Travelling are so very great that they
are not to be expressd this finishes Education in the most effectual
manner and enables a Man to speak and write on all Occasions with a
Grace and Perfection no other way to be attaind The Travels of a
young Gentleman have not only the effect of transplation of
Vegetables in respect to the encrease of Stature but also the
Consequence of the most beautiful Pruning How much the Gentlemen of
Scotland owe their Capacities to Travelling is very obvious there
being no Person of Quality in that Kingdom but expends the greatest
part of his Fortune in other Countries to reap the Benefit of it in
personal Accomplishments and a greater Commendation than this to the
Scots is the bestowing the best of Literature upon all manner of
Youth educated amongst them

Whilst the Men of Quality here very often neglect giving their
Children the common and necessary Learning and too frequently entrust
their Education with lazy ignorant and incogitant Tutors not to
mention the Supineness of Schoolmasters in general throughout
England the NorthBritains labour in this Particular
indefatigably as they are very sensible that Learning is the greatest
Honour of their Country and the ancient Britains come so near the
Scots that amongst the common Persons in some Parts of Wales
you may meet with a Ploughman that speaks tollerable Latin and a
Mason like the famous Ben Johnson with his Horace and a Trowel

The want of a generous Education is an irretrieveable Misfortune and
the Negligence of an Inspector of the Literature of Youth ought to be
unpardonable how many Persons of Distinction have cursd their aged
Parents for not bestowing on them a liberal Education And how many of
the Commonalty have regretted the mispending of the precious Time of
Youth A Man arrivd to Maturity has the Mortification of observing an
Inferior in Circumstances superior in Literature and wants the
Satisfaction of giving a tollerable Reason for any Thing he says or
does or in any respect to judge of the Excellency of others and in
my Opinion a generous Education with a bare Subsistence only is to
be preferrd to the largest Patrimony and a want of Learning

Without Education it is impossible to Write or Read any Thing
distinctly without a frequent turning of the Dictionary no Person
can be compleat in the English Language neither can he give Words
their proper Accent and Pronunciation or be any ways Master of
Elocution and a Man without Learning though he appears tollerable in
Conversation which I have known some Persons do by a constant
enjoyment of good Company and a strength of Memory is like an
Empirick that takes Things upon trust And whenever he comes to
exercise the Pen that the Subject is uncommon and Study is requird
youll find him oftentimes not capable of writing one single Line of
Senfe and scarcely one Word of English And on the other Hand I
have known some Persons who could talk Latin very fluently who have
usd Phrases and Sentences perpetually in that Language in
Conversation vulgar and deficient in the MotherTongue and who have
written most egregious Nonsense from whence it is evident that
Writing is the only Test of Literature

I have a little deviated from my Subject in pursuing the Rules and
Advantages of Education which I take to be of that universal good
Tendency that they are acceptable in any Performance whatsoever I
shall offer nothing farther but conclude this Essay with the
following Particulars that besides the Qualifications already
mentiond it is as necessary for a fine Writer to be endued with
Modesty as for a beautiful Lady that good Sense is of equal
Consequence to an Author as a good Soil for the Culture of the most
noble Plants that a Person writing a great deal on various Subjects
should be as cautious in owning all his Performances as in revealing
the Secrets of his most intimate Friend and in respect to those
Gentlemen who have made no scruple to prostitute their Names the
following Similie may be judgd well adapted

  As Musick soft by constant use is forcd
  Grows harsh and cloys becomes at length the worst
  The Harmony amidst Confusion lost
  So finest Pens employd in Writing still
  Lose Strength and Beauty as the Folios fill
