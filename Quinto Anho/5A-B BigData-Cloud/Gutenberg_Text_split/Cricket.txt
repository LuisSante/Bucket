DEDICATION TO HRH THE PRINCE OF WALES


  BADMINTON June 

Having received permission to dedicate these volumes the BADMINTON
LIBRARY of SPORTS and PASTIMES to HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF
WALES I do so feeling that I am dedicating them to one of the best and
keenest sportsmen of our time I can say from personal observation
that there is no man who can extricate himself from a bustling and
pushing crowd of horsemen when a fox breaks covert more dexterously
and quickly than His Royal Highness and that when hounds run hard
over a big country no man can take a line of his own and live with
them better Also when the wind has been blowing hard often have I
seen His Royal Highness knocking over driven grouse and partridges and
highrocketing pheasants in firstrate workmanlike style He is held to
be a good yachtsman and as Commodore of the Royal Yacht Squadron is
looked up to by those who love that pleasant and exhilarating pastime
His encouragement of racing is well known and his attendance at the
University Public School and other important Matches testifies to
his being like most English gentlemen fond of all manly sports I
consider it a great privilege to be allowed to dedicate these volumes
to so eminent a sportsman as His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales
and I do so with sincere feelings of respect and esteem and loyal
devotion

PREFACE


A few lines only are necessary to explain the object with which these
volumes are put forth There is no modern encyclopdia to which the
inexperienced man who seeks guidance in the practice of the various
British Sports and Pastimes can turn for information Some books there
are on Hunting some on Racing some on Lawn Tennis some on Fishing
and so on but one Library or succession of volumes which treats
of the Sports and Pastimes indulged in by Englishmenand womenis
wanting The Badminton Library is offered to supply the want Of the
imperfections which must be found in the execution of such a design we
are conscious Experts often differ But this we may say that those
who are seeking for knowledge on any of the subjects dealt with will
find the results of many years experience written by men who are in
every case adepts at the Sport or Pastime of which they write It is to
point the way to success to those who are ignorant of the sciences they
aspire to master and who have no friend to help or coach them that
these volumes are written

To those who have worked hard to place simply and clearly before the
reader that which he will find within the best thanks of the Editor
are due That it has been no slight labour to supervise all that
has been written he must acknowledge but it has been a labour of
love and very much lightened by the courtesy of the Publisher by
the unflinching indefatigable assistance of the SubEditor and by
the intelligent and able arrangement of each subject by the various
writers who are so thoroughly masters of the subjects of which they
treat The reward we all hope to reap is that our work may prove useful
to this and future generations

CRICKET




CHAPTER I

THE HISTORY OF CRICKET

BY ANDREW LANG

Archology of the Game


Hundreds of pages have been written on the origin and early history of
Cricket The Egyptian monuments and Holy Scriptures the illuminated
books of the Middle Ages and the terracottas and vases of Greece
have been studied to no practical purpose by historians of the game
Outside of England and before the fortieth year of the reign
of Elizabeth there are no documents for the existence of cricket
Doubtless in rudimentary and embryonic forms it may have existed Of
those forms we still possess a few as rounders and stoolball and
we can also study degraded shapes of cricket which naturally revert to
the early germs of the pastime as degenerate human types throw back to
the monkey There is a sport known at some schools as stumpcricket
snobcricket or mysteriously and locally as Dex which is
a degenerate shape of the game and which is probably very like the
rudimentary shapes These degradations are reversals or returns to
primitive forms

A ball more or less light and soft is bowled or tossed at any fixed
object which in turn is defended by a player armed with a stick
stump hairbrush or other instrument The player counts as many
points as he can run backwards and forwards after hitting the ball
between the object he defends and some more or less distant goal
before the ball is returned He loses his position when the object
he defends is struck by the ball or when the ball is caught after
he has hit it before touching the ground Such is the degraded form
of cricket and such apparently was its earliest shape Ancient
surviving forms in which a similar principle exists are rounders
and stoolball The former has been developed in America into the
scientific game of baseball the name being Old English while the
scientific perfection is American It is impossible to trace cricket
farther back than games in which points are scored in proportion to
the amount of ground that the hitter can cover before the return of
the struck ball Now other forms of ballplay as tennis in different
guises can be found even among the ancient Aztecs while the Red
Indians practised the form which is hockey among us and the French and
Walloons have sports very closely corresponding to golf but games with
the slightest analogy to cricket are very rare Stoolball is the most
important foreshadowing of cricket As early as  Chapman in his
translation of the sixth book of the Odyssey makes Nausicaa and her
girls play stoolball Chapman gives certain technical terms which
of course have nothing corresponding to them in Homer but which are
valuable illustrations of the English game

Nausicaa seems to have received a trial ball

    Nausicaa with the wrists of ivory
    The likingstroke struck

Again

    The Queen now for the upstroke struck the ball
    Quite wide of th other maids and made it fall
    Amidst the whirlpools

thereby doubtless scoring a lost ball He describes this as a
stoolball chance Chapman does not say whether the ball was bowled to
Nausicaa Everything shows that Dr Johnson was writing at random when
he described stoolball as a game in which a ball is driven from stool
to stool Chapman conceives Nausicaa as making a boundary hit There
would be no need of such hitting if balls were only driven from stool
to stool

Strutts remarks on stoolball merely show that he did not appreciate
the importance of the game as an early form of cricket I have been
informed he says that a pastime called stoolball is practised to
this day in the northern parts of England which consists simply in
setting a stool upon the ground and one of the players takes his place
before it while his antagonist standing at a distance tosses a ball
with the intention of striking the stool and this it is the business
of the former to prevent by beating it away with his hand reckoning
one to the game for every stroke of the ball apparently without
running If on the contrary it should be missed by the hand and
strike the stool the players change places Strutt adds in a note
that he believes the player may be caught out He describes another
game in which stools are set as bases in a kind of baseball He
makes the usual quotations from Durfey about a match for kisses at
stoolball to play

Brands notes on stoolball do no more than show that men and women
played for small wagers as in Herrick

    At stoolball Lucia let us play
      For sugar cakes and wine

It is plain enough that stoolball was a game for girls or for boys
and girls and Herrick and Lucia As at present played stoolball is
a womans game but no stool is used what answers to the wicket is a
square board at a certain height on a pole much as if one bowled at
the telegraph instead of the stumps Consequently as at baseball
only full pitches can be tossed However in stoolball we recognise
the unconscious beginnings of better things As much may be said for
catanddog This may be regarded either as a degraded attempt at
early cricket played by economists who could not afford a ball or
as a natural volkskriket dating from a period of culture in which
balls had not yet been invented The archologist will prefer the
latter explanation but we would not pedantically insist on either
alternative In Jamiesons Scotch Dictionary catanddog is
described as a game for three Two holes are cut at a distance of
thirteen yards At each hole stands a player with a club called a
dog A piece of wood four inches long by one in circumference
is tossed in place of a ball to one of the dogsmen His object is to
keep the cat out of the hole If the cat be struck he who strikes it
changes places with the person who holds the other club and as often
as the positions are changed one is counted as won in the game by the
two who hold the clubs Jamieson says this is an ancient sport in
Angus and Lauder A man was bowled when the cat got into the hole he
defended We hear nothing of caught and bowled

Catanddog or more briefly cat was a favourite game with John
Bunyan He was playing when a voice from heaven as he imagined
suddenly darted into his soul with some warning remarks as he was
about to strike the cat from the hole The cat here seems to have
been quiescent Leaving my cat on the ground I looked up to Heaven
and beheld a vision Let it be remembered that Bunyan was playing on
Sunday The game of cat as known to him was apparently rather a
rude variety of knurr and spell than of cricket This form is mentioned
by Strutt Both stoolball and catanddog have closer affinities
with cricket than clubball as represented in Strutts authorities
Perhaps we may say that wherever stoolball was played or catanddog
there cricket was potentially present As to the derivation of the word
cricket philologists differ as much as usual Certainly cricket
is an old word for a stool though in this sense it does not occur
in Skeat In Todds Johnson we find Cricket a low seat or
stool from German kriechen to creep In Scotland we talk of a
creepystool

    Its a wise wife that kens her weird
      What though ye mount the creepy

says Allan Ramsay meaning the stool of repentance If then
stoolball be the origin of cricket and if a cricket be a stool
cricket may be merely a synonym for stoolball Todds Johnson
with ignominious ignorance styles cricket a sport in which the
contenders drive a ball with sticks or bats in opposition to each
other Johnson must have known better In the Rambler No  he
writes Sometimes an unlucky boy will drive his cricketball full in
my face Observe he says drive not cut nor hit to leg

Professor Skeat says nothing of this derivation of cricket from
cricket a stool He thinks et may be a diminutive added to the
AngloSaxon cricc a staff If that be so cricket will mean
clubplay rather than stoolball In any case Professor Skeat has a
valuable quotation of cricket from the French and English Dictionary
compiled in  by Mr Randle Cotgrave He translates the French
crosse a crosier or bishops staffe also a cricket staffe
or the crooked staffe wherewith boies play at cricket Now the name
of the club used in French Flanders at the local kind of golf is la
crosse It is a heavy barbaric kind of golfclub

Thanks to Cotgrave then we know that in  cricket was a boys
game played with a crooked staff The club bat or staff continued
to be crooked or curved at the blade till the middle of the eighteenth
century or later and till nearly  cricket was mainly a game for
boys We may now examine the authorities for the earliest mentions of
cricket

People have often regarded Florios expression in his Italian
Dictionary  cricketawicket as the first mention of the noble
game It were strange indeed if this great word first dropped from
the pen of an Italian The quotation is sgrittare to make a noise
as a cricket to play cricketawicket and be merry I have no
doubt myself that this is a mere coincidence of sound The cricket
on the hearth is a merry little beast or has that reputation The
term cricketawicket is a mere rhyming reduplication of sounds like
hobnob or tooralooral or the older Torelore the name of a
mythical country in a French romance of the twelfth century It is
an odd coincidence no doubt that the rhyming reduplication should
associate wicket with cricket But for all that cricketawicket
must pair off with helterskelter higgledypiggledy and
Tarabara to which Florio gives cricketawicket as an equivalent

Illustration Miss Wicket From an old print 

Yet cricket was played in England by boys at least in Florios
time The proof of this exists or existed in the Constitution
Book of Guildford a manuscript collection of records once in the
possession of that town In the History of Guildford an anonymous
compilation published by Russell in the Surrey town and by Longmans
in London  there are extracts from the Constitution Book
They begin with a grant anno li Ed III For our purpose the only
important passages are pp   In the thirtyfifth year of
Elizabeth one William Wyntersmoll withheld a piece of common land
to the extent of one acre from the town Forty years before John
Parvishe had obtained leave to make a temporary enclosure there
and the enclosure had never been removed In the fortieth year of
Elizabeth this acre was still in dispute when John Derrick gent aged
fiftynine one of the Queens Coroners for the county gave evidence
that he knew it fifty years ago or more It lay waste and was used
and occupyed by the inhabitants of Guildeford to saw timber in and for
sawpitts When he was a scholler in the free school of Guildeford
he and several of his fellowes did run and play there at crickett and
other plaies

This is the oldest certain authority for cricket with which I am
acquainted Clearly it was a boys game in the early years of
Elizabeth Nor was it a very scientific game if it could be played on
a wicket agreeably diversified by sawpitts William Page may have
played cricket at Eton and learned to bat as well as to hick and hack
which they will do fast enough of themselves and to cry horum It
has already been shown that in  boyes played at crickett with
a crooked bat or cricketstaffe

In  we get a view of a summer day at Aleppo and of British sailors
busy at the national game

Henry Teonge Chaplain on board HMS ships Assistance Bristol
and Royal Oak Anno  to  writes

    At Aleppo

 This morning early as it is the custom all summer longe at the
 least  of the English with his worship the Consull rod out of the
 cytty about  miles to the Greene Platt a fine vally by a river syde
 to recreate them selves Where a princely tent was pitched and wee
 had severall pastimes and sports as duckhunting fishing shooting
 handball krickett scrofilo and then a noble dinner brought thither
 with greate plenty of all sorts of wine punch and lemonads and at 
 wee returne all home in good order but soundly tyred and weary

When once the eighteenth century is reached cricket begins to find
mention in literature Clearly the game was rising in the world and
was being taken up like the poets of the period by patrons Lord
Chesterfield whom Dr Johnson found a patron so insufficient talked
about cricket in a very proper spirit in  If you have a right
ambition you will desire to excell all boys of your age at cricket
 as well as in learning That is the right style of fatherly
counsel but Philip Stanhope never came to European reputation as
midwicketon like a hero of Mr James Payns Lord Chesterfield
also alludes to your various occupations of Greek and cricket Latin
and pitchfarthing very justly coupling the nobler language with the
nobler game Already in the fourth book of the Dunciad line  Mr
Alexander Pope had sneered at cricket At what did Mr Pope not
sneer The fair the wise the manlyMrs Arabella Fermor Lady Mary

Cricket was played at Eton early Gray writing to West says
There is my Lords Sandwich and Halifaxthey are statesmendo you
not remember them dirty boys playing at cricket In  Walpole
writes I cant say I am sorry I was never quite a schoolboy an
expedition against bargemen or a match at cricket may be very pretty
things to recollect but thank my stars I can remember things very
near as pretty The bargee might have found an interview with Miss
Horace pretty to recollect but when Horace pretends that he might have
been in the Eleven if he liked the absurdity becomes too glaring We
are reminded of Charles Lambs Here is Wordsworth saying he might
have written Hamlet if he had had the mind Cowper pretends in
 that as a boy I excelled at cricket and football but he adds
with perfect truth the fame I acquired by achievements that way is
long since forgotten The author of the Task and of a good many
hymns was no Mynn nor Grace We shall find but few of the English
poets distinguished as cricketers or fond of tuning the lyre to sing
Pindaric strains of batters and bowlers Byron tells a friend how
they together joined in crickets manly toil  Another noble
exception is George Huddesford author of Salmagundi  p


    But come thou genial son of spring
    Whitsuntide and with thee bring
    Cricket nimble boy and light
    In slippers red and drawers white
    Who oer the nicely measured land
    Ranges around his comely band
    Alert to intercept each blow
    Each motion of the wary foe

This passage gives us the costumewhite drawers and red slippers The
contemporary works of art whereof see a little gallery on the walls
of the pavilion at Lords show that men when they played also wore
a kind of jockey cap In a sketch of the Arms of Shrewsbury School
little boys are playing the bat is a kind of hockeystick as in the
preceding century There are only two stumps nor more in Haymans
wellknown picture engraved  The fields are well set for the
bowling and are represented with their hands ready for a catch There
are umpires in their usual places the scores are kept by men who cut
notches in tallysticks Such notches were got by Miss Wicket a
sportive young lady in a somewhat later caricature p  The ball
 has heavy crossseams But a silver ball about a hundred years
old used as a snuffbox by the Vine Club at Sevenoaks is marked with
seams like those of today Miss Wicket also carries a curved bat
but it has developed beyond the rustic crooked stick and more nearly
resembles some of the old curved bats at Lords with which a strong
man must have hit prodigious skyers We may doubt if bats were ever
such threeman beetles as the players in an undated but contemporary
picture at Lords do fillip withal The fields in this curious
piece are all in a line at squareleg and disappear in a distance
unconscious of perspective

Cricket had even before this date reached that height of prosperity
which provokes the attention of moralists Here is a fine morning
let us go and put down some form of enjoyment says the moralist In
 a writer in the Gentlemans Magazine was moved to allege that
the exercise may be strained too far Cricket is certainly a very
good and wholesome exercise yet it may be abused if either great or
little people make it their business The chief complaint is that
great and little people play togetherbutchers and baronets Cricket
propagates a spirit of idleness at the very time when with the
utmost industry our debts taxes and decay of trade will scarcely
allow us to get bread The Lydians according to Herodotus invented
games to make them forget the scarcity of bread But the gentleman in
the magazine is much more austere than Herodotus The advertisements
most impudently recite that great sums are laid and it was indeed
customary to announce a match for l or l Whether these
sums were not drawn on Fancys exchequer at least in many cases we
may reasonably doubt In his English Game of Cricket p  the
learned Mr Box quotes a tale of betting in  from a document which
he does not describe It appears that in  the county of Kent played
All England and money was lost and won and there was a lawsuit to
recover The court said Cricket is to be sure a manly game and not
bad in itself but it is the illuse that is made of it by betting
above l on it that is bad To a humble fiver on the University
match this court would have had no kind of objection to make The
history of betting at cricket is given by Mr Pycroft in the Cricket
Field chap vi A most interesting chapter it is

The earliest laws of the game or at least the earliest which have
reached us are of the year  A committee of noblemen and gentlemen
including Sir Horace Mann the Duke of Dorset and Lord Tankerville
drew them up at the Star and Garter in Pall Mall The pitching of
the first wicket is to be determined by the toss of a piece of money
Does this mean that the sides tossed for which was to pitch the wicket
As Nyren shows much turned on the pitching of the wicket Lumpy
Stevens would invariably choose the ground where his balls would
shoot In the rules of  the distance between the stumps is
the same as at present The crease is cut not painted The stumps
are twentytwo inches in height there is only one bail of six inches
in length No ball as far as crossing the crease goes is just like
no ball today Indeed the game was essentially the game of today
except that if a ball were hit the other player may place his body
anywhere within the swing of his bat so as to hinder the bowler from
catching her but he must neither strike at her nor touch her with his
hands

At this moment of legislation when the dim heroic age of cricket
begins to broaden into the boundless day of history Mr James Love
comedian appeared as the epic poet of the sport His quarto is
dedicated to the Richmond Club and is inspired by a recollection of
many Particulars at a time when the Game was cultivated with the utmost
Assiduity and patronised by the personal Appearance and Management
of some of the most capital People in the Kingdom Mr Love in his
enthusiasm publishes an exhortation to Britain to leave all meaner
sports and cultivate cricket only

    Hail CRICKET glorious manly British game
    First of all sports be first alike in fame

sings Love as he warms to his work He denounces puny Billiards
played by Beaus dressed in the quintessence of the fashion
The robust Cricketer plays in his shirt the Rev Mr Wd
particularly appears almost naked

One line of Mr Loves

    Where fainting vice calls folly to her aid

appears to him so excellent that he thinks it must be plagiarised and
in a note invites the learned reader to find out where he stole it
from To this a critic Britannicus Severus answers that Gentlemen
who have CRICKET in their heads cannot afford to pore over a parcel of
musty Authors Indeed your cricketer is rarely a bookworm

    Leave the dissolving song the baby dance
    To soothe the slaves of Italy and France

and play up cries this English bard

In the second book the poet comes to businessKent v All England
The poet after the custom of his age gives dashes after an initial
in place of names In notes he interprets his dashes and introduces
us to Newland of Slendon in Sussex a farmer and a famous batsman
Bryan of London bricklayer Rumney gardener to the Duke of Dorset
Smith keeper of the artillery ground Hodswell the bowling tanner of
Dartford Mills of Bromley Robin commonly called Long Robin Mills
Sawyer Cutbush Bartrum Kips and Danes Cuddy the tailor Derigate
of Reigate Weymark the miller with Newland Green two Harrises and
Smith made up the teams The match is summed up in the Argument of the
Third Book

 The GameFive on the side of the Counties are out for three
 Notches The Odds run high on the side of Kent Bryan and Newland go
 in they help the Game greatly Bryan is unfortunately put out by
 Kips Kent the First Innings is Thirteen ahead The Counties go in
 again and get Fiftyseven ahead Kent in the Second Innings is very
 near losing the two last Men being in Weymark unhappily misses a
 Catch and by that means Kent is victorious

It was a splendid close matchbut let us pity Weymark immortal
butterfingers In the first innings the wicketkeeping of Kips to the
fast bowling of Hodswell was reckoned fine

If Love was the Homer of cricket the minstrel who won from
forgetfulness the glories of the dim Heroic Age Nyren was the
delightful Herodotus of the early Historic Period John Nyren dedicated
his Cricketers Guide and Recollections of the Cricketers of my Time
to the great Mr William Ward in  He speaks of cricket as an
elegant relaxation and congratulates Mr Ward on having gained the
longest hands of any player upon record This famed score was made
on July    on the MCC ground The number was  
more than any player ever gained Aylwards  had previously been
the longest score I know Mr Wards feat moreover was after the
increase of the stumps in  Old Nyren was charmed in his declining
hours by a deed like this yet grieved by the modern bowlers and their
habit of throwing the ball The history of that innovation will
presently be sketched

Nyren was born at Hambledon in Hampshire on December   and
was therefore a small boy when Love sang He died at Bromley June 
 Like most very great men he was possibly of Scottish blood He
was a Catholic and believed that the true spelling of the family name
was Nairne and that they came south after being out in the  or
 Mr Charles Cowden Clarke describes him as a thoroughly good and
amiable man and as much may be guessed from his writings

Mr Clarke agreed with him in his dislike of roundhand bowling save
when Lillywhite was pitted against Fuller Pilcha beautiful thing to
see as the Bishop of St Andrews testifies speaking like Dares
Phrygius of the heroes at Troy as he that saw them In Nyrens
youthsay Hambledon was the centre of cricket The boy had a
cricketing education He learned a little Latin of a worthy old Jesuit
but was a better hand at the fiddle In that musical old England where
John Small the noted bat once charmed an infuriated bull by his
minstrelsy Nyren performed a moral miracle He played to the gipsies
and so won their hearts that they always passed by his henroost when
they robbed the neighbours Music and cricket were the Hambledon mans
delight His father Richard Nyren was with Thomas Brett one of the
chief bowlers Brett was the fastest as well as straightest bowler
that was ever known no jerker but with a very high delivery
The height of the delivery was not  la Spofforth but was got by
sending the ball out from under the armpit How this manuvre could
be combined with pace is a great mystery Richard Nyren had this art
always to the length Bretts bowling is described as tremendous
yet Tom Sueter could stump off itTom of the honourable heart and the
voice so sweet pure and powerful Yet on those wickets Tom needed a
longstop to BrettGeorge Lear The Bishop has seen three longstops
on to Brown but he was a jerker At that date the longstop
commonly dropped on one knee as he received the ball An old Eton boy
G B who was at school between  and  says in a letter to
the Standard dated September   that a pockethandkerchief
was allowed round the dropping knee of longstop A bowler with a low
delivery was Lambert the little farmer His ball would twist from
the off stump into the leg He was the first I remember who introduced
this deceitful and teasing way of delivering the ball Cricket was
indeed rudimentary when a break from the off was a new thing The
Kent and Surrey men could not tell what to make of that cursed twist
of his Lambert acquired the art as Daphnis learned his minstrelsy
while he tended his fathers sheep He would set up hurdles instead of
a net and bowl for hours But it needed old Nyren to teach him to bowl
outside the off stump so little alert was the mind of this innovator
Among outsiders Lumpy the Surrey man was the most accurate to a
length and he was much faster than Lord Frederick Beauclerk In these
days the home bowlers pitched the wickets to suit themselves Thus they
had all the advantage of rough wickets on a slope yet even so a
yokel with pluck and an arm as long as a hoppole has been known to
slash Lumpy all over the field But this could only have been done at
single wicket A curious bowler of this age was Noah Mann the fleetest
runner of his time and a skilled horseman He was a lefthanded
bowler and as will be seen he anticipated the magical pitching
of experts at baseball How he did this without throwing or jerking
is hard to be understood His merit consisted in giving a curve to
the ball the whole way In itself it was not the firstrate style
of bowling but so very deceptive that the chief end was frequently
attained They who remember the dexterous manner with which the Indian
jugglers communicated the curve to the balls they spun round their
heads by a twist of the wrist or hand will at once comprehend Noahs
curious feat in bowling He once made a hit for ten at Windmilldown
to which the club moved from the bleakness of Broadhalfpenny

We have followed Nyrens comments on bowlers for the purpose of
elucidating the evolution of their ingenious art All the bowlers
so far have been underhand but now we hear of these anointed
clodstumpers the Walkers They were not of Broadhalfpenny but
joined the club at Windmilldown when the move there was made on
the suggestion of the Duke of Dorset About a couple of years after
Walker had been with us probably about  he began the system
of throwing instead of bowling now so much the fashion He was
noballed after a council of the Hambledon Club called for the
purpose This disposes of the priority of Mr Willes  and
incidentally casts doubt on the myth that a lady invented roundhand
bowling Nyren says The first I recollect seeing revive the custom
was Wills a Sussex man

From the heresiarch Tom Walker we come to the classic model of a
bowler in the underhand schoolthat excellent man christian and
cricketer David Harris

 It would be difficult perhaps impossible to convey in writing an
 accurate idea of the grand effect of Harriss bowling they only who
 have played against him can fully appreciate it His attitude when
 preparing for his run previously to delivering the ball would have
 made a beautiful study for the sculptor Phidias would certainly have
 taken him for a model First of all he stood erect like a soldier
 at drill then with a graceful curve of the arm he raised the ball
 to his forehead and drawing back his right foot started off with
 his left The calm look and general air of the man were uncommonly
 striking and from this series of preparations he never deviated I am
 sure that from this simple account of his manner all my countrymen
 who were acquainted with his play will recall him to their minds His
 mode of delivering the ball was very singular He would bring it from
 under the arm by a twist and nearly as high as his armpit and with
 this action push it as it were from him How it was that the balls
 acquired the velocity they did by this mode of delivery I never could
 comprehend

 When first he joined the Hambledon Club he was quite a raw
 countryman at cricket and had very little to recommend him but his
 noble delivery He was also very apt to give tosses I have seen old
 Nyren scratch his head and sayHarris would make the best bowler
 in England if he did not toss By continual practice however and
 following the advice of the old Hambledon players he became as steady
 as could be wished and in the prime of his playing very rarely
 indeed gave a toss although his balls were pitched the full length
 In bowling he never stooped in the least in his delivery but kept
 himself upright all the time His balls were very little beholden to
 the ground when pitched it was but a touch and up again and woe
 be to the man who did not get in to block them for they had such a
 peculiar curl that they would grind his fingers against the bat many
 a time have I seen the blood drawn in this way from a batter who was
 not up to the trick old Tom Walker was the only exceptionI have
 before classed him among the bloodless animals

 Harriss bowling was the finest of all tests for a hitter and hence
 the great beauty as I observed before of seeing Beldham in with
 this man against him for unless a batter were of the very first
 class and accustomed to the first style of stopping he could do
 little or nothing with Harris If the thing had been possible I
 should have liked to have seen such a player as Budd fine hitter as
 he was standing against him My own opinion is that he could not
 have stopped his balls and this will be a criterion by which those
 who have seen some of that gentlemans brilliant hits may judge of
 the extraordinary merit of this mans bowling He was considerably
 faster than Lambert and so superior in style and finish that I can
 draw no comparison between them Lord Frederic Beauclerc has been
 heard to say that Harriss bowling was one of the grandest things of
 the kind he had ever seen but his lordship could not have known him
 in his prime he never saw him play till after he had had many fits of
 the gout and had become slow and feeble

 To Harriss fine bowling I attribute the great improvement that
 was made in hitting and above all in stopping for it was utterly
 impossible to remain at the crease when the ball was tossed to a fine
 length you were obliged to get in or it would be about your hands
 or the handle of your bat and every player knows where its next place
 would be

This long extract is not too long for it contains a dignified study of
the bowler

    This is the perfect Trundler this is he
    That every man who bowls should wish to be

Harris was admired for the sweetness of his disposition and his
manly contempt of every action that bore the character of meanness
and he chiefly bowled for catches as did Lord Frederick Beauclerk
Nyren is no great hand at orthography and he soon comes to speak of a
Sussex bowler named Wells This is apparently the Wills or Willes who
has more credit than perhaps he deserves for bringing in roundhand
He was the first I had seen of the new school after the Walkers
had attempted to introduce the system in the Hambledon Club Willes
had a twist from leg and Nyren thinks Freemantle showed astonishing
knowledge of the game because he went in front of his wicket and hit
Willes and although before the wicket he would not have been out
because the ball had been pitched at the outside of the stump A man
might play hours on that system by Shrewsbury clock but I doubt if
David Harris would have approved of Freemantles behaviour

The student of the evolution of roundhand and overhand bowling now
turns to the early exploits of William Lillywhite b June 
 Whatever Mr Willes may have done whatever Tom Walker may have
dreamed William Lillywhite and Jem Broadbridge are practically the
parents of modern bowling When Lillywhite came out the law was that
in bowling the hand must be below the elbow Following the example of
Mr G Knight of the MCC or rather going beyond it Lillywhite
raised the hand above the shoulder though scarcely perceptible
Lillywhites performances in  caused much discussion among
cricketers and in the Sporting Magazine Letters on this subject are
reprinted by Mr W Denison in Sketches of the Players London


The last great match of  was between Sussex and Kent with
Saunders and Searle given Mr Denison reviewing the match at the
time predicted that if roundhand were allowed there would be no
driving and no cutting to point or slip This of course is part of
Unfulfilled Prophecy Broadbridge and others will shew that they
cannot be faced on hard ground without the most imminent peril As a
compromise Mr Denison was for allowing straightarmed bowling so
that the back of the hand be kept under when the ball is delivered
Mr Steels chapter on bowling shows what the effect of that rule must
have been

In February  Mr Knight published his letters in defence of
roundhand bowling There had been in the origin of cricket no law to
restrain the bowlers About  the batting acquired such mastery
and forward play with runningin as Nyren knew became so vigorous
that Willes and Tom Walker tried roundhand This roundhand was
straight armed and for a time  did very well till bowlers
took to raising the hand even above the head MCC then proclaimed
an edict against all roundhand bowling Mr Knight proposed to admit
straightarmed bowling which could not be called throwing To define
a throw was as hard then as nowa man knows it when he sees it it is
like the trot in horses Mr Knights proposed law ran The ball shall
be bowled if it be thrown or jerked or if any part of the hand or arm
be above the shoulder at the time of delivery the umpire shall
call No Ball

In one of the trial matches Sept  it is said that Mr Knight
Broadbridge and Lillywhite all bowled high over the shoulder There
are no wides in the score When a man was caught the bowlers name was
not given Lillywhite has thus no wicket to his name

Mr Knights law was discussed at Lords May   and the word
elbow substituted for shoulder But Lillywhite and Broadbridge
bowled as before and found many followers till the MCC passed
the law proposed by Mr Knight But the hand was soon raised and the
extraordinary pace of Mr Mynn born  was striven for by men who
had not his weight and strength These excesses caused a reenactment
of the overtheshoulder law in 

Lillywhite was now recognised as the reviver of cricket His analysis
in  and  gives about  runs for each wicket Roundhand with
a practical license for overhand was now established but as late as
 a high delivery was a rarity The troublesome case of Willsher
ended in permitting any height of delivery and the greatest of all
bowlers Mr Spofforth sends in the ball from the utmost altitude

This is a brief account of the evolution of round and overhand
bowling As to slow and fast bowling Lord Frederick Beauclerk and
one of the Walkers were very slow bowlers in old days William Clarke
b Dec   was the classical slow bowler Clarke was not a
regular lob bowler but like Lambert delivered about midway between
the height of the elbow and the strict underhand accompanied by a
singular peculiarity of action with the hand and wrist just as the
ball is about to be discharged He had a tremendous twist and
great spin and ingenuity Perhaps his success was partly due to the
rarity of slow bowling in his time Men imitated Mr Mynn who was as
big a man as Mr W G Grace and a very fast bowler In old underhand
times Brett had a steamengine pace and later Browne of Brighton
was prodigiously fast The Bishop of St Andrews remembers seeing a
ball of Brownes strike the stumps with such force and at such a point
that both bails flew back as far as the bowlers wicket That was at
Brighton He also remembers how at Lords when Browne bowled all the
field were placed behind the wicket or nearly so that is at slip
leg and longstop till Ward went in who playing with an upright
bat contrived to poke the ball to the off and Browne himself a tall
heavy man had to go after it But this having happened more than
once a single field was placed in front Yet Beldham as Mr Pycroft
tells quite mastered Browne and made  off him in a match Beldham
was then fiftyfour Brownes pace was reckoned superior to that of
Mr Osbaldeston It is not easy to decide who has been the fastest of
fast bowlers In our own day I think that Mr Cecil Boyle when he
bowled for Oxford  was the swiftest I have seen except a bowler
unknown south of the Tweed Mr Barclay now a clergyman in Canada Mr
Barclay was faster with underhand than with roundhand Beldham and
his comrades played Browne without pads I have seen this tried against
Mr Barclaythe results were damaging Famous names of fast bowlers
are Mynn Marcon Fellowes Tarrant Jackson Freeman Hope Grant
Powys and Robert Lang

The history of bowling precedes that of batting because the batsman
must necessarily adapt his style to the bowling not vice vers He
must also adapt it to the state of the wickets There are times when
a purely rural style of play a succession of agrarian outrages is
the best policy Given an untrustworthy wicket good bowling fielding
ground in heavy grass a stone wall on one side and another wall
with a nice flooded burn beyond on another side and a batsman will
be well advised if he lifts the ball over the boundaries and into the
brook Perhaps Mr Steel will recognise the conditions described and
remember Dalbeattie In the origin of cricket when the stumps were
low and the bat a crooked club hitting hard high and often must
have been the rule A strong man with good sight must have been the
pride of the village When David Harris Tom Walker Lumpy Brett and
other heroes brought in accuracy spin twist and pace with taller
wickets to defend this batting was elaborated by Beldham and Sueter
and others into an art Tom Sueter first fathered the heresy of
leaving the crease and going in to the pitch or halfvolley Sir
Horace Manns bailiff Aylward was the Shrewsbury of an elder age He
once stayed in two whole days and got the highest number of runs that
had ever been gained by any memberone hundred and sixtyseven Tom
Walker was a great stick Lord Frederick was bowling to him at Lords
Every ball he dropped down just before his bat Off went his lordships
white broadbrimmed hat dash upon the ground his constant action
when disappointed calling him at the same time a confounded old
beast I doant care what ee zays said Tom whose conduct showed
a good deal more of courtesy and selfcontrol than Lord Fredericks
Perhaps the masterbat of old times was William Beldham from Farnham
He comes into Bentleys Cricket Scores as early as  The
players called him Silver Billy He was coached by Harry Hall the
gingerbread baker of Farnham Halls great maxim was the left elbow
well up

From Nyren I extract a description of Beldhams batting

 BELDHAM was quite a young man when he joined the Hambledon Club and
 even in that stage of his playing I hardly ever saw a man with a
 finer command of his bat but with the instruction and advice of
 the old heads superadded he rapidly attained to the extraordinary
 accomplishment of being the finest player that has appeared within
 the latitude of more than half a century There can be no exception
 against his batting or the severity of his hitting He would get
 in at the balls and hit them away in a gallant style yet in this
 single feat I think I have known him excelled but when he could cut
 them at the point of the bat he was in his glory and upon my life
 their speed was as the speed of thought One of the most beautiful
 sights that can be imagined and which would have delighted an artist
 was to see him make himself up to hit a ball It was the beau idal
 of grace animation and concentrated energy In this peculiar
 exhibition of elegance with vigour the nearest approach to him I
 think was Lord Frederick Beauclerc Upon one occasion at Marylebone
 I remember these two admirable batters being in together and though
 Beldham was then verging towards his climacteric yet both were
 excited to a competition and the display of talent that was exhibited
 between them that day was the most interesting sight of its kind I
 ever witnessed I should not forget among his other excellencies to
 mention that Beldham was one of the best judges of a short run I ever
 knew add to which that he possessed a generally good knowledge of
 the game

In  Beldham used to gossip with Mr Pycroft That learned writer
gives Fennex great credit for introducing the modern style of forward
play about  this on the evidence of Fennex himself 
But probably accurate bowling with a fast rise on fairly good
wickets must have taught forward play naturally to Fennex Lambert
Fuller Pilch and others It is not my purpose to compile a minute
chronicle of cricket to mark each match and catch nor to chant the
illustrious deeds of all famous men The great name of Mr Ward has
been already mentioned The Bishop of St Andrews when a Harrow
boy played against Mr Ward and lowered his illustrious wicket for
three runs Thus with Mr Ward we come within the memory of
living cricketers Much more is this the case with Mr Budd Fuller
Pilch Alfred Mynn Hayward and Carpenter Humphrey and Jupp Mr Mynn
was the son of a gentleman farmer at Bearstead near Maidstone His
extraordinary pace actually took wickets by storm men were bowled
before they knew where they were The assiduous diligence of Mr Ward
was a match for him When about to meet Mynn he would practise with
the fastest of the ground bowlers at Lords at eighteen or nineteen
yards rise so to speak Mr Wards great reach also stood him in good
stead Mr Mynns pace and the excesses committed by his imitators
for some time demoralised batting Few balls were straight among the
imitatores servum pecus and men went in to hit what they could
reach The joy of getting hold of a legball from a very fast bowler
or of driving him overpowered caution and these violent delights
might have had violent ends if accuracy had not returned to bowling In
 Mr Mynns analysis gave  a wicket His average was but  an
innings Scores were shorter fifty years ago

My attempt has been to trace the streams of tendency in cricket rather
than to produce a chroniclea work which would require a volume to
itself Nothing has been said about fielding because however the ball
is bowled and however hit the tasks of catching it stopping it and
returning it with speed have always been the same True different
styles of batting and bowling require alterations in the position of
the fielders But the principles of their conduct and the nature
of their duty remain unaltered One change may be noted In Juvenile
Sports by Master Michel Angelo the author speaks of byes
and overthrows as a new mode an innovation with which I am by
no means pleased It is indeed true that this places the seekers out
continually on their guard and obliges them to be more mindful of
their play but then it diminishes the credit of the player in whose
hands the bat is as a game may be won by a very bad batsman owing to
the inability of the wicketman or the inattention of the seekersout

The fallacy of this argument does not need to be exposed

                                   

MCC

No sketch of the history of cricket would be complete without a note on
the fortunes of the Marylebone Club This is the Parliament of cricket
and includes almost all the amateurs of merit There is nothing very
formal in its construction and any clubs which please may doubtless
arrange among themselves to play not according to MCC rules But
nobody so pleases and Marylebone legislates practically for countries
that were not even known to exist when wickets were pitched at
Guildford in the reign of Henry VIII Marylebone is the Omphalos the
Delos of cricket

The club may be said to have sprung from the ashes of the White
Conduit Club dissolved in  One Thomas Lord by the aid of some
members of the older association made a ground in the space which
is now Dorset Square This was the first Lords As to Lord he is
dubiously said like the ancestors of Nyren to have been a Scot and
a Jacobite or mixed up at least in some way with the  Lord was
obliged to move to North Bank and finally in  to the present
ground The famous Mr Ward had played at Lords before this migration
his first match here was in  and he played more or less till
 being then sixty years of age His bats are said to have weighed
four pounds Mr Ward bought the lease of the ground from Lord in 
at a most exorbitant rate and in  Dark bought the remainder of
the lease from him The first match on our present Lords or the first
recorded was MCC v Hertfordshire June   In  the
pavilion was burned after a Winchester and Harrow match The burning
of the Alexandrian Library may be compared to the wholesale destruction
of cricket records on this melancholy occasion In  the Club
reviewed the Laws the result will be found in Lillywhites Scores
i  No more than two balls to be allowed at practice when a fresh
bowler takes the ball before he proceeds A great deal too much time
is now wasted over these practice balls The ball must be delivered
underhanded not thrown or jerked with the hand below the elbow at the
time of delivering the ball The umpire is to call no ball if the
back of the hand be uppermost As to lbw the batter is out if
with his foot or leg he stop the ball which the bowler in the opinion
of the umpire shall have pitched in a straight line to the wicket and
would have hit it

The names of the Presidents are only on record after the fire
Ponsonby Grimston Darnley Coventry are among the most notable The
renowned Mr Aislabie was secretary till his death in  in the
pavilion his bust commemorates him Mr Kynaston and Mr Fitzgerald
of Jerks In from Short Leg are other celebrated secretaries In
 the Club purchased a lease of  years at the cost of l
There have been recent additions to the area and to that celebrated
monument the pavilion

Lords is as all the world knows the scene not only of Club and
of Middlesex matches but of Eton and Harrow Oxford and Cambridge and
Gentlemen and Players which is also contested at the Oval Winchester
used moreover to play Eton here but the headmasters have long
preferred a home and home affair In other chapters these great matches
will be chronicled and criticised

                                   

The various epochs in the history of the game may now be briefly
enumerated by way of summary First we have the prehistoric age when
cricket was dimly struggling to evolve itself out of the rudimentary
forms of catanddog and stoolball This preceded  when we find
an authentic mention of the name of CRICKET Just about the end of
the seventeenth century it was mainly a boys game With the Augustan
age it began to be taken up by statesmen and satirised by that ideal
whippersnapper the ingenious but in all respects unsportsmanlike Mr
Pope By  the game was matter of heavy bets and scores began to
be recorded The old Hambledon Club gave it dignity and the veterans
endured till quite modern times dawn with Mr Ward Then came the
prosperous heresy of roundhand bowling which battled for existence
till about  when it became a recognised institution The wandering
clubs chiefly I Z and the Free Foresters at first carried good
examples into the remoter gardens of our country The migratory
professional teams the United and All England Elevens at least showed
the yokels what style meant and taught them that Jackson and Tinley
were their masters But the lesson lasted too long Nothing was less
exhilarating than the spectacle of twenty provincial players with
Hodgson and Slinn making many ducks eggs and fielding in a mob
The first ad me on the knee the next on the wrist the next blacked
my eye and the fourth bowled me says the Pride of the Village in
Punch after enjoying a hover from Jackson Such violent delights
had violent ends The old travelling elevens are extinct but railways
have turned large England to a little field so to speak and
clubs may now meet which of old scarcely knew each other by name
The Australian elevens have in recent days given a great impulse to
patriotic exertions

Scotch cricket is a thing of this century Football and golf are the
native pastimes of my countrymen as hurling is of Ireland The Old
Grange Club is the MCC of the North The West of Scotland and
Drumpellier are other clubs of standing That everflourishing veteran
Major Dickens still upholds the honour of Kelso The Moncrieffs have
been the Wards and Budds of Edinburgh nor will a touching patriotism
allow me here to omit the name of George Charles Hamilton Dunlop For
some reasons Scotland has not been productive of bowlers Professionals
are seldom reared there nor have amateurs devoted themselves to the
more scientific and less popular part of the game Mr Barclay has
already been commemorated for his speed a few only will remember Mr
Sinclair and Mr Glassford who died young and very much regretted
Few men have done more for Scotch cricket than Mr H H Almond
headmaster of Loretto School which has contributed several players
to the Oxford eleven An old pewter may here congratulate Mr Almond
on the energy with which he kept his boys to the mark and on the
undaunted example which he set by always going in first The names of
Arthur Cheyne Jack Mackenzie Edward Henderson Chalmers Hay Brown
Leslie Balfour and Tom Marshall are only a few that crowd on the
memory of the elderly Caledonian cricketer In the Border district of
which more hereafter the houses of Buccleuch and Roxburgh have been
great friends of the game and that was a proud day for the Rough
Clan when Lord George Scott scored over  in the University match of
 Abbotsford too has been well to the front thanks to the Hon
J Maxwell Scott and for some reason Scotland has been occasionally
represented by Mr A G Steel and the Hon Ivo Bligh known to the
local press as the Titled Batsman But these are alien glories et
non sua poma

Three things are prejudicial to Scotch cricket First there is the
climate about which more words were superfluous Next boys leave
school earlier than in England for professions or for college Lastly
the University session is in the winter months and the University
clubs are therefore at a great disadvantage I shall never forget
the miraculous wickets we tried to pitch on the old College Green at
Glasgow and the courage displayed by divinity students in standing up
to Mr Barclay there As for St Andrews golf is too much with us on
that friendly shore and will brook no rival

  
   The author of the historical introduction is much indebted to
 the Bishop of St Andrews a veteran of the first University Match
 for his kindness in revising proofs and adding notes He has also to
 thank the Viscountess Wolseley for the loan of her picture of Miss
 Wicket and Mr Charles Mills MP for a sight of the silver ball
 of the Vine Club It was filled with snuff and tossed from hand to
 hand after dinner he who dropped it being fined in claret or some
 other liquor

CHAPTER II

BATTING

BY THE HON R H LYTTELTON


Illustration FIG The champion

The great and supreme art of batting constitutes to the large majority
of cricketers the most enjoyable part of the game There are three
especially delightful moments in life connected with games and only
those who have experienced all three can realise what these moments
are They are  the cut stroke at tennis when the striker wins
chase one and two on the floor  the successful drive at golf
when the globe is despatched on a journey of  yards  a crack
to squareleg off a halfvolley just outside the legs When once the
sensation has been realised by any happy mortal he is almost entitled
to chant in a minor key a Nunc Dimittis to feel that the supreme
moment has come and that he has not lived in vain

After what has been said in the foregoing chapter we shall here only
touch upon the cricket of the past in so far as seems necessary to make
this dissertation on batting tolerably complete and shall then proceed
to discuss the principles and science of the art as it now exists

The shape of the bat in the year which may be taken as a
beginning for it was in that year that the first score of a match
was printed and handed down to posterity at any rate in Lillywhites
Scores and Biographiesresembled a thick crooked stick more than a
modern bat

From the shape of the bat obviously adapted to meet the ball when
moving along the ground one may infer that the bowlers habitually
delivered a style of ball we now call a sneak How long this system
of bowling remained in vogue cannot exactly be told The famous William
Beldham who was born in  and lived for nearly one hundred years
is reported by Nyren to have said that when he was a boy nearly all
bowling was fast and along the ground As long as this was the case it
is probable that the bat was nothing but a club for if the ball never
left the ground the operative part of the bat would naturally be at
the very bottom as is usual in clubs The renowned Tom Walker was the
earliest lob bowler he probably took to the style late in life or
about the year  and several bowlers notably the great E H Budd
raised the arm slightly but it is believed that the first genuine
roundarm bowlers were William Lillywhite and James Broadbridge both
of Sussex who first bowled the new style in  That year was from
this cause a year of revolution in cricket and the shape of the modern
bat dates from that period As a rule up to the year  the style of
batting was back William Fennex is supposed to have been the inventor
of forward play and Beldham reports a saying of one Squire Paulett
who was watching Fennex play You do frighten me there jumping out
of your ground The great batsmen of the early era of cricket were
Lord Frederick Beauclerk Mr Budd Beldham Bentley Osbaldeston
William Ward Beagley William Lambert Jem Broadbridge W Hooker
Saunders and Searle The great skill of these players when opposed to
underhand bowling was what determined the Sussex players to alter the
style of bowling and indeed it is generally the fact that too great
abundance of runs raises questions as to the desirability of altering
rules

After the year  the shape of the bat became very like what it is
now but it was much heavier in the blade and thinner in the handle
which seems to indicate that the play was mostly of the forward driving
style and the great exponent of this method of play was the renowned
Fuller Pilch Anyone who has the opportunity of handling a bat of this
period will find that its weight renders it inconvenient for cutting
but suitable for forward play The change from underhand bowling to
roundarm having been effected by slow developments makes it probable
that the style of play was generally forward until the underhand
bowling was altogether superseded by roundarm Some bowlers followed
the new order of things by changing from under to roundarm Roundarm
bowling was at first less accurate than underhand and consequently
allround hitting greatly developed and we find Felix the father of
cutting who began play in  chiefly renowned for this hit Scoring
greatly diminished when roundarm bowling was thoroughly established
and increased again as grounds got better

Judging from the scores of that day the best bat in England from 
to  was Fuller Pilch and his scoring would compare favourably with
that of nearly all modern players till  with the exception of W
G Grace He was a tall man and used to smother the ball by playing
right out forward

The principle on which his whole play was founded was evidently to
get at the pitch and take care of the ball before breaks bumps and
shooters had time to work their devilries In order to carry out this
method he used frequently to leave his ground and consequently the
famous Wm Clarke always found Pilch a harder nut to crack than any of
his other contemporaries

Clarkes slow balls tolerably well up were met by Pilch who left his
ground and drove him forward with a straight bat His master appears
to have been the great Sam Redgate who was fast and ripping and
who on one occasion got him out for a pair of spectacles while on
the other hand twice in his life he got over  runs against Wm
Lillywhites bowling considered in those days to be an extraordinary
feat After Pilch Joseph Guy of Nottingham and E G Wenman of
Kent were considered the best but severalC G Taylor Mynn Felix
and Marsden for examplescored largely and they all passed through
a golden age of bowling namely about  when Lillywhite Redgate
Mynn Cobbett and Hillyer all flourished to say nothing of Sir F
Bathurst Tom Barker and others

From the year  when Fuller Pilch left off play to the year 
when W G Grace burst on the world with a lustre that no previous
batsman had ever approached there was nevertheless a grand array of
batsmenamong professionals Hayward Carpenter Parr Daft Caffyn
Mortlock and Julius Csar and among amateurs Hankey F H Norman
C G Lane C G Lyttelton Mitchell Lubbock Buller V E Walker
and Maitland These are a few of the great names They are however
surrounded by several almost as renowned such as Stephenson T
Humphrey Hearne Cooper Burbidge Griffith and others all these we
think made this era of the game productive of more exciting cricket
than has been known since It may seem odd but the overpowering
genius of W G Grace after this time somewhat spoilt the excitement
of the game His side was never beaten Crowds thronged to see him
play all bowling was alike to him and the record of Gloucestershire
cricket champion county for some time through his efforts is the only
instance of one man practically making an eleven for several years
The other Gloucestershire players will be the first to acknowledge
the truth of this Gloucestershire rose with a bound into the highest
rank among counties when W G Grace attained his position amongst
batsmen a head and shoulders above any other cricketer In his prime
Gloucestershire challenged and on one occasion defeated England when
he declined Gloucestershire declined in his old age she shows signs
of renewing her youth for which all credit is due to young Townsend
Jessop Champain and Board To return to the period between  and
 the greater equality of players made the matches more exciting
and established a keener because more evenly balanced rivalry The
grounds were not so true as those of today and the matches were not
so numerous consequently cricketers were not so frequently worn out
by the wear and tear of long fielding and days and nights of travel as
they are now The long individual scores having been less in number and
at longer intervals the few great innings were more vividly stamped on
the memory and it is doubtful if even the modern  runs per innings
will survive as historical facts longer than Hankeys famous innings of
 against the Players on Lords Dafts  in North v South on the
same ground and Haywards  against Gentlemen also on Lords

The bowling during this period was generally fast or medium varied
by lobs but of genuine slow round like that of Peate Buchanan
Alfred Shaw and Tyler there was hardly any in firstclass matches To
fast bowling runs come quicker than they do to slow consequently the
game was of more interest to the ordinary spectator and there was none
of that painful slowness in consequence of the extraordinary accuracy
of modern slower bowling that is so common now and helps to produce
so many drawn matches Though now in the year  the average
bowling pace is slower than it was in the sixties it is nevertheless
faster than it was in the seventies The professionals had literally
only one genuine slow roundarm bowler in those daysGeorge Bennett
of Kentand of course this fact accounted largely for the batting
style of the period Wickets being often rough the most paying length
for fast bowling was naturally that length which gave the ground most
chance and prevented the smothering style of playa little shorter
than the blind spot compelling back play over the crease instead
of forward play The best batsmen were great masters of this style
of play with which the name of Carpenter is strongly identified To
modern players the sight of Carpenter or Daft dropping down on a dead
shooter from a bowler of the pace of George Freeman or Jackson was a
wonderful one but it is rapidly becoming a memory only for in these
days a shooter may be said not to exist Now in  a wonderful
feature of our great fast bowlerspreeminently Richardsonis not
that they bowl straighter than Freeman or Jackson but that they
never bowl a ball on the legs or outside the legs The result is that
orthodox leg hitting and in particular the smite to longleg with a
horizontal bat and much nearer the ground than a squareleg hit is
never seen During the entire progress of a match nowadays between
Notts and Lancashire or Yorkshire and Notts the unhappy batsman will
not get a single ball outside his legs to hit So great is the accuracy
of the bowling that over after over will go by and not even a ball
on his legs will soothe his careworn and anxious brain This accurate
bowling has caused another change in the way of batting As no ball is
bowled on the leg side at all so it consequently follows there is no
fieldsman on the on side except a forward shortleg and a deep field
The batsman therefore waits till the bowler slightly overtosses a
ballwhether pitched outside the off stump or on the wicket he cares
not he sweeps it round to square leg where no fieldsman stands and
he makes four runs by the hit In other words he deliberately pulls
it Twenty years ago on seeing such a hit the famous Bob Grimston
would have shown his emphatic disapproval in a characteristic manner
But the match must be won by runs to attain this object the ball must
be hit where there is no field and it is useless to waste energy by
hitting the ball to every fieldsman on the off side

W W Read Stoddart and F S Jackson are all masters of this stroke
which revives the drooping attention of the crowd and relieves the
monotony of the scorers To all fast bowling the cut is a hit largely
in vogue and the perfection to which some players arrive with regard
to this stroke is a joy to themselves and to the spectators It is of
course as will be explained later on much easier to cut fast bowling
than slow and the heroes of the cut whenever fast bowling is on are
and were always numerous

The champion cutter of old times by universal testimony was C G
Lyttelton whose hits in the direction of point are remembered by
spectators to this day Tom Humphrey of Surrey was another great
cutter and there was a player not of the first rank who was famous
for this hitnamely E P Ash of the Cambridge University Eleven
 and 

The five champion bats of this era to were in the opinion
of the writer Hayward Carpenter Parr Daft and R A H Mitchell
The scoring of Hayward and Carpenter between  and  was very
large both excelled on rough wickets and it is on these wickets that
genius exhibits itself

In all times of cricket until the appearance of W G Grace there
has been a large predominance of skill amongst the professionals
as compared with the amateurs We are talking now of batting in
bowling the difference has been still more to the advantage of the
professionals The Gentlemen won a match now and then but their
inferiority was very great W G Grace altered all this and from 
to  the Gentlemen had a run of success which will probably never
be seen again It was entirely owing to him though the Players were
astonishingly weak in batting from  to  but nothing could
stop the crack and his scoring in the two annual contests was simply
miraculous

We will now attempt to lay before our readers a more detailed
exposition of the principles which ought to govern sound batting and
a careful observance of which is found in the method of every sound
player The first consideration is the choice of a bat and as to this
each individual must determine for himself what is the most suitable
It is probable that a strong man will prefer a heavier bat than a
batsman of less muscular calibre In any case the style of play is an
important consideration but the secret of all batting and especially
hitting is correct timing this is a quality which cannot be taught
but this is what makes a weak man hit harder than a strong manthe one
knows exactly the fraction of a second when all that is muscular all
that he has got in wrist and shoulders must be applied the other does
not

At the beginning of this century when the bowling was fast
underhand the bat used was of a style suitable for meeting such
ballsnamely a heavy blade with great weight at the bottom for
as already mentioned the bowling being straight and frequently on
the ground driving was the common stroke and for this a heavy blade
is best adapted So now if a player finds that he does not possess
a wrist style of play but a forward driving game he will probably
choose a heavier bat than the wristplayer for a forward drive is more
of a body strokethat is the whole muscular strength of the shoulders
and back is brought into use and the ball being fully met gives
more resistance to the bat than a ball which is cut This perhaps
needs a little explanation Just consider for a moment and realise
the fact that a tolerably fast ball well up and quite straight has
been delivered Such a ball is just the ball that ought to be driven
The batsman lunges forward and meets it with very nearly the centre of
his bat just after the ball has landed on the ground at the time
therefore when if there is any spin on it it is going at its fastest
pace Obviously therefore when the pace and weight of the ball are
taken into consideration there is great resistance given to the lunge
forward of the bat The heavier the blade of the bat the better is
it able to withstand and resist the contrary motion of the ball As
a rule players are not equally good both at the forward driving and
the wristplaying games Some few excel in both but usually batsmen
have preferences Now let us examine the cutof course we are now
discussing a ball on the off side of the wicket A wristplayer will
cut a ball that the exponent of the driving style would drive and
therefore meet with the full or nearly full bat The cutter does
not meet the ball for the ball has gone past him before he hits it
Take a common longhop on the off side The driver meets it with a
more or less horizontal bat and hits it forward between coverpoint
and midoff or coverpoint and point thereby resisting the ball and
sending it almost in an opposite direction to its natural course He
hits the ball some time before it arrives on a level with his body
while the cutter on the other hand does not hit the ball so soon
in fact he hits it when it is about a foot in front of the line of
the wicket sometimes almost on a level with the wicket He then with
his wrist hits it in the direction of third man He does not meet the
ball at all but he takes advantage of the natural pace of the ball
and as it were steers it from the normal course towards longstop
in the direction of third man The whole essence of the distinction
lies in this fact that in driving the ball is met directly by the
bat in cutting this is not so but the ball is as it were helped
on only in a different direction The faster the bowling the harder
therefore will be the cut The reader will at once see from this that
the wristplayer will probably prefer a lighter bat than the driving
batsman and a bat that comes up well as it is called or is more
evenly balanced

We will now suppose a batsman properly equipped in pads and at any
rate one glove on the right hand and with a bat to his taste our
next inquiry must be as to his position at the wicket He must remember
that after having chosen one positionthe most natural and convenient
to himhe ought to adopt that position invariably not alter it from
day to day You never see any material alteration in the position of
any great player and if anyone takes the very necessary trouble to
find out the easiest position he will be a foolish man who varies
it as any change must be for the worse There is an old engraving
often seen of a match between Surrey and Kent about the year 
Old William Lillywhite is about to bowl and Fuller Pilch is about to
play The attitude and position of Pilch were taken by the author of
The Cricket Field as a model and there is no objection to be raised
to the position it is a fair assumption that it was the natural and
most convenient position for Fuller Pilch himself The author however
goes on to say that this is substantially the attitude of every good
batsman To this we can only rejoin that out of the thousands of
batsmen who have played cricket it would be difficult to find two who
stand exactly alike To begin with some stand with their feet close
together others have them apart some indeed so far apart that it
almost seems as if they were trying to solve the problem of how much
length of ground can be covered between the two feet Some stand with
the right foot just on the leg side of a straight line drawn between
the legstump of the batsmans wicket and the off stump of the opposite
wicket others stand with the right foot twelve inches or thereabouts
from the legstump in the direction of shortleg Players who adopt
this position run a risk of being bowled off their legs one would
think but they ought to know best we should not however advise
a beginner to adopt this attitude W G Grace faces the ball and
there is no intervening space between his hands whilst holding the bat
and his legs If you look at the position of Pilch you will see a
considerable interval of distance from the back of his left hand and
the right leg There were three notable batsmennamely A N Hornby
W Yardley and F E R Fryerwho used to throw their left leg right
across the wicket so as almost to hide it from the view of the bowler

Illustration FIG W G Grace ready to receive the ball

Mr A J Webbe stoops very much in his position while some players
stand almost at full height notably is this the case with W G Grace
There are as far as we know only three rules which must be observed
in taking up a position The first is  stand so that no part of the
right foot is in front of the wicket or outside the crease  stand
in the attitude most natural and convenient to yourself  do not
place the toes of the right foot materially nearer the wicket than the
heel The first rule is essential for the good player never ought to
move his right foot to fast bowling If therefore any part is in
front of the wicket he runs a risk of being leg before wicket when the
ball beats the bat if his foot is outside the crease he is in danger
of being stumped and if the toes of the right foot are materially
nearer the wicket than the heel he will find himself in a very awkward
position unable to get over the ball Subject to these rules the
batsman takes any position he pleases The bat should be held firmly
with the right hand and loosely or comparatively loosely with the left
neither hand should be tightly clenched The late Mr Wm Ward spoke
the truth when he told a sculptor who had made a statue of a batsman
at guard that he was no cricketerthe wrists were too rigid and hands
too much clenched It seems that most players lift their bat from the
blockhole while the bowler is running prior to delivering the ball
and fig  shows W G Grace standing just before the ball leaves the
bowlers hand His whole position is changed from what it was a few
seconds before His first position before the bowler has begun his run
is given in the sketch at the head of the chapter The figure here
shows him to be standing almost at his full height his bat suspended
in the air and his weight if anything thrown rather on his right foot
Most players however take up a position and stick to it except that
they raise the bat slightly just before the ball leaves the bowlers
hand Nature is the best guide Let every player therefore find out the
easiest attitude and always adopt it

We will now consider the manner in which the bat should be held by
the hands This varies in a few trifling particulars with different
players but in very rare instances is there any substantial
difference The muscles ought not to be in a state of rigidity and
whilst the batsman is standing in position waiting for the ball the
bat should be held firmly but not by any means tightly The batsman
cannot depend on any particular ball coming to him consequently while
the ball is in the air his mind has to be made up he has then to set
himself for a stroke determined absolutely by the pace length and
direction of the ball and there are only a few seconds for him both to
make up his mind and make the stroke There is no doubt a scientific
anatomical reason why quickness of hand and muscles is incompatible
with rigidity of muscle but quite practicable when the muscles and
sinews are in a natural and easy state of elasticity but any man will
find this out for himself if he begins to play Hold the bat then
loosely with the left hand nearly at the top of the handle with the
back of the hand turned full towards the bowler the fingers folded
round the handle and the thumb lying easily between the first and
second fingers The right hand is fixed exactly contrary to the left as
far as the back and fingers are concerned for the back is turned away
from the bowler and the fingers are turned towards him The thumb lies
across and rests on the top of the first finger touching the finger
about a quarter of an inch from the top on the inside When any sort of
hit or block is made the bat at that instant is held tightly and both
thumbs are slightly shifted so as to lie on and clutch not the fingers
that hold the handle but the handle itself Whether the hands are
high up on the handle or low down near the blade depends very much on
the style of the player There is no rule on the subject but we think
the old motto In medio tutissimus ibis is good to observe and
the middle of the handle is on the whole the safest Some players
howevernotably Mr Frank Penn in his day a tremendous offhitter
and altogether a grand bathold the bat with the knuckle of the first
finger of the right hand almost touching the top of the blade and big
hitters rather of the slogging order as a rule hold the bat higher
up with the left hand almost on the top in fact they adopt what may
be called the longhandled style In holding the bat however follow
the precept given beforenamely ascertain the most natural method
and cling to it for your cricketing life

The actual position at the wicket is the same for both slow bowling and
fast with perhaps this trifling difference that the batsman ought
not to stand so firmly on the right foot to slow as he would to fast
The reason of this will be explained hereafter when we consider the
right method of playing slow bowling At present we will confine our
attention to playing fast bowling and let us assume that the batsman
has taken his natural position with his right toe clear of the wicket
and that a fast righthanded bowler is bowling with hand raised above
the shoulder and over the wicket This is the method of bowling most
in vogue in these days in fact the strict roundarm bowling round
the wicket with a curl from leg is for some inscrutable reason now
comparatively rare Why this is so nobody can tell and we believe that
some of the present gigantic scoring is partly owing to the absence of
this sort of bowling

However the popular method will be the first we shall try and
instruct the batsman to meet successfully and we will suppose that
the wicket is fast and true We will begin with laying down one or two
rules that must rigorously be observed by every player if he wishes
to become a firstrate cricketer  Never move the right foot when
playing fast bowling except to cut or when you want to pull a very
short ball Nobody will ever become a firstrate player if he does
not strictly observe this rule The spot of ground on which the right
foot rests is the vantagepoint from which every batsman has to judge
of the direction of the ball and if he shifts away from this all
sorts of faults will crop up chief of which will be an inability to
play with a straight or perpendicular bat He will also if he moves
his right foot towards shortlegwhich is the commonest form this
vice takesfind that he will drive balls with a crooked bat to the
off when from a proper position he would have hit them on the on
side He will also find himself further removed from the off side
and quite unable therefore to play with a straight bat on the off
stump These are a few of the faults that come from not keeping the
right foot still All coaches know that this habit of moving the right
leg is the fault most commonly found in young players and it is most
difficult to remove This arises from the fact that the ball is a
hard substance the beginner naturally dislikes being hit anywhere on
the body and his first and most powerful instinct is therefore to
run away But many instincts are base in their nature and the young
cricketer must realise in this as in other cases that the old Adam
must be put away and the new man put on He will find as he improves
that in these days of true wickets he will not often get hit the bat
will as a rule protect him and if he is hit anywhere on or below
the knee the pads will perform a similar function If he does get
hit well he must grin and bear it and try to emulate the heroism
of some giants of old in antepadandglove days of one of whom the
famous Tom Walker we read that he used to rub his bleeding fingers in
the dust after the Mold of those days had performed a tattoo on his
fingers  Never pull a straight fast ball to leg unless it is very
short and you are well in If you miss it you are either bowled out or
else you run a great chance of being given out leg before wicket The
dead true wickets of these days have no doubt made many more batsmen
proficient at this stroke but still it is sound to remember that you
must have got thoroughly used to the pace of the ground before you
try this stroke Ranjitsinhjis skill at this stroke is marvellous
but few have such supple wrists  Never slog wildly at a ball
well outside the off stump but of a good length This hit also may
occasionally come off but there is no trap more frequently laid by
modern bowlers Attewell for example bowls it so frequently that the
Attewell trap is becoming a stock phrase and a little consideration
will show how dangerous a stroke it is A good length ball is one that
it is impossible to smother at the pitch and if it is outside the
off stump it has to be played with a more or less horizontal bat if
the slog is attempted What must be the consequence The ball is not
smothered consequently any break hang or rise that the bowler or
the ground may impart to the ball must almost inevitably produce a bad
stroke frequently terminating in a catch somewhere on the off side
The proper way to play such a ball will be discussed later on but
under no circumstances must the ball be hit at wildly at the pitch 
Keep the left shoulder and elbow well forward when playing the ball It
is more important in back play than forward because in forward play
the ball is or ought to be smothered at the pitch and the value of
the left shoulder being forward is that you are much more master of
the ball if it should happen to bump or hang besides which the bat
cannot easily be held straight unless this rule is observed neither
can the full face of the bat be presented to the ball In the case of
the shooter or ball which keeps low after the pitch the movement of
the left shoulder towards the left or leg side will inevitably make it
more difficult to ground or lower the bottom of the bat

The art of defencewhich is the style of play adapted to stop the
ball as distinguished from the offensive method where the object
is to hit the ball so as to obtain runsmay be roughly divided into
forward play and back play The object of all forward play is to
smother the ball at its pitch that is to say the contact of the bat
with the ball must be almost simultaneous with the contact of the ball
with the ground The player must reach out with a straight bat as near
to the pitch of the ball as is possible It stands to reason that a
tall man will reach out much further than a short man and a bowler if
he is wise will bowl shorterpitched balls to a tall man than he will
to a short Let anybody take a bat and reach forward as far as he can
keeping the bat when it touches the ground at the end of the stroke
slanting so that the top of the handle is nearer to the bowler than
the bottom of the blade There comes a distance when this slant cannot
be maintained and the bat has either to be held in a perpendicular
position or with the handle sloping behind the blade and pointing
towards the wicketkeeper Here then we come to an invariable rule
viz never play forward to a ball so that you are unable to keep the
bat at the proper slant with the handle of the bat further forward
than the blade Also let every player remember that the left foot
must be placed as far forward as the bottom of the bat and all play
whether forward or back is really between the two feet or more
strictly speaking in forward play the bat must not be put further
forward than the left foot and in back play not further back than the
level of the right foot

Some old players may very likely not agree with this precept and
players of the date of Fuller Pilch constantly had their bat a great
deal further out than the left foot which used not to be thrown out
so far Mr C F Buller again in his day a magnificent bat used to
play forward in the same style But let anyone take a bat and throw out
his left foot to the fullest extent he will find that the bat ought
not to go any further if the proper slant be maintained and he will
find also that he has greater command over the ball in this position
than in Fuller Pilchs Look at the position in fig  and you will
see that the bat has come down strictly on a level with the left foot
That a greater command is obtained by this method cannot be proved
in writing but anyone who tries the old and the new style will find
that the new is preferable as far as command of the ball is concerned
We are not implying that the great players of the old style were bad
players because they played in the contrary way for great players
rise above rules and play by the force of their greatness but we are
chiefly concerned with the ordinary mortal and our advice is throw
the left leg right out and play to the level of the left foot Some
good players maintain that as the shooter comes so seldom nowadays
it is wasting power to ground the bat when playing forward it being
sufficient if it is placed according to circumstances varying with the
state of the ground This is no doubt true when the wickets are hard
but if the miraculous should happen and a shooter come the batsman is
out and on soft wickets they still come Fig  illustrates grounding
the bat in forward play and fig  at the end of this chapter
illustrates playing forward without grounding

Illustration FIG Forward play

The ball which is too short for the player to play forward to with his
bat at the proper slant must be played back and not forward To be a
good judge of a balls length is a source of strength in any player
and a strictly accurate player seldom makes the mistake of playing
forward when he ought to play back and vice vers In cricket
however poor human nature is apt to err oftener perhaps than in most
walks of life and the question may now be asked What is the batsmen
to do when he finds himself playing forward but unable to smother the
ball at the pitch He has made a mistake how is he to get out of the
difficulty Let it be remembered that we are at present only concerned
with a fast and true wicket the play on a slow tricky wicket being so
different that it will be noticed separately

Let us assume then that the batsman is forward in the position here
shown but that he finds he cannot reach far enough to smother the ball
at the pitch On a fast wicket there is no time to rectify the error
by getting back and playing the ball in the orthodox manner and yet
the batsman must do something or he will be bowled out There are three
courses open to him  He must trust to Providence and a good eye
and take a slog or adopt what a humorous cricketer once called the
closedeye blow in which case if hit at all the ball will probably
be hit into the air but perhaps out of harms way or as is quite as
likely into a fielders hands The famous E M Grace who is blessed
with as good an eye as any cricketer frequently plays this stroke with
success  He may adopt what lawyers would call the cyprs doctrine
in other words though he ought to play forward and smother a ball
he may at the same time play forward and not smother the ball which
may hit the bat nevertheless The dangers of this play are obvious
to every cricketer for it leaves him at the mercy of the ball that
bumps hangs or turns Modern grounds are so good that this stroke
is far safer than it used to be for in the majority of instances the
ball comes straight on and only the experienced observer sees that
the batsman comes off with flying colours owing to the excellence of
the ground rather than to his skill  He may after he has got
forward and perceived his error effect a compromise and perform what
is sometimes called a halfcock stroke This stroke does not require
a violent shuffling about of the legs and feet which are placed as
they would be while playing forward but instead of the arms and
hands reaching forward they are brought back so as to hold the bat
quite straight over or a little in front of the popping crease This
position and style of play may be observed in fig  and it is worth
a careful examination for in our opinion it is the proper way for a
man to extricate himself out of the difficulty he has been led into by
misjudging the length of the ball Nobody can play a ball in this way
more skilfully than W G Grace and the figure shows him in the act
of thus playing to a ball which is on the blind spotthat is either
adapted for forward or back play and therefore eminently qualified for
over the crease play a compromise between the two The merit of this
style of play is that it gives the batsman time to watch the ball and
if it should bump or turn he may alter his tactics to meet it whereas
by the second method his play is fixed and cannot be altered and the
awkward hanging bumping or twisting ball beats him Practise by all
means this halfcock stroke on fast grounds it may be found more
useful than even the orthodox back play for in back play unless the
ball is very short the pace of the ground may beat a man especially
when he first goes in and has not got accustomed to the pace The
golden rules to guide the beginner in playing forward may be very
briefly stated  Play forward when the ball is fairly well pitched
up but remember that the faster the bowling and the faster the wicket
the more frequently will forward play be the safer style of play
 Keep the bat quite straight and the left shoulder and elbow well
forward  Get as near to the pitch of the ball as possible  Do
not put the bat further forward than the level of the left foot which
ought to be thrown right forward

Illustration FIG Halfcock or over the crease play

It is often a doubtful question whether a straight drive forward is
what is technically a drive or hit or mere forward play Of course
when the batsman is well set he may hit as hard as he can to a straight
halfvolley but there are many players whose forward play is so
powerful that it practically amounts to a drive Stoddarts forward
play frequently makes midoff tremble and the same used to be said of
Ford and several other players

But to the beginner again until you are well set do not let all your
strength go out to any straight ball if you do you will lose more
than you gain On Lords for instance a hit over the ropes can only
realise four the same as a hit under the ropes you will very likely
therefore score as many for a straight hard bit of forward play as you
will for a regular swipe

When the art of back play to fast bowling is discussed the converse
of what has been said about forward play is true viz that as the
faster the ground the more balls ought to be played forward so
under the same circumstances will fewer balls be played back As a
general rule it may be observed that strongwristed players play more
back than batsmen who play chiefly with their arms and shoulders A
weakwristed player playing back on a very fast wicket will frequently
be late and either miss the ball altogether or else halfstop it
in which latter case it may dribble into the wicket The value of a
strong wrist is that the batsman can dab down on a ball and do the feat
in a far shorter space of time than a shoulderandarm player The
difference between a strong wrist and a weak wrist in playing back is
a little similar to what is observed in an altogether different line
Look at a great underbred carthorse with a leg like a weavers beam
and then look at the real thoroughbred with its slim proportions at
first sight it appears that a kick from the carthorse will inflict
much greater damage than a kick from the thoroughbred People who
are learned in horses however inform us that the contrary is the
case and the greater weight of the leg of the carthorse is more
than counterbalanced by the far more rapid and sudden movement of the
thoroughbred The bat wielded by a player with a strong wrist goes
through the air like lightning and comes down on the ball far quicker
and harder than a ponderous stroke from the arms and shoulders of the
batsman with no wrist action Perhaps the champion backplayer of the
century was Robert Carpenter of Cambridgeshire and United All England
renown whose back play on Lords to the terrific fast bowling of
Jackson and Tarrant will never be forgotten by those who beheld it

Illustration FIG Back play to a bumping ball

A back style of play does not smother the ball at the pitch but
plays at the ball when its course after contact with the ground is
finally determined and a careful watching of the ball is therefore of
the highest importance It is bad ever to assume that because a ball
has pitched on a line with the off stump therefore you are safe if you
protect the off stump only on the assumption that the ball is going on
straight The ball may break back and in order to ascertain that it
has done so and to shift your bat to guard the middle and leg stumps
you must carefully watch the ball Apart from breaking or curling the
ball may shoot or bump in either case the batsman has only his eye to
guide him and the wrist has to obey the eye Fig  represents back
play to a bumping ball Sometimes a ball may be so short that if the
batsman has got his eye well in and is thoroughly accustomed to the
pace of the ground he may by a turn of the wrist keeping the left
shoulder and elbow well forward steer the ball through the slips The
beginner however must be careful to attempt nothing but the orthodox
forms of play he is not W G Grace or Shrewsbury and suchlike who
in their turn do not attempt exceptional feats until they are well
set The ball ought to be met with the full face of the bat and under
no circumstances ought the ball to be allowed to hit the bat which
must be the propeller not the propelled Mind to respect and carefully
follow out the two great commandmentsnever to move the right foot
and to keep the left shoulder forward and left elbow up The number of
hours that a youngster has to be bowled at before that fatal right foot
can be relied upon to keep still is prodigious but the bat cannot be
straight if the body is gravitating towards the direction of short leg
while the ball is in the air To a very short ball different methods
of play may be adopted The one alluded to above the steering of the
ball through the slips is not often attempted and a safer method
would be to try and come heavily down on the ball and force it past
the fields for two or three runs This is a safe stroke much safer to
adopt than the other The bat must be straight and it is wise not to
let your whole strength go out for one or two contingencies may arise
for which the player ought to be prepared In the first place the ball
may shoot and the crisis must be met accordingly Now if the whole of
the strength and all the faculties of a batsman are bent towards the
carrying out of one particular stroke there will be no reserve left to
provide for any other contingency for the muscles will be wholly set
for one stroke and one stroke only and the player will infallibly be
late if the ball should keep a little low Of course on a great many
grounds in these days the chances of such contingencies are reduced
almost to a minimum on account of the excellence of modern wickets but
still we have to inform the reader what may happen not only what
happens commonly Some few players rise superior to grounds and though
of course they can get many more runs on easy wickets still they show
good cricket when the wicket is in favour of the bowler

The prevalence of easy wickets is not in our opinion an unmixed
blessing You may go and watch a match when the ground is as hard as
iron and as true as truth and see a magnificent innings played by some
batsman The same player on a bowlers wicket is not less uncomfortable
than the proverbial fish out of water A man may be a lion on a lawn
but a mere pigmy when the ground is not a lawn There are a great
many of these lions on lawns in these days and to hear them all with
one consent begin to make excuse when they have been bowled out on a
crumbling wicket is very amusing The ball hung or it kept low or
broke back a foot I assure you dear boy W G in his best days
wouldnt have been near it In his best days and almost in his worst
Mr Grace would have often played it and so would Steel Shrewsbury
and one or two othersplanets among the stars to watch whom getting
thirty runs out of a total of eighty on a difficult wicket is far more
enjoyable to a skilled spectator than to see the hundreds got on ABC
wickets The chances that on a hard smooth wicket the very short ball
will do anything abnormal is nowadays reduced to a minimum But still
it may happen and it is therefore wise to have in reserve a little
strength and a little elasticity You can play very hard nevertheless
and for this hard forcing stroke off a short straight ball W Yardley
the late B Pauncefote H C Maul and F G J Ford have never been
surpassed

The ball most to be dreaded for the forcing stroke is the hanging
ball which stops and does not come on evenly and fast to the bat The
batsman will fail to time the ball with the almost certain consequence
that the bat will go on and the ball will be hit from underneath and
up it will go The advice that has been given to keep a slight reserve
of strength to provide against such contingencies as the hanging ball
has the same force now If you have not altogether let the whole force
go out you will have a better chance of doing the correct thing to a
ball of this descriptionnamely to drop the bat and allow the ball
to hit it the exact opposite of your original intention This is an
exception to the general rule that the bat should hit the ball and not
the ball the bat

In all cases a quick and correct eye will enable its owner to come out
of the difficulty with flying colours and any rules that may be laid
down will be utterly useless to him who puts his bat just where the
ball is not but where his inaccurate eye thinks it is If a youth
with the best intentions but with a false and crooked eye after
reading and thoroughly comprehending every rule directing how every
ball ought to be played stands up and tries to play cricket what
will be the result He may even have courageously learnt to pin his
right foot firmly to the ground but notwithstanding this the result
of his efforts will be that though all proper and necessary postures
may be assumed he will be bowled out for the bat except by a lucky
chance will always be in the wrong place though held quite straight
If cricket could be played with no ball the careful eyeless cricketer
would shine but the introduction of that disturbing element dashes all
his hopes to the ground

There is a ball that in these days more frequently than any other
succeeds in bowling people out and that is the familiar tice or
yorker This is nothing else than a ball right up that pitches in
fact near the blockhole but is not a full pitch This ball ought to
be met by the bat just when it touches the ground and the bat ought
to come down very heavily on the ball It is a little difficult to
understand why this ball is so frequently fatal as it comes straight
up and only requires a straight bat and correct timing Probably most
batsmen hope that the eagerlylookedfor halfvolley has at length
come this induces them to lay themselves out for a smite and when
they see their mistake it is too late to alter the tactics Others on
the contrary think that a fullpitch is coming and advance their bat
to meet it the result is the ball gets underneath it In fact the
length of the ball is not correctly judged and the batsman is caught
in two minds A bowler who is in the habit of sending down yorkers is
fond of doing so the first ball after a new batsman comes in and if
a batsman is known to be of a nervous temperament there is no better
ball to give in the first over It may be here said however that it
is next door to impossible to bowl a yorker to some batsmen W G
Grace for instance seems always to be able to make a fullpitch of
this ball and a fourer often results It is obvious that if a ball
pitches near or on a level with the blockhole when the batsman is
standing still it ought to be easy to make it a fullpitch by stepping
out to meet it Mr Grace does this even to fast bowling

Having endeavoured to the best of our ability to enunciate a few
principles as to defensive tactics we will now try and discuss
offensive tactics or hitting A curious feature of the present day
is that new hits have come into existence These have not sprung up
because they were not occasionally brought off in earlier days but
formerly when they were the batsman used to apologise to the bowler
for having wounded his feelings and a sort of groan used to be heard
all round as if there had been some gross violation of a cricket
commandment The grounds have improved to such an extent that bowlers
have had to resort to new tactics to effect the grand object of all
bowlersnamely to get wickets

A fast bowler has one system of tactics a medium and slow bowler
another On hard level wickets a fast bowler in these days is very apt
to bowl short on the off stump and try and make the ball bump and to
cram a lot of fields in the slips while the wicketkeeper stands back
The sort of ball that bowls a man out is frequently a yorker This
is not the perfection of bowling it is a bad style that the modern
perfect wicket has caused to come in A bowler who keeps a splendid
length with really scientific methods like Hearne has his reward in
uncertain weather and on catchy wickets but the baked smooth wickets
of modernday cricket produce such bowlers as Jessop and Jones the
Australian who mainly bowl for catches in the slipsand who can blame
them Slow bowlers have to sacrifice accuracy and length to get twist
or break like Trott the Australian captain and Hartley the Oxonian
and Wainwright this is also because the perfect wickets will not allow
the combination of length and break So the bowlers have to cultivate
an abnormal break which cannot be done without the sacrifice of length

Illustration FIG Gunn cutting

Of all hits the most fascinating to the intelligent spectator is the
cut This requires a very strong use of the wrist and like all wrist
strokes charms the spectator by accomplishing great results at the
expense of apparently little effort Cricket reporters of the present
day are very apt to call any hit that goes in any direction between
coverpoint and longslip a cut and thereby make the term include both
snicks and off drives This is a mistake as nearly every cricketer
can sometimes make an off drive and all can snick the ball even the
worst indeed with some it is the only stroke they seem to possess
but there are many who have hardly ever made a genuine cut in their
lives The real genuine cut goes to the left side of pointassuming
that point stands on a line with the wicketit is made with the right
leg thrown over and its severity depends largely on the perfectly
correct timing of the ball The ball is hit when it has reached a
point almost on a line with the wicket and the length of the ball is
rather short if far up it is a ball to drive and not to cut The bat
should hit the ball slightly on the top and the most correct cutting
makes the ball bound before it gets more than six yards from the
player Figs  and  show Gunn and Shrewsbury in the position proper
for cutting It is a mistake to suppose that the right leg should be
thrown over a long way it is sufficient if the foot be put in front
of the off stump When the player is well in and has thoroughly got
the pace of the ground he very often makes what may be called a clean
cut that is to say he hits with a bat quite horizontal to the ball
and not over it This produces a harder hit as the force is wholly
directed towards sending the ball in the proper direction and not hard
on the ground It is not so safe because if the ball should bump the
bat not being over the ball may hit its lower side and send it up
Therefore be careful to hit over and sacrifice some of the severity
if you wish to play a safe game

Illustration FIG Shrewsbury cutting

Some careful players would hit over the ball even after they have
scored one hundred runs and we have never seen Shrewsbury for
instance cut in any other way In the figure the ball must be
presumed to lie rather low for it is certain that he is following his
invariable custom of getting over the ball In any case we should never
recommend the clean cut to any but the best players and that only on a
perfect wicket and when they are well set If you are in the position
to cut and the ball should bump it is wise to leave it alone for the
danger of being caught at third man is very great We have seen lusty
hitters get right under a bumping off ball and send it high over third
mans head but it is a perilous stroke and is not correct cricket If
the ball on the other hand keeps a bit low after the pitch it is a
most effective stroke to come heavily down on it if the force is put
on the ball at the right moment it will go very hard and may be called
a chop Messrs K J Key and OBrien who are strong players from
every point of view excel at this stroke and they hit the ground at
the same time as the ball with a great power of wrist It is useless
for anybody to hope to cut well unless he has both a strong wrist and
the power of timing

The question now arises What is the player with a weak wrist to do
with a ball that a strongwristed man cuts Some would say that if
he cannot cut in the orthodox vigorous way he ought at any rate to
go as near to it as he can and if he cannot make a clean cut for
four at least he should content himself with two We think however
there is for such players a more excellent way In the cut we have
been describing the right foot is shifted across suppose the player
now moves his left foot not across but simply straight forward to a
ball that is in every way suitable to cut let him then wait till the
ball has gone just past his body and then hit it with the full force
of his arms and shoulders and with as much wrist as he has got The
ball will naturally go in the same direction as the orthodox cut and
quite as hard The player must stand upright and must especially be
careful not to hit the ball before it has passed his body If he does
this off a fast long hop he will bring off a vulgar sort of stroke
which cannot go so hard as the ball hit later because there is greater
resistance to the bat in the correct way the bat hits the ball partly
behind it and as it were helps it on in its natural course whereas
at the incorrect moment the ball has to be thumped in order to send it
in an exactly opposite direction from that in which it is going before
meeting the bat

In our judgment coaches ought to teach all beginners this stroke
whenever they find weakness of wrist The body is put in such a way as
to compensate for a weak wrist and if anyone takes up this position
with a bat in his hand he will find that the stroke partakes of the
qualities of a drive more than of a cut Young players are generally
rather impatient and very apt to hit the ball before it reaches the
level of the body and this fault must be removed

Illustration FIG Oldfashioned sweep to leg Gunn

Let us now discuss the leg hitmost glorious of hitswhere every
muscle of the body may safely be exerted for if you miss it the ball
is not straight so you cannot be bowled and the harder the hit the
less chance is there of being caught at any rate in firstclass
matches in these days of boundaries Bowling having become more
accurate there is not half so much leg hitting now as there used to
be and in the present day you hardly ever hear of a batsman known for
his hitting as George Parr was formerly as also Mr R A H Mitchell
and several others

There are plenty of men who can hit to leg but in these days they
do not often get a chance and it is a rare event nowadays to see any
fieldsman standing at the oldfashioned position of longleg There is
generally a field stationed against the ropes to save four byes when
a fast bowler is on who can also stop leg snicks from going to the
ropes but to carry the illustration farther as in leg hitting there
is no George Parr so in fielding at long leg there is no Jack Smith
of Cambridge It is rapidly dying out In a match which we ourselves
saw at Sheffield in  between Notts and Yorkshire for a whole day
and a half there was not one genuine leg smack except off lobs and at
no time was a field placed there This is hard for the batsman but it
is even harder for the spectators who love to see a grand squareleg
hit George Parrs leg hit for which he was unrivalled was the sweep
to longleg off a shortish ball that many modern players would lie
back to and play off their legs George Parr would extend his left leg
straight forward and sweeping round with a horizontal bat send the
ball very hard and frequently along the ground This hit has really
totally disappeared in these days When George Parr played he used to
punish terrifically bowlers like Martingell of Surrey and Kent who
relied on a curl from leg and bowled round the wicketa most effective
style naturally producing however many leg balls It is all the
other way now and it may be taken for certain that for every leg ball
you see now in firstclass matches you saw ten or twenty in former
days However young players in schools are certain to get plenty of
convenient balls to hit so they must remember to throw out the left
leg and hit as near to the pitch as possible and as hard as they can
The ball may start in the direction of squareleg but its natural bias
after it has gone a certain distance will be towards longleg or behind
the wicket and the fieldsman must remember this or he will find the
ball fly away behind him on his right side Be very careful never to
try this stroke to balls that are on the wicket or even nearer the
wicket than four inches at least If it is within that distance it is
a ball to drive and not to hit to leg Fig  shows Gunn carrying
out this stroke and the batsman may put his left leg in front of the
wicket if he is certain the ball did not pitch straight This hit
ought only to be attempted when the ball is short of a halfvolley If
the ball is a halfvolley or at any rate well up the proper hit is
in front of the wicket or to squareleg and with a vertical not a
horizontal bat In this hit how far to throw out the left leg depends
on the length of the ball the batsman may even sometimes have to draw
it back a little and stand upright and face the ball if it is well up
There is no hit that can be made harder than this to squareleg and
there have been many records of gigantic squareleg hits Some hitters
have sent the ball as far by the lofty smack straight over the bowlers
head but more batsmen can generally hit farther to squareleg and
only a short time ago Mr Key sent a ball right out of the Oval In
years gone by Lord Cobham and R A H Mitchell were renowned for their
squareleg hitting as was Carpenter also There is no very special
rule to be observed for this hit except that the ball must be on the
legs or just outside them and not straight or within four or five
inches of the leg stump If the ball is tolerably wide on the leg
the bat will be more horizontal as it hits the ball which will in
consequence go sharper and vice vers if the ball is just crooked
enough to hit it will when hit go more straight and be called by
the cricket reporters an on drive though it is a squareleg hit
Fig  is supposed to represent W G Grace hitting to squareleg and
the reader must assume that the fieldsman is running to field the ball
going on a line or in front of the wicket and not behind it

Some players there are who never seem to hit at any ball but push
it all along the ground and for this purpose they get farther over
the ball and simply use the weight of the body using the arms and
shoulders but little

This is an eminently safe game but to these players we would only
observe that they deprive themselves of the glorious sensation
alluded to at the beginning of this chapter which comes when a ball
is hit with all the force that nature can supply and a fine driving
bat can supplement Cricket is a game the primary object of games is
to give pleasure to the players and it is quite impossible that the
same amount of keen gratification can await the stick who never hits
as is realised by the man who though he may only be at the wickets
half the time yet in that time makes at least ten great hits that
will realise forty runs There is however a good length ball on the
legs to which this push can be usefully applied if the batsman is one
of the numerous class of cricketers who cannot make use of the sweep
to leg This stroke is made by slightly moving out of the ground or
rather the whole weight of the body being inclined forward the right
foot is dragged forward also This may seem to violate a cardinal
rule laid down beforethat the right foot should never be moved It
must be remembered that the reasons why the right foot should not be
moved mainly apply when the foot is moved in front of the wicket or
towards shortleg It is invariably wrong to go out of your ground
when the fast ball is straight or on the off side for in both these
instances if you miss the ball even if it does not hit the wicket
you are under the risk of being stumped But to move out of your ground
to a fast ball on your legs practically lays you open to no danger of
being stumped for if you should miss the ball you will stop it with
your legs Now imagine yourself utterly unable to sweep the ball to
leg as George Parr used to do and receiving a ball that you cannot
reach at the pitch so as to hit with a straight batin other words
rather a short ballwhat are you to do If the ball is very short you
will probably get back bring your left foot on a line with and close
to the right and try either to make the ball glide off your bat to
longleg or play it with a full face for a single in front of shortleg

Fig  shows W G Grace attempting the glide and apparently he has
hardly moved either leg presumably therefore the ball is not very
short but only just too short to hit This is a stroke in which W G
Grace excels as indeed he does in most others but it is a dangerous
one unless the left elbow is kept well up for otherwise if the ball
bumps you will find your bat sloping backwards and the ball will go up

Illustration FIG The glide W G Grace

We must now think of the proper way to play a ball on the legs that
is not short enough for the batsman to play back to in this way
though on the other hand it cannot be hit to squareleg with a
straight bat The batsman also on account of some natural disability
has always been unable to learn the secret of the George Parr sweep
This sort of ball must be played forward and if necessary the
batsman may even leave his ground and push it in front of short leg
As has been said before if he should miss the ball his legs will save
him from being stumped The ball must be smothered as far as possible
and pushed on in front of shortleg and the reason why it is not hit
harder is simply because you cannot quite get at the pitch and if
therefore you hit hard at it you would probably sky the ball The
bat must be kept at the proper slope as the body is lunging forward
a great deal of impetus will be given to the hit by the mere weight
of the body and the ball will frequently find its way to the ropes
This play is most useful when opposed to lefthanded bowlers for then
the ball is apt to follow the arm and come straight in the direction
of the batsmans left hip The famous trio of Uppingham cricketers
Messrs Patterson Lucas and D Q Steel were very strong in this
stroke and in an innings of over a hundred which Mr Patterson played
at Lords in  against Oxford a large proportion of his runs were
made in this way In ancient days many balls on the leg side used to be
played by a now practically obsolete stroke called the draw which
consisted of an ugly lifting up of the left leg and letting the ball
glide off the bat between the legs towards longleg It was as much
part of the rpertoire of a player of the old style as a cut or a
drive but it has utterly gone out of fashion as a stroke to be learnt
simply because it had no further effect than the glide off the bat as
now practised the modern style has also the additional advantage of
being more elegant and there is less chance of the ball hitting the
foot The famous Jemmy Grundy used frequently to play this stroke
and his mantle appears to have descended on some younger Nottingham
players for at the present day they sometimes use it It used to be
brought off occasionally by the famous Richard Daft and was in fact
the only stroke of this graceful and most correct player that was not
elegant As we have now got on the subject of the draw we may as well
describe the other sort of obsolete draw which was performed by just
touching the ball with the bat quite straight but with its left side
turned towards the wicketkeeper or what soldiers would call left
halfface held some way behind the body Tom Hearne used to be great
at this sort of draw but it is even more entirely gone out of fashion
as a stroke than the other style The same effect is produced by what
is frequently seennamely a batsman only just snicking a ball off the
leg stump or just touching it leaving the spectator uncertain whether
the ball has been played or has hit the wicket Tom Hearne who was
the last player who used to practise this stroke methodically was in
the habit of jumping with both feet towards shortleg and leaving the
bat in the correct position for the draw and not unfrequently he was
caught at the wicket owing to the ball not being turned sufficiently
sometimes though not often if the bound towards shortleg happened
to be a little too much in front he used to be stumped This stroke
necessitated moving the right leg towards shortleg and it is on this
ground mainly that we contend that it is not sound cricket but as has
before been stated it is now quite obsolete and to imagine it you
must also imagine yourself in the days of tall hats pads under the
trousers and braces holding up a curious type of pantaloon such as
the late Mr Burgoyne treasurer of the MCC used to wear up to the
day of his death The play shown in fig  is made by drawing back the
left foot coming hard on to the ball and forcing it in the direction
of shortleg In our judgment this is the right play for all short
balls on the legs for the ball is near to the body and consequently
to the eye you have therefore great facility in placing it and you
have also the bat at a proper angle It is more correct than the stroke
shown in fig  for there if the ball should bump it will run up the
shoulder of the bat and possibly get caught by the wicketkeeper
shortslip or even point and shortleg and we have seen several
instances of the ball hitting the bat not in the front but at the
side of the bat In the former play the ball has to hit the bat in
the latter the bat hits the ball and according to the fancy of the
batsman can either be hit in front of shortleg or be suffered to
glide towards very sharp longleg The figure however does not quite
convey the impression that the ball is being hit hard The bat may have
descended from over the batsmans head especially if the ball is very
short while the figure only shows the end of the stroke

Illustration FIG Forcing stroke off the legs

The off drive in the direction of coverpoint and to the right hand
of point is a favourite hit with many players Barnes of Nottingham
plays it to perfection The ball to hit in this way is one well up on
the off side though it need not be a halfvolley The left foot is
thrown across the ball is hit with a nearly perpendicular bat and
the stronger the wrist the cleaner and harder will be the hit In this
and every other hit correct timing is most important and whatever the
beginner may try do not let him attempt to hit wildly at the pitch of
the ball Let the left foot be put across and be careful to hit over
the ball in order to keep it down for if you do not and the ball
bumps it will inevitably go up The ball should be a foot or so wide
of the wicket the batsman at the moment of striking the ball will be
facing coverpoint and will have his left shoulder well forward as in
fig  The bat is well over the shoulder and is coming down nearly
perpendicularly on the ball which is not a halfvolley if it were
the bat would be straighter and the ball would be driven straighter
But the ball is hit after it has gone about a foot from the pitch If
the ball is a foot or two wide of the wicket and well up it would be
hit in a similar position for the bat cannot be held straight to hit
a ball at this distance from the wicket if it should go straight it
would be a pull and not a clean hit and the further the ball from the
wicket the further ought the left foot to be moved across Whatever you
do refrain from hitting a ball when there is reasonable expectation of
the umpire calling Wide You may hit it for two or three runs you
are more likely only just to touch it with the end of the bat and get
caught by third man or point you are still more likely to cover it and
not score off it thereby losing a run for your side

Illustration CAUGHT AT THE WICKET

So completely has the modern method of bowling on the off side for
catches established itself that cautious players like Donnan and
Abel have got into the habit of leaving off balls altogether alone
Granted that the bowling is accurate and the fields well placed county
clubs will very soon find out that if this course is pursued much
further cricket will become a very dull game to watch and a match
will probably seldom lead to a decisive result It may be done to a
good length ball outside the off stump when you first go in and have
neither got a good sight of the ball nor the pace of the ground but
that batsmen should habitually watch the wicketkeeper take the ball
while they stand right in front of the wicket with their bats behind
them is carrying caution so far that some people would call it not
a virtue but a vice We actually saw a cautious player receive four
consecutive off balls and not make an attempt to hit one What pleasure
can there be in batting if these tactics are adopted And let such
players please think of the unhappy spectators The ball can be hit
if you will only get your left foot well across and get well over the
ball and even if your energies are chiefly directed towards hitting
the ball on the ground the ball will be hit and the field may make
a mistake at any rate you have made an effort and not given up in
despair It is like a timid man running away from danger instead of
facing it as he should and it is better to try and to fail than not
to try at all Never mind your average you cannot win a match by such
tactics though you may make a draw of it

Illustration FIG Off drive

The off drive by coverpoint must be always made by putting the
left leg across and not the right and the old principle never to
be departed from namely to keep the left shoulder and elbow well
forward must be again emphasised When you have once got into position
you are master of the situation you are right over the ball and you
may leave it alone if it should bump or you may wait till the ball
has passed you and then make the cut with left leg over in the way
described before You are not in the most favourable attitude for the
cut because your left leg is too much over but it can be brought off
and if only a great deal of practice is given to this off drive there
will be no necessity for leaving balls alone

There are several players to whom is denied the ability and capacity
to make these off strokes who are defective in wrist and careful
timing of the ball but who are fully capable of taking quite proper
care of a halfvolley or balls well up Such players are under a great
disadvantage when they get balls on the off side that are shorter than
the halfvolley for they certainly cannot take the same advantage of
them But they have a great many courses open to them and if they will
get the left leg over and hit over the ball they will run no risk of
getting out and a casual ball will be well timed and hit accordingly
But they have also the waiting stroke open to them and this consists
of letting the ball get past them and simply letting it glide off the
bat in the direction of longslip The faster the bowling the more
runs will result from this stroke as the ball is hit at a longer time
after it has pitched than it is when the batsman meets it by the more
effective method there is more time to observe its pace and direction
and if such a player is only careful to get over the ball he will get
a lot of runs in this way

Lastly there is the hard drive which partakes largely of forward
play but yet is a hit to which you can open your shoulders It is made
with a straight bat either on the off side on side or straight over
the bowlers head

To fast bowling the difficulty arises of distinguishing this stroke
from forward play for so many balls from fast bowlers on hard wickets
are played forward that are not by any means halfvolleys and yet go
very hard In fact there are occasions when fast grounds and fast
bowling combine to make batting very easywhen as a wellknown
Yorkshire fast bowler said If you poke at her she goes for four
There is no real necessity for ever having a regular smack at straight
balls from a very fast bowler it is practically as effective to play
them forward with the weight of the body thrown on the left foot
and the arms and shoulders kept free and loose No more beautiful
exponent of this graceful forward play has ever lived than Lionel
Palairet of Somerset But by all means hit as hard as you possibly
can at a halfvolley outside the off stump the ball will either make
midoff tremble or else go straight to the ropes between midoff and
coverpoint You move the left foot slightly forward a little in front
of the wicket and you hit at the ball with a straight bat and get
well over it to keep it along the ground Hold your bat tight for if
it should turn in your hands there will be a misshit and you will be
caught at coverpoint or elsewhere You can hit your hardest at the
halfvolley just off the wicket for the simple reason that if you do
miss the ball you cannot be bowled and there is no more chance of
missing if you put out your whole strength to it than if you simply
drive it forward with a straight bat So keep a little reserve of
strength in all straight balls but to a crooked halfvolley put your
whole force into the blow and hit as though you wished to do the ball
an injury

About the halfvolley on the on side very little need be said We have
observed before that the ball just outside the leg stump to within two
or three inches of it is a ball to drive and not hit to leg It should
be hit towards midon or between the bowler and midon and to apply
what has been said before hit it as hard as you can as if you do miss
it you will not be bowled Keep the right leg still and lunge forward
on to your left foot which should be a little thrown forward and hold
the bat tight

We have now sufficiently discussed the principles that ought to guide
the young player in playing fast bowling on a good fast wicket and
if he observes what has been said he will find that he plays a good
safe game assuming that his eye is straight and that he is able to
put his bat in the place where his eye shows him it ought to go The
play to fast bowling on slow tricky wickets brings out the batsmans
real talent and he will discover that what was easy on a hard wicket
is full of difficulty on a soft There are no decisive rules to guide
the player on such wickets he must trust to his eye and capacity for
watching the ball The player that can watch the ball carefully is the
man who will succeed on slow difficult wickets and anybody who has
seen Grace Shrewsbury and A G Steel bat under these circumstances
will understand what this watching the ball means If the ground is
very fast there is hardly any time for a careful watching of the ball
the player must play largely by instinct which will tell him where
the ball is going and as the wickets nowadays are so very true the
ball will nearly always take a natural course that is straight from
the pitch The lefthanded bowler round the wicket will come with
the bowlers arm slightly from off to leg the righthanded bowler
also round the wicket from leg to off but these are both the natural
courses the ball ought to take On slow wickets however the ball will
come slower it will take all sorts of fantastical turns and twists
it will get up straight and sometimes hang or stop a little It will
generally be found that very fast bowlers do not shine on slow soft
wickets for they have great difficulty in getting a good foothold
It is the medium and slow bowlers who revel on such ground as Briggs
and Giffen can tell you The batsman will find that he is bound to
play more back and less forward for it is little good to play forward
unless the ball can be smothered owing to the extraordinary pranks the
ball will indulge in after it has pitched He will therefore be found
playing more on his right leg and the runs will inevitably come much
slower It has been ascertained by experience that hitters are of more
value on these difficult wickets than sticks for the latter though
they may stay in for an hour will perhaps not get a dozen runs during
that period The hitter however if he brings off four hits does more
execution in a quarter of an hour than the stick will do in thrice that
time

The value of three or four hitters in an eleven was never more
distinctly shown than in the case of the Australian Elevens of 
and  and the Gloucestershire and Cambridge Elevens of  In
the Gloucestershire and Cambridge Elevens of  Jessops hitting
has on several occasions turned a match in a quarter of an hour and
this player certainly has the greatest gift we ever saw of hitting
balls of any and all lengths The Australian  eleven had four
big hittersMcDonnell Bonnor Giffen and Massie In the great
international match at the Oval in  Massie got the fiftyfive runs
in Australias second innings that practically won the match and to
say he hit at every ball is scarcely an exaggeration There was also a
match against Yorkshire at Holbeck where McDonnells scores of over
thirty in one innings and over forty in the other certainly won the
match for his side In  Surrey had to go in to get eightyseven
runs to win Abel was playing for an hour and threequarters while
Garrett and Evans were bowling every ball dead on the wicket and
during that time laboriously compiled thirteen runs The result of the
match was really very doubtful after the fall of the seventh wicket
but Jones a courageous cricketer seeing what was the right game
went out and hit Palmer over the ropes for four and the value of this
hit cannot be exaggerated As a rule it may be taken for granted that
steady and slow play useful and good as it is in its way will not win
matches on slow difficult wickets unless there is a sprinkling of three
or four hitters in the eleven By the doctrine of chances you will find
that one of the number will come off and one innings like Massies
may win the match To the player who has any hit in him we therefore
advise the playing of a freer game on slow difficult wickets than on
easy ones In the latter case runs are bound to come if only you stop
there but they will not in the former You may leave your ground even
to fast bowling on slow wickets if you think you can bring off a hit
by so doing and generally hold the bat nearer the top and give her
the long handle The defensive player if he cannot do this must play
generally back with the weight on the right leg watch the ball very
carefully take advantage of any loose ball that may be bowled and
try and place the ball for singles to shortleg or in the slips The
bowlers find it more easy to put on break or curl on soft wickets
so whereas on hard wickets you may almost assume that the ball will
play no pranks but come on straight on soft you may almost assume the
contrary The ball that hangs or stops a bit after pitching instead
of coming on is perhaps the most fatal ball that is bowled If the
batsman plays forward to such a ball he will very likely find that he
has done playing before the ball has reached his bat this means that
the bottom of the bat goes on and gets under the ball and he is caught
and bowled So frequently does this ball come that it is well not to
play hard on soft wickets for if the ball hangs at all it must go up
on being hit For defensive play we think the bat ought not to be held
at all tightly but rather slackly for you cannot get a run by hard
forward play or hard back play on such wickets

The general characteristics of play to slow bowling such as that of
Tyler Peel Briggs and others are so very different that we must make
a few special remarks on them The great amount of slow bowling is a
development of modern times not that slow roundarm bowling did not
formerly exist but it certainly did not to anything like the extent
it does now In the days which we all of us have heard talked about by
old cricketers at Lords when Mynn Redgate Hillyer and Lillywhite
flourished there were some lob bowlers notably the famous Wm Clarke
but there were few genuine slow roundarm bowlers and Wm Lillywhite
had a long stop even when the renowned Tom Box was keeping wicket as
may be seen in the wellknown engraving of the match between Kent and
Sussex played about the year  Coming to later times from  to
 there was as far as we can gather but one real professional
slow roundarm bowler namely George Bennett Between  and 
may be said to be the dark age of amateur fast bowling and to a less
degree of professional Since that date however the amateur fast
bowling has wonderfully improved and the famous S M J Woods led the
way and has been followed by Jessop Jackson Kortright Cunliffe and
others while the great Richardson we think is the best fast bowler
that has ever bowled when the amount of work and the perfect wickets
are considered

From a theoretical point of view to real slow bowling all forward
play ought to be banished If the ball is short play back to it if it
is tolerably well up there ought to be time to go out and meet it and
drive it at the pitch There are some quickfooted players who carry
this theory into practice but generally if you observe firstclass
cricket you will find that there are plenty of players who never
leave their ground even to slow bowling unless they are really well
set This partly comes from the great caution which is undoubtedly
exercised more now than it was twenty or thirty years ago and partly
from the fact that the bowling though some of it very slow is not
tossed up so high in the air as it was by Bennett and earlier bowlers
Peate for instance in his prime the best length bowler for the last
twenty years did not toss the ball at all high in the air nor did
the renowned Alfred Shaw the most accurate bowler that ever lived
But we still think that more running in might be practised for there
is nothing that more completely demoralises a bowler than a player who
comes out and drives when the ball is at all overpitched We have seen
slow bowlers who do not possess much head completely demoralised by a
quickfooted player like Mr A G Steel They preserve their dignity
by bowling so short that though maiden overs might abound wickets
certainly would not fall Let the cricketer when playing to slow
bowling stand a little easier in order that when he has made up his
mind to meet the ball his right foot will not be rooted to the ground
as it ought to be when playing to fast bowling on fast wickets Fig 
shows Shrewsbury going out to drive but he is evidently only at the
beginning of his jump and by the time the bat has got over the ball he
will be a couple of yards outside the crease Remember if you are to
be stumped you may as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb You
are equally out if you are an inch or ten yards out of your ground so
never hesitate to go out as far as you can in order to make the hit a
certainty and if you can hit the ball fullpitch by all means do so
as you ought never to miss a fullpitch You can also pull a fullpitch
to leg or anywhere on the on side where fieldsmen are scarce and it is
a sign that for that particular occasion the bowler is defeated if the
batsman has not permitted the ball to touch the ground

Illustration FIG Running out to drive Shrewsbury

If you find on going out to hit a ball that it is too short and
you cannot get at the pitch of it you have several courses open to
you If you are a very big hitter and the field is not very far out
it is worth while to try the experiment of hitting as hard as you can
the ball must go high and may go over the ropes or out of harms way
indeed some great hitters seem to prefer a ball that is not quite a
halfvolley Mr C I Thornton the biggest hitter the world has ever
beheld with the exception of G J Bonnor and perhaps Lyons has made
his longest hits off such balls as these while Bonnor who possesses
a prodigious reach seldom leaves his ground at all and constantly
sends the ball out of the ground by hitting short of the actual pitch
If the ball is smothered it cannot go up in the air and though it is
more correct cricket to get over the ball and drive it forward as
Shrewsbury and A G Steel do it is probable that the great hitters
would lose more than they gained by playing the orthodox game There
is a golden rule to be carefully remembered in playing slows and that
is never to run out to a ball that is well outside the off stump
We do not mean to bar the player from running out to a ball which is
absurdly overpitched and which he is certain to get fullpitch if
he goes out but he should not leave his ground to the halfvolley
unless it is nearly straight There is more than one reason for this
In the first place if you miss the ball it is the easiest sort for
the wicketkeeper to take and any moderately decent wicketkeeper
will certainly have you out In the second place an off ball is one
that it is impossible to hit or play with a straight bat and if you
run out to slows you ought always to hit thus and this rule is sound
even when you run out to a ball on your legs for that is generally
hit to longon with a straight bat and not to leg It is generally
true that you should never leave your ground to any ball that may be
called crooked whether it is to leg or to the off for in either case
you run a serious risk of being stumped it is only straight or nearly
straight balls that you ought to meet by going out of your ground The
modern slow bowler is so very accurate that he very rarely bowls on the
leg side at all and the oldfashioned lobber who used to bowl on the
leg side with a twist from leg and have four or five fields on the leg
side is gradually disappearing The ball that in nineteen cases out of
twenty you have to meet by going out of your ground is therefore the
straight ball

As far as lobs are concerned you can play them by stopping in your
ground but the really good player to lobs runs out to a certainty
when the ball is overpitched and the famous Wm Clarke used to say
that Pilch played him best as he used to wait his opportunity and
meet him and run him down with a straight bat If you come to reason
out the theory of batting to slows and think how you can best defend
your wicket and best score off such bowling you will easily satisfy
yourself that by playing back and gently forward you may ensure safety
for a considerable period but you cannot score even moderately fast
The ball does not come up to the bat fast off the ground as in fast
bowling and if you play forward hard you run the enormous risk of
being caught and bowled or caught at mid off In other words while
to fast bowling you play forward to get runs to slow bowling you
play forward to defend your wicket If therefore you play the
extracautious game and stick in your ground or from some cause or
another are unable ever to give her the rush you will not be able
to score except by casual singles unless you wait and fully avail
yourself of a full pitch or an outrageous long hop relished and often
obtained when amateurs are bowling but very seldom delivered in
firstclass matches and practically never by professional players

It is difficult to know what to do with the good length off ball
It is much harder to cut slow bowling than fast greater strength
of wrist is wanted and there are many players who are unable to do
more than merely pat the ball towards third man for a single or two
runs Slow bowlers have a great fancy for bowling without a field at
third man and this is to the advantage of the batsman but even if
there is a third man at any rate he cannot cover more than a certain
amount of ground and you will find that many a run may be got by the
pat Mind and get over the ball and you cannot then come to grief
by being caught at third man or shortslip and very rarely by the
wicketkeeper The bumping ball ought to be left alone this sort of
ball is the only one in meeting which prudence is the better part of
valour and no attempt ought to be made to hit at all The old Adam
within them forces a great many players to try and hit but it is
almost a certainty that if the ball is hit it must be from underneath
and up in the air it will consequently go On a soft slow wicket any
run getting to good slow bowling is extremely difficult but even on
such wickets you will lose nothing and gain the casual single by the
pat

The good length ball on the off side is the modern batsmans bugbear
but it is far easier to play when the bowling is fast than when it is
slow It is easier to cut in the first instance and there are seldom
so many fields on the off side to the fast bowler But the slow ball
can be and ought to be driven along the ground if the batsman gets
well over it times it correctly and throws the left leg across in
the same way as we explained in describing the proper method of making
this stroke off fast bowling It is more difficult to time good slow
bowling when the bowler is continually altering his pace than fast
and herein lies the difficulty of hitting these off balls Bear in
mind however that by keeping well over the ball you practically run
no risk of being caught anywhere sooner or later you will get your eye
in and when that desirable consummation is accomplished you will be
astonished to find how safely you will hit many balls that when you are
looking on it seems impossible to hit without incurring considerable
danger But nothing can be gained by leaving balls alone you run the
minimum of risk by hitting at them if only you observe the two rules
which ought to be hung in your bedroom and branded into your brain
Put the left leg over and Get on the top of the ball Above all
things do not play for a draw

From what has been said on the principles which govern the proper
playing of fast and slow bowling the reader may be led to think that
slow bowling is far more difficult to play successfully than fast
Chacun  son got is true no doubt but we are inclined to think
that to the majority of players in the prime of their play slow
bowling is on the whole more difficult to play especially on hard
wickets Take the case of W G Grace It was almost a waste of time on
hard wickets to put on fast bowlers when Mr Grace was at his best The
sole advantage to be derived from so doing arose from the fact that it
was advisable to distract his eye and for this purpose a fast bowler
was useful By this we mean that when slow bowlers were on at both
ends his eye would become more accustomed to the pace of the ground
and in a shorter time than it would have been if a fast bowler had been
on at one end But the fast bowler was on mainly to enable the slow
bowler to get him out and if the reader looks at Mr Graces enormous
scores of twenty years back he will find that Shaw Southerton Peate
and Lillywhite got him out a dozen times to the fast bowlers once And
the runs that came from bowlers like Martin McIntyre were astonishing
anywhere cuts pushes through any number of shortlegs big drives and
colossal leg hitsall were alike to the great batsman

On soft wickets though many think otherwise we believe that fast or
mediumpaced bowling is more difficult This must be assumed only in
the case of those fast bowlers who have power to keep their precision
and pace on slow wickets like Morley and Richardson The variety of
wickets as is shown in the chapter on Bowling is very great and on
the real mud farmyard sort of wicket it is generally safe to presume
that fast bowlers cannot act When there is a slight drizzling rain
which keeps the ball and surface of the ground wet fast bowlers
flounder about like porpoises and the only bowlers who can act at all
are the slow though they are very much handicapped But on the real
bowlers wicket soft yet gradually hardening by the effect of the
sun cteris paribus the fast or fast medium bowler will as a rule
be the most deadly The year  was on the whole the wettest year
for cricket that the present generation has seen and it is instructive
to turn to the result of the seasons bowling for the county of
Nottingham This county possessed in Alfred Shaw and Morley the two
best bowlers in Englandone slow the other fast Here is the analysis
of each for Nottingham

         Overs  Maidens  Runs  Wickets  Average
 Morley                       
 Shaw                        

It will be seen from this pair of analyses that Morleys is slightly
better all round than Shaw with the exception of the number of
maiden overs But maiden overs are not the final goal of the bowlers
ambition They are only means to an end The true bowlers one idea
is to get wickets The reader will note that Morley the fast bowler
got no fewer than twentyseven wickets more than Shaw which more than
makes up for the latters greater success in bowling maidens The year
 was doubtless a great year for bowlers but none the less we doubt
whether taking a whole seasons work for a county this record has
ever been surpassed by any pair of bowlers at any time and it is as
good an illustration of the truth of our theory that in wet years slow
bowlers are not likely to succeed so well as fast or mediumpace

It has always appeared to us that the reason why real slow bowling is
slightly less deadly than fast or medium on slow wickets is simply that
the batsman is more at the mercy of the eccentricities of the ground
when playing to the latter class of bowling than when playing to the
former He always has the power if he would only exercise it of
leaving his ground to balls of a certain length from the slow bowler
and smothering them And again let the beginner lay this axiom to
heart the ground can commit no devilry if the ball is smothered at the
pitch On slow wickets therefore to slow bowling leave your ground
with even less hesitation than on fast and argue in this way that as
life against these bowlers and on this wicket is certain to be a short
one therefore it had better be a merry one for the sake of the score

There are and have been a few great men with the bat who obey no
law but possess that strange indefinable gift called genius which
rises superior to any difficulty of ground or bowling these batting
luminaries may play their ordinary game on slow difficult wickets and
their genius enables them to do what ordinary mortals cannot On really
difficult wickets Shrewsbury shone and on the whole he has proved
himself the best player the world has ever seen on caking difficult
soft wickets But let the ordinary player who has acquired a certain
amount of skill in batting remember that cricket on hard and fast
wickets and cricket on slow are two quite different things and that
he must alter his game to suit the circumstances The very fastfooted
bookish sort of player is the one who is most at sea on soft wickets
and this last bit of advice we respectfully urge upon himthat one
hit for four and out next ball will probably be of more value to his
side than twenty minutes careful defence and no run It is not on soft
wickets that drawn games are played unless there is rain after the
match has begun it is on dry wickets with boundaries close in that
the plethora of runs makes the game dull to all except the ignorant
spectator and the voracious batsman Of course if there is only a
short time left before the drawing of stumps and conclusion of the
match say an hour and a half or two hours it may be of importance to
play for a draw then the twentyminuteswithoutarun batsman may be
the means of salvation for his side as Louis Hall has proved to be
more than once for Yorkshire but except under such circumstances
the hitter who runs a certain risk for the sake of a hit is the more
valuable man

A few words now on running A man is out if run out as decisively
as if his middle stump is knocked down but being run out is more
annoying than being bowled so everybody ought to learn how to run
Some fieldsmen are so renowned for their throwing and rapidity of
movement that when such a man is going for the ball the batsman will
not venture on a run which under ordinary circumstances he might
safely make In any event do not run if you feel any doubt of its
safety The first invariable rule is that the striker calls the run
if the ball is hit in front of the wicket This is simple to remember
and there is no exception unless it be when the ball is hit to third
man under certain circumstances These circumstances refer to the
fieldsman himself If the third man knows his business and throws to
the bowler the striker has to run the risk therefore he ought to
call If the third man is a player of tradition and always throws to
the wicketkeeper the nonstriker is in danger but if he is backing
up he never will be run out All hits behind the wicketexcept in
the case above mentionedmust be called by the nonstriker and the
striker must not look at the ball after he has hit it but at the
nonstriker The man who has not to judge the run must have a simple
childlike faith in the judgment of his partner and if he gets run out
he may remonstrate gently with him afterwards with good reason The man
who is receiving the ball can easily get into the habit of watching
it after it has passed him on its way to the longstop or if he has
hit it to longslip but this is a bad habit and if indulged in will
result in the two batsmen holding different ideas as to whether a run
can be got or not on which subject there must be no difference of
opinion If the batsman to whom rightly belongs the call shouts run
and his colleague shouts no unless one gives way promptly there may
be a crisis at hand Never do batsmen look so foolish as when they
affectionately meet at the same wicket and nothing is so maddening to
the supporters of a side as to see a good batsman well set deliberately
lose his wicket by the folly of either his colleague or himself If
batsmen will only remember that the decision of the run must rest with
one man and that his call must be obeyed at once there will not be
many runs out When say the third run is being made and the question
whether a fourth can be successfully attempted arises that batsman who
has to run to the wicket nearest the ball ought to call The reason
of this is that as the ball is a considerable way from the nearest
wicket it is almost certain to be thrown there and the batsman who
calls ought to be he who runs the risk We will give the following
rules to be remembered by every cricketer with regard to running 
The striker must call every time when the ball is hit in front of the
wicket  The nonstriker must call every run when the ball is hit
behind the wicket except in the case of hits to third man as mentioned
above  Whoever has to shout let him shout loudly there is no
penalty attaching to a yell and it is comforting to a man to know his
colleagues intention without any doubt  If a bye is being run
the striker must run straight down the wicket as he may be saved from
being run out by the ball hitting his head instead of the wicket for
which mercy he ought to be duly thankful  On all other occasions
run wide of the wicket so as not to cut it up  Always run for a
catch if sent reasonably high into the air if it is caught no harm is
done to you and to be missed and to secure a run in one and the same
hit is a veritable triumph  Run the first run as hard as you can
and turn quickly after grounding your bat within the popping crease
for the fieldsman may bungle even the easiest ball and it is never
safe to assume that there can be no second run

We hope that we have now explained the true principles of batting to
guide the youthful player in his path One other word of caution A
young cricketer may go to Lords and watch a great match he may see
the giants of the game performMacLaren Ranjitsinhji Jackson and
Palairet He will wonder and admire but let him beware of imitation
which may lead him into innumerable quagmires In another walk of
life literature you will find facetious writers who are fond of
imitating the style of famous authors and very amusing the attempts
sometimes are but it is easily seen that the points they successfully
imitate are the roughnesses and eccentricities which are frequently
characteristic of great authors An imitator of Carlyle for instance
revels in the brusque eccentricities of the great mans style but he
never succeeds in portraying his noble qualities It is much the same
in cricket genius defies imitation and is only by poor struggling
humanity to be admired In the prime of his play nothing in cricket
was grander than the sight of W G Grace scoring two runs off a ball
that any other cricketer would have been only too happy to stop No
school coach that understood his business would tell a youth to play
certain balls as they are played by Mr A G Steel who sometimes
adopts the most daring methods and it is not safe to infer that
anybody else in the world can play in a like manner It is so with
hitting Bonnor Lyons OBrien Ford and Jessop can hit many balls
which the great majority of other cricketers would only venture to play
gently forward Some critics who are great at criticism but great
at nothing else have been known to shake their heads at some of the
methods of great players but we can assure these gentlemen that real
genius admits no more of criticism than it does of imitation The four
nevertobeviolated rules previously mentioned need not trouble the
genius at all no human law need concern him he is a law to himself
and looks down from a lofty eminence on his weaker brethren What is
the good of telling A G Steel not to move out of his ground to fast
bowling seeing that he does so constantly and gets four runs by a
fine hit when he gives her the rush He will not heed you and why
should he

Apart altogether from the natural accuracy and quickness of hand and
eye without a proper allowance of which labour will be in vain a
great deal depends on the temperament of each player Whether failure
is owing to health to inability to recover elasticity of spirits
after a few defeats or to some other cause it is impossible to say
But let the good player who goes through a whole month or perhaps
even a season with very bad luck and comes out in the end with a bad
average comfort himself with this reflection that not only have good
players had these reverses but even the very best Mr W G Grace
must be accustomed to hear and see his name referred to but even he
has had spells of bad luck and he will we are sure excuse us if we
put in full the following figures of innings which were played when he
was in his prime

 June  and  Gloucestershire v Surrey
     c R Humphrey b Street                                         

 June  and  MCC v Cambridge University
     c Ward b Bray                                                  
     c Thornton b Bray                                              

 June  and  MCC v Oxford University
     c and b Butler                                                 

 June  and  Gentlemen of South v Players of South
     c Lillywhite b Southerton                                      
     b Lillywhite                                                    

These figures show how the mighty do sometimes fall and this certainly
ought to console those in the humbler walks of the cricket world Some
players have shot up like rockets played for a season or so and then
have been heard of no more but the county that plays a series of
county matches will act unwisely if it shunts a player who has shown
that he possesses real batting ability Of course there are limits to
the patience of every club committee but all committees would be wise
if they were to err on the side of leniency in this matter

It is of very little avail writing any sort of homily on nervousness
which is in the constitution and cannot be got rid of by much or any
reading It is common to all in greater or less degree and if any
man tells you that he does not know what nervousness in cricket is
do not believe him To say that there is no sensation other than a
distinctly pleasant one in walking to the wickets is absurd It is true
that nervousness does not appear to affect the play of some batsmen
who on first going in seem to be playing their ordinary game But the
sensation is there and these are the fortunate men whose play suffers
but little in consequence

Nervous players must try and reason to the effect that they are
sometimes in the habit of making runs and that therefore there is no
great presumption on their part if they assume that the chances are
they will do so again They must also remember that after all cricket
is but a game and no moral disgrace will attach to them if they
fail These are but poor consolations at the best but the game is so
glorious that as we have before remarked it is better to try and to
fail than never try at all

It has always been assumed that the crack English Eleven that failed
to make the necessary seventynine runs against the Australians in
 were nervous because they did not succeed in making them We are
not sure that they all were or that there was more nervousness than
usual but the wicket was difficult the Australians fielding superb
and their bowling extraordinarily good Certainly two or three of the
Englishmen were nervous and no eleven could be got together anywhere
to play such an important match without this being the case But the
longer anyone plays the less nervous will he become and the fortunate
men in cricket are those like the famous Tom Emmett of Yorkshire who
can as he modestly said bowl a bit sometimes The player who plays
only because he is a good bat and never bowls after he has laid his
duck egg has no opportunity of retrieving his character by getting
four or five wickets with the ball The unhappy batsman makes one bad
stroke and his wicket is lost and he has possibly no further chance in
the match But though the bowler may bowl a wide one ball he may take a
wicket the next and we believe that these allround players find more
enjoyment in cricket than the man who only bats To their credit be it
said that at no previous period have the professionals combined the
two more than they do now and we congratulate Peel Briggs Attewell
Rawlin Davidson Hirst and Wainwright accordingly

The obvious advice to give to players whose success depends mainly on
health is to implore them to look after and pay great respect to the
laws by which health is regulated Not to eat and drink too much great
though the temptation may be to do both is a rule that ought to be
observed by cricketers but there is another not so obvious but of
great importance and that is avoid sitting up late at night There is
such a lot of cricket in these days that some amateurs and a great many
professionals play six days in the week There is the corresponding
amount of travelling to be got through and a lot of fatigue to be
undergone sleep therefore must not be neglected and long hours
devoted to convivial evenings not only entail loss of health but loss
of runs also It is a curious and unwholesome feature of the present
day that it is judged expedient to have enormous meals in the middle
of the day with salmon forced meats creams jellies champagne and
everything calculated to disturb digestion and pervert the sight This
meal is not only the cause of much indigestion but also of a gross
waste of time Instead of half an hour being taken up by the legitimate
luncheon a precious hour is stolen from the middle of the day It must
be said that on the principal public grounds there is no reason to
complain of the luncheons excess is more the custom on private grounds

As we have in this chapter implored captains of elevens to be merciful
to good players who may happen to be out of luck so now in justice
to the other side of the question let us beg the batsman not to be
superstitious

Superstitions abound in most games but we have no objection to
examples of the weakness which cause inconvenience to nobody except the
possessor We have heard for instance of a really great player who
never goes in to bat in a match with anything new about him not even
a shoelace but such superstitions are harmless There is however
the man who has got it into his head or possibly has dreamt that it
is quite impossible for him to score if he goes in first or fifth or
in some particular place consequently the unhappy captain after he
has written out with great care an order of going in is bothered and
worried by men who begin to make excuse One is certain that he cannot
score if he goes in first another thinks he ought not to be put so low
down as eighth and so on Our advice to the captain is to care for
none of these things let him use his own judgment and not consider the
absurd whims and eccentricities of nervous batsmen The responsibility
of managing a match is quite enough anxiety and trouble for him without
being bothered by a mutinous eleven and we entreat batsmen to obey
without murmuring their captains orders and go in without grumbling

The rules of cricket are imperfectly understood even by some
reputedly famous umpires it may be well therefore to remind batsmen
how many ways there are of getting out They know what it is to be
bowled out caught out stumped run out to get out leg before wicket
or to hit wicket and a great many think that nothing else will get
them out This is a mistake and it was a comical sight to see as we
saw some years ago a firstrate professional diddled out in another
way It is against the rules properly understood to wilfully hit the
ball twice The rule runs The batsman is out if the ball be struck
 and he wilfully strike it again except it be done for the purpose
of guarding his wicket But if a batsman plays a ball and a proper
interval elapses the ball is dead and he may return the ball to the
bowler The old rule reads if the striker touch or take up the ball
while in play In the case alluded to Barlow was batting in a North
and South match at Lords He hit the ball twice and unfortunately
for him started to run This starting to run proved the more or less
wilful nature of the act There was a roar of Hows that from the
colossal throat of W G Grace standing at point it was a case
of Youll have to go Barlow and naturally in a somewhat moody
manner Barlow went to the pavilion It is absurd to say that there
was anything unfair in this he violated a distinct rule of cricket
A lot of players think that the ball must not be hit twice under any
circumstances and they would as soon think of touching a redhot coal
as hitting the ball a second time If there is no wicketkeeper and
the ball is played dead against the foot it may save a few seconds
of time if the batsman shove the ball back to the bowler with his bat
and stand still thus saving point the trouble of picking the ball up
and returning it The ball while in play must never be picked up by
the hand for handling the ball wilfully loses a wicket as much as
having two stumps knocked down It is an easy rule to remember and
is very rarely broken but still it is a rule that must be observed
Obstructing the field is another violation of rule for which the
extreme penalty is exacted Of course a witness may tell an untruth in
the witnessbox but unless it is spoken wilfully it is not perjury So
it is with obstructing the field Many hundreds of times has a batsman
standing in his ground prevented a wicketkeeper from catching him out
the mere fact that the players body being in a certain position
forces the wicketkeeper to run round him instead of straight at the
ball will make an uppish ball as unreachable as the sun The fieldsman
is obstructed but not wilfully so no penalty is incurred But if the
batsman were to hit up a ball to point for instance and either strike
at the ball with his bat or wilfully baulk the fieldsman in any way he
would be out and deservedly so In this as in other like matters the
umpire must be the sole judge and it ought to be pretty plain and easy
for him to give a right decision About twenty years ago the wellknown
Cambridge University cricketer Mr C A Absalom playing for his
University against Surrey was running a bye and whilst running to
the opposite wicket the ball hit his bat possibly preventing him from
being run out The umpire gave him out but the umpire was wrong for
the ball came from behind him and as it was never alleged that he
looked to see the course the ball was taking and then interposed his
bat it was obviously impossible that he could have wilfully obstructed
the ball it merely chanced that while running in towards the wicket
the ball by accident hit his bat We do not mean to imply that the
batsman ought to run wide of the wicket to a short run in order to give
the fieldsman every chance of running him out on the contrary if a
short bye is to be run we advise the batsman to run straight down the
wicket for then as pointed out elsewhere the ball will very likely
hit him and prevent him being run out But he must not deliberately get
in the way of the ball or in any way contribute to the fact of the ball
hitting him A case of wilful obstruction ought easily to be detected
by any decent umpire

It is amusing to ask experienced cricketers in how many ways it is
possible for a man to be got out at cricket and it is astonishing
to find many who give most absurd answers There are nine distinct
ways of getting out bowled  caught  stumped  leg
before wicket  hit wicket  run out  handling the ball
 obstructing the field  hitting ball twice It is well to know
these facts for the batsman who gets out in an untoward and unusual
way feels himself to be a fool and generally looks like one Mr
Alfred Lyttelton when playing some years ago for Cambridge University
Eleven against MCC at Lords got back to a slow long hop and with
his foot just touched the leg stump the bail of which did not at once
fall off Oblivious of this fact and only conscious that he had caught
the ball in the middle of the bat and sent it far away off he started
for his runs with radiancy on his face and a mocking smile on his
lips No less than five runs were run and not until then did anyone
except the wicketkeeper notice that the leg bail after hanging on a
frail basis for a few seconds had fallen off The appeal was made and
the facts examined the deadly verdict was given and it was a case
of a return to the pavilion The batsman on such occasions as these
may look pleasant but that is only one of the beneficent results of
civilisation for as a matter of fact he feels extremely bitter
and there are innumerable swords in his heart In the case mentioned
the unhappy batsman felt hot and out of breath after his exertions in
running the five runs and there was a sad reversal of the pleasant
feelings that attend a successful hitthe applause of the crowd was
all wasted the expected increase to the score was not realised all
had vanished and a melancholy man walked drearily to the dressingroom

Batting may be called the most enjoyable feature of the great and
glorious game of cricket A man even in full training invariably
feels the effect of fatigue after bowling sixty or seventy overs and
fieldsmen go through the same experience during a long outing But
it may with truth be said that the keen pleasure which is realised
by every cricketer worthy of the name while he is actually at the
wickets prevents him from feeling fatigue as an inconvenience until
the innings is over We do not believe though with bated breath let
it be said that the fine rider on a fine horse in a good position
and over a grass country with a burning scent can feel so supremely
content with the world and its glorious surroundings while galloping
and jumping close to hounds as does a batsman who feels himself
master of the bowling on a good wicket in a firstclass match with a
fine day and a large crowd keenly anxious for his welldoing He is
conscious that his side is gaining a glorious victory by his efforts
and life can give him no prouder moments To the young cricketer let us
therefore say in conclusion that as the pleasure is so intense and
the excitement so keen he should strive to attain proficiency by care
practice and the advice of great masters Above all he must cultivate
the moral qualities that of necessity must have a place in such a
great glorious and unsurpassable game as cricket

CHAPTER III

BOWLING BY A G STEEL

Illustration The demon bowler


Everyone who knows anything at all about cricket will at once admit
that bowling is to say the least as important a feature of the game
as batting The same share of fame has always been conferred on a
really good bowler as on an expert at the other great branch of the
game but though this has been so from the very earliest days of
cricket there is no doubt that the number of good bowlers whose names
figure in the chronicles of the game is much smaller than the number
of good batsmen This would seem to show that the art of bowling is
more difficult of attainment than its sister accomplishment and in
face of this supposition it seems strange that the energy devoted to
practising bowling by all beginners at the game should be so greatly
exceeded by that devoted to batting The reason for this may easily
be found in the fact that the pleasure derived from making a long
score and the indescribable feelings of delight experienced by every
keen cricketer when he has a bat in his hand seem to offer greater
attractions than the more sober less flashy and apparently more
mechanical duties of a bowler It is a great pity in the interests
of the game that at our large public schools and universities more
care is not taken to coach beginners in bowling Hours upon hours are
devoted to the teaching of batting but it is very very seldom any
professional ever thinks of endeavouring to instil into his pupils any
of the most elementary rules of bowling

A question which cannot fail to present itself to the minds of all
cricketers and especially those who recollect some of the heroes
of bygone days is whether the bowling of today is as good as it
used to be This particular questionso often put and answered so
differentlyseems to me to be one which it is impossible to decide
as the whole nature of the game has altered so much in the last few
years This alteration is due firstly to the great improvement in the
condition of the grounds secondly to the corresponding improvement
in batting for the better the grounds the better the batsmen is
generally a correct saying Formerly bowlers were greatly assisted by
the unevenness of the grounds whereas now on our billiardtablelike
wickets even our very best bowlers know well that their chance of
getting rid of a strong batting side for anything under  runs is
extremely remote It is impossible to compare the tallhatted old
heroes of the ball with bowlers of the present day In olden days
the badness of the grounds caused the best batsmans wicket to be in
frequent jeopardy and fast erratic bowlers were well aware that there
would be ample compensation for any accuracy which might be wanting
in their delivery in the far from infrequent shooters and abruptly
rising balls which so often either levelled the stumps or compelled
the retirement of the batsman by a catch in the slips Nowadays a
bowler is nothing unless he has command of the ball and can practise
variety batting is so good and grounds are so level that the merely
accurate bowler may keep down runs but he cannot get wickets but this
fact is hardly realised yet and our best bowlersand these consist
almost exclusively of the professional classseem to aim not so much
at getting rid of a batsman as at keeping down the runs by bowling a
good even straight length and trusting to chance or the impatience of
the batsman for his dismissal As however this subject is one which
will best be treated later on and about which there is a good deal to
be said we will leave it for the present and turn our attention to a
short retrospect of bowling from the earliest days

Roundarm bowling seems to have come into vogue in  It has been
generally supposed that Mr Willes was the first to start it and the
following story is told of the way in which that gentleman found out
the advantages of the roundarm delivery Mr Willes being a most
enthusiastic cricketer and not content with the summer months for his
favourite sport used in the winter daily to repair to his barn and
there measure out the proper distance pitch the stumps and with
his sister also an enthusiast as bowler enjoy a good practice Now
everyone who has seen ladies attempting to throw a stone or cricket
ball will remember that they invariably have a halfround halfunder
sort of delivery and this Miss Willes in common with the majority
of ladies seems to have possessed Her brother accustomed to play
against what in those days was the only known style of bowling viz
underarm was somewhat perplexed and worried with this unknown
feminine species of ball which doubtless he found difficult to tackle
How amusing it would have been to have watched this keen cricketer
probably not unconscious of his own merits as a batsman entirely
puzzled by the deliveries of a lady We are not told whether his
feelings of shame at being thus defeated or of delight at discovering
this new style of bowling predominated but we are told that shortly
afterwards he made his dbut as a roundarm bowler and met with
until he was stopped by the conservatism of the crowd the greatest
success

From the year  down to the present roundarm bowling has been
universal and it is now quite an exceptional occurrence to come
across a fast underarm bowler of the old style This is not much to
be regretted as every attribute of good bowling which was obtainable
by the fast underarm delivery is much more easy of attainment by
the round or overarm style and many accomplishments pertaining to
the bowlers art are possible to the roundarm which from the very
nature of the action are impossible to the fast underarm bowler
Break spin and quickness from the pitch are common to both styles
but certainly the two latter are made easier of acquirement by the
roundarm style and with regard to breakan easier matter for the
underarm bowlerthe ball that breaks or twists the most is not
as a rule the ball that gets the most wickets To a fast underarm
bowler the variations in flight and pace so well known to the best
roundarm bowlers are unknown Slow underarm bowling of course
must be excepted from these remarks later on in this chapter I shall
have something to say on the subject of this most useful style which
unfortunately in later years seems almost to have died out

It was formerly the reproach of amateurs that from the year  to
say  they had no bowlers When Appleby and Buchanan retired from
firstclass cricket in  there was practically nobody except Grace
and Studd to carry on the lamp of amateur bowling till Woods Jackson
Kortright Streatfeild Wells Bull Jessop Cunliffe and Wilson by
their pace and accuracy have shown the public what can be done Woods
Kortright Jackson and Jessop for pace Bull and Wells for slow and
Cunliffe and Wilson for medium are all excellent in their respective
classes and in the sixties when the grounds would have given them
more assistance they would have been far more deadly than now Still
it is a fact that at most public schools more teaching ought to be
bestowed upon bowling A few words of instruction or encouragement to
a beginner might have the effect of awakening in him the interest and
keenness about bowling which would eventually cause his development
into a good or at any rate a fairish bowler Who has not seen over and
over again a boy come up to a net where a companion is practising and
picking up a ball which as likely as not is about half as large again
as a match ball proceed to hammer away at the batsman for about ten
minutes or more in all directions with all pitches and what is worse
than everything with different lengths of run Then perhaps getting
a little tired as any bowler will who bowls for long without a rest
which he would get in a match at the end of each over he exclaims
Now Ill give you some of Spofforths patents and then with a long
run and a kangaroolike bound but probably altogether unlike the
famous Australian bowler he proceeds to hurl the ball wider and in a
more erratic style than ever Then perhaps he will say Would you
like some of W Gs and immediately assuming the wellknown and
somewhat inartistic pose of the English champion proceed to toss the
ball lifeless up in the air Now this is not the way to learn how to
bowl Bowling like everything else worth doing takes a lot of careful
practice before it can be expected to meet with success

There can be no doubt that were boys carefully trained at school in
the art of bowling as they are in that of batting our universities
from which the ranks of our firstclass cricketers are usually
replenished would be continually sending up men who could take the
position as leading bowlers now occupied by professionals But it
may be asked if we have a supply of fairly good bowlers what does
it matter whether they are professionals or amateurs There are two
answers to this question first that the Gentlemen every year play
the Players and are naturally always anxious to beat them and
secondly that the more cricket gets into the hands of professional
players the worse it will be for the game and its reputation We
would not say one word against the personal character of the English
professional cricketer for the great majority of this class are
honest hardworking and sober men We only say that it is not in
the interests of cricket that any branch of the game should be left
entirely in their hands Your professional as a rule is the son of
a small tradesman or person in that rank of life and has been born
in a neighbourhood where the greatest interest is taken in sport of
all kinds cricket during the summer months being sedulously played
These neighbourhoods are far more frequent in the northern than the
southern counties the sporting tendencies of the people of Lancashire
Yorkshire and Nottingham being developed to a much greater extent
than in the more southern shires These three counties and especially
Notts turn out large quantities of young professionals yearly

A boy who has been born in one of these cricketing districts is sure to
devote a fair share of his time to watching the victories and defeats
of his village club and consequently to imbibing that feeling of
pleasing madness connected with the game which attacks every cricket
enthusiast The height of his ambition is to bowl a ball or two to the
village champion batsman and when the opportunity arises to gratify
his wish you will see him hardly higher than the stumps bowling with
an action exactly similar to the crack village bowler and scorning to
encroach so much as an inch over the line of the bowling stump And oh
what sleepless nights ensue from the anticipation of actually seeing
with his own eyes on the following Saturday one of the real cracks
of Englandone who has positively played in Gentlemen v Players
or represented England against Australia No wonder the boy becomes
imbued with keenness for the game when everyone in the village from
the parson to the old lady who keeps the sweetshop is continually
talking about cricket As the boy grows older he begins to make his
mark in the village club and when he is eighteen or nineteen to the
delight of his father mother sisters and himself he is selected
to make one of the twentytwo colts of his county that are chosen
to play against the county team After having played in public and
perhaps tasted the pleasures of success the father finds that his son
is restless and disturbed in his trade and wishes to give it up and
become a professional cricketer So it happens that his name is sent up
to the county secretary as wanting a situation and the young fellow
finds himself launched into the world on his own account as a cricket
professional

With regard to the young mans prospect of success on starting in his
new life we are bound to say that assuming he has only the average
cricket ability of the ordinary professional his chances of even
making a livelihood are not particularly bright He may and no doubt
will earn as much as l a week or even more during the summer
months but at the end of August or beginning of September he will find
himself with very little money in his pocket and seven of the coldest
and worst months of the year to face He may get employment in the
winter monthsmany professionals do either as colliers or as porters
or some other work We have known them to do clerks work for railways
in the winter but all work for men only willing to stick to it for a
few months is extremely uncertain and there can be no doubt that many
cricket professionals have a bad time in the winter

On the whole professionals who have an assured place in their county
eleven have for men of their social position a very good time They
only get nominally l a match but this often means a minimum wage
of l a week and besides this they are well known and consequently
well advertised and this means a good deal Many have shops for sale
of cricket goods and golf clubs footballs and archery cum multis
aliis A great many become publicans which though many of us think
a loathsome profession is at any rate a livelihood and they become
publicans because they are well known and popular and brewers like
such men to manage their publichouses Even if they keep no shop
they are constantly selling bats and balls and a fair proportion of
them the picked men of the profession get permanent posts in public
schools When there is no county match on a great many especially in
the North get engagements in the detestable modern oneday league
match Leaving publicans out of the question at the present day from
our own knowledge the following old and young professionals keep
cricket shops Daft Shaw and Shrewsbury Gunn Watson Briggs Sugg
Nichols Abel the two Quaifes Walter Wright Baldwin Peate Ward
Tunnicliffe and George Hearne and there are no doubt many more while
the following have permanent engagements as coaches at schools often
with a shop also Wright of Nottingham Louis Hall Woof Emmett F
Ward Wootton and Painter

In addition to all this in some counties there has arisen in the last
year or so a system of winter wages or a bonus paid about Christmas
and when all things are considered we cannot help thinking that a
professional of ability who is steady has a better time of it than any
other working man and even if not a publican or shopkeeper many have
trades to which they can turn their hands in the winter

The firstclass professional cricketer is usually a wellmade
stronglooking man ranging from two or three and twenty to thirty
five with agreeable quiet manners He is a great favourite with the
crowd and when his side is in may be seen walking round the ground
surrounded by a body of admirers any one of whom is ready and willing
at any moment to treat his ideal hero to a glass of anything he may
wish for It is greatly to the players credit that in the face of this
temptation to insobriety he is such a sober temperate man I have
never seen on a cricket field a firstclass professional player the
worse for drink and I have only on one occasion heard the slightest
whisper against the sobriety of such a man during the progress of a
match I believe that as a class and considering the thirsty nature
of their occupation and the opportunities that offer themselves for
drinking there is no more sober body of men than cricket professionals

Having attempted to give a short and it is hoped impartial
description of the cricket professional let us before resuming the
subject of bowling return to the assertion that the more cricket gets
into the hands of professional players the worse it will be for the
game and its reputation At present cricket is perhaps the most popular
of all our national recreations it is certainly the most popular
game though football has lately made great strides in popular
opinion and it is rightly considered to be the manliest and the freest
from all mischievous influences What these latter are and what a
pernicious and enervating influence they exercise on other branches
of our national sports is known to everyone I allude to the betting
and bookmaking element which from the earliest days has been the
curse of sport What is the worst feature about horseracing To what
do English lovers of true sport owe the fact that every racecourse is
the rendezvous of the biggest blackguards and knaves in the kingdom
Is it not betting and the pecuniary inducement it offers to every
kind of dirty shabby practice The sullying influence has spread
to the runningpath and even if report says true to the river
and football field Happily there is never the slightest whisper of
suspicion against the straightness of our cricket players and this is
entirely owing to the absence of the betting element in connection with
the game It is an unfortunate fact that the tendency of firstclass
cricket nowadays is to swamp the amateur by the professional Some of
our best county teams are almost wholly composed of the latter class
The time taken up in big matches is so great owing to their being
drawn out by a late start and early finish each day that the amateur
is beginning to realise his inability to give up from his business or
profession so much of this valuable commodity What has happened in
consequence Cricketie firstclass cricketis becoming a regular
monetary speculation Thousands upon thousands troop almost daily to
see the big matches flooding the coffers of the county or club which
does its very best to spin out the match for the sake of the money
If this continue our best matches will become nothing better than
gatemoney contests to the detriment of the true interests of the game
and its lovers

Bowling is as much worthy of the name of an art as any other branch
of sport The skill science and practice which are necessary before
a man can throw a good salmon fly or before he can reckon on bringing
down a good average of high rocketing pheasants are equally necessary
for one who wishes to become an adept at bowling Perhaps bowling
does not require the same oneness of hand and eye as batting but
it demands if possible more practice and experience and to a far
greater extent the exercise of mental qualities The object of the
bowler is to outmanuvre the batsman he has either to hit the stumps
or draw him into some incautiousness or hesitation of play which will
result in the ball being caught from the bat or in the batsman being
stumped out by the wicketkeeper This is a wide field and suggests at
once that to become proficient a bowler must thinkand think deeply
toonot once or twice every few minutes but before each ball for
none should ever be delivered without a particular object Every ball
must be part and parcel of a scheme which the bowler has in his mind
for getting rid of the batsman The object of every bowler whether
fast or slow is always to bowl what is called a good lengthie
to pitch the ball so close to the batsman that he cannot play it on
the bounce or in cricket parlance on the longhop and yet so
far from him that he cannot play it just as it touches the ground
or immediately on the riseie on the halfvolley There can be
no precise measurement of the exact spot on which the goodlength
ball must pitch as it is constantly varying according to the state
of the ground the pace of the bowler and the size and style of the
batsman When the ground is slow and sticky from recent rain the
goodlength ball will have to be pitched considerably farther than when
it is hard and fast as of course the ball will come faster off
the ground when it is in the latter state than when in the former The
reason why the bowling of this particular ball is always the object of
every bowler is because it compels the batsman to meet the ball with
the bat by forward play and because in so doing he often loses sight
of the ball from the moment it touches the ground till it strikes the
bat No one can be called a good bowler until he has the power at will
of bowling ball after ball of this sort It often happens when two
batsmen are well set and every wile and dodge of the bowlers has
been tried without avail that two bowlers will have to go on to bowl
or try to bowl nothing else but goodlength balls in the hopes of
keeping down the runs If this can be done effectually a batsman is
bound through impatience to make a mistake which in time may cost him
his wicket

Every ball that leaves the bowlers hand has in addition to the
propelling power imparted by the bowler one of four different motions
The ball as it travels is either spinning from right to left or
from left to right or with a downward vertical motion or an upward
vertical motion It is a fact that it is wellnigh an impossibility for
a ball to leave the hand of the veriest beginner without having one of
these four motions to a certain extent imparted to it

On these four rotary motions depends how much and in what direction
the ball will twist or deviate from its course and also the speed and
height it will assume after touching the ground One of the arts of a
bowler is to cheat the batsman by making the ball pitch in one spot
and after the pitch suddenly take a different direction another is
to make the ball rise quicker off the ground than a batsman would be
led to expect from the ordinary rules of reflection These arts are
accomplished by different movements of the fingers and hand at the
moment of delivering the ball for the reason why every ball has a
certain amount of spin on it is because the fingers being in contact
with the ball as it leaves the hand cause it to rotate though perhaps
so infinitesimally as not to be noticeable on its journey to the
ground

The spin or rotary motion from right to left is gained by grasping
the ball chiefly with the thumb and first and second fingers the
third and fourth fingers being placed together round the other side
of the ball The moment the ball leaves the hand the latter is turned
quickly over from right to left and at the same time the first and
second finger and thumb coming over with the hand impart a powerful
twist to the ball which leaves the hand when the latter is turned
palm downwards There is also at the time of delivery an outward and
upward movement of the elbow which gives the arm the shape of a curve
or almost a semicircle The ball goes on its way spinning rapidly from
right to left and the moment it touches the ground twists very sharply
towards the off side of the batsman This ball termed in cricket
parlance the legbreak when well bowled is perhaps one of the most
deadly of all balls but it is also the most difficult for a bowler to
master It is always a slow ball as to bowl it fast with any accuracy
of pitch is an impossibilityat any rate it may be assumed to be
so as no bowler has ever yet appeared who could bowl it otherwise
than slow Palmer the Australian bowler was about the fastest ever
known at this ball but his faster ones were very inaccurate in pitch
and he could only bowl them strange to say very occasionally The
author although he has played innings after innings against this
bowler never remembers receiving a single fast legbreak from him
The fact of the hand having to turn over from right to left and of
the ball being delivered underneath the hand so to speak causes it
to be extremely difficult to attain accuracy of pitch and direction
There are many men who can bowl this ball in practice at the nets but
who never dare attempt it in a match having no confidence whatever
in their ability to bowl it straight or even fairly straight It is
no uncommon occurrence to see this ball bowled by one who has tried
it in practice travelling somewhere near to where point is standing
There are some slow bowlers who have become fairly proficient at it
and who have enjoyed at various times and especially against batsmen
they have never met before a certain amount of success but it is
a style of bowling which should only be encouraged to the extent of
enabling every bowler to use it occasionally If nothing but this ball
is bowled over after over by constant repetition it loses its sting
The batsman gets wary and when the ball is pitched on his leg side
gets before his stumps to protect them and hangs his bat in front of
him thereby rendering the loss of his wicket extremely improbable
and when it is pitched straight for the middle stump or on the off
side knowing the danger of a hit at the pitch of this ball he will
simply satisfy himself with protecting his stumps with his legs and
with letting the ball pass the off stump without further protest The
trap laid for the batsman in this style of bowling is the danger he
incurs by hitting unless he is actually on the pitch of the ball if
he falls into the snare the ball is perfectly certain to go up in the
air and generally in the direction of coverpoint or midoff This of
course is owing to the twist of the ball causing it to hit the side
and not the centre of the bat Should the batsman in the act of hitting
miss the ball altogether as is not infrequently the case he pays the
penalty of being stumped unless he happens to be a fastfooted hitter
Now of course these two traps are well known to every good batsman
and consequently it is as a rule useless to bowl ball after ball of
this nature to himone might just as well whistle for grouse at the
end of November to come and be shot

This ball therefore should only be bowled at intervals and when
according to the bowlers judgment it may have a fair prospect of
success Usually this happens on two occasions The first is when
a batsman has just begun his innings and is playing nervously and
without confidence a twisting ball then from the leg side is extremely
apt to fluster and annoy him and a catch in the slips or at point or
a catch and bowl is not infrequently the result The second is when a
hitter is in and is hitting to all parts of the field Then the ball
may be bowled with a great chance of success especially if the man
is anxious and impatient to hit every ball He is extremely likely to
hit a little short of the pitch with the abovementioned result It
is not a good thing for the bowler to worry the batsman with this ball
if the latter seems not to like it or to play it nervously it should
at most be used not more than twice in an over Let the bowler always
remember that too much of one particular ball even if distasteful to
the batsman will frighten and steady him and perhaps in the end teach
him to play it correctly There are some batsmen and good batsmen
too who never seem to be at home to this ball although they may
have played it scores of times and I remember once seeing an amusing
incident at a match in which a bowler who had adopted it was playing
sad havoc with the other side The first three batsmen had all rushed
out to try and hit the legbreak ball and failing to do so paid the
inevitable penalty of being stumped Their captain was furious at their
rashness especially as they were all three good players he explained
and rightly that the proper way to play the ball was either by hitting
it on the full volleyie before it touched the groundor else
remaining inside the crease and playing it quietly He went in himself
intending to illustrate this principle and lo and behold was stumped
the very first ball he received He scraped forward a long way to meet
the ball missed it and remained in a most elegant Fuller Pilchlike
attitude fondly imagining the toe of his boot was inside the crease
It was as a matter of fact a good inch outside it In that match
there were five stumped each innings off the same bowler and the
captain was one of them both times On another occasion a batsman with
rather thin and weedy looking legs kept jumping in front of his stumps
every time this ball was delivered Finally the ball discovering the
weak spot in this gentlemans physical proportions managed to find
just above the knees an opening large enough for it to pass through
and dislodge the bails Great was his astonishment and disgust and as
he retired crestfallen to the pavilion he said to the writer who was
one of the fielding side on that occasion It was not the ball or the
bowler that did that it was all owing to my confoundedly skinny legs
A dodge well worth trying with this ball is to bowl a good length about
two feet to the leg of the batsman he is nearly sure to have a hit
and there is a great chance of the spin on the ball causing it to be a
misshit which may go straight up in the air for the wicketkeeper
point or bowler to secure even if it is a clean hit to leg it is
nearly bound to be in the air and longleg may possibly have a chance
If this scheme is to be practised it will be generally a good thing for
the bowler to have his longleg perfectly square and bring his long
field on round till he is almost in the position of a forward longleg
This should be done by quietly waving the hand in such a manner as
to attract the attention of the batsman as little as possible It is
impossible to lay down any rule for the way in which the fieldsmen
should be placed for this style of bowling as this depends so much
upon the play of each particular batsman A longleg is however
nearly always necessary and very often an extra man out on the leg
side as mentioned already Two men out in the field for the average
batsman cannot be dispensed with The bowler himself as a rule will
know how to place his field for each batsman but on no occasion should
he ever omit to have a shortslip This is such a very likely place
to get a batsman snapped up that it should never be dispensed with to
any style of bowling except perhaps to slow underarm and not always
then A slow bowler who intends to use the legbreak let us say once
an over or even once in two overs and who relies on this ball as most
likely to secure wickets may on ordinary occasions place his men thus
but as we said before they must be changed to suit the circumstances

If the ground is hard and fast as a rule a third man cannot be
dispensed with but if inclined to be slow he may be brought forward
to extra coverpoint between coverpoint and midoff or else put
deep in the field on the on side The bowler may however see that
the batsman is wide enough awake to restrain himself from hitting
blindly at the pitch of this ball when straight or on the off stump
it will then be advisable to try him entirely on the leg sidea man
may refuse the bait on one side but take it on the other In these
circumstances extra coverpoint and sometimes even coverpoint as
well may be brought across the wicket and placed for halfhits wide
on the onie about half the distance from the batsman that a deep
field would stand If the batsman assumes a poky style of play it is
often advantageous both for saving runs and getting wickets to have
a shortleg a little nearer the stumps than the umpire and the midon
as near to the batsman as he can venture consistently with safety In
this as in every other style of bowling it is a sovereign rule to
make the batsman play to the ballie to keep it well pitched up and
compel him either to hit or play forward

A very novel style of this kind of bowling was seen on English cricket
grounds in the summer of  when the Australian team of that year
included W H Cooper so well known to all our cricketers who have
visited the colonies He bowled round the wicket and nearly every ball
almost a wide to leg There was more spin and twist on the ball than
had ever been seen in this country before excepting perhaps in the
bowling of Mr Stratford who played for a year or two for Middlesex
but who never made his mark in firstclass cricket The ball seemed
to be twisted or screwed out of the side of his hand in the way a
billiardmarker will screw a billiardball along the table to a certain
spot and then bring it back to him But unfortunately for him he was
unable to combine any pace with this tremendous twist The ball was
extraordinarily slow in the air but directly it pitched it would spin
off the ground comparatively quickly twisting into the batsman on the
faster wickets sometimes as much as a yard or more All his men except
two were on the on side and he expected his wickets to be obtained
by the impatience of the batsman causing him to rush out miss and
get stumped or else by wide hitting at the pitch of the ball on the
leg side where there were seven fielders with seven pretty sure pairs
of hands waiting for it In Australia he had met with a fair share
of success especially against some of the English elevens which had
been over there It was this latter consideration which induced the
Australian authorities to believe that he would be a useful addition to
their team His bowling was most unsuccessful in this country Whether
this was due to an accident to his hand on the voyage to England or
from the light here being not so glaring and bright for our English
eyes as it is in Australia cannot be said for certain but I have a
strong opinion from my own experience that the reason of his success in
Melbourne against Englishmen was owing to the dreadful glare on that
ground

One peculiarity of the legtwisting ball is that when the ground is
soft and sticky it is comparatively of no avail The ball then of
course twists to a greater extent than when the ground is hard but it
leaves the pitch so very slowly that the batsman can either wait for
it on the longhop or hit it on the full or halfvolley The legbreak
ball on a soft ground if bowled at all must be bowled faster than on
hard in order to counteract the deadness of the turf The best states
of the ground for this bowling as indeed for most are when the ground
has been hard and fast and has since become crumbly and covered with
loose bits of grass and worn turf and when there has been heavy rain
to saturate the ground which is being rapidly dried and caked by a
hot sun In the former state the ball takes plenty of twist and also
leaves the ground very quickly in addition to sometimes getting up
uncomfortably high for the batsman In the caked state the ball takes
lots of twist and puzzles the batsman by the varied and uneven paces
at which it leaves the ground sometimes coming sharply and high at
other stopping on the ground and in batsmans parlance getting up
and looking at you

    These positions of the fieldsmen will suit underarm bowling except
       that perhaps extra midoff may be put out on the on side

The legbreak ball is usually bowled from round the wicket as
from this side there is more scope for the bowler to make the ball
twist It is doubtless the best side of the stumps to choose for the
delivery of this ball but every bowler should remember that it is very
nearly as good as a change of bowling to change from round to over
the wicket and this is especially so with legbreak balls The ball
delivered from round the wicket generally leaves the hand a good foot
outside the extremity of the bowling crease this means that it starts
about  feet  inches from the middle stump of the bowlers wicket and
in its journey through the air even if pitched in a line with the leg
stump of the batsmans wicket it has to make considerable way from
the leg side of the wicket This of course makes the ball go across
the wicket more from the pitch and as a rule means that a legstump
legbreak ball round the wicket misses the wicket on the off side A
batsman if the ball is pitched off his wicket may defend it as the
rule of leg before wicket now stands with his legs and consequently
the bowler has not much chance of hitting it When bowled from over
the wicket the legbreak ball being delivered in a direct line with
the batsmans wicket will naturally if pitched on the legstump or
between the legs and the wicket not twist so much thus making it more
likely to hit the wicket if missed by the batsman There is also a
direct advantage to be gained by bowling over the wicket if the batsman
is inclined to get in front of his stumps as there is always a better
chance for the bowler to get an appeal for leg before wicket answered
in his favour than when bowling from the other side

             Position of field if bowling on leg side

Although as previously mentioned there has never been any instance
of the legbreak ball being bowled by a fast bowler some of the best
bowlers of the past generation of cricketers used to bowl with a
considerable bias from the leg side and were also of well over medium
pace Martingell and Silcock were bowlers of this class This old
style was very effective and it is greatly to be regretted that it
has almost entirely disappeared from the game at the present day It
differed from the slow ball that has been discussed only in the amount
of spin and as there was so much less power expended in spinning or
twisting the pace of the ball was greatly in excess of that which
can be got on to the slow legbreak The ball was delivered round the
wicket at the very extent of the crease in order to make the angle
from the hand to an imaginary straight line between the two middle
stumps as great as possible The hand was very little higher than the
hip when the ball was delivered and instead of the hand and wrist
being completely turned over at the moment of delivery as in the slow
legbreak the fingers imparted a right to left spin to the ball
The ball coming from a great distance round the wicket and with a
considerable amount of leg spin would be gradually working away to the
batsmans off side every inch of its journey both before and after
pitching Catches in the slips and on the off side were numerous from
this style of bowling and it required the batsmans greatest care and
caution to guard himself against playing inside the balls It is a
great pity we do not see more of this bowling now

The next spin or twist on the ball which we will discuss is the rotary
motion from left to right This in cricket phraseology is termed the
off break and is far more universal than that from the leg In
fact so common is it and so easy to learn that nearly everyone who
has ever bowled in a match knows more or less how to put this spin on
the ball It is of course always easier to get spin on to a slow ball
than on to a fast one

Illustration The legbreak

When the ball to be delivered is a slow one the fingers and hand
may be twisted into almost any shape as so little power is required
actually to deliver the ball all the strength of hand of wrist and
of the fingers may be utilised for the purposes of spin alone When the
ball has to be a fast one the power necessary to propel the ball at
the required pace prevents so much of the power of fingers c being
expended on spin A slow ball always takes the spin after leaving
the ground to a greater extent than a fast one because it is longer
on the ground when it pitches and the spinning has more time to take
effect on the turf

Illustration Likely balls and what may become of them if not
correctly played

   side b and c likely for a stump or if hit with straight bat

   f longleg and halfhit chancesshortslip and wicketkeeper

The natural spin on every ball which is bowled is from left to
rightie the off break Even when a fielder throws in a ball from
a distance it almost invariably has this spin on it If you watch the
smallest boy in the street throwing a stone you will find nine times
out of ten the stone has acquired this spin It is then no wonder
that almost every righthanded bowler relies upon this twist as his
principal artifice The twist depends rather more on the power of the
fingers than on the hand and wrist as in the legbreak The ball is
usually by a slow bowler grasped firmly with all the fingers resting
on the seam as this gives more purchase and resistance for the fingers
to operate The latter at the moment of delivery spin the ball almost
in the same way as they would spin a top and instead of an upward and
outward motion of the elbow as in the legbreak there is an inward
motion towards the side of the bowler The hand is turned over outwards
when the ball is delivered and if properly bowled and pitched just
outside the off stump and under good conditions of ground the ball
after the pitch will change its course abruptly towards the batsman
and the wicket

Differing from the legbreak this ball can with practice be
accompanied by a great accuracy of pitchan accuracy which has been
attained almost to perfection by some of our best known bowlers The
late James Southerton the famous Surrey bowler could bowl in this
style for hours with only a very occasional variation from a perfect
good length Alfred Shaw of Nottingham in his day was perhaps the
greatest exponent of accuracy of pitch combined with the slow off
break or what is generally termed breakback This ball should be
bowled a good length and generally about two or three inches outside
the off stump

Of course the amount of twist the ball will take depends on the state
of the ground and this should at once be apparent to the bowler The
danger most to be apprehended by the batsman from the off break is that
in playing forward if not quite on the pitch of the ball he is very
apt owing to the twist to play outside and allow it to pass between
his bat and right leg to the wicket It is never a wise thing for the
bowler to use the off break every ball although there are many who
do so Even if he is devoid of all other artifice and has no command
over the arts of change of pace flight or the legbreak he
should often vary his style by a ball without any twist at all and
this should not always be straight If a batsman has been playing over
after over nothing but goodlength off break a ball pitched about
the same spot two or three inches outside the off stump and without
any off break at all will very often be found to go to hand in the
slips because the batsman is expecting the break and plays inside the
ball

Illustration The off break

The fast off break is a most deadly ball and Lockwood Richardson
Mold and Hearne are four bowlers who have a consistent break A slight
slope in the ground from the off side is always a great advantage to
fast bowlers who try the breakback This comparatively rare ball
when it does come is sure to try the very best batsman Its difficulty
arises from the fact that the ball is of such a pace as to necessitate
quick forward play when the sudden turn after the pitch causes it to
be missed For playing off breaks of all paces it is a great and
golden rule for batsmen to remember Never allow space between the
bat and the left leg for the ball to pass through This rule which
insures the left leg of the batsman being placed well across the wicket
when playing forward if followed will render it almost impossible for
him to be bowled out with an off break It is an astounding fact that
this simple rule which should be patent to everyone seems unknown to
all our best batsmen with one or two notable exceptions W G Grace
has always played with his leg up to his bat thereby preventing the
ball from finding an opening between the two W W Read of Surrey
is another who plays thus We do not express any opinion here as to
the bearing of this rule on the legbeforewicket question It is
sufficient for a batsman at present as the rule now stands that so
long as the ball does not pitch between the two wickets he cannot be
given out lbw

 A B C all good ones D if the batsman stands with his legs some
   way from the leg stump this is likely to bowl him off his legs but
   it is a beauty to hit on the on side

The two spins from the leg and the off are the chief and most
important for all practical purposes If a bowler by constant practice
has acquired the power of twisting the ball from off or leg at will
and can at the same time bowl a good length he has laid a tolerable
foundation for future success We say tolerable because in bowling
twist as we shall see later on is not everything it is an essential
element in good bowling but it is only one of several all of which
must combine together before anyone can earn the reputation of a
firstclass bowler

The two other spins which can be put on the ball are what have been
called the upward vertical and the downward vertical By the
upward vertical I mean when the ball spins in its way to the ground
vertically and upwards with regard to the bowler It may be compared
to the spin imparted to the billiard ball in the screw stroke This
is effected by striking the ball low down which makes it revolve in
its course upwards The effect this upward revolution has is seen when
the strikers ball meets the object ball the former having a decided
inclination to stop and return to the striker In the same way a
cricket ball when made to revolve upwards has a tendency to stop and
go slower off the pitch than it went before it reached the ground

This twist as a matter of fact is never practised and it is a great
pity that more attention has not been paid to it Of course it is very
much more difficult to make the ball revolve in this manner than in
either the leg or the off break but it is quite within the powers of
the possessor of a fairly strong set of fingers The lower half only
of the ball should be held so that the upper half protrudes above the
hand and fingers and at the moment of delivery which must be from the
level of the shoulder or lower the fingers and hand must impart as
much upward spin as possible

The downward vertical spin is the reverse of this and is caused by
the upper half of the ball being grasped instead of the lower as in
the upward This spin imparts to the ball a tendency to come quicker
from the pitch than the pace in the air would seem to suggest and is
analogous to the following up stroke at billiards The latter is
made by striking the ball at the top making it revolve downwards and
vertically from the striker Very many bowlers possess this downward
spin in their bowling without being at all aware of the fact They
know as also do those who play against them that every now and then
one of their balls will in cricket slang make haste from the pitch
The batsman finds he has mistaken the pace of the ball which flies
past him before he is anything like ready to play it and when his
stumps lie prostrate as often as not he will come back to the pavilion
with the old old story Bowled with a shooter whereas in fact
the ball has hit the middle or even upper part of his stumps He has
entirely lost the ball from the pitch owing to his misjudgment of its
pace and concludes erroneously that it has shot underneath his bat

We have now considered the four kinds of spin which can be put on to
a cricket ball Of course there may be combinations of two kinds as
for instance the ball may be spinning from right to left or left to
right and at the same time be revolving to a certain extent vertically
downwards or upwards but it would be impossible to discuss the result
of every such combination

The ball may break from leg and at the same time show by its
acceleration in speed after the pitch that it has been revolving
downwards as well and the same may happen with the break from the
off but such variations are beyond the reach of any practical
discussion

Let us now turn to another element of good bowlingchange of pace
It does not require any great amount of technical cricket knowledge to
understand that if a bowler delivers every ball at the same uniform
pace his bowling is easier for a batsman to judge and play than
when he is continually altering and changing the pace If a batsman
misjudges the pace of the ball he often loses his wicket If he plays
too slow for a fast ball or too fast for a slow one he generally
makes a fatal mistake As it is necessary for a shooter to accurately
judge the pace of a driven grouse before pulling the trigger so is it
equally necessary for a batsman to judge the pace of the ball before
he plays to it This power of judging pace only comes after long
experience but when it does exist it seems to be exercised almost
intuitively and without any conscious thoughtindeed there is often
no time for thought

Perhaps the one thing which made Mr Spofforth the famous Australian
bowler superior at his best to all others and has earned him the
reputation of being the best bowler that has ever lived was his
wonderful power of changing the pace of the ball without making it
perceptible to the batsman In his bowling the same run action and
exertion were apparently used for delivering a slow or mediumpaced
ball as for a fast one Many a time especially on his first arrival in
England when this bowling was strange to our batsmen the ball seemed
to dislodge the bails long after the bat had completed the stroke and
was perhaps high in the air Change of pace to be effective must
not mean change of action and the first thing a bowler who wishes to
practise this art must understand is that the slightest variation
in style or action for a slower or faster ball will at once put the
batsman on the qui vive and destroy the effect of the device

C T B Turner the Australian bowler was a great adept at changing
the pace of the ball without sounding any warning note to the batsman
He is one of the very finest bowlers we have ever seen bowl he has
great command over the ball and a beautiful and easy delivery His
performances in this country have been wonderful the only defect
in his bowling which in the writers opinion keeps him from being
considered Spofforths equal is that his action is too easy to see A
good batsman is not so likely to be deceived by him as readily as by
Spofforths windmill deliveries

When a slow or mediumpace bowler wishes to deceive the batsman by
a change of pace he has of course two courses open to himeither
to accelerate the speed of the ball or diminish it When he wishes
to bowl a faster ball than usual he must remember that the object
of the experiment is to make the batsman play slower to the ball
than he has been doing and that this result will be far more easily
accomplished by pitching a goodlengthif anything a little further
than a goodlengthball than by a short one If the latter is bowled
the batsman although deceived in the pace up to the pitch has time
to discover his mistake before the ball reaches him and consequently
has his bat ready in time to stop it If a ball is however pitched a
good length or a trifle beyond it and up to the pitch is successful
in deceiving the batsman he will not have much chance of stopping it
afterwards

Palmer another of the famous Australians sends down the best fast
ball that has been seen from a mediumpace bowler There is no change
of action to warn the batsman no longer or faster run but the ball
comes with lightning rapidity generally pitched well up and very
often in the blockhole making that most deadly ball a fast yorker
about which something will be said farther on The change from slow or
mediumpace bowling to quite slow is much more frequently practised
than the change to fast and consequently we may presume it is more
easy of accomplishment There are few slow or mediumpace bowlers who
do not try occasionally to deceive the batsman by making the high slow
ball pitch a little shorter than the rest have been doing But although
there are many bowlers who endeavour thus to deceive there are but few
who are really skilful in the art

It is an extremely difficult thing to reduce the pace on the ball
without altering the action Mr Spofforth the Australian as we have
observed excelled in this as also did Alfred Shaw of Nottingham
when at his best For many years Shaw had the reputation of being the
best slow bowler in England and justly so His most deadly device was
after he had bowled three or four of his ordinary paced ones to toss
the ball a little higher a little slower and a little shorter Unless
the batsman detected the alteration in speed at the moment of delivery
he made what was often a fatal mistake If he hit the ball would go
high in the air generally in the direction of deep fieldon if he
played forward a catch and bowl was the very likely result If this
ball is bowled without deceiving the batsman it generally meets with
a very heavy penalty as if rightly judged at first it can generally
be either waited for and hit almost to any part of the field on the
longhop or bound or run down and driven past the bowler but the
latter feat can only be accomplished by batsmen who are very quick on
their legs

Some of the best exponents of this ball appear just prior to
delivery to greatly exert their bodies and go through their whole
customary action while the arm dragged slower than usual through
the air delivers the ball when the body is comparatively at rest
This no doubt gives the batsman the idea that the ball is going to
be delivered before it really does leave the bowlers hand But it
would be quite beyond the capabilities of the writer to furnish any
intelligible hints as to how to bowl this ball every bowler will with
practice find this out for himself

As a rule good bowlers of the present day bowl with their arms above
the shoulder and it is a rudiment in the art that the action of
delivery should be as high as possible The high delivery is certainly
the most successful where the ground is hard fast and true as then
little or no twist can be put on to the ball and the higher it is
made to bound the more chance there is of the batsman making an uppish
stroke In addition to this advantage which the high has over the low
delivery the higher the arm is raised above the shoulder the more
difficult it is for a batsman to judge the pitch and flight of the ball

With regard to the amount of success that slow and fast bowling meet
with a great deal depends on the state of the ground but speaking of
England and on hard wickets fast bowlers are having the best of it
at any rate Richardson is far the most deadly while Mold Hearne
Davidson Bland Cuttell and Hirst are very successful In a later
chapter however the causes are discussed which seem to show that head
bowlers bowlers who change their pace and methods will have to be the
bowlers of the future But it is also true as a general rule that
slow bowling is more difficult to play than fast The advantages that
it possesses over fast are as follows

FirstThe slowly delivered ball describes a curved line in the air
both before it pitches and afterwards to the bat and balls coming in a
curved line are far more difficult to play accurately than those which
come quick and straight from the pitch If the batsman properly judged
the fast ball by simply putting his bat straight forward he would
always meet and stop it It is not quite so with the slower ball The
ball coming on to the ground in a curve will leave it in a curve and
may consequently go over the shoulder of the bat Besides the quicker
the ball is the shorter time the batsman has to play it his mode of
playing must be decided on instantaneously so he has no time to get
into two minds on the subject

Illustration FAST BALL

SecondlyIn slow bowling there is always more actual hitting than
in fast and the more hitting the greater chance there is of the ball
going up in the air Fast bowling may perhaps be driven morethat
is to say it may be pushed hard by good forward play in front of
the wicket in all directions but it is not often with this style of
bowling that the bat is lifted high in the air and the shoulders
arms and whole body combine together for a big hit or slog as it
is sometimes called whereas slows often tempt the best of batsmen to
hit without quite getting on to the pitch of the ball the consequence
being that the ball goes up in the air somewhere

It is a very common occurrence to see a slow bowler who is bowling
really well and with tolerable success taken off at once on the
advent of some batsman who has earned a reputation for big hitting
He himself may be nervous about the fearful smashing the batsman may
give him and suggest to his captain to put on some fast bowler in
his place or else the captain may make the change himself What is
the usual result The fast bowler compels the hitter to play a steady
game and then when the latter has just got his eye well set and fit
for hitting on go the slows again with the probable result of being
utterly knocked to pieces in a few overs If the slows had been allowed
a chance at first when the batsmans eye had not got settled down to
the light and he himself was still suffering from the nervousness
inevitable to every man on first going in what a different tale might
have been told It is always the best thing to put on slows to a big
hitter when he first comes in His anxiety to begin to hit at once is
fostered by the slow easylooking balls that give him such time to
lift his bat and put his whole strength into the stroke this anxiety
is often helped too by his nervousness which in many instances
produces a tendency to hit

On a certain occasion one of the biggest hitters our cricket grounds
have ever seen made about eighty runs without having a single slow ball
bowled to him The captain at last put on a slow bowler out of sheer
desperation As the slow bowler walked up to the wicket to bowl the
big hitter turned to him and said What are you going to bowl your
donkeydrops Ill hit them all out of the ground If you keep on
doing it I shall have to go off was the modest reply The third ball
of the over there was a terrific slog the bat fairly whistled with the
speed it went through the air and the ball touching the shoulder
landed in shortslips hands

There are only two exceptions to the golden rule to put on slows when
a hitter first comes in the first is when there is something peculiar
connected with the condition of the ground which is making a fast
bowler at that particular time especially deadly and the second when
the condition of the game renders it imperatively necessary to keep
down the runs at all costs In the latter case a slow bowler may prove
too expensive as even the misshits of a strong hitter are apt to go
to the boundary

Thirdly to resume the consideration of the advantages of slow bowling
interrupted by the anecdote and the statement of the rule and its
exceptionsSlow bowling offers more opportunity to the wicketkeeper
for stumping than fast It is so tempting for a batsman to rush in and
drive the slow tossedup ball that often he chooses the wrong one
misses it and is left standing still a yard or two out of his ground
Chances to the wicketkeeper are also much easier off slows than fast
and consequently a great many more wickets are taken

FourthlyThe very slowness of the ball induces liberties of all sorts
to be taken besides that of hitting mentioned above The batsman
when his eye is well in often tries to score by placing balls to
a particular spot which their pitch does not justify A favourite
error that even the best batsmen fall into is that of trying to hit
the legstump halfvolleys too much to the on side and sometimes
absolutely to leg a stroke which would never enter his head were a
fast bowler bowling

FifthlyA slow bowler has much greater command of pitch pace and
spin than a fast one The power which is expended by the latter on
the pace of the ball is available by the former for these more subtle
devices There is consequently a much wider field for experiment open
to the slow bowler Usually a fast bowler bowls away ball after ball
in the hopes of breaking down the batsmans defence by a goodlength
ball or a yorker if he fails to do this he retires in favour of the
next change A slow bowler has many devices of which actually bowling
the batsman out is perhaps very seldom resorted to He should be able
to pitch the ball within a few inches of the spot he wishes and thus
when he has ascertained any particular weakness the batsman seems to
possess he is able to take advantage of it There are very few batsmen
who have not certain favourite strokes some may have a partiality for
cutting others for playing on the on side for ones and twos others
for off driving but whatever the particular penchant may be a slow
bowlers business is to make himself acquainted with it and then take
the greatest possible advantage of it Suppose a batsman shows by his
play that he is always on the lookout for a cut and even goes so far
as to cut balls which should be driven or played forward to on the
off side a slow bowler by his command of pitch and pace may do much
execution A ball pitched a trifle further up than usual on the off
side and a trifle faster may and often does induce the batsman to
try his favourite stroke at the imminent peril of placing the ball in
the hands of point or third man or of being caught at the wicket A
slower and higher ball than usual pitched on the legstump will often
induce a batsman to try a favourite on side stroke at the risk of
playing with a cross bat and being bowled or out leg before wicket In
fact every fault that it is possible for a batsman to possess may be
taken advantage of by a slow bowler to a much greater extent than by
one of great pace How often one sees a batsman who has given great
trouble dismissed by a slow bowler who seems to have absolutely no
merit whatever The ball is tossed high in the air with apparently no
spin of any sort and so slow as hardly to reach the wicket and yet
the wellset batsman falls a prey to his overanxiety to play the ball
where the pitch of it does not warrant

SixthlyA slow bowler has the advantage over a fast one of having
what is equivalent to an extra man in the field viz himself After
the ball is bowled he is firm on his legs ready to run in for a catch
and bowl or to dart to the on or the off side as the batsman shapes to
play the ball No matter how hard the ball is returned from the bat he
has always ample time to get down with the right hand or the left or to
jump high in the air when the batsmen are running he is always able to
get behind his wickets ready to receive the ball when returned by the
fielder a golden rule for every bowler which is too often neglected
A fast bowler is generally unsteady on his legs after the ball is
delivered the pace with which he runs up to the wicket carries him
on a few paces after the delivery and he is thus generally unable to
exhibit the same activity and sharpness in fielding his own bowling as
a slow bowler does In days gone by when grounds were bad and rough
slow bowling was not so successful as fast but the general improvement
in the ground has altered this

Illustration A hot return

And now having seen some of the advantages slow bowling possesses
over fast and before discussing the latters merits let us see on
what principles a slow bowler should endeavour to bowl and what
rules he should follow in order to attain success Whilst speaking of
slow bowling we shall refer to any pace under that of medium as the
rules and principles of medium are included in what is said on fast
bowling Perhaps the most important thing that every bowler whether
fast medium or slow should realise is as we have said before
to keep the ball well pitched up when a batsman first comes in The
importance of this rule is manifest as a shortpitched ball requires
no play whereas one pitched a good length or even farther requires
steadiness and accuracy of eye to play because there is a moment after
its pitch when it is lost to the vision and consequently if the eye
lacks accuracy the ball will be missed or bungled An old professional
cricketer one who has made his mark in times gone by both with bat
and ball once observed to the author Anything rather than straight
longhops sir when a man first comes in wides and fullpitches are
better and he was right straight longhops which alas many of
our professional bowlers bowl only too often in order to prevent runs
being made off them do more to get in the eyes of batsmen than any
other sort of ball Often and often one sees a bowler and perhaps
one who has the name of being firstclass send down to a new batsman
straight longhops one after the otherballs which it is impossible
or nearly so to score off and then at the end of each over walk to
his place with a thoroughly satisfied air as if adding one more maiden
over to his analysis had really helped his side on to the ultimate goal
of victory It is always better for a bowler to see a fresh batsman
make half a dozen runs from wellpitched balls or halfvolleys his
first over than to see him stop four straight longhops

On the fall of a wicket the bowler should always remember that the
new batsman is entirely unaccustomed to the light and not yet warm
to his work and that consequently the pet devices which may have
been clearly seen through and mercilessly punished by the retiring
batsman are for the present quite fresh for the new one He should
consequently begin by doing all he can to get rid of him at once
before he gets set He should in the first two or three overs try
every effective ball he knowsand certainly in the first over he
should try a yorker This ball called in days gone by a tice an
abbreviation of entice is certainly one of the most deadly balls
that can be bowled if not absolutely the most deadly We believe
that if statistics could be kept of how every wicket fell during the
course of a season more would be found victims to the yorker than
to any other ball We can find no derivation for the word yorker
but are told that it came from the Yorkshiremen who were fonder of
bowling this ball than any other A story is told of a famous old
Yorkshire professional who on being asked whether he knew why this
ball was called a yorker replied Of course I do Well said
his questioner Why what else could you call it was the answer
with a puzzled look and a scratch on the top of his head The ordinary
definition of a yorker is a ball that pitches inside the crease
and this no doubt is correct so far as it goes but it does not
go far enough It really should be any ball that pitches directly
underneath the bat It is quite possible for a man to be bowled out
with a yorker when he is two or three yards out of his ground if he
misjudges the ball and allows it to pitch directly beneath his bat
although the ball pitches as far from the crease as he is standing The
most deadly sort of yorker however is the one that pitches about
three or four inches inside the crease One mistake which the batsman
makes with this ball is that he imagines it is going to pitch shorter
for a halfvolley and gets ready to hit when he finds the ball coming
farther than he expected and is then too late to stop it Another
grave error which many batsmen fall into is that of lifting their bats
up after judging the pace and pitch of the yorker intending to come
down on it as it touches the ground which really is at the very last
moment It seems an easy thing to stop a yorker in this way but it
really requires the greatest nicety in timing and a moment late means
that the ball has passed and the stumps are down Whenever a batsman
is playing yorkers by chopping down on them inside his crease it
is as certain as can be that he is not at all at home with them and
the bowler may hope for success with every one he tries Even if the
bat does come down on a yorker in the crease at the last moment it
often dribbles on with the spin and just dislodges the bails The
only proper workmanlike way to deal with yorkers is to play them
forward The bat should be thrust forward directly the ball is seen to
be right up to the batsman and then it cannot fail to be stopped One
great peculiarity of yorkers is that it is impossible to bowl such a
ball to some batsmen W G Grace hardly ever gets one directly the
ball leaves the bowlers hand he sees its destination viz an inch
inside the crease he puts the bat out to meet the ball and makes it
one of the easiest possible viz a fullpitch If there were no such
thing as misjudgment on the part of a batsman there would be no such
thing as a yorker It depends for its very existence on being taken
for something else If every batsman were perfectly accurate in his
sight and judgment of pitch every socalled yorker would be neither
more nor less than a fullpitch However as every batsman we are
thankful to say is liable to err in judging the pitch and as nearly
every batsman when first going in is more liable to err with a yorker
than any other ball the bowler should most decidedly try it A slow
bowler should first try a mediumpaced yorker somewhat faster than
his usual pace and then a slower one It is astonishing how many
wickets fall to slow yorkers the ball is mistaken for everything but
what it really is viz a fullpitchfor every ball pitching inside
the crease must be playable as a fullpitch

When a bowler is put on to bowl by his captain it is his duty to do
everything in his power to dislodge the batsman It is really quite a
secondary consideration for him whether many or few runs are being made
off his bowling It is the duty of the captain to tell the bowler when
he wants the pace in the rungetting to be diminished and then and
not till then must the bowler begin to bowl straight and short with
that object But until certain instructions are given the bowler must
never stop for an instant in his endeavour to get the batsmans wicket
If he has experimented with every one of his arts and is unsuccessful
or even if he becomes too expensive in rungetting before he has done
this the captains duty is to take him off

It is a common sight enough to see a bowler put on in a match who
simply dare not try the experiments which he has practised with
success for fear of being hit for a four or two and taken off He is
quite content to see ball after ball played full in the middle of the
bat straight back to him knowing well that with such bowling he has
not the remotest chance of getting a wicket In the hopes of getting
a wicket a slow bowler should often try leg halfvolleys they are
of course delightful balls for a batsman to hit but at the present
day when the old George Parr leg hit is comparatively unknownviz to
fine longleg all along the ground well behind the wicketand the leg
hitting off slows is generally high and square they often result in a
longleg catch and sometimes one at the wicket through the batsman
hitting too quick at the ball A bowler who has been sending down ball
after ball with the off break on should often try pitching one on the
same spot but without the break the batsman is very apt to play inside
this ball and place it in shortslips hands In addition to the
change of pace which we have above commented on it is a most excellent
thing occasionally to lower and heighten the action Alfred Shaw used
continually by lowering his action to send in a ball which skimmed
so to speak from the pitch at a great pace and much faster than his
ordinary balls The raising of the arm higher than usual makes the ball
bound higher which is very often an advantage especially on rough
cutup grounds The goodlength ball outside the off stump pitched
perhaps eight inches to a foot wide of it and without any break on
at all is often a most telling ball especially to eager excitable
batsmen The ball not being straight cannot be met with the full face
of the bat and consequently unless the batsman puts his left leg
right across the wicket he must in playing it lift it up in the air
when it is probably captured by coverpoint or midoff If this ball
can be made to go ever so little from the leg side after it has pitched
it becomes more deadly as then there is a much greater chance of the
batsman being unable to get over the ball sufficiently to keep it along
the ground

There has grown up in late years a most deplorable practice amongst
batsmen of leaving balls on the off side alone for fear of risking
their wickets In every match big and little one may see batsmen jump
in front of their wickets time after time to off balls allowing the
ball to go by unplayed at or if it twists to hit their legs We call
this a most deplorable practice because it is not real cricket The
true object of the batsman is to defend his wicket with his bat let
him use his legs as well if he likes but his bat he should certainly
use and when he holds the bat high in the air and guards his wicket
with his legs and legs alone in our opinion he goes beyond the limit
of legitimate batting A batsman is perfectly right in refusing to hit
or play at wide balls on the off side but when he remains passive to
balls a few inches only outside the off stump he not only acknowledges
his want of confidence in himself but also degrades the dignity of
a cricket bat by substituting in its place his own usually nervous
legs We remember seeing some years back a batsman who had completed
his hundred refusing on a perfectly good wicket to play ball after
ball on the off side The famous old bowler David Buchanan was bowling
at one end and could not understand how some of his most lovely
halfvolleys were allowed to pass by unlooked at and despised The
batsman however was thoroughly well roasted by his own side and the
other for his tame play and it was satisfactory afterwards to learn
that he had given up his weakness for seeing longhops and halfvolleys
pass on the off without being first heavily taxed for the good of his
side It is rather a difficult thing for a slow bowler to know what to
do when he has to bowl to a batsman of this sort He might of course
go on bowling on the off side and try to tire the batsman out and
make him play but this in these present days of good wickets and
lengthy matches would take far too long The best course for a bowler
to take is continually to alter his pace and endeavour by pitching a
ball sharper from the pitch and quicker than usual on the off stump to
get the batsman out leg before wicket Just the very slightest degree
outside the off stump is also a good place for this class of player he
gets undecided whether to adopt his mawkish style of play or not and
in his indecision is apt to make mistakes

A favourite scheme for a slow bowler to get rid of a batsman is by
bowling him off his legs This is always more easy of accomplishment
when the batsmans legs stand some distance from the legstump and his
bat When this is going to be tried an extra man should be put out on
the on side between longleg and deep fieldon as the ball which is to
be bowled will if hit by the batsman generally go in that direction
If the bowler can dispense with a longleg it is advantageous to have
a shortleg perhaps a yard or two in front of the umpire and also a
midwicket on as near to the batsman as he can with safety venture The
ball should then be bowled with as much off break and as good a length
as possible in a line with the legstump if played at and missed on
account of the twist it hits the legs and so cannons into the wicket
If it is met with the bat there is always a chance of the twist taking
it into the hands of shortleg or midon The place on which the ball
pitches must depend on the state of the ground and the amount of twist
that can be put on to the ball

Spofforth the Australian was a bowler who used this ball very
successfully as indeed he did most others When he had the ground
in a suitable stateie when it was sticky or else crumbled and
loosehe used to place a shortleg close in to the batsman about two
yards behind the wicket he would also have another shortleg or midon
close in to the batsman and fairly straight He would then bowl about
medium pace pitching ball after ball a good length on the legstump
and with as much off break as he could get on which of course would
vary with the state of the ground The result of this manuvre was
to make the batsmans chance of remaining at the wickets for long
extremely doubtful The pace medium would compel him to play forward
to all goodlength balls the breakback and abrupt rise or kick then
made it very probable that he would either place the ball in the hands
of one of the expectant shortlegs or else be bowled off his bat or
legs The author recollects on one occasion having to play against the
redoubtable Spofforth under the above circumstances After receiving a
few balls he came to the conclusion that it was absolutely impossible
to prevent being captured by one of the shortlegs who were both
standing ridiculously close and every ball was rising uncomfortably
high He determined to take the liberty of pulling and did so once
or twice with success till he paid the usual penalty of the practice
on a kicking wicket by being badly cut over He then tried jumping in
front of his wicket and trying to slide the breaking balls off his bat
to very fine longleg Spofforth however was too much for him and
almost immediately bowled a straight middle stump ball without any
break on it and rather faster than the others it kept low hit the
shin and there was as dead a case of lbw as any bowler could wish
for

A favourite trick of some slow bowlers is to bowl from different
distances Sometimes the bowler will have one leg behind the wickets
and the other in front and sometimes both behind we have even seen
some bowl occasionally with the front leg as much as two yards behind
the wicket The object of this is to deceive the batsman as to the
pitch of the ball by changing the distance the ball has to travel
This is doubtless an excellent theory but in our opinion it is not
of much worth in actual practice We have seen bowlers of all sorts
repeatedly try this experiment but in our experience it never meets
with any appreciable success This is perhaps owing to the fact that
the batsman can always see very clearly when the bowler does not come
up the whole way to the wicket and is accordingly on the alert for a
shorter pitched ball than usual The only practiser of this trick who
ever seems to turn it to good account is Tom Emmett the lefthanded
Yorkshire veteran he usually bowls his slow wides from some distance
behind the crease and certainly obtains a fair share of wickets with
these balls but even in his case we think that it is generally not so
much the difference in the distance that the ball has to travel which
causes disaster to the batsman as the latters anxiety and impatience
to score from slow wide off balls which look so easy and are really
so deadly However though our opinion of this bowlers dodge is
not particularly high we still think it is worthy of trial at times
by every slow bowler A slow bowler should try every wile that can
possibly be attempted by adopting slow bowling he has undertaken to
use the wisdom of the serpent in the guise of the harmlessness of
the dove and has sacrificed pace to cunning and thought No slow
bowler is worth his salt who merely tosses the ball into the air and
trusts to chance for success even if it has a little spin on it he
must continually think and diagnose every particular case which comes
before him and then adopt the measures necessary for each one With
this object it is the duty of every slow bowler to take advantage of
any local peculiarity which the size and situation of the ground may
afford He should almost always have the choice of ends except on
occasions when the captain of the side considers that for some reason
his fast bowler is more likely to get rid of the batting side for a
small score than the slow and then of course the fast must have the
choice

For example in the University matches from  to  Oxford was
so overmatched by Cambridge that in each of these years before the play
began it was considered by the outside public as a foregone conclusion
for the latter The really knowing ones however who thoroughly
understood the game were aware that there was one man on the Oxford
side who might any day get rid of the best side in England for a very
small score That man was Mr Evans the famous fast bowler He was the
only man on the side who humanly speaking seemed capable of turning
the chances of the game He consequently chose his own particular
endthe one he thought most suited to his style quite irrespective of
any mediocre slow bowler that was on his side and the havoc he played
amongst the Cambridge wickets for those four years may be seen from the
old scores It is however an exception when a side depends almost
entirely on its fast bowling and it is only when this exception arises
that a slow bowler assuming him to be one who is competent to judge
must not have his choice of ends Of course we mean his choice of ends
at the commencement of an innings as after that it is the captains
duty to put any bowler on at either end and it is the duty of every
bowler to obey his captain cheerfully

As already remarked every slow bowler should take advantage of every
local peculiarity that may offer itself For instance there may be a
ground where a high tree is behind one of the wickets the slow bowler
if he thinks this tree will help him at all should take his measures
accordingly We hope none will think we are advocating anything at
all unfair in the game or anything that is even on the line between
fairness and not quite straight As a rifleshooter takes advantage
of a lull in the wind to pull his trigger as a deerstalker of every
rock and unevenness of ground to approach his gamein short just
as in every kind of sport natural facilities may be utilisedso in
bowling every peculiarity of time and place should be enlisted on the
side of the bowler in his in these days of good wickets and good
batting by no means easy task of getting rid of the batsman If a
bowler who we will say usually bowls over the wicket perceive that
by bowling round the wicket he may make his bowling more difficult to
see and consequently more effective on account of a tree house or
hedge that is directly behind that side of the wicket he should most
certainly change and make the most of that advantage An injudicious
and talkative batsman often materially assists a bowler by such remarks
as I cant see your bowling a little bit When tossed high in the air
that beastly tree is right behind or When you bowl over the wicket
the ball gets right in a line with the dark windows of the pavilion
and I cant see it at all Can anyone imagine for a moment that a
bowler will not do his very best instantly to make the most of the dark
branches of the tree or the windows of the pavilion The sun too
often materially assists a slow bowler especially during the last hour
or hour and a half of the days play If there are any trees round the
ground the shadows beginning to lengthen will often lie right across
the pitch and if there is one anywhere near where a goodlength ball
should pitch it is advisable to try pitching one occasionally on it
If the sun is behind the bowlers wicket and getting a little low the
bowler should try by bowling high slow ones to get it in the line of
the batsmans vision Every possible advantage within the limits and
spirit of fair play may be considered legitimate for a bowler Local
advantages of ground and weather are certainly within these limits but
any peculiarity of dress or tricks of manner which are in themselves
calculated to baulk or annoy a batsman are not

For example bowling with a long loose and flapping sleeve in order
to distract the batsmans attention from the ball a habit which of
late has been seen on our English grounds is in itself intrinsically
unfair and unworthy of any true cricketer And again waving the arms
behind the ball after it has been delivered or any other trick adopted
in order to worry or harass the batsman is manifestly unfair Some
batsmen are extremely fastidious and are distracted by the merest
trifle The writer remembers on one occasion taking part in a match
when a batsman objected to a bowler on the ground that he was wearing
a stud made of some bright material or stone which glistened so in
the sun that it diverted his attention from the ball This of course
sounded absurd but the bowler at once removed the glittering nuisance
and rightly too

A slow bowler must bear in mind what has before been mentioned viz
that it is often almost as good as a change of bowling to change
from over to round the wicket or vice vers quite apart from
the advantage he may gain from any local obstruction to good light
Supposing a slow bowler has been on for some time over the wicket as
a rule the great majority of his balls have been pitched a few inches
outside the off stump and breaking in to the middle or middle and leg
The batsman has got thoroughly into the way of playing this particular
ball and does not show any signs of making a mistake The bowler goes
round the wicket and although he still continues to pitch a little
outside the off stump the ball is quite different now from what it
was from over the wicket It is of course impossible to get as much
breakback spin on to the ball when bowling round as over the wicket
because the ball is delivered several feet from a straight line between
the two wickets but in most conditions of the ground it is possible
to get a certain amount on The change in the direction of the ball
or rather in the spot from which it is delivered combined with the
diminution in the amount of break makes it often a most effective
change and one well worth the trial In addition there is always from
round the wicket the chance of a batsman playing inside a ball which
delivered without any spin at all keeps going across the wicket as it
is technically called with the arm

Illustration A pokey batsman dealing with a highdropping fullpitch

We cannot omit when enumerating the different balls of which a slow
bowler may avail himself one which is by no means used as often as
it should be viz the fullpitch In slow bowling there are three
different kinds of fullpitchesthe highdropping fullpitch which
will pitch either on the top of the wicket or a few inches before it
the ordinary slow fullpitch which reaches the batsman about the
height of his knees and the mediumpaced fullpitch which will hit
the stumps nearly at the top The highdropping fullpitch is a ball
that is seldom used the reason for its rarity probably being the
extreme difficulty of bowling it accurately and the certain punishment
it will meet with if it falls at all short either in height or length
of what it should be It should be delivered as high as possible there
is no limit to the height this ball may go in the air as the higher
it ascends the more difficult it is to play It should be bowled so
that it reaches its highest point when it is almost directly over the
head of the batsman and should pitch on the very top of the stumps
It is strange that this ball is not more often practised by slow
bowlers as especially to the pokey nervous style of batsmen it is
fraught with considerable uneasiness and requires some skill to play
properly To really firstclass punishing batsmen it is a ball which
has comparatively no terrors and on which not much reliance can be
placed though it should always in our opinion be tried at least once
to every batsman who is getting well set But to the poker the man
who refuses to do anything but stick his bat in front of the wicket
who lets halfvolleys fullpitches and longhops pass unscathed and
unplayed on both sides of himto him who considers he is doing his
side good service by wasting three hours of valuable time for a dozen
runs on his side of the balance and three hours wear and tear of the
wicket on the otherto him who helps so greatly to fill up the records
of drawn matches the highdropping fullpitch is an excellent ball He
does not know what to do with it he is afraid to step back to play it
for fear of hitting his wicket and he hardly likes to be so bold as to
try to cut or hit it on the on side One of the most amusing sights we
have ever seen at cricket was one of these batsmen having ball after
ball of this sort bowled to him it was not till after he had nearly
lost his wicket a dozen times only keeping it by exceptional good
luck and had afforded the greatest merriment to players and spectators
alike that he burst out from sheer desperation into wild and furious
hittinga line of conduct which had the immediate effect of compelling
the bowler to desist from his lofty attacks

The second kind of fullpitchthe one reaching the batsman about the
height of his kneesis the most usual of fullpitches and enjoys the
distinction of being considered the easiest of all balls to hit A
good batsman can hit this ball from a slow bowler to almost any part
of the field consequently though it often happens in the chapter of
accidents that a wicket falls to this balla catch in the country
perhaps or a hard catch and bowlit is of all balls the very worst
for a slow bowler to deliver except perhaps a long hop

The third kindthe mediumpaced fullpitch straight to the top of
the stumpsis occasionally for a slow bowler a very useful ball In
the first place it is not quite so easy to hit as it appears to the
batsman the change in pace from slow to medium often causes him to
hit a trifle slower than he should do when the ball coming on faster
than expected hits the top or splice of the bat and goes straight up
in the air This ball is generally more successful with players who
have a partiality for onside hitting than with others as it is never
a difficult one to play quietly it is only when the batsman tries to
hit that it becomes likely to get a wicket It is also useful when a
hitter by running out and hitting every ball is demoralising bowler
fielders and the whole side If the bowler sees the intention of the
hitter to run out before the ball is deliveredand he is often able
to do thishe can do nothing better than bowl a good mediumpaced
fullpitch straight at the top of the middle stump if the batsman goes
on with his intention of running out he is not only apt to overrun
this faster than usual ball and let it pass over the top of his bat
but if he does hit it he is likely to send it high in the air from
the abovementioned cause of catching it with the top or splice of the
bat There is however nothing so flurrying to a bowler as a batsman
who runs out to every ball and who evinces his intention of doing
so before the ball is delivered The writer has often talked with
old cricketers on this subject and they have remarked how well the
old bowlers of their early days used to keep their heads under these
trying circumstances Doubtless they deserve the very greatest credit
for doing so for there is nothing so trying to a bowler it spoils
his pitch and is rather apt to do the same to his temper The regular
attendant at matches may have seen almost every bowler of reputation in
England so thoroughly flurried and upset by a batsman doing this that
in spite of all efforts to keep cool the bowling was simply paralysed
and rendered useless to the side for the time being The best courses
for a slow bowler to pursue on these occasions is st to bowl the
sort of fullpitch just discussed and nd to increase his pace a
little and bowl a little short of a good length about a foot or more
outside the legs of the batsman There is nothing a rushingout batsman
finds so hard to hit as a ball well outside his legs

Widish off balls are also useful as a batsman going down the wicket is
not only apt to miss but also if he can reach to sky them A high
fullpitch into the hands of the wicketkeeper is likewise sometimes
successful but though we may lay down certain rules and suggestions
as to what is best for a bowler to do at this very trying time we are
afraid that unless he is able to keep exceptionally cool they will be
of no practical assistance

The variableness of the English climate plays a very important part
in the success or otherwise of slow bowlers A shower of rain in the
night often has the effect of making particularly deadly a slow bowler
who the day before on a hard and fast ground was comparatively
harmless and ineffective Up to  the disadvantage of a rainfall in
the night to a side that had begun but not finished its innings was
increased by the rule forbidding the ground to be rolled except before
the commencement of each innings Rain in the night not only softens
the ground but brings up to the surface numbers of worms which cover
the pitch with little heaps of earth mould These little heaps in the
absence of any rolling made the ground bumpy and treacherous and
consequently entailed serious discomfiture to the batting side The
only plausible argument ever advanced for this injustice was that it
might happen to either side and was one of the chances of the game
However the MCC wisely decided though not till quite recently
that this rule should be abolished the reason for the decision being
that the side which won the toss had a great advantage as it was from
having the first and best of the wicket and that as the other side
was usually batting at the end of the day it gave the men an extra
and unfair disadvantage in having the wicket spoilt by rain and worms
without the chance of having it rolled No rule however can affect
the drawback under which a batting side is placed whose wicket is
softened by a heavy rainfall in the night The roller may level the
worm moulds but it cannot alter the slow sticky state of the ground
in fact it often brings up more water and makes the pitch still more
sticky and slow It is on occasions such as these that slow bowlers
meet with their greatest success So frequently during the course of
the season do these soft wickets occur even in what are called our hot
summers that it is part of the science of bowling to know how to turn
such grounds to the best advantage The different states of the ground
caused by the weather may be roughly and for all practical purposes
divided into five st the hard and dry state nd the hard state
with the grass wet rd the very soft and slow state a with the
grass dry b with the grass wet th the drying state when it has
been very slow and soft but is gradually drying under the influence
of a hot sun or wind th the hard and crumbled state The hard and
dry state calls for no comment as everything written on the subject
of bowling unless otherwise specified refers to the ground in this
condition The hard state with the grass wet is perhaps the most
trying time for a slow bowler He has to bowl with a wet ball which
he has great difficulty in holding he cannot get on the slightest
degree of twist as the wet ball slips off the wet grass directly it
pitches allowing no time for the ball to bite the ground and take
the twist A good batsman on these wickets knows that all he has to do
is to play forward with a straight bat when the ball is anything like
a good one and he is bound to meet it The slippery ball flies off
the bat like lightning and travels if the grass is short and not too
thick over the hard ground faster than it does when the grass is dry
Every now and then a ball may be inclined to keep low or shoot but a
shooter does not possess the same terrors on a wet as on a dry ground
because in almost every instance it can be played forward to and a
good batsman in playing forward always keeps his bat low enough to stop
shooters especially on wet wickets until he actually sees the ball
rise

The only course for a slow bowler to adopt on these wickets is to bowl
as good a length as he can and as straight as possible He should also
bear in mind that the ball leaves the ground far more quickly than
usual in its wet slippery state and that consequently the most
likely place in the field to capture a batsman is shortslip Easy as
the ground is for a batsman when once he gets the pace of it it often
happens that at first he is surprised at the great pace from the pitch
plays back instead of forward and places the ball in the slips It
is a golden rule for every bowler slow and fast on these wickets
to have shortslip finer than on ordinary occasions and a trifle
further back It is often advisable to have an extra man standing about
three yards squarer than the regular shortslip but no farther from
the wicket Two quick active men who are capable at times of bringing
off smart onehand catches should be chosen for these places They
are by far the most likely men in the field to dismiss good batsmen
on wet hard wickets in fact it is often difficult to see how two
such batsmen are to be separated on these occasions except by a catch
at one of these places or at the wicket A bowler should with this
object keep bowling a good length on the off stump and just outside it
recollecting that goodlength balls must pitch considerably shorter
than usual on these very quick wickets

The very soft and slow state is the result of heavy rain which has
left the surface of the pitch dry but the ground itself thoroughly
sodden This condition of the ground is popularly supposed to favour
a slow bowler How often on coming on to the ground to inspect the
wicket after a nights rain is he accosted something in this style
Well Jack this ought to suit you those twisters of yours will want
some watching today Jack after looking at the pitch which is as
soft and sodden as a piece of dough knows full well that it will be a
long time before the ground gets back enough of its halfdrowned life
to help him in the slightest degree There is no poorer fun for a slow
bowler than having to bowl on these utterly lifeless wickets On a
hard true ground though it may be favourable to the batsman he has
good sport in trying every dodge he can think of he fishes and feeds
and angles as warily as Izaak Walton himself the ground and ball are
full of life and go and very often unfortunately for the bowler the
batsman too On wet hard wickets when he can get no twist on there
is still life and pace in the ground but in the sodden dead state
directly the ball touches the ground it sinks in loses all life and
pace and comes on to the batsman like what a Yorkshire professional
was once heard to call a diseased lawntennis ball There is no
greater fallacy at cricket than to suppose that a sodden wicket is an
advantage to a slow bowler The time when it begins to assist him is
when the surface is caking under the influence of the sun or a drying
wind and then it is that as we said above the greatest successes of
slow bowlers are met with A slow bowler having to bowl on a sodden
wicket perceives at once that it is extremely difficult for him to bowl
to a good batsman a goodlength ball for the following reasons

What is called a goodlength ball on ordinary occasions remains on
the ground so long and comes off the pitch so slow that a batsman if
he is so minded can with ease play it backie he can see it coming
on from the pitch in time for him to get back and play it as a simple
longhop Anything short of this will all the more be capable of
being played as a longhop If the ball is pitched farther than a
good length it becomes at oncecertainly to batsmen quick on their
legsa halfvolley Thus if a batsman really gets the time of the
ground he has only to play these two simplest of balls No amount of
spin will help the bowler the ball in the soft ground may twist at
right angles but it does it so slowly that the batsman has ample time
to defend his wicket In these circumstances there is only one thing
for a slow bowler to do and that is to bowl faster and endeavour by
giving extra pace to the ball to make it come off the ground quicker
There are some batsmen whom on these sodden wickets it is almost
impossible to get rid of They remain for hours perfectly contented if
a whole day is taken up with their innings and forty runs added to the
total the chances of a draw being thereby greatly augmented A famous
professional stick on one occasion remained at the wickets when the
ground was sodden for one hour and fifty minutes before troubling the
scorer he was then so flustered by the jeering of the mob that he
rushed out hit a catch was missed and amidst as much cheering as if
he had wanted one run to complete his hundred broke his ducksegg
Louis Hall of Yorkshire was a desperate man to bowl to on these
grounds every ball that was bowled he either played back or smothered
Nothing in cricket could be more dull or dismal than bowling to this
batsman on a sodden wicket at Bramall Lane Ground in a real Sheffield
fog A Bannerman the Australian batsman is another terrible hard nut
for a bowler to crack on these sodden wickets

Although as has been said slow bowlers are not assisted by the ground
when in this condition and it is extremely difficult to bowl anything
approaching a good ball to a good batsman there are some batsmen and
real good ones too on a hard true ground who are utterly unable to
adapt their style of play to a slow ground or rather never can realise
that a ball pitched into a lump of dough will leave it much slower than
when pitched on to a stone These batsmen if they kept their keenness
of eye and activity till they were a hundred would still be seen
playing a quick forward stroke on the sodden ground sending the ball
up in the air in every direction A batsman who persists in playing
forward on a dead wicket and finishing his stroke as he would do on a
fast wicket is certain not to last long It is very curious to notice
how sometimes nearly a whole batting side will make a mistake about
the condition of the wicket The first batsmen see the ground slow and
the ball twisting a good deal and begin playing as they would do on a
faster wicket viz playing forward to the pitch instead of waiting and
playing a back game Four or five batsmen will follow play in the same
style and lose their wickets generally bowled or caught and bowled
Some batsman will then come in who at once finds out what the slow
bowlers have long since knownthat it is a slow easy wicket he has to
bat on and not a caked kicky one What happens He plays every
ball back except those that he hits and he hits everything except a
longhop because he can get to the pitch of anything else The slow
bowlers who have been doing the mischief are soon knocked off and
his side in spite of the failure of its four or five most competent
batsmen makes a good score On one occasion in a firstclass match
the first seven wickets fell for fifty runs the wicket being deadly
slow and dull the eighth man came in and by dint of playing back and
hitting and a little luck made over a hundred in about an hour and a
half being fortunate enough to have some one to stick in with him at
the other end

When the ground is very soft and the grass wet the bowler is in
about the same position as when the grass is wet on a hard wicket
he has to bowl with a wet slippery ball and cannot get any twist at
all upon it This is called the cutting through state which means
that the ball being slippery and the ground and grass wet it cuts
through the surface of the pitch taking with it a small piece of wet
sticky turf As in the hard state with wet grass shortslip is an
important place and likely to get chances Although the ground when
in this condition is in favour of the batsman cricket is miserable
under such circumstances and is enjoyed neither by batsman bowler
nor fielders The batsman cannot stand on the slippery mud the bowler
with wet dirty hands and boots and trousers bespattered with slush is
utterly unable to do anything with the slimy ball and the fieldsmen
can neither hold nor stop it The ground is covered with sawdust
without the use of which it would be impossible for the bowler to grasp
the ball firmly and altogether the whole scene is so unlike cricket
essentially a fineweather game that it always seems a pity under such
conditions to go on playing

The drying state when the ground has been very soft and sodden but
is gradually drying and caking on the surface under the influence of a
hot sun or wind is the time when slow bowlers have it all their own
way It is on this condition of ground that in former days bowlers
like Alfred Shaw and Peate of Yorkshire and in present times
Tyler Briggs and Wainwright have so often astonished the cricket
community with wonderful analyses When the ground has got into this
state it will often remain so for several hours At Lords when the
ground after being soft has become caked on the top it is no unusual
occurrence to see thirty good wickets or more fall in the course of the
day When a side no matter how many really good batsmen it may number
has to go in on caked wickets against good bowling they may think
themselves lucky if they get  runs The ball takes almost as much
twist as a bowler wants to put on it comes off the ground at different
paces one part of the pitch being a trifle drier and harder than
another The first ball of the over will perhaps get up almost straight
and very quickly from the pitch as a batsman is playing it the next
pitches a trifle shorter may stop in the ground and get up and look
at you as it is called making correct play an impossibility Or
perhaps one ball will get up very quickly and high and hit the batsman
on the arm or side and the next pitched in almost the same spot
will leave the pitch equally quickly but never rise more than an inch
from the ground It is no recommendation to a bowler to be able to get
wickets on such grounds as these any bad bowler might bowl a good
batting side out for a small score with such assistance The only way
a batsman can reasonably hope to add any notches to the score of his
side is to grasp the situation at once throw careful correct play to
the winds and hit pull and slog in every direction where he thinks
he can get rid of the teasing ball The Australian eleven of  were
particularly good on this class of wicket they had four menGiffen
Bonnor McDonnell Massiewho rarely needing much inducement to hit
used to launch out most vigorously and successfully on these occasions
often cracking up twenty or thirty runs in about half the number of
minutes and securing victory for their side

Although very badly caked wickets are not uncommon perhaps the best
for bowling and the worst for batting in modern experience was at the
Oval during the last innings of the England v Australia match in
 It is the only disastrous match for England in the whole list
of national fixtures that have been played in this country It may be
remembered that England having only a few runs to get to win nearly
made them for the first two wickets Grace and Ulyett both making about
twenty The ground at this time was drying and becoming every minute
more difficult and the way in which our English wickets were mowed
down by Spofforth is now a matter of cricket history too well known to
repeat Spofforth was bowling rather more than medium pace bringing
the ball back a foot or more very quickly from the pitch sometimes
kicking to the height of the batsmans head and at others shooting
Some of our cricket reporters talked in an airy manner about the funk
of the English team on that occasion but the charge was wholly without
foundation A batsmans consciousness that twenty thousand spectators
were watching each ball with breathless interest and that on his own
individual efforts depended the reputation of English cricket that
the bowling was about as good and the ground as bad as any cricketer
had ever seen might and probably did cause a feeling of intense
anxiety in the minds of each of the English players who failed in his
efforts to win victory for his side but to say that their efforts were
paralysed or that any one of them was unnerved by what is popularly
called funk is certainly unjust to the welltried cricketers who did
battle for England on that memorable and disastrous occasion

The hard and crumbled wicket is perhaps almost more difficult for
batsmen than when it is caked The ball will twist a great deal on this
class of wicket and does it very quickly It is also inclined both to
pop and keep low Spofforth and Turner of the Australian bowlers and
Peel Briggs and Attewell of the English ones are all most deadly
bowlers on such a wicket as this

Some of our most successful slow bowlers have been lefthanded The
peculiarity and difficulty about lefthand bowling is that the natural
spin imparted to the ball by a lefthanded bowler is the offspin
which of course makes the ball after the pitch twist from the leg
side of the righthanded batsman to the off This as we have mentioned
above is the most difficult twist for a batsman to play as an off
break is more easy to watch after the pitch than a legbreak The
legbreak which a batsman has to meet from a righthanded bowler is not
so difficult to play as that from a lefthander because first the
latter is usually faster than the former and secondly it is much
more disguised The righthand legbreak is impossible without getting
the ball in the centre of the hand and screwing the hand round just
as if it were twisting a corkscrew the reverse wayan action which
at once prepares the batsman for the leg twist Thirdly because it
usually twists very much less than the righthand legbreak It is not
the ball which twists the most that gets the wickets it is the ball
that just twists enough to beat the bat

The mode of attack generally adopted by a slow left hander is to place
all his men with the exception of a shortleg and a deep midon on
the off side He then proceeds to bowl on the off stump and outside
it making the ball go away from the batsman to the off as much as
possible after the pitch Great care has to be taken by the batsman
as the slightest mistake in hitting or forward play will give a catch
to one of the numerous traps laid all round on the off side It is the
object of the bowler to get the batsman either to hit at a ball which
is not quite far enough to be smothered or to reach out and play
forward at one which is a little beyond his reach A favourite device
of the lefthanded bowler is to get the batsman to hit at widish ones
on the off side a stroke that must cause an uppish hit somewhere
as it is impossible for a batsman to smother a ball that is a trifle
out of his reach It is often a good thing for a lefthanded bowler
to send down a ball without any twist on it at all especially if he
is bowling on a wicket where he is able to do a good deal The ball
without any spin on it should pitch on the middle and off stumps and
if the bowler is bowling from round the wicket as lefthanders usually
do it will then come on in a line with the pitch and the hand at the
moment of delivery and if not stopped by the bat take the legstump
This slow ball that comes with the arm in the middle of others going
the other way is very successful Slow lefthanded bowlers often have
their tempers sorely tried by a class of batsmen that were discussed in
a previous portion of this chapter namely those who are so frightened
of getting out that they will never play at an off ball longhop
halfvolley or goodlength There are many enticing balls bowled by
lefthanded bowlers that ought to be left alone by every batsman
notably those that pitch too wide to enable them to be played forward
and smothered There is no greater or more successful trap for wild
young players than these widish off balls But it is indeed a trying
time for the bowler when he keeps pitching just outside the off stump
and is not even played at by the batsman Bowlers should in these
circumstances bowl ball after ball on the off stump and just outside
it It is by no means an uncommon occurrence to see these punishing
batsmen taken in by a ball that comes in a little with the arm and
removes the bail while they are striking an attitude bat over shoulder

We have had some excellent lefthanded bowlers in England and there
can be no doubt that every team should possess one of this sort if
possible Peate for some years enjoyed the reputation of being the
best lefthander in England and rightly so He was an exceptional
good length difficult to see and had a lot of work on Some of his
performances against the Australians are truly wonderful When Peate
first began to play cricket he was a very fast highactioned bowler
and the writer remembers finding him on the slow sticky wicket of
the Carlisle ground very nasty to play He subsequently altered his
pace to slow and it is a remarkable fact that after this alteration
he completely lost the power of sending down a really fast ball
Another of our great slow lefthanded bowlers was David Buchanan and
strangely enough he too was in his early days a fast bowler As one of
the slow school he is best known and we have no doubt that he at the
present moment has taken nearly twice as many wickets in the course of
his career as any other living cricketer His bowling was celebrated
for the great amount of work he got on to the ball unless the batsman
was on the pitch of it a mistake was certain The only team that ever
seemed to enjoy Buchanans bowling was the Rugby boys and constant
practice had robbed it of all terrors for them

It is a doubtful point amongst cricketers whether Peel of Yorkshire
or Briggs of Lancashire was the best lefthanded slow to medium
bowler In the writers opinion Peel was the best He bowled perhaps
a slightly better length than Briggs and as he had a more difficult
action to see was not so easily hit by a resolute batsman as Briggs
They were both however excellent bowlers but both are now a little
past their prime Briggs possesses a marvellous strength of wrist and
fingers which give him great power of twist and pace His very fast
ball is nearly as good as that of Palmer the Australian One of his
best performances was in England v Australia at Lords in  None
of the English bowlers on this occasion could do much with the ball
except Briggs There is one Australian lefthanded bowler who we regret
has never been seen on English cricket groundsTom Kendall In 
when the first colonial team visited this country great accounts of
Kendalls prowess with the ball had reached us His name was included
in the list of the players whom we were led to expect but for some
reason or other though he did actually start with the team he left it
at Adelaide or at some other port at which the ship touched The writer
saw him and played against him in  in Tasmania and though getting
on in years and rather on the big side for bowling he was about as
nasty a lefthander as any batsman could wish to play He had a high
action changed his pace well from slow to medium and then to very
fast had lots of work both ways on his slow and medium balls and the
very fast ones went with the arm When the writer saw him his length
was not as good as it might have been or from all accounts as it
once was His action reminded us rather of that excellent bowler J C
Shaw in his day the best lefthander in England

In the first Australian team that visited this country in 
there was another lefthanded slow bowler named Allan about whom the
Australians themselves spread most extraordinary statements It was
said that Allan the bowler of the century as he was called in
Australia possessed some of the most remarkable qualities Rumour
declared his spin off the ground was so great that the slowest
ball came off up to the bat at ten times greater speed than it had
travelled to the pitch that he could twist either way to almost any
degree at will and that his bowling had a most remarkable curve in
the air which rendered it most deadly This lefthanded bowler is
mentioned because though his powers of bowling had of course been
greatly exaggerated it was certainly most puzzling He met with some
considerable success at the outset of the tour but subsequently his
health gave way before the wearing work of cricket every day and he
was unable to bowl at all His bowling had a considerable amount of
spin but what was the most extraordinary thing connected with it was
the inward curl in the air towards the body of the batsman and then
after the pitch the outward twist of the ball A ball that goes one
way in the air and another after the pitch is calculated to try the
mettle of the best batsman It is a subject for regret that Allan
through increasing years and his consequent inability to stand hard
work has not accompanied any of the later teams as his bowling was so
very different from anything we have ever seen at home

Does bowling curl or twist in the air is a question we have often been
asked and we have frequently heard disputes by men who possessed some
considerable knowledge of the game as to whether it was possible for
balls to travel thus or not It seems almost incredible that men who
have over and over again handled the bat should doubt the tendency of
some kinds of bowling to twist or curl in the air Nearly all legbreak
slow bowlers curl inwards towards the batsman before the pitch and no
one who has ever played against W G Graces bowling can doubt that
the real secret of his success as a bowler has been in the peculiar
flight his action gives the ball causing it to curl before it pitches

However the question as to balls turning in the air has been
definitely settled by the American baseball players In this game the
pitcher throws one fullpitch after another to the batsman and even
if the latter happen to be one of the best and most experienced in
the game he misses a considerable proportion of these fullpitches
And why because of the twist or curl in the air which the pitcher
imparts to the ball A very interesting account is given by Mr R A
Proctor in Longmans Magazine for June  of a wellknown English
cricketers failure to strike the fullpitches of one of the best
American pitchers Time after time the bat struck the air and nothing
else and this was simply owing to the curl the pitcher put on the
ball Mr Proctor scientifically explains the curl in the air and it
may be of interest to insert a short extract from his article

 When a ball or in fact any missile is advancing rapidly through the
 air there is formed in front of it a small aggregation of compressed
 air In passing we may remark that the compressed air in front of an
 advancing cannon ball has been rendered discerniblewe can hardly
 say visibleby instantaneous photography In shape the cushion of
 air is conical or rather conoidal if the ball is advancing without
 spin and therefore it resists the progress of the ball equally on
 all sides and only affects the balls velocity The same is the case
 if the ball is spinning on an axis lying along its course But in the
 case we have to consider where the ball is spinning on an axis square
 to its course the cushion of compressed air formed by the advancing
 ball has no longer this symmetrical shape On the advancing side of
 the spinning surface the air cannot escape so readily as it would if
 there were no spin on the other side it escapes more readily than it
 would but for the spin Hence the cushion of air is thrown towards
 that side of the ball where the spin is forwards and removed from the
 other side The same thing then must happen as where a ball encounters
 a cushion aslant A ball driven squarely against a very soft cushion
 plunges straight into it turning neither to the right nor to the
 left or if deflected at all as against a billiard cushion comes
 straight back on its course but if driven aslant against the cushion
 it is deflected from the region of resistance So with the base ball
 As the cushion of air against which it is advancing is not opposed
 squarely to it but is stronger on one side than on the other the
 ball is deflected from the region of greatest resistance

There is one style of slow bowling that has of late years almost
completely vanished from firstclass cricket we refer to underhand
slows When Ridley left off bowling lobs about twelve years ago
nobody except Humphreys attempted to bowl lobs but in  Jephson
of Surrey has introduced them again with some success and we hope
he will prosper As underhand was at one time the only bowling that
was allowed by the rules of cricket and as it met with a great amount
of success even after the raising of the arm was permitted it will
be as well to refer to the cause that has brought about its practical
abolition This is owing to the increasing popularity of the game
and the consequent great increase in the number of good batsmen The
greatest underhand bowler that ever played was probably William
Clarke whose merits have been so often discussed in cricket writings
that it is unnecessary to repeat them here In order to ascertain
the style of batsmen Clarke made his great reputation against we
must refer to some one who has seen and known the great bowler and
conversed with those who were in the habit of playing against him We
are told that Clarke had perfect accuracy of pitch a quick rise from
the ground and a good leg twist on his bowling These attributes in
an underarm bowler most excellent as they are would not nowadays
with the present efficient state of batting justify the name of the
possessor being placed in the first rank because we consider no amount
of accuracy of pitch twist or anything else can ever secure this
coveted distinction to a bowler of this kind Mr Pycroft gives us
the information we require on the subject of batting against Clarkes
bowling He says with regard to Pilch at that time the best batsman of
the day He played him back all day if he bowled short and hit him
hard all along the ground whenever he overpitched and some times he
would go in to Clarkes bowling not to make a furious swipe but to
run him down with a straight bat

Now this description of the play of a man who was able to meet
Clarkes bowling is interesting to us because it shows us that the
way in which the great bowler was played by one of the few who could
oppose him successfully is exactly the same method in which every good
batsmen of the present time does play underhand bowling If any man
of today chosen to take part in the Gentlemen v Players match as
a batsman were to endeavour to play underhand bowling in any other
manner he would be laughed at as being devoid of the most elementary
rules of the game Mr Pycroft goes on to tell us the way which many
did adopt in playing Clarke He says This going in to Clarkes
bowling some persons thought necessary for every ball forgetting that
discretion is the better part of cricket the consequence was that
many wickets fell from positive longhops This description shows
that a great number of those who fell victims to Clarkes bowling
were absolutely uninitiated in the first principles of playing slows
viz never to hit except on the volley or just as the ball pitches
Nowadays every batsmanat any rate all who play in firstclass
cricketknows the danger of playing wildly at underhand lobs
as they are called Occasional mistakes are made no doubt when an
unexpected lob bowler appears but more from wildness and anxiety to
score than from any ignorance as to the mode of playing such balls The
way to play lobs is exactly the method Mr Pycroft tells us was adopted
by the great Fuller Pilch

Slow lobs have therefore in firstclass cricket died a natural death
and although we may expect to find a lob bowler occasionally cropping
up here and there we do not think there is much prospect of seeing an
exemplar of this style who will ever attain the rank of a firstclass
bowler such as that acquired by Clarke Mr V E Walker and Tinley
Mr A W Ridley was the last wellknown amateur underarm bowler who
made a mark in firstclass cricket His performance against Cambridge
in the now famous University match is too well known to need record
here Humphreys of Sussex has only retired two or three seasons and
for a long time he got a lot of wickets His bowling has always been
useful to his county but during the season of  it has met with
extraordinary success He has great command over the ball and can
consequently vary its flight pitch and break at will Humphreys will
always be a terror to those batsmen who prefer to hit the ball in the
air rather than along the ground and to those who recklessly leave
their ground and hit wildly at the pitch of the ball J B Wood of
Oxford has occasionally got wickets for his University with lobs
and helped materially to win the match v Cambridge in  but
he though useful as a change is a long way removed from a good lob
bowler and indeed his best ball would seem to be a straight high
full pitch Although we have stated that lob bowling has died a natural
death and cannot ever be expected to cope with the present state of
batting still underhand slows are occasionally such an excellent
change that we are sorry they are not more practised It is not
however wonderful that there are so few lob bowlers who can go on at a
pinch for a change when we consider what has been already said about
batting having mastered the art of underhand men will not practise
any art unless they have some fair prospect of being ultimately
successful and knowing that lobs will only be useful very occasionally
and cannot attain to great success they will not practise them It is
a pity they do not as over and over again we see instances of a good
wicket falling to a poorish lob bowler when everything else has failed
The previous remarks about underhands refer to firstclass cricket
against schools and against secondclass batsmen lobs have been and
always will be particularly deadly There is something so tempting to
an inexperienced player in seeing a ball chucked up in the air slowly
and simply it looks so very easy to hit so peculiarly guileless that
a wild slog is frequently the result too often followed by disastrous
consequences

For this reason the captain of every school eleven should insist on one
of his team devoting himself to lob bowling a little practice will
enable any one to get a fairly accurate pitch and twist from the leg
side any boy can manage Lob bowling thus acquired at school will often
be useful in after days as a change even in firstclass cricket There
are one or two simple rules connected with lob bowling which everyone
who attempts this style should master

FirstDo not bowl too slow if the ball is thrown high and slow in
the air a good batsman quick on his legs will have time to reach and
hit it before it pitches Old Clarke used to say It wants a certain
amount of pace to make a goodlength ball with proper rise and twist
The ball should be sent at such speed as will oblige the batsman to
play forward to it

SecondlyA good long run should be taken as this gets way and fire
on to the ball and is always more likely than a short run to deceive
the batsman as to the pitch

ThirdlyGenerally bowl round the wicket

Most of the remarks that we have made on slow roundarm legbreak
bowling apply to slow lobs

Having devoted a number of pages to the subject of slow bowling
let us now turn to the consideration of what is almost equally
importantfast bowling indeed it may be said that the cooperation
of a good fast bowler is absolutely essential if a team wants to rank
amongst the best particularly as if there be one of each sort bowling
at either end the change in pace is more likely to embarrass the
batsman than if he had to play two bowlers of the same pace Between
 and  there was a great dearth of good fast bowlers at the
time much regretted and not easily accounted for Now there is a great
improvement and fast bowling gets much more attention paid to it than
formerly was the case

Although ordinary fast balls are easy to play on good wickets
however it is but seldom that a wicket which is good at the beginning
of a match remains so to the close The ground wears and cuts up with
the continual pitching of the ball and the tramp of feet and fast
bowling on such occasions often becomes most deadly Then again a
fast quick delivery to a newcomer even though the best of batsmen
may deceive him in the pace and before the eye gets accustomed to
the light and the hand becomes steady cheat him into playing back
at a ball which ought to have been met with forward play Often have
crack batsmen been dismissed summarily by the first or second ball
coming quicker than they expected off the pitch Murdoch the famous
Australian batsman was particularly apt to mistime fast bowling on
first going in and several times has the author seen his stumps
shattered immediately by an ordinary straight fast ball without any
work at all on it The tail end of a team are usually victims to a
good straight fast bowler as unless a fast bowler is met by straight
fearless forward play he is bound to be dangerous and it very rarely
happens that the tail end of an ordinary team even a county team is
capable of this A great deal has been said and written about young
fast bowlers bowling too fast for their strength thus overtaxing their
powers and overbowling themselves It is doubtless a fact that many
young promising fast bowlers have been rendered useless by this anxiety
to get more pace on the ball than their strength warranted and there
can be no better advice to a young aspirant for the honours of a fast
bowler than that so often given viz Bowl within your strength or
else you will overbowl yourself Although the wisdom and truth of
this warning are generally ascertained by personal experience pretty
early in the career of most fast bowlers it is seldom we are sorry
to say remembered in actual practicewhich remissness we are bound
to add does not in the least surprise us It may possibly sound like
heresy to many old cricketers to say that in fast bowling pace is
nearly everything but such is our opinion Assume that a man can bowl
straight and a good lengthie has a good command over the balland
then it may be said that the faster he bowls the more likely he is to
get wickets And this is generally discovered by young bowlers who have
an aptitude for fast bowling with the result that many overbowl
themselves strain muscles rick shoulders and render themselves
useless

The object of fast bowling is to beat the batsman by the pace of the
ball and if this object be accomplished the ball will either be missed
or a bad stroke will be made by the batsman The faster the bowling
the more likely it is that a batsman will be beaten both before and
after the ball leaves the ground Should the ball shoot or get
up the chances of its being played accurately are rendered much
less when the ball leaves the ground with lightninglike speed and is
almost invisible to the eye than when it leaves it with less speed
and gives the batsman an opportunity of seeing what is going to happen
for an appreciable moment before it reaches him Besides the faster
the bowling the more scope there is for the bowler to change his pace
should he be one of the few fast bowlers who have the power of so doing
with advantage While saying that pace is everything in a fast bowler
we do not wish for a moment to cry down or disparage the advantages of
mediumpaced bowling This style has its own characteristics which
are more closely allied to slow bowling than to fast but at the same
time there are many moderately good mediumpaced bowlers now bowling
with some success in firstclass matches who would be much more deadly
and successful could they add about half as much speed again to their
bowling There are of course men who on the other hand spoil a good
style by trying to bowl too fastmen who depend for their success
on peculiarity in flight and the work on the ball Every man must
judge for himself if he possess great powers of twist combined with
accuracy and anything peculiar or difficult to see in his action then
let him devote himself to slow or mediumpaced bowling

When the first edition of this work was published firstclass cricket
was almost entirely without any really fast good bowling Things have
changed since then and the hope that we then expressed that a new
race of good fast bowlers would arise has been happily fulfilled
Ten years ago the only really fast professional bowler was Ulyett of
Yorkshire He was fast and bumpy and occasionally most deadly with
his breakbacks Allan Hill of the same county with his easy and
beautiful delivery had retired owing to increasing years There were
brilliant comets for a season or so who shone brightly and then quickly
disappeared Harrison likewise of Yorkshire seemed likely to make
his mark but after a brilliant beginning vanished from the scene of
firstclass cricket Crossland of Lancashire for a brief period
mowed down the County Palatines opponents like ninepins but he too
retireda victim to the just cry against unfair bowling There was
Bowley of Surrey a very fast and uncertain bowler who was perhaps
the best fast bowler for a season or so but it was a pitiful best for
English cricket to produce Amongst the amateurs were A Rotherham S
Christopherson Whitby and C Toppin H Rotherham at the beginning
of his career his last year at Uppingham and the year following was
a very deadly bowler He had a good slow ball and a splendid yorker
but he only lasted a very short time S Christopherson was a fairly
good fast bowler at one time but he took a good deal out of himself
with his action and soon lost the fire and life that a fast bowler
must possess The temporary absence of good fast bowlers during some of
the years between  and  was one of the most remarkable facts
connected with firstclass cricket It was the more remarkable because
it was only a few years before this that nearly all the great bowlers
were fast the list included Tarrant Jackson and Freeman whose
bowling used it was said to hum in the air and after these what a
harvest of fast amateur bowlers there wasButler Francis Powys
Evans Morton and names too numerous to mention

Now we are happy to say English cricket can once more be proud of
her array of fast bowlers Richardson of Surrey the greatest in our
judgment that ever lived Mold and Cuttell of Lancashire Hearne and
Davidson are all good fast bowlers Among amateurs S M J Woods
was the best but for the last few seasons he has been handicapped by
a sprain but when at his best he was a magnificent fast bowler with
a most deceptive slow ball while Jackson Kortright Jessop and
Cunliffe are all far above the average

As mentioned above with reference to slow bowling the higher the hand
and arm are raised at the moment of delivering the ball the higher the
ball will bound after it leaves the pitch A fast bowler should always
bear this in mind and keep his hand as high as possible It is simply
a matter of ordinary common sense that a ball which rises up high from
the pitch is more difficult for a batsman to get over and smother than
one that comes on low and skimming A fast ball when it is anything
like a good length must be met with the bat ie it must be played
with the forward stroke consequently a ball that rises quickly from
the pitch and is still rising when it meets the bat is extremely
likely to rise higher still after it leaves it unless it is played
with great care and caution

The low skimming fast bowler is generally an easy man to play the
batsman when the ground is true can play hard forward to almost any
length of ball there is no abrupt rise to render an uppish stroke
probable even if he does slightly misjudge the pace and length of the
ball There is of course in fast bowling a much greater difficulty
in getting any appreciable twist on to the ball than in slow The ball
leaves the ground so quickly that it is hardly in contact with it
long enough to bite the turf and so avail itself of any spin that
may have been imparted to it by the bowler It is to be remembered
however that the slightest deviation of a fast ball from its course
after it has pitched is if a good length most likely to deceive the
batsman The latter is bound to play to the pitch of the ball as it
leaves the ground so quickly as to render it impossible for him to
follow it with the eye in its course from the ground He plays forward
with a straight bat to meet it should it turn an inch or two he will
most likely miss it

The off break is the one most usually attempted by fast bowlers the
ball is grasped firmly generally by the seam to give the hand a
firmer grip and is delivered in the same way as described for the slow
off break There have been but few really fast bowlers who have been
able consistently to make their balls come back Every now and then
however for some unaccountable reason a fast bowler finds that he is
making the ball do a lot from the off side Perhaps his grasp is firmer
and his wrist and fingers are more powerful than on ordinary occasions
or the ground may have more turf on it or for some other reason his
bowling twists in from the pitch with most fatal results to the batsmen

If a fast bowler happen to be a man of strong physique which is
usually the case a fairly long run up to the wickets before delivering
the ball is an advantage to his bowling This gives more impetus to the
ball and what is popularly known as devil Spofforth the Australian
bowler when bowling fast took a much longer run than when bowling
medium pace It is also an advantage to keep the batsman waiting for
the delivery of the ball which happens when the bowler runs several
yards up to the wicket For a fast bowler who intends to change his
pace from very fast to medium slow a long run is of great advantage
as the sight of the bowler coming up to the wicket before the delivery
of a slow ball as fast as before the delivery of a fast one is
extremely likely to take in the batsman with regard to the pace There
are not so many tricks and dodges in the art of bowling fast as there
are in bowling slow the chief object to be sought is to bowl straight
and good length and to make the ball bound A fast bowler when first
being put on should remember that his muscles are probably stiff and
that he may not at first be able to bowl as accurately and as fast
as he will be when thoroughly warmed to his work For this reason it
is always well to bowl two or three balls to one side of the wicket
before beginning These should be not quite at full speed for fear of
straining or ricking a muscle not yet in full swing but a good medium
pace It is always best for a fast bowler to try a ball or two before
beginning excepting in circumstances when he is called upon to bowl to
some one he has never bowled to before and especially so to some one
who has never seen him bowl How often when batting have we silently
chuckled with joy at seeing a man quite unknown to us rapidly loosening
his arms with two or three balls before beginning to bowl It is a
great thing to have an unknown bowler on ones side but he loses half
his value if his style and action are revealed to the batsman before he
receives the ball In  the writer was playing in a match against
the Australians when although things had been going very well for the
English side the team was beginning to get tied up into a knot owing
to the steady careful way in which Scott the colonial captain was
defying all the efforts of our bowlers to dislodge him A fast bowler
who had never seen Scott in his life before was deputed to bowl and
was proceeding to get ready for two or three down to loosen his arm
when he was told not to mind his arm being stiff but to bowl the first
over as fast as ever he could The first ball sent Scotts legstump
flying it was quite a simple ball never turned a hairs breadth
either way but the action and pace of the bowler took him in and this
would have been very unlikely to happen had he had an opportunity of
seeing the bowlers style

A fast bowler must be straight to be good This is not the art of one
skilled in the dodges of slows he has to bowl straight and a good
length too or else the runs will come at an enormous rate In the
present day it is usual to do without a longstop even to the fastest
bowlers this makes it imperatively necessary for the bowler not to
bowl to leg or if missed by the batsman the balls have a good chance
of flying past the wicketkeeper to the boundary for four Whether
it is a good principle to do without longstops even when the best
wicketkeepers are behind the sticks is a doubtful point

A fast bowler should have such command over the ball as to be able to
bowl a yorker whenever he wishes for the fact may be repeated that a
fast yorker is a most deadly ball

Spofforth and Palmer the Australians and Rotherham the old
Uppingham bowler Woods and Mold were about the best fast yorker
bowlers of modern times The ball came from these bowlers as high
as the arm would allow and seemed to fly like an arrow with
lightninglike rapidity straight to the blockhole or a few inches
inside it A highaction yorker is more likely to deceive a batsman
than a lowaction one as in the former case the startingpoint of the
ball is above the line of vision and in the latter on a line with
or below it which naturally makes the course and pace of the ball
more easy for the eye to judge A very common error into which good
fast yorker bowlers fall is not being content with trying the ball
occasionally to a batsman and when he first comes on or when they
first go on but persistently trying over after over to break down
his guard with a ball with which he is evidently quite at home and
which presents no terrors to him The result of this mistake is that
the balls get considerably punished either by being driven on the
fullpitch or else on the halfvolley the latter ball being often
the result of a tiredout yorker bowlers persistency The writer
remembers when playing in a match some years ago asking W G Grace
who was on the same side what sort of a fast bowler a certain man
was who was going on to bowl Oh Im never frightened of him he is
always trying to york you and bowls any amount of halfvolleys was
the reply and this was soon proved to be like most of the champion
cricketers opinions perfectly accurate

A good length just outside the off stump and between the off and middle
stump is the direction that may be commended to the bowler who bowls
over the wicket and tries to get a little off spin on the ball The
legstump in olden days was considered the most deadly spot for a
fast bowler to aim at but since every firstclass batsman now stands
up to his wicket and does not draw away an inch when the ball comes
between it and his legs legstump bowling is rather expensive work
By all means let fast bowlers lay siege to the legstump of inferior
batsmen but good batsmen getting over this ball will play it with
an almost perfectly straight bat on the outside and tax it most
unmercifully for the total of their side

As a rule it is better for a fast bowler to bowl over the wicket
as by so doing he has more of the wicket to bowl at and has
consequently a slightly better chance of hitting it if the ball is
missed by the batsman He has also a greater chance of an appeal for
leg before wicket being answered in his favour than if bowling from
the other side of the wicket There are some fast bowlers however
who must from the very nature of their action and delivery bowl from
round the wicket viz those who have either a natural bias from the on
to the off or who are able by their strength of wrist and fingers to
impart such a bias to the ball A man who bowls from the very extent
of the crease outside the wicket and whose bowling has naturally or
otherwise this leg side biasit can hardly be called twist in fast
bowlingis a particularly awkward customer for the batsman There is
such a constant tendency and inclination for the ball to keep going
farther away to the off side both before and after its pitch that
the greatest care must be exercised by the batsman to prevent himself
playing inside the ball and putting it up either to point third man
or shortslip A fast ball that comes in from the leg side is the most
difficult ball that has to be played assuming its good length There
have been very fewtoo fewfast righthanded bowlers who have been
able to manage this ball but there are many instances of lefthanded
men who have attained to great accuracy with it The late Fred Morley
of Nottingham and Emmett of Yorkshire are instances

About thirty years ago there were numerous good fast bowlers who used
to get the leg bias on the ball in the following way They bowled round
the wicket and delivered the ball from about the height of the hip
the backs of the fingers were presented to the batsman before and at
the moment of delivery the result being that the ball had on it a
slight amount of what in slow bowling we have described as legbreak
This was a useful style and it is a pity that it has almost altogether
died out at the present day

It is quite impossible to say with any certainty what essentials are
necessary in fast bowling before it can be ranked as firstclass so
very much depends on whether the action is easy or difficult for the
batsman to see By the word see is meant whether the pace and pitch
of the ball at the moment of delivery can be instantly gauged by the
batsman or not Given equal straightness pace and command over the
ball in every respect the bowler who has an action which it is easy
to see cannot compare with the man who from some peculiarity in the
movements of his body at the moment of delivery has an action which
is not easy to see Now it is a very difficult task to lay down any
rules or reasons why some bowlers are easier to see than others but
after a good deal of consideration on this subject the writer has come
to the conclusion that the bowlers who do not present a square front
to the batsman when the ball is delivered but who stand sideways or
half turned are as a rule the most difficult to judge The hand
comes then from behind the body and is often not plainly seen till
the very latest moment before delivery There may be and no doubt
are many mannerisms in bowlers which have their effect but the above
suggestion will probably be found to contain a good sound working rule
Take Giffen the Australian almost as much of his back as his front
was visible to the batsman when he delivered the ball and his bowling
was most difficult to seeat any rate until the batsman was thoroughly
well set Perhaps the best English batsmen have made more bad and
utterly mistimed strokes off Giffen than off any other modern bowler
Spofforth may have bowled more men out but Giffen certainly was the
cause of more misjudged and uppish strokes due in all probability to
the fact of his bowling being so difficult to see

Illustration Low delivery

The best bit of bowling the writer ever recollects playing against was
in the second innings of the Gentlemen of England v Australians at
Lords in  It was Giffens day and a batsman had to have luck
on his side if he succeeded in staying in long enough to appreciate
the beauty of the bowling Take Peate and Emmett the two Yorkshire
lefthanders both in their day the best bowlers in Englandboth these
men stand sideways to the batsman when they deliver the ball and both
are most difficult to see Palmer the Australian bowled very nearly
quite square his bowling was very easy to see and to judge and the
more credit is therefore due to him for being such a successful bowler
There is no doubt a greater difficulty in attaining to perfect length
and command over the ball when the body of the bowler is not square at
the moment of delivery but if these essentials to good bowling are
obtained by patience and constant practice the bowler has this great
advantage that his balls are more difficult for the batsman to judge
accurately It seems strange that not one of the numerous published
books on cricket has ever suggested the advantage to the bowler which
is obtained in this way In almost every one of these works great
stress is laid upon the necessity of the bowler presenting a full face
to the opposite wicket at the moment the ball leaves the hand It is
doubtless easier for a beginner to bowl straight if he adopts this
style of bowling but if he can once gain straightness by the other
viz the sideways style he has enlisted a great help to success

W G Grace is however an exception to this rule He delivers the
ball perfectly square with the batsman and yet we suppose that to
a batsman who meets him for the first time his bowling is about as
difficult to see and to judge as that of any bowler ever was It is a
fact that his bowling is invariably fatal to men he has not met before
This is owing to the hovering flight that his action imparts to the
ball The first time the writer ever played against W G Graces
bowling was at Cambridge in  and on the way to the wickets he
was greeted with the cheering cry Ill get you out I always get
youngsters out and surely enough he did caught and bowled for two or
thereabouts What the champion did next morning showed that he was as
generous and kind to young cricketers as he was skilful in the game He
took the writer to the nets prior to the beginning of the second days
play and saying that youngsters required to know his bowling before
being at home with it he proceeded to bowl for quite twenty minutes
to him a comprehension of his method was thus gained and the result
was an addition to the Cambridge score of some forty odd in the second
innings Few latterday cricketers would do this

Perhaps one of the reasons why W G Grace is so deadly to young
cricketers is this the batsman seeing an enormous man rushing up
to the wickets with both elbows out great black beard blowing on
each side of him and a huge yellow cap on the top of a dark swarthy
face expects something more than the gentle lobbedup ball that does
come he cannot believe that this babylooking bowling is really the
great mans and gets flustered and loses his wicket W G Grace is
certainly enormous and a year or two ago at Lords an amusing remark
might have been overheard on this subject The England v Australia
match was being played W G walked out into the field side by side
with Briggs of Lancashire the latter as is well known being very
small perhaps hardly up to W Gs elbow A small child of about five
was in the pavilion with his father and said Father who is that big
man Thats Dr Grace the champion said the papa and Who is the
little one the child continued That is Briggs Dead silence for a
few moments and then Papa is Briggs Dr Graces baby

Although power of pace straightness and command over the ball are
the really essential qualities of good fast bowlingas indeed of
all sortsthere are many occasions when fortune smiles upon bowling
which possesses none of these good attributes And it is for this
reason we think that every cricketer should be able to bowl when
called upon to do so by his captain Every man who has played cricket
has bowled at a net and he certainly has an action which is different
from everybody elses As a rule men who are not considered regular
bowlers can send the ball in somehow or other at a fairly fast pace
more or less straight and these unknown wild and erratic bowlers
often succeed in getting rid of wellset batsmen who have defied all
the efforts of the recognised bowlers of the side There are numerous
instances of a side being deeply indebted to a bowler who never
before nor afterwards showed the slightest ability to get wickets
In Australia in  when Ivo Blighs English team was playing
combined Australia on a certain occasion two of the best Australian
batsmenMurdoch and Bannermanseemed immovable They had been in
for about an hour and every one of the regular English bowlers had
been on and off A suggestion was made to try C F H Leslie Now
this gentleman with all his great merits was never even in the
estimation of his best friends a great bowler But on he went with
pleasure as every cricketer should when ordered The first ball was a
very fast one rather wide the second ditto but the third oneAh
the thirdwas a head ball designed after the manner of Spofforths
best and it pitched on the middle of Murdochs middle stump The next
comer was Horan at that time the reputed best player of fast bowling
in the Colonies A very fast longhop wide on the off side was
prettily cut straight into Barlows hands at third man and Mr Leslie
had secured two wickets for no runs He continued for another over or
two had Bannerman beautifully stumped by Mr Tylecote off a fast wide
halfvolley on the leg side and then retired in favour of one of the
regular bowlers after having simply by wild erratic fast delivery
lowered three of the best Australian wickets We give this as an
example of the principle that every cricketer should try to bowl and
if he finds that he cannot attain to any efficiency even with constant
practice then let him try to sling in as hard as ever he possibly
can he will often be of use to his side when in a fix

Before leaving the subject of fast bowling a word must be said about
whatsome years ago and again nowmay be called the great cricket
bugbear of the last few yearsviz throwing It is worthy of notice
that when overarm bowling was first allowed a great outcry arose
and there were not wanting those who prophesied that this hand over
head style would ultimately result in a mere overhand throwa kind
of pelting with a little mannerism or flourish to disguise it Now
it is an astonishing thing that in a great variety of cases this is
just what actually has happened Some of the bowling that has been
allowed to pass unnoticed by umpires is well described by the phrase
quoted but although this is so there are many minor offenders whom
all would like to see pulled up short not out of any illwill to them
personally but in the interests of the game Now throwing is most
pernicious to cricket and is calculated if allowed to increase as it
surely will unless promptly suppressed by the authorities backed by
public opinion to exercise a most disastrous effect on the game The
subject of throwing is sometimes poohpoohed by prominent cricketers
who have remarked What does it matter whether a man bowls or throws
If it makes no difference by all means let the MCC at once expunge
the rule relating to throwing and jerking But let us pause for a
moment to see if there are any reasons to suppose that it does make a
difference There are in truth two very good reasons why throwing
should be stopped First if it were allowed it would seriously
interfere with the art of bowling The reasons for this proposition are
as follows In throwing there is no scope for dissimilarity of style
All men who throw must from the very nature of the delivery send the
ball on its course with exactly the same description of spin It is
impossible for a thrower to make the ball go across the wicket from
the leg to the on side every ball which leaves a throwers hand has
the offside spin on it and none other is possible Any style which
tends to cramp bowling as this does must be bad Again a throwing
bowler cannot change his pace as other bowlers do he dare not bowl the
slow highdropping ball so successfully used by Spofforth and others
because he knows that when his arm and wrist move slowly the unfair
jerk of the wrist and elbow will be more manifest than when it is
partially concealed by the usual quick movement of his arm If throwing
tends to cramp bowling as it does and render certain essentials for
the development of the science impossible then it must be injurious
to the game Secondly if throwing were allowed the batsman would
be in a position of considerable danger Many cricketers say Let
throwers alone they are always easy to play and this no doubt is
so for the reasons given above especially when every thrower must
for the sake of appearances adopt some slight measure of disguise in
his action but once let it be recognised that throwing is part of the
game and a race of sturdy chuckers will spring up whose pace will be
so terrific that the best and pluckiest batsman will not be able to
defend his body much less his wicket against their lightninglike
deliveries Imagine what it would be if Bonnor or Forbes or Game
were to be allowed to throw all of them having thrown in their best
days as much as  yardsis it likely that a batsman at a distance
of only twentyone yards could be quick enough with his bat to stop
such bowling Even with an ordinary fast bowler a batsman has sometimes
difficulty in preventing himself from being struck by the ball and
with an undisguised thrower the danger would be tenfold

The question then arises what can be done to stop the throwing
nuisance And it is one which every member of the cricketloving
community should ask himself It is a question of the greatest
difficulty as is evident from the fact that the committee of the
MCC have so far found it impossible to legislate with regard to
the nuisance The committee has done everything in its power it
has instructed the umpires to watch closely the delivery of every
doubtful bowler and probably the umpires have acted fully up to their
instructions but they have stopped here and absolutely refused to
report to the world the result of their careful observations It is a
fact that of late years no professional umpire in a firstclass match
has noballed a professional bowler for throwing This is not to be
wondered at professional umpires themselves have been professional
bowlers and they cannot bring themselves to take the bread out of the
mouth of one of their own class by noballing him and stigmatising him
at once and for ever as a thrower

We cannot get amateur umpires to stand these would no doubt
fearlessly noball any unfair bowler but if we could we should
probably find that the quantity of bad decisions in the course of
the year would be greatly increased An umpire wants practice and
experience in keeping his attention and whole mind fixed impartially on
the game and this can only be acquired by those who stand day after
day in that capacity

The only way then to our mind to stop throwing as the MCC
cannot and the umpires will not is to get public opinion to step in
and sweep it off our cricket grounds Let every amateur cricketer
whether he plays for his county or his village club set his face
resolutely against the evil and do his utmost to discourage it If an
AntiThrowing Society could be established amongst cricketers we
firmly believe it would effect its object

In the North of England where the game is ever increasingly popular
there are many chuckers to be met with The clubs who do not possess
to say the least a doubtful bowler are we should say from our
experience in the minority Young professional bowlers see the general
laxity that prevails and adopt the peculiar flick of the wrist and
elbow hoping thereby to get more twist on the ball and this sooner
or later develops into a throw Young bowlers of this description get
drafted from their village clubs into the county team and thereby
augment the number of doubtful bowlers in firstclass matches Now if
every amateur stood out against this system and even went so far as to
say I will not be one of a team that wins its matches by such means
unfair bowling would soon die out

It may be accepted as an absolute truth that the greatest bowlers
do not throw and never have Spofforth Turner Palmer Lohmann
Richardson Morley and a host of others are true bowlers and to the
credit of the Australians it may be said that till  when Jones and
McKibbin came over there had been no suspicion against any Colonial
bowler and it is a matter of great regret that both Jones and McKibbin
must be described as very great offenders in the matter of throwing

Illustration Doubtful delivery

It will be well for everyone to realise that if this question is
allowed to drift on from year to year without any serious protest from
public opinion it will become absolutely necessary for the committee
of the MCC to do something in the matter What this should be is as
we have said very doubtful and many and varied would be the opinions
of competent judges as to the form of legislation that would meet
the evil It can almost be taken for granted that it is impossible
satisfactorily to define a throw and even if this were not so the
solution of the question would be no nearer as there would be just the
same difficulties in the way of an umpire saying that a bowler came
within the definition as there is now in saying that he throws What
is wanted is to get rid of throwers in small club and village matches
and then we should never get them drafted into firstclass cricket If
the umpire at either end were allowed to noball we believe the system
of throwing would receive a serious blow It often happens that the
thrower can only bowl at his own umpires end if he attempted it at
the other end he knows what would await him and if both umpires had
the right to noball for throwing this difficulty would be overcome
by his not being able to bowl at either end It is however earnestly
to be hoped that no change of any sort in the rules will be necessary
but that all true cricketers will unite in discountenancing that which
is always a source of wrangling and dispute

Before leaving the subject of fast bowling a few remarks on the
position of the field will not be out of place Every bowler who is
worth his salt knows much better than anyone else how the field should
be placed to his bowling So much depends upon the style and favourite
strokes of the batsman to be dislodged and the mode of attack that is
going to be brought into requisition that the general rules we suggest
here are more as a guide to young fast bowlers than to those who have
gained their experience To a fast over the wicket roundarm bowler on
a true wicket the field should be placed as on page

              The field for a fast rightarm bowler

Should the bowler however be one who changes his pace to slow and
relies occasionally on quite a slow head ball it will be as well to
bring shortleg halfway between the umpire and the bowler and put
midon out deep in the field on the on side On no occasion should
shortslip be dispensed with he should on a fast wicket be fairly
fine and if he is a quick active man with his hands as he should
be for this post about eight yards from the wicket The object of
shortslip is to pick up snicks which just miss the wicketkeeper and
although he may hold a larger proportion of these quick snap catches
when a long way from the wicket he will get an infinitely greater
number when closer in consequently if he is a man of quick sight and
tenacious hand he will actually secure more catches close in although
at the same time he may miss more The positions of longleg third
man shortleg and midon depend to a great extent on the batsmans
play It is a golden rule never to do without a point and coverpoint
although in some instanceseg when a strong cutting batsman is in
on a fast wicketit is sometimes advisable to place point in front
of the wicket and coverpoint square It is however but seldom that
this is necessary and many cricketers always view the change with some
misgiving as to its correctness because a good active coverpoint in
the usual place saves a large number of runs and probably gets more
catches than any other man in the field with the exception of the
wicketkeeper and shortslip

A round the wicket fast bowler requires the field in much the same
position But in his case it is sometimes necessary to have an extra
man on the leg side as these bowlers are very apt to bowl between
the legs and the wicket which means with good batsmen that they get
played on to the leg side between midon and shortleg If this change
is necessary longleg may be sent almost to the boundary very fine
behind the wicket and longstop be brought on to the leg side A very
fine longleg prevents boundary byes and generally manages to save the
fine longleg boundary hits Unless there is a firstclass man behind
the stumps however this generally results with firstclass bowling
in rather too many extras to justify its continuance Fast lefthand
bowlers want more men on the off side as from the nature of their
bowling they get more punished in that direction than anywhere else
If fast lefthand bowling is accurate and straight longleg is usually
dispensed with and in fact midon as well is often taken to the
other side of the wicket leaving shortleg who is brought forward a
few yards the only man on the leg side of the wicket Then there is an
unbroken line of fielders on the off side which the batsman finds it
difficult to break through if it is composed of active and energetic
men The way in which fast lefthanded bowlers place their field is
usually as on page

                                BOWLER

            The field for a fast leftarm bowler

There is a class of fast lefthand bowlers who require more men on the
on sideviz those who give the ball the leg side bias on delivery
which to a righthanded batsman causes the ball to come in from
the off side or as it is usually termed to come with the arm It
is often necessary with this style of bowling to have a very fine
shortleg to stop the snicks and leg byes which are caused by the
batsman playing outside the ball Then a shortleg by the umpire is
necessary and also a midon making three on the on side Mr Appleby
of Lancashire is an example of this style of bowler as is Wright of
Kent who at times is most deadly with the ball coming with the arm
especially if he has any assistance from the lie of the ground We have
occasionally seen a leftarm bowler like Emmett of Yorkshirewho
relies exclusively on the off break which to a righthanded batsman
brings the ball from leg to offinvoluntarily send down a ball that
instead of taking the bias imparted to it for some strange and
unaccountable reason went the other way an accident which places the
batsman in a most awkward fix

Some bowlers experience great difficulty in bowling to lefthanded
batsmen The necessary alteration in their style seems to worry them
and interfere with their accuracy of pitch Usually a slow bowler tries
to get a lefthanded batsman caught on the off side He places most of
his men on this side and bowls the off break or as it would be to
a lefthanded batsman the legbreak with the object of getting the
batsman to play inside the ball and thus make an upstroke In short
he places the men as a lefthanded bowler places them when bowling to
a righthanded batsman Lefthanded batsmen are notoriously strong and
powerful in their off hitting and consequently in this direction must
the bait be laid As a rule lefthanded batsmen are apt to be a trifle
wild and unable to restrain their keenness to hit and consequently
they pay the usual penalty of attempting to hit widish off balls
going away from them But occasionally a bowler meets a lefthander
who is too wide awake and too good a batsman thus to throw away his
chance of scoring and then different tactics must be employed There
have been and are wonderfully few really good lefthanded batsmen
in England and the chance of a bowler having to meet one of them is
very slight Between the years  and  there were only in first
class cricket the late W Scotton of Notts and Peel of Yorkshire and
the late F M Lucas The best of this class was perhaps F M Lucas
whose early death in India will always be deeply regretted by his wide
circle of friends He was really an accomplished batsman with good
sound defence and great punishing powers A slow bowler might bowl for
hours on the off side to him with the sole result of seeing four after
four being despatched all along the ground to the boundary Moses of
Sydney has many times distinguished himself against our English teams
in Australia and was an excellent batsman At the present time we
have Ford Clement Hill and Darling the Australians and the two last
are probably the two finest lefthanded batsmen the world has seen
Ford as a hitter was perhaps the hardest lefthander that ever lived
and Hewett a few years ago was almost as hard Bruce the Australian
is a fine free lefthanded batsman and certainly has a more graceful
and finished style than any other lefthander we have yet seen In
our opinion when a really good lefthander comes in one who is not
likely to get himself out on the off side by careless hitting an
attack should be made on his legstump Most lefthanders are good
leghitters but we have never yet seen one not excepting those above
named who was as good on the legstump as a firstclass righthanded
batsman There is an awkwardness apparent in the lefthanders play
to a ball pitching on the legstump or just inside it and there is
always a great likelihood of a cross bat being used for a leg hit
Many and many a time has the writer after trying the offball trick
unsuccessfully against one of these batsmen succeeded in dismissing
him by bowling over the wicket at the legstump and between the legs
and legstump of the batsman This manuvre only entails a couple of
men being brought across from the off side to stop the rungetting

There is one species of ball which we have not discussed deadly as it
is both in fast and slow bowling This is the ball which after the
pitch never rises but shoots along the surface of the ground and
is commonly called a shooter The reason why no notice was taken of
this when the different kinds of ball which may be bowled were being
dealt with is because no amount of practice or skill can enable a
bowler to bowl thus It depends for existence upon inequalities in the
ground There are some grounds which have acquired great reputation for
supplying shooters for the benefit of bowlers but this reputation is
unfortunately always accompanied by one for being lumpy and dangerous
Not a great many years ago Lords used to be celebrated for shooters
owing to its rough condition and even now well looked after as it is
shooters are of more frequent occurrence there than on most other good
grounds Although it is not in the power of any man to bowl shooters
at will still there is no doubt that men with a low delivery have a
greater chance of being helped by a shooter than men who bowl with a
high overhead action The writer recollects at Cambridge about 
or  being told by a young professional bowler engaged at the
University ground at that time that he had found out how to bowl
shooters He was a bowler of considerable promise and had begun to
make his mark in county cricket but it being known that his cricket
abilities far exceeded his intellectual powers the announcement of
this wonderful discovery was received with some amount of doubt
However out he came to bowl to prove his prowess with the celebrated
shooter but it simply appeared that instead of bowling with an
overhead delivery which was his wont he bent his body quite low and
proceeded to bowl in a manner which was hardly removed from genuine
underhand It is unnecessary to say that there were no shooters His
balls kept low after the pitch because his action was low

There is one style of bowling sometimes seen in the present day that
has not been mentioned viz fast underarm This is of two kinds
first that which pitches a good length as with roundarm bowling
secondly sneaks or bowling that pitches near the bowlers hand and
travels along the ground till the ball reaches the batsman The latter
can never be of any avail against a good player on a decent wicket as
every ball can be met by the forward stroke and rendered harmless In
country matches it is amusing to see the batsmen holding their bats
in the air and trying to pounce down at the very last moment on these
balls This mode of playing such bowling is essentially incorrect and
would even be likely to cause the downfall of a good batsman it is as
certain as anything can be at cricket that a good forward straight bat
cannot miss a sneak Mr C I Thornton at one time attempted this
style of bowling and was known to get a wicket or two The goodlength
fast underarm when bowled round the wicket with a good leg twist on
might be made very dangerous The old style of low roundarm mentioned
a few pages back was very similar to this style of bowling and was
bowled with the same object as this has in view viz catches in the
slips and on the off side We only know of one fast underarm leg
twist goodlength bowler and he does not play in firstclass cricket
His name is Bunch an old sergeant of the Black Watch well known on
many military cricketgrounds all over England and India Some years
ago he was decidedly a good bowler his balls came very fast pitched
good length on the legstump and having lots of leg stuff on wanted
very careful play

And now after having discussed the different styles of bowling known
in cricket let us consider some of the main rules which must guide
the action of every bowler in the field The first and chief principle
that a young bowler must master is that he is bowling for his sides
success and not for his own and that with that object in view he
has voluntarily placed himself under the leadership of his captain
He must therefore give in at once and readily to every order A
captain is always ready to hear the suggestions of a bowler and as
a rule with regard to placing the field is always willing to adopt
them but should he not do so the bowler must accept the decision
with the best grace possible There is nothing more discouraging and
demoralising to a side than a sulky bowlerie one who gets angry
when spoken to and subsequently adopts a defiant manner towards his
captain This bowler is usually a very poor stamp of sportsman but
unfortunately he may often be seen and the marks by which he may be
recognised are First bowling wildly and much faster than usual
Secondly getting to his place at the end of his over after everyone
else Thirdly if he fields a ball throwing at the wicket instead
of to the wicketkeeper as hard as he can generally causing an
overthrow Fourthly if he misses a ball in the field standing still
and allowing some more remote fielder to run after it or else running
after it himself at about the same pace as if he were just starting on
a fivemile race He is a great nuisance generally in the game We do
not deny that circumstances often arise when one is bowling that tax to
the utmost the temper of the mildest man in the world it is to say
the least very irritating to try for half an hour to get a man caught
out by a particular stroke off a particular ball and then at the end
see the ball bowled the stroke made and the catch missed but as
chance enters to a great extent into the game the bowler ought to do
his very utmost to curb his feelings in the interests of others who
are taking part in the game

A bowler should be ready to take any place in the field when he is
not bowling In these days when slow bowling is frequently on at
both ends there is often a difficulty in getting four men to do the
outfielding A bowler should not object at all to help his side by
doing this outcountry work Although a great specialist in the field
such as an excellent coverpoint or point is always an object of
admiration more admirable still are men good at all places W G
Grace A N Hornby and many others we could mention were at one time
equally safe and at home in any position where they were placed

A bowler should never grumble aloud at catches being missed the
unfortunate man has done his best and failed and any censure only
makes him more flurried and adds to his discomfiture without doing any
good

A golden rule for every bowler to observe isafter the batsman has
played the ball get back to the wicket as quickly as possible
Neglect of this rule loses many a run out If a bowler does not
get back to his wicket there is no one to take the ball and knock
the bails off should the batsmen run and the ball be returned to the
bowlers end When the ball is thrown up the bowler should not take it
till it has just passed the wicket he should then seize and sweep the
ball into the stumps in one and the same action Should he stand behind
and take the ball before it reaches the wicket there is great danger
of his disarranging the bails before he gets the ball in his hands Of
course there are exceptions to this ruleeg when a ball is coming
very slowly up to the wicket from a feeble throw or because the ground
is sticky and dead then the bowler must do his best anyhow to get the
ball into the stumps before the batsman reaches the crease

A bowler should never throw the ball at the wicket unless it is the
only possible chance of running the batsman out There is always a
chance of the ball slipping out of his hand and missing its aim

A bowler should take plenty of time between each ball he delivers If
he hurries he will get flurried and out of breath and bowl badly

It is a mistake for a bowler to appeal unless he has a good chance of
getting a favourable decision Umpires are very peculiar individuals
once let it enter their heads that a bowler is trying to jockey a
decision out of them up go their backs and they suddenly become a
mechanical toy that glibly answers every appeal with the two words Not
out and those only A bowler is quite justified in appealing for a
leg before wicket even if he is himself doubtful and uncertain as to
whether the ball pitched quite straight or would have quite hit the
wicket since he is exceedingly likely not to form a correct impression
of its straightness from the fact of his being at the moment of the
pitch of the ball a little out of the straight line between the wickets

Bowlers should always take care before a match that they are shod with
good stout shoes with plenty of nails in them It is a most important
thing for a bowler to have shoes which will prevent him from slipping
and this is somewhat difficult when grounds are so constantly changing
from hard to soft For a hard ground nothing is better than big nails
or screws these do not go into the ground but grip it and give a firm
foothold The left shoe of a righthand bowler and the right shoe of a
lefthand one should be extra well supplied with nails because in the
act of bowling the whole weight of the body comes down upon the left
foot with the righthand bowler and the right with a lefthand one

For a soft ground the oldfashioned spikes are the best They can be
put in and taken out in a few minutes before the beginning of a match
according to the state of the ground Every bowler should carry spikes
nails and screws a screwdriver and gimlet in his cricketbag

A bowler should do all in his power to prevent cutting up the wicket
with his feet in a place where bowling from the other end may pitch If
he finds that he is doing so with either foot he should at once change
sides of the wicket and if he then finds that do what he will he
cannot help damaging the wicketwhich is a most unlikely eventhe
should at once desist from bowling If the ground is unduly cut up and
made artificially difficult for the batsman by bowlers feet whether
it is done intentionally or not such bowling is unfair and should at
once be stopped Spofforth in some states of the ground used to spoil
it terribly and this although he wore no spikes on the offending
foot The side of this foot however came down with great force a few
yards in front of his own wicket No doubt great damage at times was
caused to the opposing batsmen by this unfortunate foot and also to
the Australian batsmen themselves and on one occasion an appeal was
made to the umpire as to whether though caused unintentionally it was
or was not unfair The umpire declined to give an opinion But there
can be little doubt that a bowler who has unfortunately developed this
tendency is transgressing the rules of fair cricket

A chapter on bowling would not be complete without the addition of some
rules for the guidance of those who are beginning to play cricket and
who want to learn how to bowl Success depends so much upon the natural
action of the bowler that the multiplicity of rules so often laid down
for the guidance of young bowlers though followed out to the letter
does not greatly profit the aspirant to bowling honours There are many
straight accurate bowlers who can put as much twist as most men on the
ball and who yet never attain to any eminence in the art This is due
to their action being simple and easy to see and to their consequent
inability to deceive the batsman as to the pace and flight of the ball
There are however one or two simple elementary rules which it would
be always as well for young bowlers to follow

FirstTake every opportunity of bowling at imitation cricket with
a racquet or fives ball or any other sort of ball This teaches you
by practical experience the difference in the spins of the ball and
what constitutes a good ball Small cricket with a fives ball and a
fives bat is splendid fun and has initiated many a youngster into the
mysteries of breakbacks and breaks from leg

SecondlyKeep your arm as high as possible

ThirdlyIf naturally inclined to be a fast bowler aim at
straightness first of all and take care to bowl well within your
strength

FourthlyAlways bowl in the same style and action Bowl every day
in practice but not for more than half an hour And take a rest of a
minute or so after every six balls remember in a match you have a rest
after every four or five Bowl carefully in practice If you get tired
leave off at once If you find your bowling is getting worse instead of
better leave off for a few days and have a complete rest

FifthlyTake a good long run whether you bowl slow or fast and if
you can run on a little after delivering the ball This gives extra
fire to the ball

SixthlyBe sure to practise bowling both sides of the wicket

SeventhlyIf you want to become a really good bowler accustom your
fingers early to get as much twist as possible on the ball both ways




CHAPTER IV

CAPTAINCY

BY A G STEEL


Illustration Going in

It is a strange fact connected with cricket that a good captain is
but seldom met with The game has made such progress in popularity
during the last thirty years and the numbers of those who are
proficient in its different branches have increased so enormously that
we should certainly expect to find in our county and other important
matches captains who thoroughly understand the duties they are called
upon to fulfil But on looking round we are disappointed to find that
the really good captains in firstclass including of course county
cricket are extremely few and these few are amateurs The cause of
this may be that few men are able to take part in firstclass cricket
after they have served such an apprenticeship as would give them the
experience calmness and judgment necessary for the difficult post of
captain or it may be that the qualifications for a good leader in the
cricketfield are from their very nature seldom met within other
words that a captain is born not made and very seldom born too Few
professional cricketers it is a wellknown fact make good captains
we have hardly ever seen a match played where a professional cricketer
was captain of either side in which he was not guilty of some very
palpable blunders Take the Gentlemen v Players matches at Lords
and the Oval for the last twenty years the Players have always been
seriously handicapped by the want of a good captain though Shrewsbury
and Gunn may be exceptions Bowlers are kept on maiden after maiden
without the faintest chance of a wicket no originality of attack
is ever attempted and altogether the captaincy is usually bad It
must however be admitted that professional captains are in a more
difficult position than amateurs inasmuch as they are often exposed
to the but thinly concealed murmurings of their fellows who consider
that they have not been treated with the amount of consideration they
deserve Amateurs always have made and always will make the best
captains and this is only natural An educated mind with a logical
power of reasoning will always treat every subject better than one
comparatively untaught There are exceptions to every rule and Alfred
Shaw the best professional captain we ever came across is the
exception here The disastrous effects of bad captaincy on the success
of a side were never more clearly manifested than by the Australian
team that visited England in  This team contained several good
bowlers who helped by the sticky state of the ground were very deadly
to our best batsmen Their batting was rough and rather untutored
but still at times dangerous They met with great success until the
grounds got hard and firm when their bowlers were collared It is in
adversity at cricket as in the more serious walks of life that the
best qualities come to the fore and whenever the Australian bowlers
were collared the whole team seemed to go to pieces Either the
captain or the bowlers placed the fielders in the most extraordinary
and unheardof positions where they had but little chance of saving
runs or getting catches Spofforth during one match at Lords in that
season bowled the greater part of the day to a batsmanthe Hon Edward
Lytteltonwho was not dismissed till he had topped his hundred Ball
after ball was neatly cut on the hard true ground to the boundary
past the spot where third man ought to have been but was not Fancy a
fast bowler bowling on a hard ground while a batsman made a hundred
without a third man then think that this batsman was one of the
finest amateur cutters of his day and you will wonder what had become
of the management of the side This was however the first year the
Australians visited us on many subsequent occasions we found out to
our cost that they had made good use of their time and experience in
England and had improved in every branch of the game to what was to
an Englishmans eye an alarming extent Their captaincy however has
never been good till Trott a thoroughly good captain took command in
 Murdoch of course had a thoroughly sound knowledge of the game
but his better judgment was too frequently hampered by the ceaseless
chattering and advice of one or two men who never could grasp the fact
that in the cricketfield there can only be one captain

The chief qualifications for a good captain are a sound knowledge of
the game a calm judgment and the ability to inspire others with
confidence

Bad captains may be split up into three classes

 Nervous and excitable men

 Dull apathetic men

 Bowling captains with an aversion to seeing anybody bowl but
themselves

 The nervous and excitable class is perhaps the worst of all and
sides which have the misfortune to be led by one of this division are
indeed heavily handicapped The chief peculiarity of a captain of this
sort is that he seems never to be able to keep still for a moment in
the field He is continually rushing about altering the field every
over without any reason shouting excitedly at the top of his voice
whenever a fielder has to stop or throw up the ball and generally
creating a feeling of uneasiness and excitement among players and
spectators He is at one moment tearing his hair distractedly because
some unfortunate fielder has let a ball through his legs and the next
shouting and dancing with excitement and joy when some exceptionally
good catch or bit of fielding has got rid of a dangerous batsman

 A member of the second class may be easily recognised He walks
slowly to his place at the end of each over with his eyes fixed on the
ground as if in deep thought In reality he is thinking of nothing
or at any rate nothing connected with the game He has put his two
best bowlers on and so long as a wicket falls every thirty or forty
runs what does it matter whether or not time is being wasted by a
series of profitless shortpitched maiden overs It is the bowlers
duty not his to get the batsmen out and if the latter put on forty
runs without a wicket falling why it will be time enough then to try
someone else and perhaps later on he himself might have a turn with
lobs if things get into a very bad state It does not take long with a
captain like this for a side to get thoroughly demoralised and slack

 The bowling captains suffer from the very opposite of the
feebleness which affects the last class overkeenness is their bane
They are generally moderate bowlers who at times enjoy a fair amount
of success and who are often very valuable to their side as changes
But the power of bowling wherever and for as long as they please is too
much for them Over after over hit to all parts of the field without
the slightest suspicion of a chance of a wicket only convinces the
selfconfident captain that something must happen sooner or laterand
something generally does after the match has been bowled away The
fascination that bowling has for captains and the danger it often leads
to is a good reason for pausing before selecting as captain anyone
who has any pretensions in this branch of the game It is sometimes
however impossible for a side to recognise anyone as captain except
a bowler He may be the oldest and most experienced member of the
team or perhaps from his position as a cricketer it may be out of
the question to pass him over and then of course the best of a bad
job must be made But a captain who is also a bowler has much heavier
responsibilities in the field than one who is not Even if he happens
not to be overanxious about trundling all day himself he is apt from
shyness and diffidence of his own merits not to put himself on at
allanother extreme into which some captains before now have fallen

The duties of a captain are of two kinds those out of the field and
those in it and it is proposed to discuss them in the order named
The first duty of a captain is the choice of his team but as it so
frequently happens nowadays that the team is chosen for him by the
committee of his county or his club this topic may be passed over till
we discuss the duties of the captains at the Universities and Public
Schools

When the team is chosen the captains first duty is to win the toss
and assuming that by the aid of his lucky sixpence he has succeeded
in so doing he should at once decide whether he or his opponent is
to begin the batting It is a very old saying that the side that wins
the toss should go in and it is a very true one No captain who wins
the toss and puts the other side in deserves to win the match unless
there are some very exceptional circumstances to be taken into his
consideration There is perhaps only one reason to justify a captain
putting the other side in first If the ground previously hard has
been softened by a nights rain and if at the time of beginning it is
drying under a hot baking sun and if the captain is tolerably sure
that it is going to be a fine day then he will do well to put the
other side in There must be present these three conditions of ground
and weather before he is justified in refusing to bat The ground
will then for the first hour and a half or two hours make a bowling
wicket the top soft in the early morning and gradually getting caked
under the hot sun will in the afternoon if the weather keeps fine
and it has been hard before the rain assume its former hardness and
become easy for batting for the last few hours of the days play If
the ground has been soft before the rain and has been made still softer
by the rain it is madness to put the other side in The first two or
three hours will then be easy for batting as a very slow soft wicket
is always against the bowlers and it will not be till after several
hours of hot sun have been on it that it will begin to get caked and
difficult for the batsman Suppose the weather looks uncertain and
broken and the glass has been gradually going down a captain should
never in any state of the ground risk putting his opponents in Rain is
always in favour of the in side bowlers cannot stand and cannot hold
the ball which wet and slippery cannot be made to take any twist or
screw that the bowler may try to give it

Sometimes in a oneday match it may be advisable to put the other side
in under circumstances different from the above circumstances which
are for the captain alone to judge of and which it is impossible to
discuss Suppose a very strong side is playing against a very much
weaker one It may be that the captain of the former is afraid that
if his side once goes to the wickets so many runs will be made as to
preclude all probability of finishing the match and he may be content
after conference with the members of his team to take the undoubted
risk of putting the other side in it is however a very dangerous
thing to do at any time and his finesse may very possibly end
disastrously to his side in the imperfect light of the evening

There are however some disadvantages in batting first In the
first place nearly every cricketer is a better man after luncheon
than before Do not let this be understood for a moment as a hint
that the overnight carousals of cricketers very pleasant though they
be are such as to interfere with correctness of eye and steadiness
of hand in the morning Far be it from me to suggest such a thing
But every man is fitter in the afternoon his eye is more accustomed
to the light and his digestion is better And besides the men that
walk to the wickets to bat the first time they go into the field are
apt to be more nervous than those who have been playing a few hours
and have got accustomed to the light and general surroundings These
are disadvantages certainly but they are as nothing compared to the
advantages gained by batting first These include getting the best
of the light the best of the wicket and last but not least the
incalculable advantage of having in the last innings of the match
to save and not get runs on a wicket that has previously stood the
wear and tear of three innings The side that bats second is nearly
always in at the close of the first days play and the lights and
shadows between six and seven often make the ball very difficult to
judge accurately at Lords especially the light gets bad towards
the close of the day a haze overspreads the ground making clear and
accurate sight extremely difficult As for the respective difficulties
of making and saving runs a cricketer need only look at his scores and
references to see how often the out side at the close of a match has
prevented the in side from getting the runs required The feeling of
responsibility which affects the batsmen on these occasions creates an
overanxiety to play steadily and run no risks and often results in
feeble play Then the bowlers and fielders are nerved to their utmost
endeavour to keep the runs down every fielder runs after the ball at
the very top of his speed halfadozen men are backing up to prevent
an overthrow and the bowler not only does all he knows to secure a
wicket but strives hard to avoid the delivery of a punishable ball
Whenever a side goes in for the last innings of the match against a big
score and wins one may feel sure the match has been won by sound and
sterling cricket There are many wellknown instances of the fielding
side pulling the match out of the fire at the very last moment In the
Oxford and Cambridge match in  Cambridge in their last innings
wanted  runs to win Seven wickets fell for  The eighth went
down at  Before this wicket fell it looked any odds on Cambridge
but the eleven were eventually all out for  and lost the match
by six runs In England v Australia at the Oval in  England
the last innings wanted  to win but only made  The annals of
cricket are full of instances showing that it is better at the end
of a match to have to save runs than make them We remember playing
in a match some years ago in Scotland where the folly of putting in
the other side first on a good wicket was clearly shown It was a two
days match and the two best batsmen on the side which lost the toss
had been travelling all night from England This in spite of a good
wicket induced the captain who had been successful in the toss to put
the other side in One of these travelworn and weary batsmen knocked
up over ninety runs the ground began to cut up and the side that
had refused to bat first came utterly to grief As the losing captain
left the ground he said One thing this match has taught menever
to put the other side in first The following year the same match
was arranged and once more the toss was won by the same captain The
ground was very soft indeed in fact sodden with days of heavy rain
Again in spite of the former sad experience the other side were put
in first and made over  runs The ground was too soft for bowlers
to put any life into the ball and all bowling was comparatively easy
Next day the ground had got firmer and more solid and the side that
won the toss was again dismissed for two insignificant totals

With regard to the order in which a captain should send in his men a
good deal depends on the strength of the batting he has at command
With a weakish batting team it is in our opinion always better to
send in the best batsman first assuming of course he has no objection
to the place It is of great importance to give the best batsman every
possible advantage and the men who go first to the wickets have a
great advantage over the others They have less waiting for their
innings and consequently less of that restless nervousness from which
few men are free they have the best of the wicket they have often
loosish bowling just at first before the bowlers have warmed to their
work and last but certainly not least they are batting a new ball
Few people realise what a difference a new ball makes to the batsman
it goes cleaner and firmer off the bat than an old one and what is
better than all a hard new ball is much more difficult to twist than
one that has had a hundred runs made off it Let anyone look at an
old bowler who has to begin the bowling his first action is to rub
the ball on the ground in the hope of taking off even a little of its
slippery newness it is not however till after its surface has been
considerably worn that it begins to take much notice of any twist at
any rate on a hard ground

With such advantages to be gained by going in first it would be a pity
not to give the best batsman the chance of making a good start for his
side A good start gives confidence to the shaky batsman and shows
the bowlers that they are not to have it all their own way Sometimes
the best batsman on a side does not care about going in first if so
it is always well to consult his wishes and humour him but he should
never go in later than second wicket With the best batsman should
go some steady correct bat one who plays the game thoroughly and does
not take liberties with the bowling In these days of perfect grounds
it is a vast mistake to send in first a regular sticker one who
scores at the rate of eight or ten an hour The stonewallers of our
cricketfields have a great deal to answer for in the heavy indictment
against modern players of leaving so many unfinished matches An
account was lately given in the papers of a man recognised as a
firstclass county bat who was in on a fast hard wicket in the first
innings of a match three hours and forty minutes for thirtytwo runs
More shame to him He did his best to draw the match and by puddling
about for so long only helped to wear out the ground for more capable
scorers who were to follow him Sometimes when the ground is very bad
it is good to have a sticker but taken altogether cricket would be
very much better off if the whole race of stickers occasionally adopted
a somewhat freer style Nobody objects to slow scoring so long as the
batsmen are playing good correct cricket playing the straight ones
with a straight bat and cutting or hitting the crooked ones but every
cricketer objects to seeing ball after ball simply stopped without the
slightest attempt to make a run

Two very fast rungetting batsmen should not be sent in together they
are apt to run each other a bit off their legs W G Grace and A P
Lucas were as good a pair for first that have ever been seen both
played sound correct cricket the former scored freely the latter when
the ground was hard quite fast enough and Shrewsbury and Stoddart were
about as good

After the first two have been selected the others must follow generally
in order of merit it is as well not to put in two hardhitters
together if possible as it often tends to make one hit against the
other First one makes a big hit the other feels bound to follow suit
quite irrespective of the pitch of the ball and loses his wicket It
is always an excellent thing to have one or two real good hitters but
they should be kept apart as far as possible in their innings sixth
or seventh wicket down is a very useful place for a hard hitter the
bowling has often begun to get a trifle loose by that time and good
hitting may make a dreadful mess of it in a very short time

If any of the bowlers on whom the captain relies for his main attack
happen to be goodish batsmen and likely to make a few runs it is just
as well to let their innings come off as early as convenient A bowler
who makes forty or fifty runs at the close of an innings never bowls
as well after the running about as he would do had he made nothing
and it is consequently best if possible to insure him a rest before he
begins his more important duties as bowler It is exceptional to find
a man successful in batting and bowling in the same match There are a
good number of modern cricketers who are very fair allround men and
shine at times in both branches of the game but it very rarely happens
that success awaits them in both in the same match Sometimes we find a
wellknown bowler piling up heaps of runs but on looking at the other
side of the scoresheet we generally perceive that he has done it at
the expense of his wickets Alfred Shaw the famous Nottingham bowler
used at times to bat with great success but when he did so he was
nearly always unsuccessful with the ball

When once the captain has arranged the order in which his men are to
bat he should stick to it It is worrying and harassing to the batsmen
to be continually shifted up and down We once saw one of the best
batsmen in England put in last but one because the captain thought
he looked nervous His side was beaten by a few runs and without
his having received one single ball An order made out before the
innings begins is more likely to be correct than one hashed and cut
about amidst excitement and anxiety Never should a captain change his
order in the second innings of course a man who is in particularly
good form may be given a hoist up a place or so but the bad bats of
the team should not be sent in first so long as there is the remotest
possibility of losing and at cricket this contingency is nearly always
on the cards The good batsmen do not wish to go in if there is only an
hour or an hour and a half to play they may get out and cannot make a
really big score so they fight shy for their averages sake Captains
should put a stop to this and insist on their taking their proper
place first because the side may otherwise be beaten and secondly
because those who have the advantage of going in first in favourable
circumstances should also take their turn when things are not so bright

After a captain has written out his order of going in he should
carefully watch the innings from the first to the very last ball
A watchful captain can at times greatly help his side a shout of
steady when a young batsman appears to be getting rash in his play
or when two players are getting a little abroad as to running often
comes with great effect and authority from a captain and may prevent
such a catastrophe as that represented in the illustration opposite
A word of encouragement to a nervous player as he leaves the pavilion
may also often be of service On no account should a captain ever abuse
a batsman no matter what rash stroke or foolish lack of judgment
has cost him his wicket Nothing is so galling to a batsman when he
has made a bad stroke or been guilty of a mistake as being publicly
derided or reproved Afterwards when the keen sense of vexation has
somewhat subsided a quiet word of advice may be given and will have
much more effect than a noisy public remonstrance A good cricketer who
has made a bad stroke and thereby lost his wicket knows better than
any spectator what a mistake he has committed Pavilion worthies ye
who love cricket for its own sake ye who sit for hours criticising
every ball and every stroke forbear we pray you outspoken remarks
on the arrival of a discomfited batsman What on earth possessed you
to try to hit a straight one to leg You never seemed at home the
whole time You cant keep that leg of yours out of the way are all
remarks that may be withheld at any rate till the keen sense of failure
has diminished

Run out

It may possibly happen that during the course of an innings a
point which during the summer of  was considerably discussed and
about which some very extraordinary remarks have been made may crop
up for decision by the captain Supposing he considers that his side
has made enough runs to win the match and that if any more are made
there will not be sufficient time to get the other side out Is he
justified or not in giving orders to his men to get out on purpose A
great controversy arose on this point about ten years ago owing to the
captain of one of our leading counties considering that he was entitled
to give such orders If this question be looked at from a cricketers
point of viewand by that is meant from one which is in every way
honourable and to the furtherance of the true interests of the gameit
will be seen at once that a captain has a perfect right to ask his men
to get out whenever he considers enough runs have been made to insure
victory

The true principle of the game is we take it that every side should
do its utmost honourably to win the match In days gone by when
grounds were rough and uneven every match had to be completed in a
much shorter time than is now allowed In these times of improved
batting and perfection in grounds three whole days have been decided
on as the time within which every county or club must win lose or
draw the match The game is not to lose or to draw it is to win and
the side that can win most matches in the time allowed is plainly
the best side And should a side make so many runs as to render it
impossible to win if they make more whereas if they get out they must
almost inevitably win and can scarcely lose we consider it would not
be acting up to the true principle of the game if it did not get out
Besides what sport or individual interest to a batsman is there in
making runs after the match is practically finished A man does not
play at cricket for himself so much as for his side it is not the
number of individual notches or wickets that falls to his lot which
delights the true cricketer it is the actual result of won or lost
What pleasure does a member of either of the University elevens derive
from making fifty every innings he plays in the InterUniversity
matches if all his matches are lost There are some who say that
directly the principle is recognised that a man has a right to get out
on purpose in order to gain victory for his side it will open the
door to all sorts of shady tricks in the game and there will be no
guarantee to the cricketloving public that a side is trying We cannot
see the relevancy of this argument if a man sacrifices himself for
his side the more honour is due to him It is suggested that if the
batting side has a right to get out or to forego its right of batting
the fielding side has a right to drop catches purposely and to bowl no
balls and wides so as to avoid being beaten If this latter course were
permitted it would be in direct contradiction to the true principle of
the gameviz the endeavour to win it would be a dishonest subterfuge
to prevent victory from rewarding the side that had played the best it
would be an unEnglish doginthemanger policy and in our opinion
it would entitle the umpires to say that the game was not being played
fairly There is a vast difference in principle between getting out
on purpose in order to win and bowling and fielding badly in order
to snatch victory from the best side A captain is then not only
perfectly justified but is bound in the interests of his side and in
the true interests of the game to order his men to get out if that is
the only way to win

In  the MCC passed a law to the effect that the side which
goes in second shall follow their innings if they have scored 
runs less not  as formerly than the opposite side in a three days
match or  runs in a two days match and power was also given for the
inside on the last day of a match to declare the innings at an end
This last most important rule was passed partly in order to prevent
drawn matches and partly to prevent cricket lapsing into burlesque as
it has on several occasions But still the true principle alluded to in
the beginning of the preceding paragraph is difficult to find and the
awkward question still remains as it is within the right of a captain
to order his men to get out that he may follow on is it not within the
opposing captains right to order his bowlers to bowl wides to prevent
the follow on The motive is the same in each case one captain desires
to follow on because he thinks that by following on he has a better
chance of winning the match the other captain is of the same opinion
is it wrong therefore for him to try and defeat that object by
bowling wides I am not able to say that it is One captain to make his
side follow on orders his batsmen to play skittles the other captain
to prevent a follow on orders his bowlers to play skittles Where is
the difference in principle There is a difference of another kind
which is that it is easier for a batsman to get out on purpose without
making it appear to be a burlesque than it is for a bowler to bowl
wides or no balls on purpose A batsman may run himself out or put his
leg in front and nobody wonders but if a steady bowler bowls three
wides running the most ignorant spectator sees through the game at
once and yells accordingly The problem may be stated in another way
Is it cricket to sacrifice runs by running yourself out or knocking
down your wicket If the answer is in the affirmative then state your
reason why it is wrong for a bowler to sacrifice runs by bowling wides
or no balls To a genuine cricketer it is equally unpleasant to see
cricket turned into burlesque by the batsmen as by the bowlers what
is difficult to understand is why the batsmen should be allowed to
practise burlesque and command the applause of the crowd while the
bowler is hooted and yelled at

The question is a most difficult one to answer and perhaps the most
satisfactory solution may be in the direction of abolishing the follow
on altogether and giving power to close the innings at any time Every
proposal has its drawbacks and the drawback to this is that it gives
an additional advantage to winning the toss but it is not easy to see
that there is any better solution of the questionR H L

In club and county matches a captain whose side is batting may often
have little duties to perform such as hurrying his men in after the
fall of a wicket and allowing no time to be wasted c There is
nothing so annoying to a keen cricketer as to see the field waiting
three or four minutes whilst some local swell calmly buckles his pads
and saunters sleepily to the wicket A captain should see that the next
batsman is always ready to go in directly the preceding one reaches the
pavilion and a good experienced captain can also give many valuable
hints to the younger members of his team as they sit waiting for their
innings Play your own game of course he is the first one to know
and realise the truth of the old saying but and there are often many
buts for goodness sake dont try and hit that curly bowler unless
you are on the pitch of him if you play back to that fast chap you
are done he is out and away faster than he looks watch that man at
cover hes as quick as lightning with his return All these little
odds and ends from an old hand are well worth the attention of a young
player they all help to give him more confidence and more knowledge
and experience and consequently make him a better cricketer And
then a captains eyes must be sharp to detect any slovenliness in the
dress of a batsman What a sorry sight it is to see a man going to
the wickets with his padstraps hanging two or three inches down his
legs his trousers unfolded and sticking out from behind his pads
his shirtsleeves hanging loose and altogether having a general air
of being a slovenly fellow A captain must note this he knows that
there are a good many better ways of getting out than being caught from
ones padstraps or loose trousers that flap gaily in the breeze or
from ones shirtsleeves that float round the forearm with so great an
expanse of canvas looking for all the world like a bishops sleeve
All these little things are worth knowing cricket is a game with a
great deal of luck in it and full of a great many odd chances and the
sooner a young player realises that he must do all he can to minimise
the chances against himself the better cricketer he will become and
the more runs he will make

The duties of a captain in the field are far more onerous than those
out of it It is here that his good qualities are tested his knowledge
and judgment of the game put to the proof The most difficult task
he has to perform is the management of the bowling It of course
occasionally happens that his two best bowlers are put on and bowl
successfully without a chance during the whole of the innings But this
is a very exceptional occurrence and is but seldom seen in firstclass
cricket and then only when the ground is sticky or crumbled It is in
the bowling changes and placing that a captains skill is principally
seen On a hard fast wicket it is best to begin with fast bowling at
one end and slow at the other A good overhand fast bowler on a hard
wicket has more chance of making the ball rise and getting catches in
the slips and at the wickets than a slow one but it is always well
to have differentpaced bowling on at either end as in this way the
batsmans eye does not get thoroughly accustomed to one pace The late
F Morleyin his day the best lefthand fast bowler in Englandand
A Shaw were always individually more successful when playing together
for their county the fast left hand and slow right being an excellent
variation for the eye of the batsman Poor Morley what a good bowler
he was In our opinion he was the best fast bowler we have had in
England for a very long time He was a good pace had a beautifully
easy lefthanded delivery just over his shoulder and was most
wonderfully accurate in his length He had a good spin and breakback
on his bowling and every now and then sent in one that came with the
arm and required a lot of playing His early death caused a great gap
in the ranks of our professionals and was much lamented by every class
of cricketers for a more honest and unassuming professional player
than Fred Morley never went into the cricketfield His knowledge of
geography was not up to his cricket capabilities for after a serious
collision in the Indian Ocean on his voyage to Australia in  a
mishap which subsequently ended fatally to him he said No more ships
for me Ill home again by the overland route

At the beginning of the innings the two bowlers put on should both be
asked which end suits them best if both want the same the captain
should give the choice to the one on whom taking into consideration
the state of the ground he relies most The field should be placed
according to the style of the opposing batsman and in doing this the
captain should act with the consent of the bowler There are many
captains who change the field from time to time without ever consulting
the bowler who if a cricketer knows better than anyone else where
his bowling is likely to be hit

No rule can be laid down with regard to the frequency of bowling
changes except the more the better A bowler should never be kept on
if he is not getting wickets and if the batsmen are playing him with
ease It goes no way towards winning a match to bowl ten or a dozen
shortpitched consecutive maiden overs Directly the batsmen seem to
have guessed the length and style of bowling it should be changed if
only for a few overs while some new style is tried for a short time
If a long stand be made every style of bowling should be quickly
tried thirty runs should never be allowed without a change of some
sort unless the bowling happens to be particularly puzzling to the
batsman and is being badly played

As regards the placing of the field it has already been said that
usually the bowler is best able to guess where his own bowling is most
likely to be hit but there are many things which a captain should
recollect as the suggestions of a captain in whom his bowlers place
confidence are always accepted readily He should keep his eye on
shortslip as this place is especially on a fast wicket the most
important of all There are more good batsmen dismissed at shortslip
and the wicket on good wickets than at any other places It is an
extraordinary fact connected with shortslip that unless he has had a
great deal of experience he is continually shifting his position one
over he will be standing fine and deep and the next square and near to
the wicket It is the captains duty even more than the bowlers to
see that this does not happen

On a true hard wicket we never like to see a captain putting his
midon or shortleg close in to the batsman to field what is called
silly midon the risk of standing near in on a hard wicket to a
batsman who can hit at all is not by any means slight and we have
on several occasions seen men placed in this position get very nasty
blows Boyle the Australian midon stood about as near in as any man
ever did stand on sticky grounds he made many catches on fast grounds
he missed many which if standing further back he would have caught He
not seldom received nasty injuries and on one occasion was laid up
for several weeks with a broken or injured bone in his hand A quick
active field at midon who will run in when he sees the batsman making
a quiet forward stroke on the leg side and when he observes a legside
ball kick up higher than usual is all that should be required In
a match at Melbourne in  we recollect a very amusing little
incident in which midon played a prominent part The Australians were
batting and Bates the Yorkshireman had just dismissed two of their
best bats McDonnell and Giffen in two consecutive balls Bonnor
who used to congratulate himself and not without a certain amount of
justification that he could make mincemeat of our slow bowling was
the next man in Somebody suggested that in the faint hope of securing
a hat for Bates we should try a silly midon Bates faithfully
promised to bowl a fast shortish ball between the legs and the wicket
and said he was quite certain Bonnor would play slowly forward to it
Acting on the faith of this W W Read boldly volunteered to stand
silly midon for one ball In came the giant loud were the shouts of
welcome from the larrikins throats now would the ball soar over the
green trees even higher than yonder flock of twittering parrots As
Bates began to walk to the wickets to bowl nearer and nearer crept
our brave midon a slow forward stroke to a fast shortish legstump
ball landed the ball fairly in his hands not more than six feet
from the bat The crowd would not believe it and Bonnor was simply
thunderstruck at midons impertinence but Bates had done the hat
trick for all that and what is more he got a very smart silver tall
hat for his pains

The duties of captains of the University teams and of the Public
Schools are far more arduous than those of a captain of a county or a
club eleven At our large Public Schools the captain is responsible for
the selection of the team he may be assisted to a certain extent by a
committee but the actual filling up of the vacant places in his eleven
generally devolves on him alone An energetic and keen boy captain will
usually manage before the close of the summer term to get together a
team of fair merit even if the stuff he has to work upon is inferior
in quality the great amount of time at his disposal for practice and
the assistance he receives from the school professionals and masters
ought always to ensure a keen captain having a tolerable eleven before
the summer holidays begin It may be taken as true that a bad fielding
school eleven denotes a bad and slack captain Whatever may be the
batting and bowling material at his disposal a boy captain can if
he likes have a good fielding side and if in his school matches
at Lords or elsewhere he finds that he loses the match by slack
fielding he has none to blame but himself None of our best county
teams can field as boys can if they are properly taught and kept up to
the mark There are few men of thirty taking part in the game who can
throw with any effect for more than about thirty or forty yards their
arms and shoulders are stiff and will not stand it whereas boys can
all throw and are about twice as active as many of those whose names
at the present time figure prominently in our leading fixtures

A school eleven as indeed every other only requires four regular
bowlers If you cannot win with four bowlers youll never win at
all is an old and true saying But this wants a little explanation
The four best available bowlers must be played without regard to their
batting powers and after these four have been selected let the team be
filled up with good batsmen and fielders quite irrespective of whether
they can bowl or not It is an excellent thing for a side that every
man should be able to bowl a bit if wanted and every boy should be
able to do so but it is only necessary in choosing the team to play
four men as bowlers only

Every school eleven should possess a lobbowler if he be a good one
so much the better but one of some sort there must be Lobs have
always been most destructive to boys and even very indifferent lobs
are occasionally very fatal to schools A little practice will teach
any boy to bowl them fairly he must take a long and rather a quick
run and bowl just fast enough to prevent the batsman hitting the
goodlength balls before they pitch The high slow lob is generally
worthless

The wicketkeeper must also be trained and coached He should be taught
the right and the wrong way to stand and should practise keeping for a
short time every day And above all things the school wicketkeeper
should know that for anything over slow and slow medium bowling he is
to have a longstop The number of good wicketkeepers who have been
spoilt by having to perform the office of longstop as well as their
own is legion There are no firstclass keepers nowadays who put out
their hands on the leg side and draw the ball to the stumps they all
jump to the leg side in front of the ball to prevent it resulting in a
fourbye and consequently even if lucky enough to take the ball with
their hands they are so far from the stumps as to make it exceedingly
difficult to knock the bails off

A captain of a University team has not so much to do with training and
coaching his team as a school captain By the time men have reached
their University eleven they have generally mastered the elementary
principles of the game and require more practice and experience
keeping up to the mark rather than coaching A captains duty is
consequently to see that his men engage in constant practice at all
parts of the game and by showing an example of keenness and energy to
inspire his team with the same qualities Some men at the University
and especially those fresh from the restraint of a public school
occasionally require a few words of advice about the mode of life
which is necessary for undergoing with success the wear and tear of a
University cricket season A Varsity team has about six weeks hard
work and no man can bear the strain of this if at the same time
he is keeping late hours and distributing his attentions impartially
amongst all the numerous delicacies that adorn the University
dinnertables during the May term No strict training is required
thank goodness Cricket does not demand of her votaries the hollow face
and attenuated frame and too often the undermined constitution that
a long term of arduous training occasionally results in especially to
a youth of unmatured strength but a cricketer should live a regular
life and abstain at table from all things likely to interfere with his
digestion and wind Above all else smoky rooms should be avoided A
small room filled with ten or a dozen men smoking as if their very
existence depended on the amount of tobacco consumed soon gets a
trifle foggy and the man who remains there for long will find next
morning on waking that his head feels much heavier than usual and his
eyes are reddish and sore A University captain should never hesitate
to speak to any of his team on these matters should he think warning
or rebuke necessary

The necessity of moderation in drink is happily a thing which few
University cricketers require to be reminded of There are many
opinions as to what is the best drink for men when actually playing
By best we mean that which does least harm to the eye In hot weather
something must be drunk and the question is What Our experience is
that beer and stout are both too heady and heavy gin and ginger beer
is too sticky sweet c to the palate In our opinion shandygaff
sherry or claret and soda are the most thirstquenching the
lightest and the cleanest to the palate The latter consideration is a
great one on a hot day at cricket In a long innings the heat and the
dust are apt to make the mouth very dry and parched and a clean drink
is especially desirable

As a rule a Varsity captain has not much difficulty in selecting the
first eight or nine of his teamthere are usually that number that
stand out as far and away better than all the othersbut the last two
or three places often cause him the greatest difficulty There may
be two or three men of the same merit fighting for the last place
inflicting sleepless nights and anxious thoughts on the captain He
cannot make up his mind and possibly remains undecided till the very
week before the big match A Varsity team owes half its strength to
playing so much together Every man knows and has confidence in the
others and every mans full merits and the use he may be to the side
are understood by the captain consequently the sooner the whole team
is chosen the better

Illustration A E STODDART

Now let us briefly discuss the considerations that should guide
the captain in the choice of his team And perhaps the simplest and
best way will be to assume that a captain has to choose the best team
in England our fictitious captain making the twelfth man on the side
The first thing he must do is to choose his bowlers and as we have
said above these must be the best four he can get each one different
from the others in style He wants a fast bowler to begin with and if
the match is to be played on a hard wicket he will probably want two
He has Mold and Lockwood to choose from undoubtedly the two best
If he wants one only he must be guided by present form whichever
is bowling the best must be selected Let us say he has selected
Mold This is No  No  must be a good lefthand bowler Peel and
Briggs are perhaps the only two at the present time who have good
qualifications and we think our captain would probably fix on Peel
as being the best bowler of the two No a mediumpace to fast
roundarm bowleris next wanted Lohmann would be the very man but
since illhealth at the present date prevents his appearance on the
field let our captain bring into his team as No  Lockwood Surely
he or Mold if not both will prove destructive No Our captain
now wants a rightarm slow bowler accurate enough to keep down the runs
if it is necessary on a hard true wicket and powerful enough with
the ball to take advantage of crumbled or sticky wickets Who is he to
take C M Wells of Surrey and Cambridge Flowers of Notts Attewell
of ditto Wainwright of Yorkshire A Hearne of Kent are all good
names The man for this place a few years ago would have been Alfred
Shaw What a fine bowler he was Perhaps his best performance was in
 when for Notts v the MCC at Lords he bowled  balls for
 runs and  wickets bother the maidens we dont care how many of
them he bowled and amongst these seven wickets were W G Grace
A W Ridley C F Buller and Lord Harris In the same match for
the MCC A W Ridley with his lobs had a good analysis for the two
innings balls  runs and  wickets Our captain thinks for
No  he cannot do better than Wainwright and we agree with him No
the wicketkeepermust be G McGregor of Cambridge and Middlesex
Alas when this chapter was written for the first edition of this
book Pilling was the wicketkeeper selected and we then expressed a
hope that his health would allow him to remain behind the stumps for
many years to come Pilling died a few years ago but those who ever
played with him will never forget the excellence of his calm and quiet
wicketkeeping nor the gentleness and courtesy which graced his whole
character No Now our captain has got to fill up six places he
has up to the present provided for getting rid of the opposite side
he now turns his attention to the selection of his batsmen W G
Grace first no one disputes Does someone suggest Shrewsbury Well
certainly during the last seven or eight seasons he has batted most
wonderfully well but for winning a match give us W G as our first
choice Shrewsbury may be the best to prevent his side being beaten
but we want to win and if one man stays in the best part of a couple
of days for  runs there is a great chance of the game being drawn
We like the man who makes  in three to four hours and then gets
out and helps to get the other side out afterwards So our captain
annexes W G as No  No  Shrewsbury No  A E Stoddart that
sound and resolute batsman who perhaps gives more pleasure to the
spectators than any other living cricketer No  Gunn No And
now having selected nine of his team our captain must consider what
he has and what he has not got His team at present consists of W G
Grace Shrewsbury A E Stoddart Gunn G McGregor Mold Lockwood
Peel and Wainwright He has therefore the four best batsmen in
EnglandGrace Shrewsbury Stoddart and Gunnthree sound firstclass
batsmen in Lockwood Peel and Wainwright a very likely rungetting
bat in McGregor and an indifferent performer in Mold He has six
bowlers the four chosen and Grace and Stoddart Now what has he in
the field Shrewsbury will have to go point that is evident as he is
a fairly good point and useless elsewhere owing to his inability to
throw Grace Mold and Lockwood must all be in places somewhere near
the wicket Grace because of advancing years and stiffened muscles the
other two because much throwing would damage their bowling We have
Stoddart and Gunn both excellent fielders and throwers and these two
must be kept for fielding in the country Peel and Wainwright are also
two good fielders but they being bowlers will not probably be wanted
for country fielding except in an emergency Taken as a whole the nine
we have already got are good fieldsmen What does our captain then want
for the tenth place As he has already got a strong batting bowling
and fielding side he must look out for a good allround cricketer
who will strengthen his team at all points He must take care not to
give either of his last two places to men who will weaken the side in
fielding above all they must be good in the field Would W W Read
do for the tenth place Unquestionably he is a magnificent batsman
but where is he to go in the field Shrewsbury is at point W W
Read would have to field elsewhere then and for the same reason as
already given for W G Grace he would seriously cripple the side if
required to go into the country as undoubtedly he would have to No
Our captain rejects W W Read and selects F S Jackson of Cambridge
University and Yorkshire as his tenth man And as he is one of our most
accomplished and resolute batsmen a fine field and thrower and a most
useful fast change bowler surely his inclusion in the team will add
strength to every department of it No The last place in the team
is a difficult task to select The same considerations must guide the
choice here as for the tenth place If another bowler were required we
would suggest Briggs or A Hearne as being good bowlers and allround
good cricketers but our captain is already playing four men to bowl
and has in addition the various changes already mentioned Is there
any really firstclass batsman who if included in the team would not
injuriously affect the fielding of the side W W Read we have already
said has to be rejected A Ward of Lancashire is the man a really
sound batsman and a good field and thrower Our captain has completed
his task and a very powerful team he has selected strong in batting
bowling fielding and throwing and indeed a difficult nut for any
Australian side to crack

Such was the selection of the first English eleven about ten years ago
but a great deal has happened since that date At the present moment
Stoddarts team in Australia have been so unsuccessful that though
when they started they were reckoned to be about our best eleven for
the honour of England it must be hoped that a better is to be found
There can be no doubt that our bowling is terribly weak weaker on good
wickets than at any previous time in cricket history and it seems that
we must go out of the beaten track of bowlers and try a change Our
representative eleven today is chosen with no great confidence and
many will unfavourably criticise the selection There is no difficulty
about the batsmen who shall be MacLaren Ranjitsinhji Gunn Abel
Jackson and Hayward and the wicketkeeper Storer but what about the
bowlers Hirst is not good enough Peel and Briggs are past their
prime and Wainwright on good wickets is harmless Richardson and
Hearne we still must select but for the last two we shall select a
veteran and a youngster Attewell shall be one and the young Essex
amateur Bull shall be the other During the last season Bull on hard
wickets showed himself to be a slow bowler with more spin than any
other bowler in England moreover he is not so well known while
Attewell bowls still the best length and can always keep runs down

One thing will be noticed here and that is that for the first time
since  W G Grace is left out of a representative English team
and the elements of a tragedy can be found here For twentynine years
he would have been chosen but the time has come at last but to show
his wonderful powers if he had been chosen nowand some people would
still choose himit would largely be for his bowling which is unlike
other bowling and would still get wickets

An old cricketer may here be permitted to drop a tear over the
decadence of the bowling and the superlative excellence of the grounds
that has disturbed the old balance of cricket and brought far too
prominently forward the second and third rate batsman

In the field all captains should be cheery and bright and full of
encouragement to both fielders and bowlers A despondent captain who
becomes sad and low when things are going against him has a most
depressing effect on his men Cricket is a game full of so many chances
and surprises that no match is ever lost till the last ball has been
bowled so the bowlers must be cheered and encouraged and the fielders
kept up to the mark till all is over

Illustration At wicket after bowling

Everything that goes on in the game should be noticed by the captain
If a bowler forgets to get behind the stumps when the ball is to be
returned to him by a fielder the captain should at once call his
attention to the fact if a fielder keeps shifting his position over
after over without orders a gentle reminder must be given if a
fielder throws unmercifully at the bowler or wicketkeeper when there
is no attempt at a run on the part of the batsmen he must be spoken
to It is a bad fault on the part of a fieldsman to knock the poor
wicketkeepers hands to pieces for no purpose

If a captain keeps his eye open on all these little things and does
his best to eradicate them and others of the same nature from his men
if he is a keen zealous cricketer gifted with a calm temperament and
sound judgment he may rest assured that before he has led his men very
long he will be the captain of a good team

CHAPTER V

UMPIRES

BY A G STEEL


If anyone were to ask us the question What class of useful men
receive most abuse and least thanks for their service we should
without hesitation reply Cricket umpires The duties of an
umpire are most laborious and irksome they require for their proper
performance the exercise of numerous qualifications and yet it is
always the lot of every man who dons the white coat the present dress
of an umpire to receive certainly no thanks and too frequently
something which is not altogether unlike abuse Nowhere can any notice
be found in the history of cricket of the first appearance of umpires
as sole judges of the game and from old pictures and notably the one
at Lords it is evident that in the early days of cricket there were
no umpires The scoring was done by the notcher who stood by and
cut a notch in a stick every time a run was made and who also most
probably would be the one to decide any point of dispute that might
arise amongst the players The earliest copy of the laws of cricket
that we have is dated  the heading is The Laws of Cricket
revised at the Star and Garter Pall Mall February   by a
committee of noblemen and gentlemen of Kent Hampshire Surrey Sussex
Middlesex and London

These laws are the foundation of those which now govern cricket and
in them rules were laid down with regard to umpires some of which
with certain modifications are still in force Although these laws
promulgated in  are the earliest authenticated there is still
in existence a much older document though the date is unknown which
contains a few remarks on the game entitled Ye game of cricket as
settled by ye cricket club at ye Star and Garter in Pall Mall and
then it goes on Laws for ye umpires showing that in considerably
earlier days than  umpires were recognised institutions in the game

It has always been the custom till within the last few years for each
side to choose its own umpire even in the most important matches
except those played at Lords and the Oval The system of each side
providing its own umpire existed till  It thus happened that aged
and decayed cricketers were rewarded by being chosen as umpires to
watch over the interests of their old colleagues

It was quite impossible for men who were thoroughly imbued with a
strong spirit of partisanship to remain perfectly impartial however
honest and free from suspicion a man might be his opinion at a
critical stage of the game could not fail to be unconsciously biassed
in favour of the side with whose name his own had been long associated
Many men became alarmed at the idea of obtaining a reputation for
giving partial decisions and would go to the other extreme and decide
against their own side oftener than the facts justified There were
also men no doubtbut these were few and far betweenwho used their
important position to unfairly enhance the chances of victory for
their own side This system was a bad one as it made the position of
an umpire so extremely invidious but it was not till  that the
present practice was introduced At the beginning of the season each
county now sends up the names of two or more umpires to the secretary
of the MCC Then from the list of names nominated by the different
county committees the secretary has to appoint two umpires for every
county match neither of these two being the nominees of either of
the counties that are playing in the match This system works very
well and is a very fair one as the judges of the game are not now
exposed to the charge of partiality so frequently made under the old
rule their interests being connected with neither side The list of
what may be called the official umpires is almost totally composed of
elderly professional cricketers who as young men were themselves
famous players they are consequently men who having spent many years
of their lives in the active pursuit of the game possess a thorough
knowledge of its laws and practice And our experience of the way in
which those arduous duties are performed is that considering the
difficulties of the situation they are placed in our English umpires
taken as a body give good and correct decisions We think that this
opinion would be indorsed by most leading cricketers

The difficulties of an umpire are many and the nice distinctions he
is called upon to draw over and over again during the course of the
match may be gathered from the fact that bad decisions in firstclass
matches are not infrequent And yet we adhere to the commendation
given above It is an absolute impossibility to find an umpire who
will not make mistakes at times The most likely slip for him to make
is perhaps when he is appealed to for a catch at the wicket Let
us just glance at some of the difficulties which may and often do
arise as to this decision The umpire has to satisfy himself that the
bat or the batsmans hand but not the wrist has touched the ball
before it has lodged in the wicketkeepers hand There are often cases
where there is no doubt that the bat has touched the ball the batsman
strikes at the ball and hits it so hard that the sound of the click
may be heard by every fieldsman on the ground and even sometimes by
the spectators and then of course the umpire has no difficulty But
supposing a batsman in playing forward to a ball just outside the off
stump apparently misses it and the ball turns after the pitch and
without any sound or click lodges in the wicketkeepers hand what
has the umpire to say if appealed to He sees the ball turn after the
pitch and he sees it pass the bat dangerously near but he hears no
sound perhaps in this case no one on the field but the wicketkeeper
knows for certain what has taken place he knows that the ball turned
from the pitch just grazed the shoulder or edge of the bat and
came into his hands The batsman perhaps has in his forward stroke
touched the ground with his bat at the very moment the ball grazed the
bat The jar of his bat on the ground has nullified the effect of the
touch of the ball and he doubtless considers that if the appeal is
answered against him he has met with injustice In a case like this
the umpire gives or should give the batsman the benefit of the doubt
that exists and No  bad decision is chronicled against him by the
fielding side No blame can be attached to the umpire he has done his
very best to give a correct decision but the circumstances have made
it absolutely impossible for him to be certain on the point Again
it is sometimes next to impossible for an umpire to be sure whether a
ball has just grazed the tip of the indiarubber finger of a batsmans
glove or not for often in such a case no sound can be distinguished
The batsman feels and the wicketkeeper sees it but none else in the
field knows anything at all about what has happened The umpire can see
the ball pass very close to the glove but whether they have actually
touched he cannot at a distance of twentyfour or twentyfive yards
decide An umpire may often be deceived too in his vision if the
ball pass the bat quickly and the stroke of the bat towards the ball
has been a rapid one he may hear an ominous click that sounds like
a touch and yet he may think that he saw daylight between them at the
moment the ball passed the bat We have more than once in a firstclass
match in which two good umpires were engaged struck a ball fairly
hard and seen it lodge in the wicketkeepers hands and heard in
answer to a confident appeal Not out he was nowhere near it and
this when everyone in the field heard the sound and knew it could only
have been caused by the ball meeting the bat And again supposing a
slight noise or click to be heard just when a ball is passing outside
the legs of a batsman should the ball be taken by the wicketkeeper
it is often a most difficult thing for an umpire to be certain whether
the click has been caused by the bat and the ball or the batsmans
leg or padstrap and the ball The click of the ball hitting a strap
or hard piece of cane in a pad is very like the sharp sound caused by
the bat hitting the ball and this added to the impossibility of the
umpire actually seeing whether a leg ball passes close to the bat or
not makes appeals for legside catches at the wicket extremely hard to
answer with any degree of certainty

These are a few instances of the many very difficult cases which an
umpire may be called upon to decide at any moment during a match Many
others will probably occur to the minds of most of the readers of this
chapter at any rate of those who have any practical experience of
the game We do not however propose to mention all these cases at
present some of them we shall have to refer to later on

We think enough has been said as to the difficult nature of the post
to show conclusively that it is an impossibility to find an umpire
who will not be liable to give bad verdicts It is most unfortunate
that all umpires in addition to having to bear the heavy weight of
knowing that they may at any minute be called upon to give a decision
about which they are uncertain and consequently liable to err
have also too often to suffer from the abuse of those who consider
themselves aggrieved by wrong decisions The chief principle that
tends to harmonise the game and make it the quiet English pastime
that it is is that the umpires decision shall be final It would be
impossible to play the game if this were not so how would matches
ever be finished satisfactorily if every batsman had a right to remain
at the wickets until he himself thought he was fairly out And yet
though this principle is universally known as the main one on which
the prosperity of the game depends we unfortunately find but too
frequently and even amongst some of the leading cricketers of the
day a tendency to revile and abuse the unfortunate umpire whenever
an appeal has been given against them If a batsman considers he has
been given out wrongfully he has a perfect right of course to give
his opinion of what has taken place privately to anyone but he has no
right to stand at his wicket wrangling with and abusing the umpire
nor has he a right to declare publicly to the pavilion on his return
from the wickets that a wrong decision has been given Too often one
sees a sulky badtemperedlooking face arrive at the pavilion and
in loud tones declare he was not within a yard of it or it didnt
pitch within a foot of the wicket Such conduct is unsportsmanlike and
ungentlemanly and what is more is unfair as such a statement is a
public accusation made against the professional capacity of an absent
man who has no opportunity of refuting or contradicting it

Firstclass amateur cricketers should remember that it is impossible
for them to pay too much deference to the decisions of umpires as
it is from them that the standard or tone of morality in the game is
taken They should ask themselves if they wrangle and dispute with
umpires in firstclass matches when a large assemblage is present what
will happen in smaller matches when there is not the same publicity
and notoriety to restrain the rowdiness which has before now been the
result of a wordy warfare with the sole judge of fair and unfair
play We admit that there is nothing so disappointing and annoying to
a batsman as to be given out by what is really a bad decision Take
for instance a man who cannot for business reasons get away as much
as he would like to indulge in his favourite game He has been looking
forward for weeks to a particular match perhaps one of the greatest
importance he has been practising hard for the last month in his spare
time in the evenings after business hours The eventful day comes the
time for his innings arrives and just when he has settled down with
ten or fifteen to his score and has begun to find himself thoroughly
at home with the bowling his hopes are dashed to the ground by a
bad decision He is maddened with anger and disappointment for the
moment and every cricketer will heartily sympathise with him but if
he allows his feelings to get the better of him and indulges in an
open exhibition of anger against the umpire that man should never play
cricket again until he has satisfied himself that come what may he
will be able to curb himself sufficiently to prevent such exhibitions
which act so greatly against the true interests of the game

The majority of cricketers we are happy to say are not open abusers
of umpires and their decisions though a considerable number have
earned this unenviable notoriety But by far the greater proportion
of batsmen though not open cavillers at the umpires verdict always
refuse to allow that his judgment when adverse to them is correct
and especially in cases of lbw It is one of the most extraordinary
things connected with the game that no matter how straight the ball
may have pitched how low down it may have hit the leg and how
straight it is going off the pitch to the wicket when stopped by the
opposing leg there is not one batsman in twenty who will allow that he
is fairly out The ball pitched off the wicket It would have gone
over the wicket It was twisting like anything and would have missed
the wicket and How could it be out I hit it hard are the usual
excuses that are made to a knot of the crestfallen batsmans friends
and sympathisers after his return to the pavilion Sometimes no doubt
one or more of these excuses may be perfectly true and the batsman has
been unfortunately dismissed by an error in judgment on the part of the
umpire but in far the larger number of instances they are simply sham
excuses invented by the player to cover his own discomfiture In some
cases a batsman may really believe that the ball would have missed the
wicket or did not pitch straight and if so he has a perfect right
if he thinks fit to tell his own friends what is opinion is but as
a rule the umpires judgment is right and the batsmans is wrong The
mere fact of a ball hitting the leg when it is pitched so nearly
straight and would have so nearly hit the wicket as to justify an
appeal to the umpire shows that the batsman has seriously erred either
in his judgment of the pitch of the ball or in his stroke He has made
a mistakethe ball hitting his leg is a proof that he has done so and
yet with this proof staring him in the face he comes out and states
positively what practically comes to this The ball must have been
very nearly straight and would have very nearly hit the stumps or else
the bowler would not have asked I mistook the pace or the pitch or
the flight of the ball or all three of them at the same time but now
that I have had time to think over it I know for certain the ball was
not pitched straight or would not have hit the wicket This is the
logical conclusion of the vast number of excuses that are made with
regard to decisions of lbw

Illustration A clear case

When a batsman says that he has hit the ball it does not always follow
that it is correct for under certain circumstances he may imagine he
has touched it when in fact he has not done so For instance if he
plays forward with the bat close to his left leg he may slightly touch
his pad or his boot which may produce in his mind the same impression
as if the bat had touched the ball In a forward stroke a slight touch
on a hard ground with the end of the bat will often convey the same
idea There are one or two wellknown cricketers thoroughly keen and
honest players of the game whose habit of finding fault with umpires
decisions adverse to themselves has often provoked great amusement
We remember on one occasion taking part in a match in which one of
these critical gentlemen was playing Shortly after his innings began
he missed a perfectly straight ball and just as it was going to hit
the centre of the middle stump it came into contact with a thick
wellpadded leg He had to go Shortly afterwards in the pavilion he
was overheard replying in answer to a friend Out why it didnt
pitch straight by a quarter of an inch

What has been said with regard to the duty of batsmen to abide by
umpires decisions applies equally to bowlers What can be worse form
than a public exhibition of temper on the part of a bowler because an
appeal is not answered in his favour Whaaat shouts a bowler at
the top of his voice after a negative answer to an appeal his eyes
glaring at the poor unfortunate umpire as if he wanted to eat him
What is out then Perhaps in the next ball or two the batsman is
palpably out either bowled or caught Hows that then sir says
the bowler in sarcastic glee as if his success was directly due to
the former verdict of the umpire All this sort of thing is very poor
cricket and not calculated to promote the true spirit of friendliness
which should distinguish every match if the game is to be enjoyed

It is in club cricket that there is always the greatest number of
disputes about umpires decisions This is owing to the fact that the
only way in which umpires can be procured is by each side bringing
its own As a rule the professional bowler of a club stands as umpire
in all matches and this system as before mentioned cannot fail
occasionally to cause a little wrangling Supposing for instance a
side has to get half a dozen more runs to win a match with only one
wicket to fall and the umpire of the fielding side by giving the
last hope out leg before wicket decides the game in favour of his
employers it must inevitably stir up some angry feelings especially
as a batsman is scarcely ever known to admit the impeachment of being
fairly out lbw Considering the keenness and anxiety to win of every
cricketer worthy of the name the fact of serious disputes being almost
unknown is a remarkable instance of the generosity and manliness of
English players

But it is in bon fide country or rustic matches that there is most
often good reason for finding fault with the decisions of umpires We
are not speaking of matches between clubs who can boast enough members
to enable them to engage a professional bowler level a good large
square piece of turf and erect a local habitation in the shape of a
neat and pretty little pavilion but of matches between clubs in remote
villages where the village common rough and uneven as it is suffices
for practice on the weekday evenings and for matches on Saturday
afternoons where the only weapons of the batsmen are the old wellworn
and usually desperately heavy club bats where the village barber is
the bowler the village baker the best batsman and the umpire on
whom his side relies for victory more than on all the other men in the
village the publican There are still such clubs in existence though
not nearly so many now as in days gone by The increased popularity of
the game and the greater facilities for getting about the country
have caused many of these old village clubs to become large and
welltodo One of the greatest treats that any cricketlover can
have is to take part in a match between two really primitive village
clubs The old fast underarm bowling now sixty years at least out of
date in firstclass cricket still preserves its pristine efficacy on
the rough uneven turf and against the untutored batsmen The running
and the shouting and the general excitement when the parson misses a
catch or the butcher is bowled is very pleasing to one accustomed to
the stateliness and publicity of a match at Lords or the Oval But
the village umpire is perhaps the most interesting personage on the
ground He is usually a stout elderly man who grown too grey on the
head and too thick in the girth to give his side any more active help
in the field assists in quite as efficient a manner in his new post
He is generally a genial jolly sort of fellow devoted to the game he
fondly imagines that he is an infallible judge of every point that can
arise in it though really he is wofully ignorant of the whole subject
He is however looked up to by the whole village as an authority whose
opinion cannot be disputed probably he has once in his life many
years ago been to Lords and has there while watching Carpenter
Hayward and George Parr laid up a store of information connected with
the play of great cricket celebrities which has sufficed ever since to
maintain his reputation as a cricket savant

Before the beginning of a match he may be seen diligently rolling the
stubborn ground with a small handroller in the hopes that some of
the numerous adamantine hillocks may be compressed to something like a
level with the surrounding dales and valleys

After this labour of love has been ineffectually bestowed he proceeds
to mark the creases And what marvellous works of art they are when
finished Long crooked lines some three or four inches in thickness
suggest that straightness and neatness have been sacrificed to the
desire of using as much whitening as possible When it is time for the
match to begin he marches solemnly to the wicket with a bat over
his shoulder chaffing and joking with the players as he goes Then
what numerous appeals are made to him Catches at the wicket lbw
runs out all follow one another in quick succession His decisions
are always given with deliberation and evident doubt and often are
preceded by questions to the batsman such as Did yer it it Jack
or Whereabouts did it touch ye Thus the length of a mans innings
is often in the same ratio as his moral obliquity in concealing or
perverting the truth However there is wonderfully little disputing
the goodnatured batsmen being quite willing to abide by the fiat of
the great authority and if decisions are given rather more against
than for them they are induced to keep quiet by the knowledge that
they have their own village judge at the other end who when the time
comes will do his best to equalise matters

One of the most primitive rustic matches we ever saw was on a village
common in Hampshire We always look back to that match as one which
produced more real fun than any we have ever taken part in The village
umpire there a jolly goodnatured old man but absolutely ignorant
of the laws of cricket caused us the greatest merriment during the
whole day In addition to his official post as umpire he was the
village caterer at all public entertainments and consequently supplied
luncheon at all the matches It was evident his thoughts in the field
were divided between the responsibilities of his two dutiesat least
we inferred so by his occasionally allowing the bowler to bowl as
much as ten or more balls in an over and giving as his reason If
Mr doant have a bit o exercise he woant relish my steak pie
Oim vaamous for steak pies yer know sir he added by way of apology
for introducing the subject This worthy old umpire gave certainly
the most astonishing decision we ever saw A man was batting at one
end who was evidently one of the swells of his side Owing to the
roughness and slope of the ground the slow bowling that he had to
play was going about in all directions Now a ball pitching nearly
a wide to leg would twist in and pass the wicket on the off side
and then one pitched wide on the off would hit or pass the legs of
the batsman who after many wild and futile attempts to strike this
to him peculiar style of bowling determined as a last resource
to treat it with supreme contempt He therefore whenever the ball
pitched wide got in front of his stumps turned round and presented
the back portion of his person to the bowler The umpire watched these
proceedings with a somewhat perplexed smile on his broad goodhumoured
face but said nothing Shortly a ball that pitched a couple of feet
on the leg side twisted in and struck the batsman on the seat of his
trousers This caused some laughter amongst the lookerson and when
the mirth had subsided the umpire walked slowly a few yards down the
pitch and addressed the batsman thus Why Jack that aint cricket
Oim a pretty favourable umpire as a rule you know Jack but when a
man stops the ball with that he must be out You must go Jack
Nothing would induce the injured batsman to remain we implored him
to stay but no he had been given out and was going out and for the
rest of the day he enjoyed the importance of being an injured manan
importance enhanced by the opinions of his admirers that had he not
suffered an injustice the village scorers would have had on that
occasion anything but a holiday

Illustration You must go Jack

The wellknown crack player who now and then plays in village cricket
matches usually enjoys perfect immunity from the vagaries of the
village umpire in fact he runs only a very slight chance of ever
being out at all unless he is palpably caught or his stumps knocked
down The old style of umpire that we have attempted to describe is
immensely delighted at the prospect of seeing what he calls real
cricket and whether the swell is on his side or against it he
fully makes up his mind that it will be no fault of his if spectators
are not treated to an exhibition of the real article The bowlers may
be hoarse with appealing but the umpire remains obdurate and it is
with real sorrow he at last sees the great man go

We remember on one occasion coming across a strange umpire in
Scotland It was in a country very country match The writer was
batting and his copartner at the other end was a wellknown sporting
baronet The latter was the continual cause of appeals both from the
bowler and wicketkeeper for lbws and catches at the wicket All
were answered in the batsmans favour much to the disgust of the
fielders Thinking that the latter were really being treated rather
badly the writer ventured humbly to ask the umpire whether the last
appeal an enormous thigh right in front of all three stumps to a
straight one had not been a very near thing Lor bless you sir was
the reply I have been his valet for fifteen years and I dussnt give
him out he gets awful wild at times

A little knowledge is a dangerous thing to umpires as well as
everyone else A ball in a country match hit the batsmans leg skied
up in the air and was caught by point Hows that for leg before
wicket shouted the bowler Hows that for a catch said point The
bewildered umpire had not an idea what it was but no doubt he thought
such loud appeals meant something and so said Out What for
said the batsman it didnt pitch anything like straight wouldnt
have hit the wicket and whats more never touched it Out said
the nonplussed umpire it hit you below the wrist This story
although told of an ignorant umpire illustrates a principle which the
best umpires should have in mind but which many of them seem never
to have learnt or else to have forgotten and that is never give
your reasons for a decision This is a golden rule for all umpires An
umpire is engaged to say Out or Not out when appealed to and not
to state the reasons which have induced his verdict When a man adds to
his decision It didnt pitch straight Your toe was up in the air
Your bat was over the crease but not on the ground it has a tendency
to create useless discussion and waste of time Besides an umpire may
occasionally be right in his verdict but may be brought to grief by
explaining his reasons For instance suppose an appeal for a lbw
and the umpire says Not out The wicketkeeper and the bowler may
know that the point for decision is whether the ball pitched straight
or not the umpire adds for example The ball would have gone over
the wicket Well this may be so but both the wicketkeeper and the
bowler think not if the verdict had been a decided Not out both of
these two would have been satisfieda doubtful point had been given
against them no one was to blame for it better luck next time c
c But since the umpire has been guilty of stating reasons which
according to them are not satisfactory he has branded himself with a
bad decision in the eyes of the fielding side

Some umpiresin fact the majority of themhave a habit of putting
their hand and arm in the air and pointing to the skies when they
give a man out A verdict propitious to the batsman is given by a
solemn Not out but one adverse by an annoying silence and a most
inappropriate wave of the arm in the air It would be far more to the
purpose if the finger were pointed downwards instead of upwards as the
batsmans hopes are shattered We never like to leave the wickets till
the umpires voice is heard The arm may go in the air involuntarily
or the umpire be surprised into a spasmodic upward armjerk but a good
honest Out can never be doubted

With regard to the qualifications that a man should possess before he
can hope to perform satisfactorily to himself and others the duties of
an umpire the first essential is that he must have been at one time
a good cricketer By good we do not mean firstclass or that he must
have had his name amongst the list of the best players of his time
but he must have been fairly proficient in the game and must have had
a large practical experience The qualifications of a good judge are
no doubt of a different nature from those for a good advocate but
before a man can sit on the Bench he must have passed through the wear
and tear of the bar and had when there varied experiences in the
practice of law So with an umpire it does not absolutely follow that
a firstrate player will make a good umpire but it does follow that a
man who has had great practical experience in the game will be better
qualified to decide the nice points that arise than one who has only
made cricket a theoretical study Assuming that a man has sufficient
knowledge of the game to stand as umpire he must possess quick and
keen sight a good sense of hearing powers of rapid decision and
last but not least he must be very fond of cricket The necessity of
the first two of these qualifications for good umpiring is apparent
For most decisions a good power of sight only is required but in
appeals for catches at the wicket an umpire has both to be guided by
his eyes and his ears Many cases occur where the ball and the bat pass
each other with such rapidity that it is impossible for an umpire to
be certain from his eyes alone that they have touched one another and
he must then to a great extent be guided by what he has heard Both
sight and sound must help him to come to his conclusion and he must
give no decision if it is inconsistent with the effect of either of
these senses on his mind

No umpire should ever be chosen to stand in firstclass matches unless
he possesses the perfect use of these two senses More than once in
important matches we have seen an umpire with his ears stuffed full
of cottonwool This no doubt was an excellent preventive against
catching cold in the head but it was a monstrous thing to see the
result of a match of some interest depending upon the amount of sound
that could penetrate through two or three layers of wadding

An umpire should possess powers of quick decision because every time
his opinion is asked he has to give it at once and with firmness If
he shows any signs of doubt or hesitation he destroys the confidence
which it should be his constant endeavour to see reposed in him and his
judgment

An umpire has to concentrate every particle of his attention on the
game every minute of the five or six hours he is in the field has
to be devoted to studiously watching every ball that is bowled and
every incident in the play Once let his attention be distracted or
his interest lessened in what is going on around him and he will
make a mistake The powers of concentration necessary in an umpire
are so great and are required for such a lengthy period that it is
impossible to find them in any man unless he is imbued with a thorough
love of cricket It is this devotion to the game which enables our
umpires to fix their attention on it for such long weary hours in all
conditions of weather and in our most important matches with such a
heavy weight of responsibility upon their shoulders Firm free and
unbiassed in their judgment our English umpires have the satisfaction
of knowing that unbounded confidence is placed in them by the players
and the public and that never in the history of modern cricket has
there been the faintest whisper of suspicion against their integrity or
fair fame

And now let us discuss the actual duties of an umpire connected with
the game The two umpires before the beginning of the match should be
present when the ground is chosen and measured By rights it is the
duty of the umpires actually to choose the pitch but this is seldom
done as so much care and attention is spent on all grounds at the
present day by the groundmen that the wicket intended to be used has
been generally prepared with diligence for two or three days previous
to the match They should however be present and see that the ground
is the proper measurement and that the stumps are so fixed in the
ground as to satisfy the sixth rule of the gamenamely Each wicket
shall be eight inches in width and consist of three stumps The
stumps shall be of equal and sufficient size to prevent the ball from
passing through twentyseven inches out of the ground The bails shall
be each four inches in length and when in position on the top of the
stumps shall not project more than half an inch above them Umpires
should be very careful to see that these provisions are complied with
both with regard to the width of the wicket and the ball passing
between the stumps We have often seen stumps in a firstclass match
so wide apart that the ball would pass between them without dislodging
the bails over and over again have we taken hold of the ball and
passed it between them to show the umpire that the stumps were too far
apart but we have never seen a bowled ball pass between the stumps
without removing the bails in a firstclass match though this often
happens in smaller matches Umpires should themselves measure the
ground between the wickets groundsmen as a rule do this but they
occasionally do it in a careless and slovenly fashion which may result
in the distance being a foot too short or too long The slightest
difference in the usual distance of twentytwo yards from wicket
to wicket makes a great difference to the bowler and so it should
invariably be checked by the umpires themselves using the chain

Before the match begins the umpires should settle what the boundaries
are to be This of course will only apply to those places where the
boundaries have not been finally settled as at Lords and the Oval
and other wellknown grounds The usual practice however is for
the visiting team to accept the boundaries that are customary on the
ground but should there be any dispute on this subject it must be
settled by the umpires Having arranged all preliminaries connected
with the pitch and the boundaries the umpires should go to the wickets
punctually to the very minute agreed upon for beginning play A vast
amount of time is on many grounds lost owing to unpunctuality and if
the umpires appear on the ground at the appointed time irrespective of
whether the players are ready or not it has a good effect The umpire
at the bowlers end when the bowling is over the wicket should stand
as near as he can to the wicket without inconveniencing the bowler in
his action he should stand sideways fronting the bowler but with
his head looking over his right shoulder down the pitch The object
of this attitude is that as small a surface of his body as possible
should be permitted to be in the line of sight of the batsman and the
ball There are some umpires who stand as much as five or six yards
from the wicket no doubt under the impression that so long as they
are in a straight line with the two wickets they can see everything
but this is a mistake as it is evident that the nearer the umpire
stands to the wicket the better he can see and judge the points that
arise for his decision Before umpires were required to wear the long
white coats which now render them so conspicuous their dark ones
often greatly interfered with the batsmans view of the ball but now
this inconvenience has been done away with and the batsman can never
rightly complain of his sight being obscured by the umpire

The umpire should stand perfectly still at the moment the ball is
delivered he must not even move his head as any moving object
directly behind the ball and especially as near to it as the umpire is
standing may distract the batsmans sight from the ball He must watch
the bowlers hindmost foot to see if it touch or cross the bowling
crease in which case it is a no ball and must almost at the same
time watch the bowlers hand and arm to guard against any infringement
of the rule against throwing

The rule with regard to no balls is The bowler shall deliver the
ball with one foot on the ground behind the bowling crease and within
the return crease otherwise the umpire shall call no ball The umpire
must therefore call no ball if the hindmost foot of the bowler is
at the moment of delivery even touching the bowling or return creases
This rule makes it important that the bowling crease should be neatly
and correctly marked The rule with regard to the bowling crease says
that it shall be in a line with the stumps  ft  in in length
c but says nothing about the width of it We must therefore infer
from the words in a line that the bowling crease should not be of
greater width than the thickness of the stumps If it is drawn of this
thickness only it is a very narrow line but is correct according to
a commonsense interpretation of the rules  and  for supposing as
is often the case the crease is thicker than the width of the stumps
it would then be a manifest injustice to no ball a bowler because
his hindmost foot has just touched the edge of it These two rules
evidently mean that the hindmost foot shall be behind the line of the
wicket when the ball is delivered If the crease is too thick the foot
may just touch it and yet not transgress the spirit of the two rules
taken together

With regard to the necessity laid down in rule  for the hindmost
foot to be on the ground  when the ball is delivered we think
umpires may take it as settled that it is quite an impossibility for a
bowler to deliver a ball with this foot off the ground Let anyone try
to bowl with only the left foot on the ground and he will at once see
the practical impossibility of doing so A no ball should be called
quickly and distinctly directly the ball has been delivered an umpire
must not shout No ball as soon as he sees the foot touch or overlap
the crease but must wait till the ball is actually bowled otherwise
he may land himself in a difficulty should the bowler stop and not
deliver the ball We remember an umpire who is generally supposed to
be about the best in England making this mistake in  he called
a no ball so very prematurely that it gave the bowler time to stop
before the ball left his hand

A wide ball is one that in the opinion of the umpire is not within
reach of the striker It therefore does not make the slightest
difference where it pitches so long as in the umpires opinion it
has never been within the batsmans reach Some people entertain
the idea that if a ball has pitched fairly straight but afterwards
twisted beyond the batsmans reach it should not be called wide but
this is wrong as the rule says positively that if it is not within
reach of the striker the umpire shall call wide ball It is often
a very nice point as to what is or is not within reach of the striker
and umpires opinions vary on this head We think the true reading of
the rule is that on the off side the batsmans reach should not be
limited to what he can only reach when standing still in his original
position but should be extended to what he can conveniently and
comfortably reach with either leg across his wicket say for cutting
or off driving On the leg side we think a ball should be called
wide if the batsman in the ordinary swing of the arms and bat for a
leg hit could not reach it It thus follows that a ball may be a
wide on the leg side which would not be one if at an equal distance
from the batsman on the off side If the ball passes so high over the
batsman as to be out of his reach it is a wide This very rarely
occurs but umpires should remember that if the batsman can touch this
ball by holding the bat in the air it is not a wide It does not
follow that it is a wide because the ball goes over the head of the
batsman without being played atmost batsmen refuse to strike at such
a ball because of the attendant riskbut it must be so high that the
batsman cannot reach it when holding the bat in the usual manner

When the bowler is bowling round the wicket the umpire should stand
exactly in the same place as he does for over the wicket bowling but
should of course front the bowlers side of the wicket He should be
watchful to see that the bowler keeps within the limit of the return
crease if he touches this with his hindmost foot it is a no ball
and should be instantly called Roundthewicket bowlers often have
a tendency to bowl as far as possible round the wicket and as this is
done with the object of making their bowling more difficult umpires
should be careful to keep them within the prescribed limits There is
rather a slackness in many umpires about calling no ball because the
return crease is touched but they ought to be quite as particular in
this respect as in the case of the bowling creasein fact even more
so as a ball delivered an extra inch from the line between wicket and
wicket makes more difference to the batsman than one delivered an inch
nearer than usual

The principal duties of the umpire at the bowlers end are those
we have discussedviz calling wides and no balls answering
decisions for leg before wicket and catches at the wicketand there
are some few other points he may occasionally be called upon to decide
Before mentioning these let us see what the laws say with regard to
the several duties of the two umpires Law  says The umpire at the
bowlers wicket shall be appealed to before the other umpire in all
cases except in those of stumping hit wicket run out at the strikers
wicket or arising out of law  the law relating to any part of the
wicketkeepers person being in front of the wicket or to his taking
the ball before it reaches the wicket but in any case in which an
umpire is unable to give a decision he shall appeal to the other
umpire whose decision shall be final It will thus be seen that the
umpire at the bowlers end must be appealed to first in all but the
excepted cases he therefore has to decide all questions relating to
catches but if he is uncertain or from some cause has been prevented
from seeing the circumstances of the catch he may appeal to the other
umpire whose decision shall be final It is sometimes a very difficult
thing for an umpire to be certain whether or not the fielders hands
have got under the ball before it has touched the ground if he is
at all doubtful he should at once appeal to the other umpire whose
position may probably have enabled him to get a better view of the
catch A difficulty occasionally arises in connection with what is
commonly called a bump ball A bump ball is one which the batsman
playing hard on to the ground and close to the bat causes to bound
in the air Should it be caught by a fielder a question often arises
whether it touched the ground after the bat or not Sometimes these
decisions are hard to arrive at with certainty and especially so if
the ground is dry and dusty and the batsman in striking stirs up a
cloud of dust as the actual contact between the bat and the ball is
then partially if not altogether obscured from the umpires view
Perhaps the most historical decision on this point is one that was
given in the University match of  C F H Leslie the wellknown
old Rugbeian had just begun his innings A F J Ford was bowling
Leslie made a halfhit at a wellpitchedup ball and raised a cloud of
dust around him the ball came straight back to the bowler who caught
it and Leslie instantly left his wicket for the pavilion evidently
under the impression that he was fairly out Before he had reached the
entrance of the pavilion circumstances arose which caused the other
batsman then at the wickets to appeal to the bowlers umpire for a
decision as to whether the catch had been made off a bump ball or
not This umpire not being able to give a decision appealed to the
other one who after some discussion with his colleague decided in
the affirmative and consequently Leslie resumed his innings

When an umpire has to decide the question of a bump ball or not he
must be guided by its length its flight from the bat and the way in
which the latter has been used the state of the ground sometimes must
be considered as it is unlikely when the turf is in a soft spongy
state that a ball will bounce high or far from it

As will be seen by the latter part of law  just quoted the
bowlers umpire may occasionally be appealed to on matters which are
primarily in the discretion of his colleague If the latter cannot
decide for instance a question of stumping which by the law must
first be referred to him he may appeal to the bowlers umpire This
power of appealing in cases of stumping is rarely usedin fact we
have never seen or heard of a single case of its exercise though we
once saw a case arise in which an appeal might very rightly have been
made In the University match of  A H Evans was batting he ran
out to a slow hit at it with all his might missed it and let the bat
slip out of his hands The ball was taken and the wicket put down by
the Cambridge wicketkeeper Alfred Lyttelton but the umpire had seen
the bat flying straight at his head and not wishing to risk a broken
crown by sticking to his post had fallen down with his head averted
from the wicket and was consequently unable to give a decision on a
case which he had not seen Evans was some three or four feet out of
his ground when the bails were knocked off but as no decision was
given against him he of course remained at the wickets This is exactly
the case which this part of rule  is framed to meet the other umpire
would have been quite able to have given a decision on a plain case
like this and no doubt would have done so had there been an appeal
made to him

Under law  many points arise for the decision of the bowlers
umpire two of which merit discussion here This law says The
umpires are the sole judges of fair and unfair play of the fitness
of the ground the weather and the light for play all disputes shall
be determined by them and if they disagree the actual state of things
shall continue But law  says They the umpires shall not order
a batsman out unless appealed to by the other side So that no umpire
can really decide anything except wides no balls and boundary hits
unless an appeal is made to him As will be seen from law  appeals
may be made on the fairness or otherwise of the play These appeals
happily are seldom made but circumstances may arise in which it is the
duty of the umpire to give his opinion under this rule For instance
should the bowler so cut up the pitch with his feet as to place the
batsman at a disadvantage when opposed to the bowling from the other
end it would be the duty of the umpire if appealed to to say that
such tearing or cutting up was unfair whether done accidentally or
not When the Hon Ivo Blighs team was in Australia in  an
appeal was made to the umpire by one of this team as to whether the way
in which Spofforth was cutting up the wicket was fair or unfair There
was no doubt the wicket was being seriously damaged the appealing
batsman of course made no imputation of intentional unfairness against
Spofforth but only asked for a decision whether such damage was fair
to the batting side The umpire asked to see the soles of Spofforths
shoes these were held up for public view and as they only had about
one spike each it was decided that there was nothing unfair It is
however a wellknown fact that when ground is cut up it is done by
the force with which the boot is brought on to the ground the edge of
the sole is often answerable for the damage and the number of spikes
that are worn is quite beside the question

As we have before noted the umpire at the strikers end has to
decide some few points his duties however are not nearly so onerous
as those of his colleague at the other end They are decisions on
stumping hitting wicket running out and matters arising under law
 This umpire should stand quite square with the wicket so near
as to enable him to see accurately all that happens without placing
himself in any risk from a hard square hit He should take care that
the popping crease is clearly visible to him if it has got worn out
and difficult to see a pinch of sawdust placed at the end of it will
give him its correct line It is always best however when either of
the creases has become indistinct to send for the whitening and remark
it Stumping rarely gives much difficulty to the umpire his position
is such that he ought always to be able to see whether the bails are
off before the bat or foot are within the line If the toe of the
batsman is on the crease and no part of his foot within it of course
the decision must be against the batsman If the batsman relies on
his bat being in his ground when the bails are off the umpire should
recollect that the bat must be in his hand according to law  We
recollect once seeing in a county match a batsman after a tremendous
futile swipe fall prostrate outside his ground with the force of the
unsuccessful stroke he was lying some two feet out of his ground and
his bat was within the crease with the handle resting on his shoulder
when the wicket was put down The umpire wrongly gave him not out no
doubt thinking he was justified in doing so as the bat was connected
with a portion of the batsmans body The bat must however be in his
hand to prevent a decision against him unless some part of his person
be grounded within the line of the popping crease

It is generally easy for an umpire to see when a batsman hits his
wickets The ball is usually played by the bat but the batsman coming
further back than usual either from a mistake in his judgment as to
the pitch or from originally standing too near strikes the wicket
An umpire however must keep a sharp look on the wicketkeepers
feet and hands and see that the fall of the bails is not due to
any of these coming in contact with the wicket It is possible for
a wicketkeeper to dislodge the bails with the tip of his gloves or
the point of his boot and yet be unconscious that he has done so An
umpire must also keep his eyes open to guard against any chance of this
being intentionally done Fortunately there is now no hankypanky
play in our firstclass cricket but there have undoubtedly been cases
where a smart wicketkeeper has been unable to resist the temptation
of removing the bail with foot or glove when in the act of taking the
ball If any part of the batsmans person hits the wicket in playing
at the ball it is sufficient to justify a decision against him If
his hat blow off and knock the bails off when he is in the act of
playing he is out several instances are on record of this unfortunate
method of dismissal In the season of  there was an instance
recorded of a man knocking one of his bails off with a piece of the
string that had been wrapped round the blade of his bat he was of
course given out A difficulty sometimes arises as to whether the bail
was knocked off in the actual stroke at the ball or whether it was in
the action of the bat preliminary or subsequent to the stroke

Illustration Stumped

The duties of umpires are so various and the decisions they are
called upon to give are so numerous that it is an impossibility to
discuss them all Every umpire should remember that when an unforeseen
incident occurs in the game he must use his common sense for its
solution and then he will not go far wrong

FOOTNOTES

 A batsmans reach is further on the off than the leg side because
he has his legs to put across the wicket to help him on the former side




CHAPTER VI

FIELDING

BY THE HON R H LYTTELTON


Illustration Saving the four

Certain natural qualifications are indispensable to enable any
cricketer to become a great fieldsman The highest reputation that can
be attained by any painstaking cricketer who is not endowed with these
qualifications is that of being a good safe man When you hear this
epithet you may take it for granted that reference is made to a man
who may cover himself with glory if he has to field a ball within a
certain more or less limited space from the spot where he has taken his
position who is generally in the habit of holding a feasible catch
and who will seldom disgrace himself

In other words a safe field is generally a slow one is lacking in
electricity and rapidity of movement and as batsmen get to know this
the short run is attempted with impunity Slow fields are earnestly
advised to practise throwing for their defects are less apparent
when fielding a long distance from the wicket and the nonobservant
spectator does not notice that the ground covered at a distance from
the wicket by a slow field is very small compared to that commanded by
some spacecovering field like Palairet Sugg or J Douglas

Again let safe and slow fields the roadsters among the thoroughbreds
try and get a respectable knowledge of the game for if they obtain
this they can in a great measure discount their deficiencies A good
judge of the game gets to know by instinct where a batsman is likely
to hit certain balls and so does the observant fieldsman He will
consequently shift a few yards or so from his original position to
the spot towards which his instinct tells him the ball is likely to
be hit and he will thereby earn the enviable reputation of being a
man who is frequently in the right place It used to be said of the
immortal French tennis player Barre that he himself did not run after
the ball but the ball ran after him his genius told him where his
opponent was going to hit the ball and he planted himself accordingly
In like manner will a fieldsman so plant himself and it is important
to a slow field to try and acquire this instinct for if the fieldsman
is not on a certain spot of ground before the hit is made his slowness
will prevent his getting there afterwards especially if the hit is
hard and the ground fast

Directions may now be given on the knotty points Where ought I to
stand When ought I to back up Which end ought I to throw to
and a few others for this reason that many a good fieldsman might be
better if he knew where to place himself and precisely what to do

First then it may be safely asserted that a concentrated attention on
every ball is a sine qu non of even decent fielding Men often think
that if they are simply looking at the batsman they are doing all that
is required But this is not so There is a difference of opinion as
to whether the eyes should be fixed on the batsman or should follow
the ball as it leaves the bowlers arm this is a matter of dispute
our own opinion being in favour of the former plan But each man should
stand as if the next ball were sure to come to him not only as if it
might come to him One can see a whole eleven doing it now and then
when there are say six runs wanted to tie and seven to win They
are all adopting for a few minutes the position they ought to adopt
alwaysin short the position in which great fieldsmen like Wainwright
and Burnup are found invariably We will first take a few general
points and then the separate places in the field


BACKING UP

Illustration Backing up

This is a matter which demands the earnest consideration of all who
field within thirty yards of the wicket There ought always to be
two men backing up never more Nine times out of ten they will be
superfluous but the tenth time they will save a four overthrow and
all the chagrin demoralisation and tearing of hair connected with
that disaster No fieldsman can throw his best unless he is confident
about the backing up and the man who ought to be abused when an
overthrow occurs is not the fieldsman who throws the ball but the men
who should be backing up and are not Againand let young fields take
heed to thisthere must be ten yards between the two men backing up
and also between the one nearest the wicket and the wicket This gives
them room to stop the wildest throw but does not give the batsmen
time to run if the ball passes the wicket If the fields stand close
together two are as bad as none and get in each others way Rules
for the different fields we give in dealing with them separately


THROWING

This is of course a gift of nature not a result of art Few
men can throw far but everyone can throw quickly and that is what
prevents batsmen from running There is a moment which decides a
batsman whether he can manage to secure another run or not It is
just when a fieldsman having run some way after the ball and having
his back turned to the wicket is stooping to pick up preparatory to
throwing in Now any good judge of running after seeing a man go
through this process once knows exactly how long it will take Every
nerve should be strained to make it as brief as possible a little
extra sign of life and rapid movement will make the batsman hesitate
a moment and the run is lost The engraving on p  shows what in
our opinion is the proper way to pick up a ball going away The field
is not trying to catch the ball up as far as his feet are concerned
He is stretching his hand forward to pick it up and when he has got
it into his hand he will throw it rather over his left shoulder to the
wicket Again supposing a run is being snatched The field should
then remember that to throw in slowly is of no possible use The throw
may be in other respects as perfect and as straight as Robin Hoods
arrow but the batsman will be safe over the crease and such a throw
becomes an example of showy drawingroom cricket which is sure to be
applauded by the spectators as well as the reporters but is useless
to the side If every field picked up and threw in as quickly as his
knee joints and the state of his arm allowed him a very considerable
percentage of the runs usually scored would be saved It is commonly
asserted by many of those supporters of the game who having laid down
their arms devote themselves for the rest of their lives to laying
down the law that nobody ought ever to throw down the wicket This is
certainly wrong We do not mean that everybody ought always to throw
at the wicket but only that some fields under certain circumstances
ought to do so These circumstances occur when it is the only chance of
running a man out The ball should be hurled violently at the bails
and if an overthrow occurs the wise captain will abuse those who
ought to be backing up and not the thrower But to throw hard at the
wicket when there is no chance of running a man out is strongly to be
condemned it may produce an overthrow and it is certain to inflict
useless concussion on the hands of bowlers and wicketkeepers No
fieldsman is so apt to disregard this advice as the bowler at least
it is a fact that many bowlers are particularly fond of returning the
ball hard to the wicket after they have fielded it It does not succeed
in running a man out once in a thousand times it often enables a run
to be got by an overthrow and it uselessly troubles the wicketkeeper
A batsman is next door to an idiot who is got out by such means and we
suspect that it is often done to secure the applause of an unthinking
mob

Illustration Overtaking and picking up


DEEP FIELD OR COUNTRY CATCHING

This is an art which the abovementioned critics lament as having
died out It may be suspected that they missed as many catches as
the present generation but still the present generation miss more
than they ought All fine country fields catch the ball close to the
bodynay more close to the headand rightly so because the eye is
more in a line with the ball and with the hands in the position shown
in fig  not in the way shown in fig  If a young player begins in
the wrong way he will miss one or two and get nervous It is worth
remembering that folios of rules will never make a nervous field keep
hold of a country catch Cold hands are a frequent cause of failure
but loss of confidence and the disorganisation of the nervous system is
the commonest reason and a constant prayer of many a cricketer is to
be spared a high catch

Illustration FIG The right way to catch

When a field begins to be uncertain he should keep wicket to fast
bowling for a quarter of an hour a day and field somewhere close
in for a week or so The wicketkeeping will practise his eye and
the fielding close in will spare his nerves during this educational
process Practice is of course useful for long catches but only up
to a certain point A player may alter from a bad style of catching to
a good one by practice but a very safe catch in practice is frequently
a bad performer in a match simply on account of nervousness For sharp
catches wicketkeeping is perhaps the only thing that will help The
peculiar faculty they demand is like the spin in bowling something
that cannot be taught the possession of which is a guarantee of genius

Illustration FIG The wrong way to catch

And now for those who occupy the separate places first among whom we
are surely right in dealing with the


WICKETKEEPER

A little thought makes it clear that there are given at least
three chances of catching to one of stumping a man out And so the
wicketkeeper must first feel the ball safe and warm in his hands
before he attempts to put the wicket down This advice sounds obvious
but it is so often disregarded that it must be insisted on The first
rule accordingly is that the ball must not be snatched at but
received This snapping used to be a very common fault with amateurs
and the great George Pinders remark You amateurs snap em a bit
hit on a then weak spot in amateur wicketkeeping Another reason for
not snapping is one that will certainly strike home and that is
that the nonsnapper is not nearly so likely to hurt his hands as
one form of snapping consists in jerking the hands quickly forward to
meet the ball and thereby resisting a blow instead of waiting for it
Another danger of snapping is that you run the risk of moving your
hands in such a way that instead of the ball striking the palms of the
hands where it does not hurt it strikes you on the top of the thumb
or fingers causing an agony that only wicketkeepers can rightly
appreciate Hardly any two wicketkeepers stand alike so take any
position that is natural to you as was recommended in the chapter on
Batting only bearing one fact in mind which is to avoid standing
so far away as not to be able comfortably to put down the wicket
without moving the legs The postures generally assumed are it must
be confessed the reverse of graceful they are too well known to need
description but the two most common forms are shown in the figures
given on pp  and  In one figure we recognise the massive
proportions of the famous Sherwin It is wise to teach the beginner
to stand still and not to move his feet till the ball is hit by the
batsman or has passed his hands or is in his hands We say beginners
because some famous wicketkeepers do move right in front of the ball
but if a beginner moves his feet it may be inferred that he funks the
ball and is getting out of its way Again you may not be able to
take many legballs but every time you do put the wicket down not
regarding the fact that the batsman may not be out of his ground If
you wait to look he certainly will not wait to get back warned as
he is by the sound of the ball impinging on the gloves that there is
no time for loitering about We do not say that an appeal ought to be
made to the umpire every time that the wicket is put down that ought
only to be done when you think that the batsman was out of his ground
unless this is the case it is an unfair and unsportsmanlike proceeding

Illustration WicketkeeperSherwin in position

We have before protested against pandering to the vicious tastes
of the gallery and we must protest against it again and caution
wicketkeepers in the following particular It is supremely difficult
to take legballs and the populace applaud accordingly when one is
taken Now we have no objection to a wicketkeeper taking as many
legballs as possible but on one condition and that is that he does
not lay himself out to take legballs at the expense of the off balls
It is easy to do this by a different position and a concentration of
thought on the legballs The vast majority of catches are given on the
off side and catches as has been before remarked outnumber stumping
chances in the proportion of  to  We would infinitely sooner have
a wicketkeeper on our side who was safe on the off side and did not
take one legball in a hundred limiting legballs to those outside the
legs of the batsman Let your first thoughts be concentrated mainly on
straight and offside balls and pay no regard to the applause of any
save those whose knowledge of the game makes their approbation valuable

Illustration WicketkeeperAnother position

A player with no aptitude for wicketkeeping on first going to that
position will undergo moments of unspeakable agony Spectators do not
thoroughly realise the position of the wicketkeeper indeed nobody
can who has not attempted the art In the first place we will suppose
a very fast bowler in the second a fast and possibly a rather bumpy
wicket in the third place a batsman with perhaps the bulk of W
G Grace or K J Key wielding a bat of the orthodox proportions
and in the fourth place three stumps with two bails placed on the
top The body of the batsman in many cases completely obstructs the
view the wicketkeeper ought to have of the ball Even if he can get
a good sight of the ball there is that abominable bat being fiddled
about baulking the eyesight in the most tantalising manner and
there are some batsmen who have a provoking habit of waving their
bats directly the bowler begins his run and continuing their antics
till the ball is right up to them while others seem to be built like
windmills and have a limb always at hand to throw out between the
unhappy wicketkeeper and the rapidlyadvancing ball There are several
seconds therefore when the wicketkeeper is only conjecturing what
course the ball is taking and is certain of but two thingsone that
the ball is hard the other that it is advancing in the direction
of himself with terrific rapidity Then even if you see the ball
plainly it may happen to be and frequently is straight and a
straight fast ball raises unutterable emotions in the wicketkeepers
breast for who knows what devilish tricks the ball to say nothing
of the bails will play after the wicket is struck and the course of
the missile diverted not stopped One reads how a bail has been sent
a distance of thirty or forty yards by a fast ball and that bail may
take the wicketkeeper in the eye in transitu The writer was once
struck by the ball on the eye and by the bail on the mouth at very
nearly the same second The wicketkeeper is grimly told that he must
not flinch and that he never can be really good if he does not keep
his legs still True most true but like other great people who do
great things he must resist every natural impulse and all his lower
nature and not till he has succeeded will he stand the least chance
of reaching to a pinnacle of excellence Having briefly pointed out
these difficulties and dangers let us beg the field to treat the
wicketkeeper as tenderly as possible to cultivate a straight throw
either a catch or a longhop and not halfvolleys or worse still
shorthops and never to throw hard when there is no necessity If the
throw is crooked the wicketkeeper should not leave his position to
stop it leave that to the men who are backing up He may be called
upon afterwards to put down the wicket and he ought to be in a
position for so doing Bear in mind also this cardinal rulenamely to
stand behind the wicket to a throw and not in front


LONGLEG

Illustration Hit to squareleg

It may be stated first of all in regard to this place that its
importance is very considerably less in the cricket of the present
day than it was in former times The improvement of bowling in mere
accuracy owing to the fact that now compared with twenty years ago
five medium pace and slow bowlers exist to one fast bowler is the
reason of this change and even when a longleg is used it is very
often because a sort of backup is required for the wicketkeeper and
the longleg is consequently placed very sharp always remembering
that there is no longstop The man chosen for this grand post ought
to know from the way a batsman hits at a ball whether he should stand
square or sharp The oldfashioned longleg hitting of George Parr is
almost a thing of the past so that longleg should stand too square
rather than too sharp especially as the right hand will thus get most
to do If the batsman is a weak hitter alter the position moving not
only nearer the wicket but sharper as well For a weak hitters most
dangerous stroke will be a snick to leg and it is rather galling to
see a snick score many runs But a strong squareleg hit is far more
dangerous therefore leave ample space to cover the ground and trust
to your speed to save two runs A good runner after he plays a ball
gently to longleg makes all haste over the first run and as he
turns assumes that there is time for the second if he sees that the
longleg is slackening in the least or winding up for an ornamental
throw or in any other way wasting time In such case jump towards
the ball the moment you see the batsman turning round to slide it in
your direction run as if a mad bull were behind you and picking up
the ball with one hand as it is moving slowly enough hurl it at the
wicketkeepers headunless he is some distance off in which case
throw so that it goes to the wicketkeeper a longhop Occasionally it
is useful to throw to the bowler assuming that he is behind the stumps
and that midoff is backing up because the batsmen get frightened at
this manuvre and feel that their second run entails too much of a
risk and this frequently prevents them trying it again Bear in mind
that the aim of good fielding is not to run men out but to prevent
their trying to run Remember also that a catch to longleg has a
tendency to curl towards your right hand so do not rush too violently
towards the left directly the ball is hit


MIDOFF AND MIDON

have somewhat similar duties to perform and the latter in one way
is the easiest place in the field for there is less twist on the
ball when hit there than is the case with any other hit When the
ground is hard stand deeper than when it is soft because on a hard
ground a single is easier a four harder to save Again stand wider
when the bowler is bowling your side of the wicket as he is then
responsible for part of the space between you If the batsman is a
timid runner it is a good plan to tempt him to run by pretending to
be slow and the moment he calls run dash in with unexpected vigour
This artifice however can be useful only once in an innings and
must not be attempted by any except quick and good fields But if by
wellascertained and true report and your own observation you know that
either or both of the batsmen are slow or timid runners stand further
back unless there is any special reason to make you stand in for a
catch for by so doing you cover more ground and can save fourers or
threes Midoff must back up behind the bowler when the ball is thrown
in from longleg shortleg midon and longstop Midon backs up the
bowler when it is thrown from midoff coverpoint point and third
man Modern tactics and modern slow bowling have invented an extra
field in the shape of an extra midoff who stands between coverpoint
and midoff and his duties when the fashion is to bowl mainly on the
off side for catches are most onerous Mr G B Studds fielding
here was one of the sights of cricket The Australians in general and
Boyle in particular have introduced a new position to bowlers of the
Spofforth typeyou may call it either an extra shortleg or an extra
midon If the wicket is soft and catchy this field stands sometimes
only five or six yards from the bat and makes numerous catches when
batsmen are poking forward and the ball is inclined to hang In short
it is on the on side that which silly pointafterwards describedis
on the off side It will only be seen when bowlers of superlative
excellence are bowling men who can be relied upon to keep a good
length and whose bowling is too fast to allow the batsman to run
out for a drive If the bowler has not these qualities but bowls a
decent average of halfvolleys on the legstump or a little outside
there will probably be a coroners inquest required But Boyle knew
that neither Spofforth nor Palmer bowled such balls and it cramps the
batsman unpleasantly to see a field standing there on a tricky wicket
Extreme vigilance is required for this post and the risk of injury is
too great to permit it being made use of when the wicket is fast It
was practically never seen in England till the Australians introduced
it in 


COVERPOINT

shares with the three lastmentioned fields a great responsibility
connected with throwing and running fast after the ball A very
common set of strokes are those which send the ball on either side of
coverpoint midoff extra midoff or midon and realise on a hard
ground three runs Now a really good field very seldom allows three
runs because he makes the batsmen suppose that the ball is somehow
back at the wicket almost at the same moment that he is seen picking
it up from the ground Those who have tried this will testify how
very often a sudden turn and throwin just checks the third run the
batsmen feel that they must watch such a field and it is this very
watching which prevents them from ever pressing the running This is
a most important matter and one generally neglected but it is worth
insisting on because anybody can act upon this piece of advice Anyone
can run his fastest and throw his quickest but the men who field in
these places seldom do their best though the man who does not is not a
genuine cricketer and is probably a selfish animal Such conscientious
fielding as this gets very little recognition though it saves about
one in every ten runs Spectators do not observe the cricket reporters
notice the features of the game that are obvious to only ignorant
spectators and they do not waste ink upon it but any really judicious
captain estimates it very highly No doubt a flashy field is very
useful at coverpoint he cramps all the runs on the off side and
covers the defects of a thirdrate midoff but very often these are
just the men who shirk the burden heat and hard work of the day as
we may call these repeated excursions of fifty yards or so under a
strong sun Coverpoint should learn if possible the underhand throw
practised with such success by the late Rev W Law and G J Mordaunt
He has to back up behind midoff when midon or the deepon fields are
throwing in and behind point when shortleg and longleg throw to the
wicketkeeper


POINT

Success in this place depends almost entirely on natural gifts and
there are two distinctly different methods of firstclass fielding
in this place One is the point who seems nearly to have solved the
problem of perpetual motion and bounds about everywhere rushing in at
one ball and right in front of the wicket to the next but whose first
position is closer in than more stationary fields at the same place
The other variety of point stands a yard or two further from the wicket
and is more stationary and his specialty consists in being a grabber
of every ball within his reach The right way of standing is shown
in the figure opposite There are plenty of good fields at point who
stand differently from this but we are trying to teach those who are
not good fields and we think that this figure is a good position The
important point to observe is that you can move quicker when one foot
is drawn a little behind the other and Carpenter and other good fields
used always to stand thus Some critics would say that point ought to
stoop more and no doubt some good points do Each must choose his own
elevation as far as this goes but we feel sure that a great many balls
go over the points head when he stoops very much and that on the
whole the figure shows the best stoop The stationary and the restless
both have their merits and both have their characteristics The tall
man with a long reach nearly always adopts the stationary position and
no hit is too hard for him to face Of course he ought to stand ready
to start quickly but his business consists in covering as much ground
as possible from very nearly one position and he must have a good
aptitude for getting his hand in the right place to stop the ball

Illustration Point

The position of point ought to be in a line with the wicket and at a
distance depending entirely on the pace of bowler style of batsman
and condition of ground The faster the bowler and the ground the
further off the wicket ought point to stand but in no case ought he
to be more than eight yards away Some points make a great mistake in
standing further than this for a very common catch at point is when
a bumping ball rises off the batsmans glove and pitches about four
yards from the wicket in the direction of pointa certain catch if
point is fielding in his right place but impossible to get at if he
stands too far from the wicket There is no limit on certain grounds
and to certain batsmen to the closeness to the wicket which an active
point will stand The ball has been taken literally almost off the
bat We think on the whole that the fieldsman who stands nearly in
the same position till the ball is hit who is quick in starting and
very sure and ready to face and stop a real hotun is more valuable
than the restless point who runs here and there and rarely adopts the
same position for two consecutive balls There is however much to be
said for both styles but we feel very sure that the restless point
must first acquire a certain faculty of more or less correctly judging
where the batsman is likely to hit the ball or else he will be always
rushing to the wrong place

There is a combination of circumstances which induces modern captains
to put their point right forward on the off side about eight yards from
the wicket The circumstances required include a batsman who has got a
peculiar forward style a bowler whose balls are inclined to hang or
get up straight from the pitch and lastly a catchy wicket where the
balls are apt to bump and hang It is a very useful place sometimes
but most dangerous to the field at other times In the Australian and
England match at the Oval in  Morley was bowling McDonnell was
batting The ball now and then bumped up and the English captain
acceded to W G Graces wish and allowed him to go forward point or
as it is familiarly called silly point Now McDonnell is one of the
hardest hitters in the world and Morley used sometimes to bowl a ball
a little overtossed A ball of a certain length might have been
bowled that McDonnell might not have smothered at the pitch and the
requisite hang having taken place W G Grace might have triumphed
But unfortunately before this consummation took place McDonnell got
a ball admirably adapted to his extremely powerful off drive The
wellknown musical sound of a bat hitting the ball plump was heard
then a second knock higher in its musical pitch and nearly as loud
the ball was seen about twenty yards high in the air and McDonnell
easily scored a run What really happened was this McDonnell made a
grand hit all along the ground and long before the burly form of W G
Grace had unbent itself the aforesaid ball had struck his toe which
offered a strictly passive because involuntary resistance with such
violence that the ball ascended into the air like a rocket and a run
was the result W G walked slowly a wiser man to his old position
on a line with the wicket and probably in his inmost thought silently
adopted the opinion that the position of silly point is only feasible
when a batsman of a style directly opposite to that of McDonnell is at
the wicket But this forward point is very useful at times and should
be made use of when circumstances are favourable The late Mr R A
Fitzgerald in his wellknown book Jerks in from Shortleg says that
if there is no good field at point in an eleven the captain should
choose the fattest man for nature makes it impossible for him to get
out of the way of a hard hit In other words it sometimes strikes him
in the most prominent part of his person and saves four runs Perhaps
Roger Iddison of Yorkshire fame who died in the year  could have
testified to the truth of this remark and perhaps Mr Key will take to
the position in the maturity of his cricket life


SHORTSLIP

ought first of all to be as vigilant as if he were keeping wicket If
he is so and knows where to stand he will find it the easiest place
in the field if he is not it will be the hardest Wicketkeepers
ought always to be able to field shortslip for it is a post that has
all the pleasant moments of wicketkeeping with none of the knocks
and bruises and other discomforts of that important place Stoop as
the ball is in the air and hold the hands ready forward as shown in
figure on p  This position is necessary because many more balls
hiss low along the grass than rise into the air from a snick and if
they do rise shortslip can rise too and be in time for them but if he
has to stoop he will be too late So for fast bowling stand finer than
most shortslips do and if the ground is very hard keep a long way
offeight yards is often not too long a distance But the difficulty
in this respect is much greater when the bowling is slow A late cut
adds materially to the speed of a slow ball though it has scarcely
any effect on a fast one But if instead of cutting a batsman plays
forward and snicks a slow ball a gentle catch comes at a medium
height and drops short Shortslip must then regulate his position
accordingly When he sees the batsman lean forward he must advance one
step when the batsman hangs back and the ball is on the off side he
should hang back too and hold the hands low for assuredly if anything
comes it will be a hard low catch He should study the slow bowlers
action so as to know when his fast balls are coming and drop back He
should also ponder on the pace of the ground and never forget that
wet on the top of a hard ground makes the fastest surface of any in
these circumstances therefore he should stand finer and deeper When
the rain soaks in the balls pop and catches come slower and higher
Shortslip should back up when balls are thrown not from short nor
from longleg but from midon and midoff and coverpoint and should
run across when there is a run to third man between the wicketkeeper
and shortleg This last is a tiring and often unremunerative
process but if done through a long innings is in the highest degree
commendable Shortslip must also run up to the wicket and take the
place of the wicketkeeper when the latter has usurped the functions
of an ordinary fieldsman and left his post to pick up and throw in the
ball to the wicket

Illustration Shortslip


THIRD MAN

This is another most scientific post and one in which a bad fieldsman
is very much out of place First there is the twist It is worth
knowing respecting a twist from a bat that if the ground is hard and
the cut clean the ball will not twist till it has lost some of its
impetus Consequently stand straight in the line of a hard cut on a
smooth ground as the ball though it is spinning all the time will
not curl till it is some way past third man But if the turf is soft
the ball bites and curls on the second or third bound seldom on the
first unless the stroke is a very slow one The same holds good with
regard to longleg The batsman if he were a genuine judge of a run
would always run to third man when the spin is likely to act at once
since under those conditions the ball wants so much watching that third
man cannot well return it in time But many batsmen do not know these
things

With regard to the distance of third man from the wicket it is
important that he should judge it according as the batsmen are good
runners or not He should estimate this at once from their appearance
and demeanour standing well out if they are men of weight and dignity
and nearer in if they are active and inclined to steal runs After
they have run one run to him he should come a yard nearer in feeling
like a man who has had a personal insult offered him and is burning
to avenge it Lastly he has to consider the throwin It is nearly
always best to throw to the bowlers wicket assuming of course
that he is ready behind the stumps and midon is backing up for this
plain reason it is generally the nonstriker who calls the run and
consequently starts the quickest runs quickest as he sees the danger
before him and gets home the quickest Even if he does not call the
run he is backing up and starts unshackled by having made a stroke
So leave him alone The striker on the contrary has made a stroke
and one that throws him back a good deal is not backing up and does
not see the danger Also if he runs by the shortest way to the other
wicket he will very likely be cut over Circumstances in short are
against him Above all he seldom suspects that the ball is coming his
way for very few third men ever throw to the right wicket very few
bowlers are behind the stumps and very few midons back up Third man
should stand squarer for a strong cutter than for a weak one He should
back up behind shortslip when the ball comes from midon and arrange
with coverpoint as to the throws from shortleg himself covering
point when the throws come from in front of the wicket and coverpoint
taking that place when they come from behind


SHORTLEG

is an important place for backing up and saving singles It is a
good plan to put a lefthanded man here as he can better command the
strokes between himself and midon which are generally so prolific
of runs Having fielded one of these he ought not to throw to the
wicketkeeper as he is already facing the bowlers wicket and the
bowlers wicket is facing him should he wish to throw it down He
should of course previously make a league with midoff as to the
backing up The late Mr R A Fitzgerald in the book just mentioned
Jerks in from Shortleg once urged the importance of putting
the witty man shortleg as a convenient spot for cracking jokes
Certainly conversation in the field is often of great service towards
keeping the men brisk Shortleg has to back up all the returns from
the off side dropping well back if shortslip comes across for this
purpose and in any case leaving ten or fifteen yards between himself
and the wicket A captain of an eleven feels himself very often bound
by an unwritten tradition to put the notoriously worst field in his
eleven shortleg No doubt it is exceedingly difficult to judge which
is the natural position for a bad field but we unhesitatingly say that
several matches have been lost by bad fields at shortleg In the days
of his prime people used to watch W G Grace playing ball after ball
in the direction of shortleg especially when lefthanded bowlers were
on The late famous J C Shaw was not a good field in any sense of the
word he was consequently often to be seen fielding at shortleg and
we wonder how many times he has missed W G Grace in that position
Missing Grace was and is still a most expensive mistake There are
several players who are weak in their play off their legs and these
players are continually sending chances to shortleg while other
players are extremely fond of playing off their legs and score very
heavily by the stroke and it is wonderful to see how many runs a quick
field will save when such men are batting


LONGSTOP

In these days of slow bowling and fine turf captains of elevens do not
bother themselves with providing longstops at all Wicketkeepers are
so good the bowling is so straight that in the present year 
it is impossible to say who is the best longstop in England for the
simple reason that no longstops are wanted But in the days of yore
every schoolboy who was fond of cricket could tell you of the prowess
of Mortlock H M Marshall and A Diver Mr Powys was a splendid
bowler and so was Mr R Lang But had not Mr H M Marshall been
found to stop Mr Langs balls and Mr F Tobin those of Mr Powys
neither one bowler nor the other could have been put on at all Such
longstops as these stand rather on the leg side and if the bowling
is very fast just deep enough to take the ball as it rises after its
second pitch This is not easy to do and young hands feel tempted
to leave more room But this when the ball is very swift scarcely
diminishes its speed at all and the further off longstop stands the
more chance there is of the ball bounding awkwardly by the time it
reaches him Longstop however would be in an awkward position if
the batsmen ran every bye that is possible To prevent their doing so
he must throw over to the bowler for the old reason that the striker
has the whole distance to run and has his back to the danger Again a
hard throw straight down the pitch places both batsmen in jeopardy
the striker especially and that is why he so often runs with his hand
to the back of his head of course retarding his speed by so doing It
is a harassing run to steal and that combined with the fact that it
is not scored to either batsman is doubtless the reason why it is not
oftener stolen Longstop should accordingly be a strong thrower and
midoff a conscientious backerup Longstop should back up behind
shortleg the returns from coverpoint and midoff

                                   


Before concluding these technical remarks let us draw attention to
one or two circumstances connected with cricket affairs now which are
different from what they were formerly We have said that in these
days longstopping is a lost art or rather it is not an art that
is required in modern elevens It would appear miraculous to an old
cricketer who had seen nothing of the game for the last fifteen years
could he watch Spofforth bowling and Blackham keeping wicket with no
longstop when the ground was hard Such a thing would not have been
dreamt of twenty years ago Then a ball used to shoot five or six times
in an innings of  runs and the occasional shooter that occurs now
always results in four byes if it escapes the bat and the wicket Hence
one important reason why formerly a longstop was indispensable Though
there are or were a very few years since some very fast bowlers the
average pace nowadays is far slower than twentyfive years ago and
that is another reason for dispensing with longstop But the change
of tactics in not having a longstop has had one effect that we regard
as pernicious and that is that it has spoilt one part of the skill
of wicketkeeping and on the whole worked an enormous change for the
worse in the fielding of shortslips generally The longstop is not
there both wicketkeeper and shortslip are conscious of this and
they are aware that his place must be filled up by themselves If a
ball goes in the least to leg even if it only just misses legstump
shortslip is usually to be seen backing up the wicketkeeper for
four byes make an appreciable addition to the score But though the
ball is on the leg side it is quite possible for the batsman to hit
it on the off side and send it straight to shortslips hands if he
only could have been in his proper place He is abused if he does
not back up the wicketkeeper and in any case the mere feeling that
runs must result from the wicketkeeper not handling the ball makes
it impossible for him to give his undivided attention to fielding at
shortslip proper He is continually shifting towards his left hand
and numerous balls that he would have fielded if only there had been a
longstop now result in runs The wicketkeeper is also in more danger
of being hurt and as his position is necessarily one attended by
extreme responsibility and considerable pain this further danger ought
to be spared him if possible The risks he runs are from fast balls
outside the batsmans legs He cannot see the ball accurately so that
he may judge where to put his hands without moving his feet in order
then to prevent the ball going to the ropes he has to rush right in
front of it at the risk if the ball should bump or do anything odd
of getting hit on the face or elsewhere If a longstop were behind
him he would try and take the ball for the sake of a possible catch
or stumpout but he would not expose himself to danger by getting in
front of it

Two corollaries must be drawn from what has been already said The
first is that the bowler should be just as prepared to receive a
throwin as the wicketkeeper When both wickets are menaced the
danger of a short run is doubled and an overthrow is oftener due to
the bowler and backerup than to the field But it is said This is all
very fine but the bowler cannot get behind his wicket in time No
assertion could be wider of the mark Take some genuine cricketer as an
example and no better one could be chosen than Mr A W Ridley some
sixteen years ago Lobbowlers follow their own ball further down the
wicket than any other kind of bowler and of all lobbowlers Mr Ridley
did this the most But no one has ever seen a short run got off his
bowling without at least at the same moment seeing him dart behind
the wicket and be ready to put down the hardest throw anyone might
send to him He is always there in time and any bowler in the country
might do the same if he were cricketer enough to see what is wanted
The second inference to be drawn is that it is highly important to
pursue a medium hit with all possible speed and to throw it in as if
it burnt the fingers to retain the ball a moment We do not remember an
eleven who neglected this less as a whole than the Players eleven of
the year  and the number of runs that can be saved by observance
of the rule is immense

These are the two most important directions which can be given to any
young cricketer and especially to any young captain of a side in
order that he may select his men with a view to these requirements of
the game The general fielding capacity of a whole team depends on the
attention devoted to such dull points by the eleven minds not less
than on the suppleness of the eleven backbones No directions it has
already been said will make a bad field into a good one But it is
equally true that no advice should be offered which cannot be acted
upon Consequently only some duties of a fieldsman have been described
But it is not too much to say that a careful attention to these points
would ultimately turn eleven indifferent cricket players into a good
fielding team

In a work necessarily somewhat didactic as this is it may be
advisable to remind youngsters that the finger of scorn is pointed
even more to the very bad field than it is to the very bad batsman
or bowler A very bad bowler will not be asked to bowl unless the
bowling is hit into a thoroughly entangled knotas was the case in an
Australian v England match in  when every member of the English
team including Shrewsbury had to bowland then if he fails he has
only done what was expected of him But it is difficult for anybody
to explain except on the ground of gross carelessness how a man who
is a good bat or bowler can be so utterly useless as a field as some
have turned out to be The cricketer who never appears to have grasped
the rudiments of the laws concerning twist who is lazy and will not
run after the ball and who hardly by accident holds a catch is an
eyesore in cricket And let us also assure the young practitioner that
an intelligent audience though a somewhat rough one such as you
may see at places like Bramall Lane Sheffield will jeer in audible
and not too polite tones at the bad field long before it will do the
like at bad batsmen or bowlers Every cricketer knows the different
eccentricities of indifferent fields their wonderful varieties of
error and the specious appearance of some that fatally delude the most
patient captain There are some men who are fairly fast runners and
can throw hard and yet are fields of a character to make angels weep
They dash in at the ball like a man charging at football with the
result that they half stop it or after they stop it in attempting
to pick it up they kick it eight or ten yards behind them They never
seem to be able to judge what sort of length the ball will come into
their hands and never under any circumstances is the ball cleanly
handled And yet they go at it so heartily they move so quickly and
at first sight look so alert and full of promise that it is difficult
to condemn them until you have had two or three days experience of
them This sort belongs to the class we call the specious fieldsman
Then there is the man who might look at a batsman for two hours and yet
never discover where his favourite stroke is likely to go who obeys
orders strictly and when he has taken up the position assigned to
him stands there like a tree despite the fact that every ball hit in
his direction is a little too much on his right or on his left hand
This individual may safely be assumed to be a creature of a low order
of intelligence to whom Providence has probably vouchsafed a natural
instinct for bowling in the absence of which he would never be seen on
any cricketground again except as a spectator He is so stupid that
he never can excel in batting Then there is the man who is very slow
and has not acquired the merit of being what may be called an eminently
safe field His position when endeavouring to stop the ball is that
illustrated by the figure on the opposite page which shows what is
essentially the wrong position to assume Probably he will not touch
the ball with his hands and it certainly cannot be stopped by his legs
or feet He can hold a catch sometimes and stop a ball occasionally
but he does not succeed in these two particulars often enough to make
one forget or forgive his extraordinary slowness Another variety is
the man who fields tolerably well sometimes but when he fails to stop
a ball either runs after it very slowly which is the sulky form
or else dashes after it and throws it wildly and very hard anywhere
causing overthrows by the dozen and maiming his comrades fingers
This is the angry forman odious type let every youngster beware of
such and develop not into it Every cricketer ought to try to become as
good a field as he can by assiduous practicefor this reason if for
no other bowlers get disorganised when the fielding is loose

A natural curiosity is always evinced where a critic shows a tendency
to name certain celebrities in any form of game This is the reason why
we now proceed to praise famous men and famous fielding elevens but
let us add that we do not profess to name every good man who has ever
fielded and can only beg for forgiveness if we omit to mention some
who have deserved recognition

Illustration The wrong position for stopping the ball

The various Australian elevens have earned great fame for their
fielding in England and it was no doubt very good At the same time we
think it was not so good as their batting and certainly not so good as
their bowling The elevens of  and  which were the best no
doubt won their matches by allround play but if we had to name a weak
point we should say that as compared with the batting and bowling
it was their fielding although this was very good The Australians
themselves sayat least so we have heardthat the fielding in
Australia of the Hon Ivo Blighs eleven was never surpassed in the
colony and that must be high praise Still judging by what we know
of that team we think that we can point out higher standards in
England The finest fielding we have ever seen was that of the Players
in  in their annual match at Lords against the Gentlemen and at
the Oval it was nearly as good But that was only for two matches As
is natural University teams from their youth and habit of playing
together have earned great fame as fielding elevens and if we had to
select four elevens whose fielding reputation ought to be inscribed
on the highest pinnacles of fame we should name the Cambridge
representatives of  and  and the Oxford of  and 

The Cambridge celebrities of  and  have faded away into
distance and the present generation know not their names Both those
elevens had several fast bowlers in them and oneMr R Langwas
superlatively good It was owing to this fact that Cambridge had
to provide itself with a longstop and Mr H M Marshall in that
capacity has earned undying fame for longstopping on Lords Ground in
 and  was no laughing matter As general outfield Mr Marshall
also stood very high and was a perfectly safe catch Contemporary
cricketers of that day are nearly unanimous in their praise of Mr W
Bury as a fieldsman at longleg he has never been excelled There
were besides these the Hon C G Lyttelton at point and Mr R Lang
at shortslip Bells Life of that date mentions as a fact that
the fielding of Cambridge in the University match of  was never
equalled on Lords or any other ground Those were the days when the
bowling was mainly fast the ground rough and the cautious safe field
who got stolidly and fixedly in a certain position was often defeated
owing to the ball making unspeakable bounds It required a touch of
genius to be a grand field at Lords in those times and several
members of those two Cambridge elevens possessed it The two Oxford
elevens of  and  had each only one fast bowler but they had
magnificent fielding teams to support their slow bowlers When the
bowling is generally slow amateur wicketkeepers can hold their own
This was the case in  and  and in Mr H G Tylecote Oxford
possessed a wicketkeeper fully up to the mark for the work he had to
do It used to be a bone of contention between Messrs W Law and A
W Ridley the captains respectively of  and  as to which of
the two elevens was the greater in this particular line of fielding
Mr Law whose early death everyone who knew him deplores contended
that his eleven in  made no mistake in the InterUniversity match
whereas the  eleven did But the Cambridge batting in  was
fatuous to a degree and the Oxford eleven had nothing to stop whereas
Cambridge in  batted very well and kept their opponents hard at it
We are willing to give equal credit to each and to enshrine the names
of Law Game Ridley T B Jones and Royle in the temple of fame

It is not easy to gauge the merits of the fieldsmen of forty years
ago Some of them have made their names live Mr T A Anson as
wicketkeeper Mr R T King at point and the famous W Pickering
at coverpoint for instance But though they had rougher ground to
field on still the scoring was nothing like so large matches were not
nearly so numerous and the wear and tear far from being so great The
first thing that strikes one on reading over old scores and comparing
them with those of the present day is the enormous number of extras
that were then given Bowlers were no doubt faster but they bowled
many more wides Taking one year at random  we find that for the
whole season Yorkshire in all matches only bowled eight wides five
of which were delivered by the famous Tom Emmett who is no doubt a
slightly erratic bowler In the days of Redgate and Mynn the wides were
numerous so were the noballs and frequently the extras contributed
more to the total than any one batsman If the bowling was fast and
erratic one cannot wonder that byes became numerous especially when
the rough ground is also considered In the University match of 
Oxford gave Cambridge  extras out of a combined total of a
very large average In  Cambridge only gave Oxford  extras in a
combined total of  and Oxford lost but three wickets in the second
innings In the same year Oxford gave Cambridge only  extras in a
grand total of  Though bowling is generally slower now than forty
years ago still in former days they used to have longstops to bowling
that even amateur wicketkeepers would now stop The longstopping
wicketkeeperthat is the wicketkeeper that lets nothing pass
himis a marvellous testimony to the excellence of modern grounds the
accuracy of modern bowling and the skill of the men themselves The
sight of Blackham standing close up to the wicket stopping Spofforth
and Palmer would have made our forefathers look on aghast In the
wellknown print of the Sussex and Kent match in  old Lillywhite
is bowling and he was a slow mediumpace bowler yet though Tom Box
was reckoned the best wicketkeeper of the day he has a longstop to
Lillywhites bowling

We may now try to enumerate the greater fields of cricket history We
read of the marvellous feat of Mr T A Anson at the wicket when he
stumped a man off a legshooter of Alfred Mynn one of the fastest
bowlers of the period We yield the place of honour to Mr Anson for an
individual feat but it is alleged to have taken place a long time ago
and is it certain to be true The greatest wicketkeepers since 
in England have been Lockyer Pooley Pilling Pinder Storer Lilley
and D Hunter and we ask Plumb and Sherwin to forgive us It is not
easy to discriminate between these we merely remark that to genuine
slows of the pace of Southerton Peate and Tyler we reckon Pooley
to have been the best that ever lived and to the very fast Pinder
and Storer were unequalled Still Pooley was relatively not so good to
fast nor Pinder to slow and on the whole they may be left on an
equality The best wicketkeepers of old days were Mr Herbert Jenner
Mr T A Anson Mr W Ridding and Mr W Nicholson among amateurs
and E G Wenman and Tom Box among professionals The two best English
amateur wicketkeepers that ever lived in our opinion are Mr Alfred
Lyttelton and Mr McGregor and besides them since  there have
been Mr Leatham Mr Bush Mr Newton Mr E F S Tylecote Mr
Philipson Mr Kemble and Mr Gay

Perhaps a word would not be out of place here respecting Mr Blackham
the celebrated Australian wicketkeeper When the Colonial Eleven
came over in    and  practically the whole of the
wicketkeeping had to be done by Mr Blackham In  and  Mr
Jarvis assisted him Now wicketkeeping is essentially an amusement
you can have too much of In old days when there was a lot of fast
bowling the cream of the wicketkeeping used to be seen during the
first six weeks of the season because during that time the hands of
the wicketkeeper were more or less sound The famous George Pinder at
the beginning of his career had faster bowling to keep to consistently
than any other cricketer before or since Freeman Emmett and Atkinson
were three very fast bowlers and they all three played for Yorkshire
and after them came Hill and Ulyett Pinder in consequence very
frequently damaged his hands and no wonder Blackham however during
all the four years we have mentioned had Spofforth and either Garratt
or Palmer to stop Now although these were not so fast as the Yorkshire
lot they bowled a goodish pace the Australian season consisted of two
matches a week from the beginning to the end of the cricket year and
Blackham did not get very many days off When his record is examined
therefore we think that his performances during these four years
constitute the greatest wicketkeeping feats on record Not unless
Spofforth bowled his fastest did he ever have a longstop and he
held his hands closer to the wicket than any other wicketkeeper we
ever saw If the batsman was an inch out of his ground for a second
or so the ball would be put down and a stumpout resulted for the
hands had no distance to travel and no time was lost Of course the
bowling he had to stop was very accurate but when the amount of
wicketkeeping that he had to go through and the number of wickets he
got are considered our opinion is that Mr Blackham was the finest
wicketkeeper to bowling of all paces that the world has ever seen

There have been numerous fieldsmen at point who have made themselves
a name and by universal testimony in his day Mr R T King
of Cambridge University was not approached in excellence in this
position The late Mr John Walker who was intimately acquainted with
cricket of that period as well as with that of a later date once told
the writer that in his opinion none of the modern points ever came
quite up to Mr Kings level Since  Carpenter R C Tinley E M
Grace and F W Wright have earned high reputations in this position
but a great many excel at point and in the University match alone
there has been some admirable fielding here the Hon J W Mansfield
for Cambridge and Mr Hildyard for Oxford both being very good
The place where good fielding is most conspicuous is midway between
coverpoint and midoff and with this post the name of Mr G B Studd
is for ever identified In later days Briggs Moorhouse Gregory the
Australian Mr Andrews of Sussex and Wainwright excel in this place
Mr Royle at coverpoint has never been excelled and the same may be
said of Gunn at third man The celebrated fieldsmen of old were Mr W
Pickering at coverpoint John Bickley and Mr R Lang at shortslip
Mr E S E Hartopp Mr H M Marshall W Pilch A Diver W
Mortlock and J Thewlis at longstop while F Bell W Bury John
Smith and A Lubbock were excellent at a distance from the wicket
There have been also and are many fields who were and are good at any
place for instance the renowned Mr V E Walker and the still more
famous Mr W G Grace We have said before and we say it again that
the fielding though probably as good as ever it was is not so good as
it ought to be The nuisance of the day is the long scoring we wonder
how many innings of  are played where you do not read the wellknown
remark the batsman gave a chance at  another at  and a third
just before he was out but none the less he played a fine innings
The following brief epigram is undoubtedly trueGood fielding makes
weak bowling strong and strong batsmen weak An eleven that is really
A in fielding very rarely has to field out for  runs When we say
this we feel inclined to go further and add that if no feasible catches
are dropped this total of  runs would not be of anything but the
rarest occurrence This fact ought of itself to be sufficient to make
every true cricketer try and become if not a brilliant field at any
rate one who when a catch is sent him does not cause a thrill of
agonising anxiety to arise in the minds of the supporters of the side
to which he belongs

CHAPTER VII

COUNTRY CRICKET

BY F GALE


I can remember the first cricket match I ever saw as well as if it
happened yesterday and moreover I can give the names and description
of many of the players

The locus in quo was the meadow opposite the Green Lion at Rainham
in Kent which is situated halfway between London and Dover The
cricket field is now built over It adjoined the vicarage garden in
which a stand was erected for my brother and myself and from which we
as little boys saw the first game of cricket we ever witnessed in the
summer of  as we had come into Kent from a Wiltshire village where
cricket was not known

Our grand stand was immediately behind the wicket Farmer Miles
a finesetup man was the best bowler and he bowled underarm
rather a quick medium pace and pitched a good length and bowled very
straight his balls curling in from the leg for be it remembered that
but two years had elapsed since it was allowable to turn the hand
knuckles uppermost in delivery I was seven years old at the time
and was perfectly fascinated at the sight and as the gardener an
old cricketer stood by me all day and explained the game before the
sun had set I had mastered most of the main points in it One thing I
am certain of which is that there was an onbreak from Farmer Miles
bowling for I watched the balls pitch and curl

Illustration MITCHAM GREEN

The dress of the cricketers was white duck trousers and flannel
jackets and some wore tall black hats and some large straw hats A
few old fogies veterans who played had a silk pockethandkerchief
tied round the left knee so that they could drop down on it without
soiling their white trousers for in the rough outfielding when the
balls jumped about anyhow oldfashioned fieldsmen would drop on one
knee so that if the ball went through their hands by a false bound
their body was in the way Josiah Taylor the brazier was longstop
and played in black leather slippers with one spike in the heel which
he claimed as his own invention as cricketshoes were little known
The umpire was Ost the barber who appeared in a long blue frockcoat
like Logics the Oxonian in Tom and Jerry and who volunteered
hout to a fieldsman who stopped a bumpball and when remonstrated
with by men of both sides remarked Surely first bounce is hout
at cricket and trap This occasioned a change of umpire There were
two very hard hitters Charles Smart a tall young fellow son of a
rich farmer and Billy Wakley a very stout tall young farmer there
were many hits to the longfield off and on which were well held and
Charles Watson a promising lad of about sixteen the butchers son
who played for the first time in a mans match immortalised himself
by making a long catch close to the vicarage hedge The batting mostly
consisted of hardhitting and the catching was good The booth was
made up of rickcloths strained over a standing skeleton woodwork
frame and on the right of it was a round table with six or eight
armchairs placed on either side a large brass square tobaccobox out
of which those who sat round the privileged table could help themselves
by putting a halfpenny into a slit which caused the box to open on
the same principle as the chocolate and sweetstuff automatic pillars
seen now at railway stations kept company with a stack of claypipes
The armchairs were for the accommodation of the principal farmers and
magnates of the parish who subscribed to the matches and who sat in
state and smoked their pipesas cigars were little knownand drank
their grog out of rummerslarge glasses which stood on one gouty leg
each and held a shillings worth of brandy and water and for the
accommodation of the smokers the ostler who always appeared in his
Sunday best costume which consisted of a Sam Weller waistcoat with
black calico sleeves brown drab breeches and topboots provided a
stable horn lanthorn the candle in which he lit with the aid of the
flint and steel tinder box and brimstone matches for lucifers were
not yet invented

Another honour belonged to the knights of the round table as the
cricket ground was bounded on the southern side by the high road
and as coaches were passing all day the drivers never forgot the
Coachmans Salute with whip and elbow and nod of the head as they
drove by and this was always returned by a cheery wave of the hand
from the cricket ground The patriarchs of the village had a form to
themselves on the left hand of the booth and old Billy Coppin the
halfpay naval purser who had a snug little house on the bank of the
roadside sat outside his door waving his pipe and crying out Make
sail my lads make sail whenever a good hit was made

When the match was over one of the villagers an illtempered
thatcher who was always ready for a setto picked a quarrel with
someone from a neighbouring parish and they adjourned to a quiet
corner close to our grand stand behind the booth pulled off their
shirts and had a pretty stiff rough and tumble fight which I
described in my innocence at supper when I went in and thereby got
the gardener into a scrape for allowing me to see it A very serious
relative told me that she was cock sure of the future fate of the two
men who fought quoting cases out of Dr Wattss hymns Let us hope
that some of the Doctors tips have proved wrong

Would you be surprised to hear as Lord Coleridge was always saying
that with the exception that cricket has much improved as regards
grounds and some of the implements in general use oldfashioned
village cricket in its true and pure spirit still flourishes in many
rural districts and not very far from London even now You will find
this happy state of things mostly where village greens exist in a real
cricketing county and having formerly devoted much of my leisure
during very many years to country cricket I can speak from actual
experience down to present date

In the first place every village green has a history of its own and
the people are proud of their old traditions On many of these greens
some of the bestknown cricketers in England have from time to time
appeared during a century past and some come there occasionally now
during every summer so the cricketers of all classes have always had
good models to work from The green is common to all and all have a
common interest in the honour of the parish This charming home feeling
is admirably described by Miss Mitford in the Tales of our Village
and she has not exaggerated it The consequence is that by one consent
the centre of the green is always left for good matches and as every
village boy learns the management of turf you would be surprised to
see what an admirable pitch youngsters of fourteen or fifteen years of
age will make for themselves on somewhat rough ground with the aid of a
fivepronged fork a wateringpot and a handroller and you would be
surprised to see what real good cricket many of them play Of course
there is always a sprinkling of sons of good cricketers who have been
well taught and they have the opportunity of instruction from old
players

The training of village boys is very analogous to cricket fagging at
school and anyone who takes an interest in village cricket will do
well when he and a few friends practise to have any little boys of
twelve or thirteen who show any proficiency to field out for them and
to encourage them with a few coppers making them understand that the
honorarium is dependent on their trying to do their best The next step
is to take a lively interest in the boys eleven which consists of
boys under fourteen or fifteen to promote their matches in every way
and to inculcate the value of fair play It does them a great deal of
good if an old cricketer will spare half an hour when the boys are
practising to criticise their play pointing out any faults such as
running over the crease bowling no balls not backing up for a run
explaining to them the principles of running and calling their partner
secrets which some really good batsmen never have learned and never
will learn and so on The grand thing is to try and make cricket
real and to make youngsters understand that playing the strict game
is the secret of true enjoyment We all know how all pleasure depends
on observance of simple rules and on doing in practice all things
as carefully as if we are engaged in a match or any other friendly
strife Even if I play at beggar your neighbour with a child I insist
on the rigour of the game Many of us must know as cricketers too
that long after we had given up playing in matches there was immense
pleasure in having a firstrate professional on a real good wicket to
bowl with sixpence on the wicket

The very mention of single wicket now is like the mention of jalap and
rhubarb and calomel and bleeding those terrible remedies of the past
to a modern doctor but single wicket with seven or eight in the field
is the finest practice for training and we found it so on our village
green a very few years ago played thus Every mans hand was against
his neighbours in turn and there were no sides Of course with six
or seven in the field byes and hits behind wicket counted and this
fact made the youngsters try to cover as much ground as possible The
batsman went out if he got ten runs and as in these games there was
at least one good professional bowler it took a good man to score
ten runs The professional and any amateur who had any pretence of
being a bowler changed about These games were very good for putting
a youngster into and I have seen three or four hundred people on the
green watching one of these trials It was also a good thing in the
event of a substitute being wanted in a good match to try one of them
as it accustomed an aspirant to accept responsibility and to play
before a crowd It is a wholesome state of things when young cricketers
are at hand anxious to fill a vacancy it shows zeal

Anyone who has charge of village cricket falls very short of his duty
if he does not arrange at least one real practice afternoon a day or
two before a match He must have a good wicket made and all who are
going to play in the match must come for some part of the play And
this is a good opportunity for letting young bowlers come and try their
hand with sixpence on the wicket I have much faith in that sixpence
on the wicket It is useless to waste any trouble on a boy who has not
got cricket at heart but it is a great deal of use training one who
has The difficult stage is when a boys strength is growing and he
is old enough to be taught strict cricket as regards defence and in
trying to steady him down you must be sure to steer clear of the evil
of cramping his hitting power We know from experience that sometimes
matches are lost or draws made owing to the want of a man who will
go in and hit In my boyhood days there used generally to be one or
perhaps two in every eleven who could field splendidly and who made
no pretence to scientific batting but who aided by a strong nerve
and quick eye and a heavy driving bat could sometimes make a terrible
example of the bowling and help the score Mr Absolom of Cambridge
and afterwards of the Kent eleven was one of this class He was worth
playing in any eleven in England for his bowling fielding and hard
work and if he never made his runs his share towards success was
as great as those who made a score The thing to burn into a young
players mind is that unless he can concentrate all his thoughts on
the match in which he is playing he will never be an English cricketer
He may perhaps by long practice acquire the knack of getting a lot of
runs and building up an average but if that is all that he is worth
he had much better never have been in the eleven at all Amongst eleven
men some are sure to get a lot of runs generally but the men who win
matches are those who prevent the other side getting them Take one of
the best samples of cricket in the season of  as a proof of what
saving runs means I think that anyone who knows the game can hardly
help coming to the conclusion that Gunn in the long field saved more
runs in  than the best man made and saved a good many more too
The Australians put their main trust in their field and they taught
us a good lesson when they came first and it has done us good Gunns
batting is often equal to his fielding to say nothing of his bowling

Now we come to a more serious mattermanagement and finance and
unless the world has very much changed in the last few years anyone
who takes a new lead in country cricket will find himself surrounded
by hosts of friends  who are worth nothing They will all want to
come on the committee and make all kind of wild suggestions about a
stock of club bats pads and gloves c There is only one antidote to
this which is to stand firm on one pointthat no public subscriptions
shall be asked for for any purpose other than keeping the green in
order paying for balls for matches matchstumps hire of tents
umpires scorers and other inevitable expenses the simple inducement
for subscriptions being the having a few good matches during the
season and keeping up a ground for the use of those who cannot pay for
themselves Unless you keep up a good parish eleven everyone will do
as he thinks best and the whole green will be cut to pieces and will
never be repaired

In these days you cannot get an eleven who will make a good stand in
a match without some professional training Many places are fortunate
enough to have an old professional or two amongst its inmates men who
have given up grand public matches but who are worth their weight in
gold as practice bowlers trainers and members of the village eleven
Men of this class who will play in a match for ten shillings or will
come in the evening after work for a crown or so and who are always
on the spot are the best aids towards keeping together a good set of
young players and forming an eleven They know the young players and
take a pride in them and will find out their failings and good points
and nothing cheers a captain more than an invitation from a local
professional to come and see Bill Smith or Tom Brown bat When such an
invitation is given you may be sure that the professional has found a
recruit who can play a length ball with a straight bat and confidence
and who can punish a loose ball You will find numberless cricketers
who can get runsif they once get set but like precious stones many
get spoilt in the setting What you want is batsmen who in wet or
fine weather on rough or smooth ground will go in with nerve to have
a good try If you want a few runs today from A and he breaks down
through that cricket malady called funk it is no consolation to hear
from his claqueur B that A got seventy not out last week

You must try and raise the standard of a village eleven by letting
them play when you have the chance against teams who are stronger than
themselves A licking is good medicine for them sometimes and if on
the other hand they win by the chances of the game a victory of this
kind sets their tails up The worst thing for them is playing against
weak teams making a tremendous score and knocking their opponents
wickets over for a few runs It is astonishing how a captain by
working steadily on can educate his party as the late Lord
Beaconsfield said and if by quiet persuasion he can influence some of
the rougher element to abandon their horseplay and flowery language
and to assist in keeping good orderat the same time warning them that
ladies and gentlemen are kept away from the green for fear of their
ears being contaminated by rough languagehe will find that visitors
who come prepared for a noisy rude crowd will be surprised to find
perfect order and if some one trangresses the bounds of good manners
he will hear a cry of Better language there This kind of thing can
be and has been done and the result was that in a place where the
possibility of such a thing as a ladies tent on the green was laughed
at not only was the ladies tent a great success but subscriptions
flowed in in a wonderful manner One dear old ladyan Exeter Haller
who took omnibuses full of people to hear Sankey and Moodysent two
guineas for the green which is now I believe a place of innocent
amusement and happiness as she stated in her letter She was a
good Christian as her house stood deep longleg and many a time has
a four been scored for a hit through her windowand this is fact
With the enormous number of large schools in England where cricket
is played it will seldom happen that any cricket neighbourhood has
not some young fellows from school or possibly a few from either
University close by and if they happen to be of the right sort they
are a great boon At the same time it should be a golden rule never to
put out of the eleven a good one who has worked for and earned his
place for a swell The rule must be kept hard and fast that the
eleven is open only to those who have proved themselves good enough
and if that rule is observed in the event of a real firstrate amateur
turning up you will generally find that more than one volunteer will
offer to stand out for him

Captaining a village team is not all a bed of roses but if you are
really a cricketer at heart you will soon acquire the absolute
confidence of people of all classes especially of the humbler order
It is not an unpleasant thing as you walk across the green on your way
to the train to hear a pack of little boys on their way to school
who look on you as a kind of big dog that wont bite all chattering
about the match the day before Ah Sir I heerd my father say that he
won a pot over the match says one That boy Sir got the stick for
playing truant yesterday morning says another Well if I did
replies the culprit I see the beginning of the match and you did
notthere That boy may be another Fuller Pilch some day

And if you are sitting in the tent when your side is in revolving
many things in your mind and you feel that the whites of the eyes of
Mr Chummy the sweep a good cricketer formerly who sits on a form
just outside the tent behind a very short pipe are glancing round
on you what a comfort it is if you turn round to see an almost
imperceptible nod of Mr Chummys headfor he never speaks during a
matchwhich says Going on all rightwe shall win That nod of
the head is only intelligible to a cricketer just as a very shy
rise of a trout is only perceptible to a genuine fisherman Those
too only who have known some celebrated cricketer from childhood and
have watched his career and promotion from the little boys to the big
boys eleven and eventually to the parish eleven and have seen his
cricket talent developed from year to year until he appears in his
county team can imagine how painful is the excitement to those who
are interested in his success It has been my fate to go throughI
had almost said the agony ofthat state of suspense many times and I
must relate one instance A young player twenty years old after my
earnest entreaty was allotted a place in the county eleven He broke
ground in London against Notts and at his dbut had to stand the
fire of Alfred Shaw and J C Shaw Directly I saw him play the first
ball my mind was quite at rest as he showed that he had not the stage
sickness He got twelve runs in an hour and a quarter His next public
appearance in London was a caution as he scored  not out in his
first innings against Cambridge University and going in first scored
 in his second innings This occurred nearly twenty years ago when
cricketers played with their bats and not with their pads and boundary
hits except against the pavilion were unknown so fifty runs was a
grand score I never shall forget my feelings when the colt had made
 within  of his  I could look no more when all of a sudden
I heard a roar from the crowd which told me that our village boy had
done it The secretary of the club said He must have his sovereign
for fifty runs and he promised me that if he made thirty more which
would make a total of  including his  not out he would give
him two sovereigns if I would give him one for his first fifty I
undertook to raise that capital whereupon a stranger a very tall
handsome gentlemanly man said And I will give him a sovereign too
for turning to myself your excitement which I found was only
occasioned by interest in a village boy and not heavy betting as I
imagined has done me real good I have been for thirty years in India
and am going back again in a month and nothing pleased me more than
to find this keen love of sport still existing He would not give his
name and I could never find out who he was possibly he is alive and
may read this and may let us know who he was for I am sure he has not
forgotten it Richard Humphrey was the colt and I sent for him into
the Pavilion and the illustrious stranger shook hands with him and
gave him the sovereign

The foregoing remarks about clubs apply to a country place with some
pretensions to firstrate cricket and a village green In a rural
outoftheway place where the population consists of a class which
cockney writers call Hodge and which we call chawbacons bats and
balls and stumps and all implements must be provided by subscription
In all other cases those who want to play cricket must pay for their
own cricket things If a good ground is provided the cricket ought to
grow of itself And this country cricket must cost a good deal of
money perhaps you will remark Of course it does so does fishing
or shooting or hunting or any other sport There are many men who
want to skim the cream of the cricket and to play in a good home match
who will not play in an out match because they have not time really
because they are too stingy If you mean cricket you must back it
everywhere with all your heart and all your strength Whatever you do
never forget the windup match and supper at the end of the season and
get some good cricketers from amongst your foes to join and above all
a parson or two if possible In these days I need not say abolish all
ribald songs and drunkenness as cricketers have good manners now

As a last word I must say something for country umpires When
changes in the game are proposed a lot of outsiders who try
their hardest to prevent penal laws being made intelligible on
the ground that the change will put too much on the umpires
shouldersespecially country umpires are talking nonsense In the
days of Caldecourt John Bayley Tom Barker and Good at Lords
umpires did their duty without fear or favour and did not let men
cheat and the same stamp of umpires still exists in counties and
on many a village green and if there are any umpires on public
grounds who cannot administer the law fearlessly they had better be
supplanted by those who can If batsmen in the past had shamelessly
stopped the ball with their pads without offering at the ball with
their bat country umpires would have given them out for unfair play
on the same principle as wilfully obstructing the field I suppose
they would call it lbw and the crowd would have given the retiring
batsman  a very cold reception or perhaps a very hot one neither
extreme of heat or cold is pleasant The late Chief Justice Cockburn
said of county magistrates They may sometimes administer bad law
but generally good justice and the remark applies to villagegreen
umpires




CHAPTER VIII

BORDER CRICKET

BY ANDREW LANG


Mr Gale has been saying his very pleasant say on country cricket in
England A Border player in his declining age may be allowed to
make a few remarks on the game as it used to be played in pleasant
Teviotdale and generally from Berwick all along the Tweed The first
time I ever saw ball and bat must have been about  The gardeners
boy and his friends were playing with homemade bats made out of
firwood with the bark on and with a guttapercha ball The game
instantly fascinated me and when I once understood why the players ran
after making a hit the essential difficulties of comprehension were
overcome Already the border towns Hawick Kelso Selkirk Galashiels
had their elevens To a small boy the spectacle of the various red and
blue caps and shirts was very delightful The grounds were as a rule
very rough and bad Generally the play was on haughs level pieces of
townland beside the rivers Then the manufacturers would encroach on
the cricketfield and build a mill on it and cricket would have to
seek new settlements This was not the case at Hawick where the Duke
of Buccleuch gave the town a capital ground which is kept in very good
order

In these early days when one was only a small spectator ay and in
later days too the great difficulty of cricket was that excellent
thing in itself too much patriotism Almost the whole population of
a town would come to the ground and take such a keen interest in the
fortunes of their side that the other side if it won was in some
danger of rough handling Probably no one was ever much hurt indeed
the squabbles were rather a sham fight than otherwise but still bad
feeling was caused by umpires decisions Then relations would be
broken off between the clubs of different towns and sometimes this
tedious hostility endured for years The causes were the excess of
local feeling and perhaps the too great patriotism of umpires Not
out one of them said when a member of the Oxford eleven playing
for his townclub was most emphatically infringing some rule I can
not give Maister Tom out first ball the umpire added and his case
was common enough Professional umpires if they could be got might be
expected to prove more satisfactory than excited amateurs who forgot to
look after no balls or to count the number of balls in an over But
even professionals if they were attached to the club or school were
not always the embodiment of justice

The most exciting match I think in which I ever took part was for
Loretto against another school In those days we were very weak
indeed When our last man went in second innings we were still four
runs behind our opponents first score This last man was extremely
shortsighted and the game seemed over But his partner a very
steady player kept the bowling and put on some thirtyeight more
We put our adversaries in to get this and had lowered eight wickets
for twentyeight I was bowling and appealed to the umpire of our
opponents for a palpable catch at wicket Not out Next ball the
batsman was caught at longstop and a fielder triumphantly shouted
Well hows that

Not out replied the professional again and we lost the match by two
wickets

If this had happened on the Border there would have been trouble and
perhaps the two clubs would not have met again for years I have no
doubt that a more equable feeling has come in among those clubs which
retained a good deal of the sentiments of rival clans The Borderers
played too much as if we were still in the days of Scotts and Carrs
and as if it were still our purpose

    To tame the Unicorns pride
      Exalt the Crescent and the Star

Sir Walter Scott encouraged this ardour at football when he caused
to be unfurled for the first time since  the ancient banner of
Buccleuch with its broidered motto Bellendaine The dalesmen the
people from the waters of Yarrow Ettrick and Teviot played against
the souters of Selkirk all across country the goals being Ettrick
and Yarrow The townsmen scored the first goal when the Galashiels
folk came in as allies of the shepherds and helped them to win a goal
Then began a murder grim and great and Scott himself was mobbed in
the evening But he knew how to turn wrath into laughter

Tis sixty years since and more but this perfervid ardour while it
makes Border cricket very exciting is perhaps even now a trifle too
warm The great idea perhaps in all country cricket is not so much to
have a pleasant days sport win or lose but to win merely Men play
for victory as Dr Johnson talked rather than for cricket This has
its advantages it conduces to earnestness But it does not invariably
promote the friendliness of a friendly game

Border cricket is very pleasant because it is played in such a
pleasant country You see the angler going to Tweedside or Teviot
and pausing to watch the game as he strolls by the cricketground The
hills lie all around these old unmoved unchangeable spectators of
mans tragedy and sport The broken towers of Melrose or Jedburgh or
Kelso look down on you They used to look down as well they might
on very bad wickets Thanks to this circumstance the present writer
for the first and only time in his existence once did the hat trick
at Jedburgh and took three wickets with three consecutive balls Now
the grounds are better and the scores longer but not too long You
seldom hear of  in one innings on the Border

In my time the bowling was roundhand and pretty straight and to a
length as a general rule Perhaps or rather certainly the proudest
day of my existence was when I was at home for the holidays and was
chosen to play and bowl for the town eleven against Hawick I have
the score still and it appears that I made havoc among Elliots
Leydens and Drydens But they were too strong for our Scotts
Johnstons and Douglasses it is a pleasure to write the old names
of the Border clans in connection with cricket The batting was not
nearly so good then as it is now professional instruction was almost
unknown Men blocked timidly and we had only one great hitter Mr
John Douglas but how gallantly he lifted the soaring ball by the banks
of Ettrick At that time we had a kind of family team composed of
brothers and other boys so small that we called ourselves Les Enfants
Perdus The name was appropriate enough I think we only once won a
match and that victory was achieved over Melrose But we kept the
game going on and played in all weathers and on any kind of wickets
Very small children would occasionally toddle up and bowl when the
elder members of the family were knocked off Finally as they grew in
stature the team developed into The Eccentric Flamingoes then the
only wandering Border club We wore black and red curiously disposed
and had a good many Oxford members The Flamingoes coming down from
Oxford full of pride had once a dreadful day on the Edinburgh Academy
Ground We were playing the School which made a portentous score and
I particularly remember that Mr T R Marshall probably the best
Scotch bat who ever played and then a boy hit two sixes and a five
off three consecutive balls It is a very great pity that this Border
bat is so seldom seen at Lords his average for MCC in  was 
The Flamingoes lasted for some years and played all Teviotdale and
Tweedside

In those days we heard little of Dumfries and Galloway cricket into
which Steels Tylecotes and Studds have lately infused much life In
recent years Lord Dalkeith Lord George Scott and Mr Maxwell Scott
of Abbotsford have contributed very much to the growth of Border
cricket Money has never been very plentiful north of Tweed and when
scarcely any but artisans played the clubs could not afford good
grounds or much professional instruction In these respects there
has been improvement Perhaps the boys cricket was not sufficiently
watched and encouraged Veterans used to linger on the stage with a
mythical halo round them of their great deeds in the Sixties Perhaps
the rising generation is now more quickly promoted and better coached
than of old I feel a hesitation in offering any criticism because I
had only one quality of a cricketer enthusiasm combined for a year
or two with some twist from leg But if I never was anything of an
expert my heart hath always been with those old happy scenes and happy
days of struggling cricket What jolly journeys we had driving under
the triple crest of Eildon to Kelso or down Tweed to Galashiels or
over the windy moor to Hawick How keen we were and how carried beyond
ourselves with joy in the success of a sturdy slogger or a brilliant
field There were sudden and astonishing developments of genius Does
J J A among his savages on the other side of the globe remember
how he once took to witching the world by making incredible and almost
impossible catches Audisne Amphiarae Michael Russell Wyer I am
sure among Parsee cricketers has not forgotten his swashing blow But
one of whom the poet declared that he would

    Push into Indus into Ganges flood
    While all Calcutta sings the praise of Budd

will no more push leg balls among the slips

    No longer make a wild and wondrous score
    And poke where never mortal poked before

This is the melancholy of mortal things

As Mr Prowse sang

    The game we have not strength to play
    Seems somehow better than before

Our wickets keep falling in this life One after the other goes down
They are becoming few who joined in those Border matches where there
was but one lady spectator when we made such infrequent runs and
often dropped a catch but never lost heart never lost pleasure in the
game Some of them may read this and remember old friends gone old
games played old pewters drained old pipes smoked old stories told
remember the leghitting of Jack Grey the bowling of Bill Dryden and
of Clement Glassford the sturdy defence of William Forman And he who
writes recalling that simple delight and good fellowship recalling
those kind faces and merry days in the old land of Walter Scott may
make his confession and may say that such years were worth living
for and that neither study nor praise nor any other pleasure has
equalled or can equal the joy of having been young and a cricketer
where

    The oak and the ash and the bonny ivy tree
    They flourish best at home in the North Countrie

                                   

It is long since the writer has played in Border cricket or even
seen the game in those quarters A more modern sportsman and an
infinitely better player has kindly drawn up a few observations made
in recent years On the whole nothing it seems is altered The game
is played mainly as of old by the stalwart artisans There is little
patronage from the counties and the middle classes are sunk in golf
Money therefore is scarce and while very fair wickets are provided
the outfielder is harassed by difficulties of ground in many cases
Time also is scarce and thus lack of wealth prevents the Borderers
from doing themselves justice At Langholm the family of the Duke of
Buccleuch the Langholm Lordies set an example and at Dalbeattie
in Galloway Steels as of old Studds and Tylecotes play in autumn
Mr Maxwell of Glenlee now dead and Mr Maxwell Scott of Abbotsford
were recently patrons of the game On the whole however money and
encouragement are sadly lacking

The play I gather has improved and the employment of professionals
has doubtless contributed to this result There is a danger however
of depending too much on the professionals who take part in the
matches between the clubs The difficulties of umpiring are overcome in
matches for the Border Cup by the assistance of strangers who truly
and indifferently minister justice In other matches I am told the
umpires being members of the rival clubs are apt to suffer from the
personal bias and from accesses of local patriotism This defect is
not absolutely confined to the Border Football a game entailing less
expenditure of money and time is naturally better rooted and more
flourishing than cricket It is also less dependent on weather On the
whole improvement both in skill and in the wickets is to be noted and
I conceive that a match is much less likely than of old to degenerate
into a Border brawl But cricket is not the national game of the
country which gave birth to golf and can hold her own at football

CHAPTER IX

HOW TO SCORE

BY W G GRACE


Ask any player who has scored over a hundred in an innings if he felt
any particular influence at work on the morning of the match and he
will probably answer in the negative but press him and he will admit
that he felt fit and well and that the feeling was owing to a good
nights rest together with the careful training of days and weeks I
am aware that there are exceptions to this rule and that players have
been known to score largely after a night of high feasting and dancing
but in my own experience whilst admitting that occasional freaks of
this kind have been followed by moderately large scores I cannot
recollect many of my big innings that were not the results of strict
obedience to the rules which govern the training for all important
athletic contests Temperance in food and drink regular sleep and
exercise I have laid down as the golden rule from my earliest
cricketing days I have carefully adhered to this rule and to it in a
great degree I attribute the scores that stand to my name in cricket
history and the measure of health and strength I still enjoy

Early in the season every cricketer knows the difficulty of getting
his eye in but though he may be disappointed at the small score
attached to his name match after match he plays steadily on trusting
that by constant practice the coveted hundred will come If he hopes to
score largely he must be careful in his manner of living and moderate
in all things even though nature may have blessed him with exceptional
wrist power and sight

The capacity for making long scores is not a thing of a days growth
and it may be years before strength and skill come and enable the
young cricketer to bear the fatigue of a long innings He cannot begin
too early to play carefully and earnestly and in all club and school
practice the lad should play as if he were engaged in an important
match and the result depended upon his individual efforts In my own
case thanks to careful guidance I was early taught to keep my wicket
up never to hit recklessly always to play straight or goodlength
balls with force and if possible away from the fielders Habits of
that kind thoughtfully cultivated will not desert you in firstclass
cricket Great scores at cricket like great work of any kind are as
a rule the results of years of careful and judicious training and not
accidental occurrences

If you have occasion to travel a considerable distance to play make an
effort to get to your destination the night before or at least some
time before the match begins There is nothing so fatiguing to the
eyesight as a long railway journey and going straight from the railway
station to the wicket is often fatal to long scoring

I have tried hard especially of late years to arrange so that I could
reach the ground in good time and save everything in the shape of hurry
or bustle There are but few cricket grounds within a hundred miles of
each other where the light and conditions are alike and it takes some
time for eye and mind to accommodate themselves to new surroundings
You will find it just as trying to play in a blaze of sunshine after
three days of smoke and leaden skies as you will in a change from the
sunny south to the bleak sunless north

You must also not only bear in mind the vast importance of reaching
the ground in good time but the greater importance of getting five
or ten minutes batting practice before the innings begins Very few
grounds are the same as regards the way in which the ball rises off
the pitch even if the light be similar to that you have been playing
in for days and it requires nothing short of a genius for the game to
change from a fast to a slow wicket and play with the same ease and
confidence

I shall not readily forget an experience that came to me in  when
I travelled from London to Brighton to play for the Gentlemen against
the Players for the benefit of John Lillywhite Being very much younger
than I am now I was blessed with clearness of vision and quickness of
action that suited themselves very readily to most conditions of light
and ground Perhaps it was the inexperience of youth that led me to
put off reaching the old Brunswick ground at Hove until the moment of
beginning my innings This I know I felt as fit as ever I did in my
life walked to the wicket with confidence and took my guard carefully
to the bowling of J C Shaw He was on at the seashore end and there
was a glare on the water delighting the artistic eye I have no doubt
but to me shifting and dancing like a will o the wisp There is no
need to deny the fact I was all abroad to his first ball and knew it
had beaten me before it came within two yards of me I tried hard to
play it but the ominous rattle told me I had failed and I returned to
the pavilion and made the mental note The dazzling light the railway
journey and want of five minutes practice did it I had no desire to
repeat the performance in the second innings and had little fear of
doing so I took care to have some practice and scored  my brother
G F made  and we increased the total by  runs in two and a half
hours

There is this also to be said in favour of five or ten minutes
batting practice before a match that it enables you to test pads
gloves and shoes To have the fastening of a glove or pad break off
when you are well set is a disagreeable and annoying interruption It
takes some time to put things right and when you return to the wicket
the confidence you felt has very likely to a great extent deserted you
And how often have you placed your boots in your bag all the spikes
seemingly firm to find one or two missing after you have been batting
for a few minutes One has gone out of the toe of your boot and you
play forward to a ball miss your footing and get stumped or one has
vanished from the heel and you are called by your partner for a short
run sent back again slip and get run out Inattention to these
apparently small points causes annoyance and may prevent you from
getting a long score

You are now ready to go in and if you are first on the list you may do
it leisurely but if you follow first wicket down or later impress
strongly upon your mind that it is your duty to get to the wicket
within the limit of time the law allows and as quickly as possible
particularly if your partner has got his eye in and looks like making
a large score You will expect a like consideration when your turn
comes to wait and nothing upsets a player so much as having to loiter
three or four minutes when he is warm and at home with the bowling
especially when he knows there is no need for delay There will be a
lack of confidence between you for some time at least and indifferent
judging of runs

You will doubtless please yourself as to the guard to be taken but
whether you take it to cover the middle and leg stumps or middle
or leg only be sure to keep your legs clear of the wicket A good
umpire notes at the first glance if your leg is covering any part of
it registers it against you and remembers it when called upon for a
decision If you stand clear of the wicket he realises that you are
taking every precaution will not decide without thinking and will
give you the benefit of every doubt

Be sure you have your right foot firmly planted behind the popping
crease or you may play a little too far forward and be stumped You
may as well remove any small piece of grass or loose bit of turf that
catches your eye as you look along the wicket After you have taken
guard and marked it clearly look all around and note the position of
the fieldsmen It is something to know you may hit out to certain parts
of the ground without the risk of being caught

It is not very many years since if you had asked the question how you
were to begin an innings you would have been told to play quietly
for an over or two and hit at nothing straight until you got your
eye in With all my heart I say do not be in a hurry to hit keep up
your wicket and runs will come but do not think that this means that
you are not to punish a loose ball if you get one whether it be your
first or your twentieth I understand it to mean that you are not to
hit at a good or doubtful ball for the sake of a start or to shake
off the nervousness that affects a great number of players until they
have scored the first run No begin as you mean to go on playing good
balls carefully hitting loose ones and bearing in mind that a large
score is not made in halfadozen hits or overs Do not be surprised
and disappointed if the first few overs are maidens or ruffled that
the scoresheet is still clean so far as you are concerned Possibly
your partner has been placing balls that you could not get away and
you grow impatient That is foolishness and fatal to your chance of
scoring Remember he had been batting before you came in and had
obtained the confidence and mastery over the bowling that is now
coming slowly but surely to you Runs will come if you stay in and
few bowlers can go on bowling over after over for half an hour or more
without giving you a loose ball or two

It is bad judgment to attempt sharp runs early in your innings
Inclination that way is sure to be encouraged by the bowler and when
you least expect it he will in some way unknown to you communicate with
the wicketkeeper and fielders and the next attempt may end in you
or your partner being run out A deal of harm has been done even if
you just saved it by an inch or two and you will be in a most unhappy
state of mind for some time afterwards It dawns upon you that there
was a degree of stupidity in the attempt and it does not improve your
temper to have words of caution showered upon you from the pavilion
The state of the game the condition of the score did not demand it
and you will be very lucky if you realise the fact and recover your
usual coolness and confidence before resuming your innings

Exercise judgment when running out big hits If you find the fielders
a little careless in throwing in you may make a five out of what
looked like a four but remember that to do this you will have to make
an exceptional effort that will try your wind And now you have the
opportunity to show if your head is of the thoughtful kind The bowler
will be delighted if he can tempt you to play the next ball before
you have got rid of the flurry and excitement and you will be looked
upon as very obliging and thoughtless if you do Very likely you have
resumed your position in front of the wicket with no intention of
playing for a second or two perhaps the bowler is aware of the fact
but that does not prevent him from bowling at you in the hope that you
may change your mind Do not blame him if you play and are bowled He
was not supposed to know that you were not ready and you had no right
to be there recovering your breath it will come back as freely to
you a yard or two away from the wicket as in front of it and neither
bowler nor fielders ought to blame you for waiting for that purpose
You are playing the game for your side as well as your individual
reputation and ought to take all needful precautions

Be careful what you take to drink during a long innings If you are
not accustomed to large scoring you are sure to feel thirsty and your
mouth will become very dry before you have made many runs A big drink
at this or any other time when you are in is a great mistake For the
moment you feel as if you must quench your thirst or you cannot go
on you must however refrain for there is nothing so insidious and
infectious as indulgence in drinks of any kind In half an hour you
will want another and the fieldsmen generally will sympathise and
lean to your way of thinking Then there will be five minutes break
you will probably lose sight of the ball and very likely get out
immediately after If you must have something call for a little water
it will answer the purpose perfectly Rinse your mouth with it swallow
as little as possible and the thirst will quickly pass away

It is the first long innings that requires nerve and judgment The
hopes and fears that spring up in the young players breast when he has
scored something between fifty and a hundred make it a severe trial
and I daresay if you and I could read his thoughts we should find that
every run of the last ten was made in mental fear accompanied by a
thumping heart But when the hundred is reached who can describe the
joy that thrills him as he hears the handclapping and shouting

I will not say be modest in the hour of victory but rather be modest
after it It is after the victory as we listen to outside praise that
conceit and its enervating influence steal in Turn a deaf ear and
remember it was in fear and trembling that you reached the muchdesired
score Quiet confidence is a widely different thing from conceit The
former will help you to a run of big scores the latter will cripple
every effort to sustain your hardly earned reputation

So far I have not touched upon the different wickets that are met
with during the season There have been years such as  when the
weather has continued dry and fine for weeks and the change from
ground to ground was hardly perceptible but I have known the wicket
to change in a single match from dry fast and true to wet and soft
and then to have finished sticky and unplayable Anyone who can score
heavily through changes of that kind will be exceptionally fortunate
I venture to think it may be of some use to young cricketers if I tell
them how they should play under these different conditions of ground I
will begin with what is known as a fast dry and true wicket

This is the wicket which all good cricketers like to play on and if
it does not crumble before the match is finished long scores may be
expected Never hesitate to play forward on a wicket of this kind for
the bowler can get little or no work on the ball and what is more
the further it is pitched up and the faster it comes along the easier
it is to play it forward and the more difficult to play it back On
such a wicket as this do not go in for lofty and gallery hitting or
you will very likely throw away your chance of making a long score
If the bowler gives you a ball well up instead of hitting very hard
at it I should advise you to drive it along the ground although you
may not score so many runs for it still you do not incur the risk
of being caught out and you will get the applause of those who know
what scientific batting means Cuts and leghits travel at a rare pace
on a good fast ground and timing and placing are of more importance
than strength A snick to longleg may bring more runs than a hard hit
straight and a tap past longslip goes flying to the boundary with a
very small expenditure of strength Most long scores have been made on
a wicket of this description and you do not tire half so much as you
would if the wicket were wet and heavy

In the season one of my best yearsI remember playing in three
matches following each other when the ground was fast dry and true
The first match was at Canterbury for Marylebone CC v Kent Kent
made the long score of  chiefly owing to the magnificent batting of
Lord Harris who made  We responded with the comparatively small
total of  To follow on with so large a deficit was not encouraging
but the wicket was still everything to be desired in pace and quality
and I made up my mind to play a fast game knowing that the bowler
could get little or no work on the ball and that any attempt to play
carefully for a draw would be useless It is now a matter of history
that we scored the first  in fortyfive minutes  well under
the two hours and finished up with a total of  for nine wickets
converting what appeared to be inevitable defeat into a creditable
draw It took me a little over six hours to make my  but so good
and fast was the wicket that I played forward to most of the good balls

Two days after on a similar wicket against Notts playing for
Gloucestershire at Clifton I made  and the same week  not out
against Yorkshire at Cheltenham The last wicket was one of the very
best I ever played on and right through the innings I could play
forward without danger to nearly every ball bowled Remember then on
a wicket of this kind to play forward as much as possible

I come now to a fast good wet wicket It may surprise a great many
players when I say play almost the same way as upon a fast dry wicket
The bowler has still as much difficulty in getting work on the ball as
it cuts through the ground and he cannot hold it owing to its wet and
slippery state and you will find playing forward the better way You
will have to be a little more watchful for some balls will keep low
and travel at a terrific rate after they pitch and should you get a
shooter it will come to you even faster than on a dry wicket Batsmen
on our perfect wickets of today think a ball that keeps low is a
shooter but I wish they could come across the shooters we used to have
at Lords ground twenty years ago They seemed completely to baffle
some players and gave them the impression that the ball instead of
travelling all along the ground went under it and came up again at the
bottom of the wickets

Of course you will distinguish between a fast wet wicket and one that
is not thoroughly saturated The latter though perhaps quite as true
will not be so fast nor will runs come so quickly A wicket of this
kind was formerly considered much in favour of the bowler but that
opinion has been upset and a good punishing batsman who takes no
liberties has the bowler pretty much at his mercy In  on a
wicket of this kind I made  not out for Gloucestershire v Surrey
at Clifton In the early part of the innings the wicket was fast and
wet and the ball travelled at a rare pace but later on it became
softer and the ball did not travel so well

A slow good dry wicket You will occasionally meet with this kind of
wicket after rain when the ground has not had time to dry sufficiently
to make it fast The bowler can get more break on than he can on a
good fast wicket but the ball rises slowly off the pitch and you have
plenty of time to watch it You will rarely get a ball higher than
the bails and you can play forward or back as the pitch admits When
playing forward you must not play too quickly as the ball sometimes
hangs a bit and you may play it back to the bowler It was on a wicket
of this kind at Clifton College ground that I scored a hundred in each
innings for Gloucestershire v Kent in  The first day the wicket
was perfect of its kind every ball coming easy and with very little
break travelling quickly when hit as the outside ground was much
harder than the pitch which had been watered I made  in less than
three hours Rain stopped play for some time on the second afternoon
Friday but by Saturday afternoon the wicket recovered and I scored
 not out in two hours and twenty minutes Years ago when youth was
more on my side I preferred a very fast dry wicket but now I confess
to a leaning for a good slow and dry one

The three wickets I have described must be considered easy and
attention to the points I touched upon at the beginning should help the
batsman to score largely I now come to two of a very different nature
on which as a rule the bowler has a high time of it and where
special nerve skill judgment and luck on the part of the batsman are
required before he can make a large score

Illustration MCC AND GROUND V AUSTRALIANS LORDS MAY  

W G GRACE LBW BOWLED PALMER

First a bumpy wicket By a bumpy wicket I do not mean a fast fiery
wicket where the ball only goes over the top of the stumps and raps the
knuckles occasionally but a wicket upon which you may get a shooter
one over and a blow on the chest the next as a pleasing variety to
those that come frequently right over your head the first bound and
straight into the hands of the longstop without again touching the
ground I can assure all young players that there is a new and curious
sensation in facing balls of this kind Skill patience a quick eye
and ready arm are useful for the occasion but dogged pluck is worth
the whole of them Do not let thoughts of hard knocks trouble you
or your chance of scoring even a double figure will be remote Take
your position at the wicket in your usual way stand up to the bowling
pluckily and do not have it said of you that you are only a good
wicket player On a ground of this kind every run is valuable and you
may risk stealing a sharp run or two now and then One of your side may
make fifty or more runs but the average score is sure to be small
and you must face the possibility of hard knocks and play as if you
expected every ball to come true and a large score depended upon you
I am glad to be able to say that owing to the general improvement
that has taken place in the principal grounds you rarely now meet
with a bumpy wicket When the Yorkshire County Eleven made their first
appearance at Lords in  to play against the MCC and Ground
the wicket was as bumpy as a wicket could be and very few players on
either side escaped knocks of some kind It was the first match in
which the alteration in law  came into operation by which a bowler
could change ends twice in the same innings but not bowl more than two
overs in succession and Alfred Shaw and Wootton availed themselves
of it in the second innings of Yorkshire The MCC went in first to
the bowling of Freeman and Emmett and were all out for  Yorkshire
made  George Pinder the wellknown Yorkshire wicketkeeper who was
playing for the first time at Lords contributing  The prospect in
our second innings was not encouraging and the wicket anything but
good when that accomplished Essex sportsman Mr C E Green joined
me but if ever a good and sterling cricketer played pluckily under
adverse circumstances Mr Green did that day and in seventy minutes
we scored  runs Freeman bowled a terrific pace and Emmett was in
his glory his bowling bumping and kicking up as I have never seen it
since We were hit all over the body Mr Green twice painfully hard
on the chest but he was cool and cheerful and made  in his best
styleand that is saying a great deal considering the number of balls
he had to dodge with his head Just before I was out last man Emmett
bowled a ball which hit me very hard on the point of the left elbow
the ball flew into the air and we ran a run before it came down into
shortlegs hands but I could not hold the bat properly afterwards
and was glad when the innings was over I made  and our total was
 Freeman Iddison Pinder and Wootton were all badly knocked about
Yorkshire won by one wicket thanks to the plucky hitting of Luke
Greenwood and the steady batting of Emmett

Now I come to a drying sticky wicket This is about the worst you
can play upon and he who scores largely on it deserves to be praised
indeed If the bowling be indifferent the player who can pull or hit a
long hop to leg has a decided advantage as the ball hangs a great deal
at times and favours that kind of play If the bowler be on the spot
then tall scoring is an impossibility The work to be got on the ball
is astounding I have seen balls break a foot or more

This kind of wicket is oftener seen at Lords after a good deal of rain
and a drying sun than anywhere else We all remember that great match
when the Australians made their first appearance there in  I had
a fair conception of what might happen and after hitting the first
ball of the match to the boundary was not surprised at being caught out
from the fourth One ball of Spofforths was enough for me the second
innings The best advice I can give is to watch every ball on a wicket
of that kind and score when you can

In conclusion never treat a straight ball with contempt however badly
bowled I have met with a ball that bounded twice or thrice before it
came to me varying every bound and at the finish twisting or shooting
and becoming a very difficult ball indeed I have made it a rule all my
life to hit a straight long hop or fullpitch with a straight or nearly
straight bat so that when a ball of this kind was bowled to me I had
the full length of my bat to play it with whereas if I had tried to
pull or hit across at it I should only have had the width of my bat
and should have been more likely to miss it

When an indifferent bowler is put on you cannot be too careful He is
put on to tempt you to hit and does not mind how many runs you score
off him but presently you will get a good ball and if you are not
careful especially if you are trying to bring off a favourite stroke
you will hit at it and very likely lose your wicket

After you have made a boundary hit do not make up your mind to hit
another off the next ball

Keep your eye on the bowler watch how he holds the ball and runs up
to the wicket before delivering it that will help you considerably to
detect alteration in length and pace

It is a mistake to hit at the pitch of slow round or underhand
bowling The twist is sure to beat you and if you do not miss the
ball altogether you will most likely get caught at coverpoint In my
younger days I always ran out to underhand bowling and hit it before
it bounded or waited and got it long hop When a firstclass bowler
tries to bowl a slow ball with an extra amount of break look out for a
bad ball and when it comes as it will sooner or later punish it and
you will upset him a bit and very likely prevent him from bowling good
balls afterwards

I think I have touched upon nearly everything that might help a young
player to a long score and with just a word about playing against odds
I have done Whether against eighteen or twentytwo in the field play
the same game that you would against an eleven I have very often found
that the fieldsmen in the outfield are placed too deep and a second
run can be stolen after the ball passes the men close in Do not hit to
leg but rather place or snick the ball you will get just as many runs
without the risk of being caught It was when playing against odds that
fine placing to leg was first cultivated and now it has to a great
extent superseded leg hitting

I need not say how delighted I am to watch the progress of every
young and rising cricketer My heart is in the game I love above all
others with a love that is as strong today as it was when I made my
first large score and when eye hand and foot were much quicker than
they are now I do not believe that there are no days like the good old
days of cricket but I do strongly believe that the prospects of the
game are as bright and hopeful today as they have been at any time in
its history and that in future years as great if not greater things
will be done with both bat and ball I ask every young cricketer to
study the points I have submitted and it will be sufficient reward to
me if they in some way help him to make a big score




CHAPTER X

THE AUSTRALIANS

BY A G STEEL


Not until Monday May   did the English public take any real
interest in Australian cricket though in  in their own country the
Australians had defeated Lillywhites eleven on even terms Prior to
this date four English teams had visited Australia but their doings
though recorded in the press did not interest the cricket community
at home The Australian players met with in the Colonies were no doubt
learning from the English teams they had seen and played against but
the idea that they were up to the standard of English firstclass
cricket seemed absurd and to a certain extent this estimate was
justified by the records of the English visitors In  H H
Stephenson Surrey player and huntsman took out twelve professional
players to the Colonies under the auspices of Messrs Spiers and Pond
They played twelve matches against eighteens and twentytwos won six
lost two and drew four In  two years later George Parr took
out a team which played sixteen matches against twentytwos and was
not beaten at all In  Mr W G Grace visited the antipodes at
the request of the Melbourne Cricket Club his eleven played fifteen
matches all against odds won ten lost three and drew two In
 James Lillywhite followed and it was during this tour that the
Australians first won a match on equal terms Lillywhites team played
Australia on March   and   with the result that Australia
won by  runs This match was noteworthy for another reason C
Bannerman made  for Australia and was the first amongst Australian
batsmen to score a hundred against English bowlers Now though English
cricketers had been beaten on even terms as recently as  the
fact seemed to have been lost sight of at home in  and when the
first Australian eleven that ever visited England arrived early in the
latter year it never occurred to anyone that it could have any chance
of actually storming the citadel of English cricket with success On
May   English cricket and its lovers received a serious shock
as on that day in the extraordinarily short space of four and a half
hours a very fair team of the MCC were beaten by nine wickets The
famous English club was certainly well represented seeing that W G
Grace A W Ridley A J Webbe A N Hornby Shaw and Morley did
battle for it Gregorys team as the Australians were called had a
very successful season beating in addition to MCC Yorkshire
Surrey Middlesex Leicestershire Sussex Gloucestershire and a bad
eleven of the Players and being beaten by Nottingham the Gentlemen
of England Yorkshire and Cambridge the latter the most decisive
defeat of all

The British public were surprised at these results especially as it
had expected so little from the visitors Many of the lower classes
were so ignorant of Australia itself to say nothing of the cricket
capabilities of its inhabitants that they fully expected to find the
members of Gregorys team black as the Aborigines We remember the late
Rev Arthur Ward putting his foot into it on this subject before some
of the Australians One day in the pavilion at Lords the writer
who had been chosen to represent the Gentlemen of England against the
visitors in a forthcoming match was sitting beside Spofforth watching
a game in which neither was taking part Mr Ward coming up accosted
the writer Well Mr Steel so I hear you are going to play against
the niggers on Monday His face was a picture when Spofforth was
introduced to him as the demon nigger bowler Gregorys team in the
writers opinion contained four really good bowlers Spofforth Boyle
Allan and Garrett and two fair changes in Midwinter and Horan but as
batsmen they were poor when compared with Englands best

Charles Bannerman was a most dashing player his offdriving being
magnificent and Horan and Murdoch were fairish batsmen Murdoch then
was very different to the Murdoch of  and  but the rest
were rough and untutored more like country cricketers than correct
players Had this team come to England in a dry instead of a wet
season it would probably have had a very different record at the end
of its visit Spofforth Boyle and Garrett were most deadly to the
best batsmen on the soft caked wickets they so often had to assist
them and the Australian batsmen with the rough crossbat style which
distinguished the majority were just as likely to knock up fifteen
to twenty runs on a bad wicket as on a good one Nothing brings good
and bad batsmen so close together as bad wet seasons When Cambridge
University met them the match was played on a hard true wicket the
Australian bowling was thoroughly collared and none of the eleven
except Murdoch C Bannerman and perhaps Horan showed any signs of
being able to play correct cricket on a hard ground

Gregorys team however had a wonderfully stimulating effect on
English cricket Their record taught us that the Australians could
produce men to beat most of the counties and who might after a
year or two of experience play a very good game with a picked team of
England

In  W L Murdoch brought over a Colonial team to England
The close of the season showed that in the elevenaside matches
Derbyshire Yorkshire Gloucestershire and a good eleven of the
Players of England had been beaten while only two matches had been
lost Nottingham succeeded in winning by one wicket and England by
five wickets This latter match was the first in which a picked team
of England did battle against the Australians and the excitement was
intense It was most interesting and will be ever memorable for the
splendid innings of W G Grace and W L Murdoch who made  and
 respectively the latter being not out Englands first innings
was  Australias  the latter followed on and when the last
man W H Moule came in there were still wanting  runs to save the
innings defeat Moule played a stubborn game with his captain and put
on  for the last wicket How England lost five wickets on a goodish
wicket in getting  runs will never be forgotten The writer had taken
off his cricket clothes at the end of the Australians second innings
thinking all would soon be over but cricket is a strange game and he
soon had to put them on again The result of the first pitched battle
between England and Australia though a win of five wickets for the
former was a marvellous performance on the part of the Australians
indeed seeing how far they were left behind on the first innings it
was one of the best things ever done at cricket to get so near the
victors at the finish especially as the wicket on the last innings was
not to be found fault with It should also be mentioned in fairness to
the Australians that their best bowler Spofforth was prevented by an
accident from taking part in this match

The next team that visited England was in  and was again under
the captaincy of W L Murdoch On this occasion G Giffen S P
Jones and H H Massie were introduced to the British public for the
first time As this eleven succeeded in defeating England and was
perhaps the best that ever represented the Colonies we record the
namesA C Bannerman J M Blackham G J Bonnor H F Boyle
P S McDonnell W L Murdoch G E Palmer F R Spofforth T W
Garrett T Horan and the three new players above mentioned The
result at the end of the season was Matches played  won  lost
 drawn  Nottingham beaten once Lancashire once Yorkshire three
times the Gentlemen of England once and Oxford University once The
four defeats were by Cambridge University the Players of England
Cambridge Past and Present and the North of England This team played
the second pitched battle between Australia and England on Monday
August  and after the close finish and creditable display made in
 against England by worse players the match created the most
intense excitement The Australians went first to the wickets which
were very sticky and were all disposed of for  England topped this
by  Prior to the beginning of Australias second innings a heavy
shower deluged the ground Going in on the wet cuttingthrough wicket
Massie hit the incapacitated bowlers all over the field and when the
first wicket fell for  had scored  out of that number With the
exception of Murdoch and Bannerman nobody else troubled the English
bowlers and the ground rapidly drying and caking the whole side were
disposed of for  The Englishmen wanted  to win and when the
score was at  for one wicket it seemed as if the game were over
Spofforth however was bowling splendidly and the wicket had become
most difficult He was bowling over medium pace coming back many
inches and often getting up to an uncomfortable height The English
batsmen could do nothing with him and after the keenest excitement
the game ended in a wellwon victory for the Australians by  runs
Though this defeat was a great blow to the English representatives
there were none who grudged Australia her success which was obtained
by sound and sterling cricket We think there is no doubt that the
 team was better than the next one in  In  they had as
bowlers Boyle Spofforth Palmer Garrett and Giffen in  they
had Spofforth Palmer Boyle Giffen and Midwinter but they had lost
Garrett The  team contained two excellent batsmen in Horan and
Massie whose absence was not sufficiently compensated for by Scott and
Midwinter Murdoch Horan Giffen Blackham were all likely to make
runs while Massie Bonnor and McDonnell often succeeded on the worst
wicket in making mincemeat of any bowling

In  W L Murdoch again brought over an Australian team to
England and played thirtytwo matches winning eight and losing seven
This time it was decided by the English authorities not to allow the
fame of English cricket to depend on the result of one match only but
on the best of three and accordingly three matches were arranged to
be played between England and Australia one at Manchester the second
at Lords and the third at the Oval The first at Manchester was
seriously interfered with by the weather Rain prevented any play on
the first day England began to bat on a sodden wicket and made 
and Murdochs team responded with  England had now a difficult
task to prevent being beaten but at the end of the match were 
runs on and one wicket to fall This was doubtless a draw in favour
of the Australians but still a hundred runs on a bad wicket against
the flower of English bowling take a lot of getting and it must be
remembered that a month before the Australian team were all disposed
of for  on a sticky wicket by Peate and Emmett The second match
was at Lords and was the only one of the three that was finished
England won easily by an innings and  runs The earlier teams of the
Australians never appeared to advantage at Lords The later ones
however have done better on that ground The third match at the Oval
was a memorable one The Australians won the toss went in on a perfect
wicket and made the terrific score of  McDonnell  Murdoch 
Scott  This was a truly great performance and it was remarkable
that every member of the English team tried his hand with the ball
by far the most successful having been the Honourable A Lyttelton
with the analysis of four wickets for  runs England made  first
innings in which was a magnificent display from W W Read of  In
the second innings England made  for two wickets and thus required
 runs on a true wicket with seven good batsmen to save the single
innings defeat

The next team that visited England was in  H J H Scott being
the captain This is memorable as the first Australian team in England
that did not contain W L Murdoch Several unknown men now made their
appearance W Bruce E Evans J McIlwraith and J W Trumble but
this was undoubtedly less successful than any of the previous teams
Their seasons record showed Matches played  won  lost 
drawn  Here again as in  England v Australia was to be
played at Manchester Lords and the Oval but it is unnecessary to
give an account of these three matches It will suffice to say that at
Manchester England won by four wickets at Lords by an innings and 
runs and at the Oval by an innings and  runs

The sixth Australian team visited us in  and as W L Murdoch
had at that time practically retired from firstclass cricket the
captaincy devolved upon that sterling hitter P S McDonnell This
team though including some excellent players at all branches of the
game cannot be considered equal in merit to that of  Three
representative matches were again arranged as in  The first was
played at Lords upon a wicket deluged with rain and the Australians
won in a smallscoring match by  runs They won on their merits as
the game was played and the English batsmen on that occasion deserved
to lose On a most difficult wicket and against C T B Turner and J
J Ferriss bowling they poked and scraped about and seemed utterly
unable to realise what each Australian batsman had done viz that to
make runs under such circumstances the bat must be used vigorously
Though the Australians here scored their second success since  in
England in a representative match the supporters of England were in
nowise satisfied that the Australians had the better side Two really
good bowlers their opponents had in Turner and Ferris but no one
else on their side had any pretensions to being called firstclass
in this department of the game Their batting taken as a whole was
weakMcDonnell of course was a fine player but the rest could not
be compared to our best English batsmen Then their fielding was hardly
up to the standard of previous colonial teams Altogether the English
side did not fear the result of the next two matches if played under
ordinary conditions of weather and luck The second match at the
Oval resulted in a win for England by an innings and  runs and
the third played at Manchester in another win for the same side by
an innings and  runs The feature of the seasons cricket played by
this side was the bowling of C T B Turner and J J Ferris Turners
analysis was remarkable wickets for  runs giving the
excellent average of  This bowler is undoubtedly entitled to take
rank amongst the really great bowlers of this generation of cricketers
J J Ferris though he met with wonderful success this season 
was never in the same class as C T B Turner

The next Australian team that came to England was in  and W
L Murdoch after five years absence from firstclass cricket
consented to once again act as captain The result of this trip was
anything but a success from a cricket point of view and indeed the
team was not competent to cope with Englands best Six of this team
made their first visit to England viz Messrs Charlton Gregory
Walters Barrett H Trumble and Burn The batting of this team was
distinctly indifferent though Murdoch showed on occasions he had not
altogether lost his skill he was not however the Murdoch of 
Messrs Turner and Ferris again bore the brunt of the attack they
each took the same number of wickets during the tour viz  The
formers average was slightly the better of the two how in view
of Ferriss performances since  in England he managed to run
Turner so close for the highest bowling honours will always remain a
mystery The first of the three representative matches England won by
seven wickets at Lords The feature of this match was that though
the Australians made  and  and the English team  and  for
 wickets there was not one bye scored to either side in the match
This is a wonderful testimonial to J M Blackham and G McGregor the
respective wicketkeepers for Australia and England The second match
England v Australia was played at the Oval and a good game resulted
in the defeat of the latter by two wickets it was a close finish and
the Australians deserved great credit for so nearly defeating such a
powerful side as represented England on that occasion The third match
arranged to be played at Manchester was never even begun owing to the
incessant rain which deluged the ground on all three days

In  the eighth Australian eleven came over and carried with it
great hopes of their own countrymen It had some good batsmenTrott
Lyons Bannerman Giffen Bruce Graham and Gregory but none of
them except Giffen could then compare with the best English bats and
Giffen for some reason has never done himself justice as a batsman
in any of these trips The bowlers were Turner H Trumble Giffen
R McLeod Trott and Bruce Giffen at times bowled very finely and
Turner bowled well but not so successfully as of yore H Trumble also
proved himself to be an excellent bowler but the combination was not
strong enough especially in a fine season to win the rubber against
England Unfortunately only one of the three matches was finished and
this resulted in a win for England by an innings and  runs

In  the ninth eleven that visited England under the leadership of
Trott proved a good side far the best that had been over since 
and from this date the efficiency of Australian cricket began to rise
until at the time of writing April  it stands as high as it ever
did Before discussing this eleven it will be well briefly to review
the result of five remarkable test matches played in Australia in the
winter of  and  between Stoddarts eleven and the Australians
Stoddarts eleven was very good but nobody could say that at that
time it was the best that England could have sent Grace Jackson
Gunn Storer and Abel might with advantage have taken the places of
Humphreys Brockwell Philipson Briggs and Lockwood but still it was
a good team and it won three out of the five test matches

Under any circumstances this must always remain a great feat for each
side possess a great advantage when playing in their own country but
on looking carefully into these five matches as a whole it must be
confessed that Stoddart must have been greatly helped by the selection
and captaincy of the Colonists Giffens view of his duties of captain
was the very erroneous one that it was essential that he should be
bowling at one end nearly the whole time In the first match he bowled
 overs while Turner and Jones were only allowed to bowl  overs
between them In the second match he magnanimously did not go on in the
first innings on a wet wicket but made up for it by bowling  more
overs than anyone else in the second innings and in the last match he
bowled while  runs were scored off him and H Trumble who was on
all wickets the best bowler in Australia was only selected to play
in one of the matches Stoddarts side however batted finely and
Richardson proved himself at that time to be far the best bowler in the
world

When they came to England in  they brought Giffen but wisely made
Trott captain and Hill and Darling showed symptoms of developing into
the very high position they now hold and the whole eleven proved
themselves a difficult side to get out Gregory Darling Hill
Iredale Trott Giffen and Donnan all scored a thousand runs in the
season and Trumble Jones McKibbin and Giffen each secured over a
hundred wickets and H Trumble on all wickets was not excelled by any
bowler in the two countries The eleven played a safe game there was
no McDonnell or Lyons in the side but they took a lot of getting out
though as might be supposed in the case of a side where there was no
hitter they were weak on soft wickets

Such was the situation when the last disastrous visit of Stoddarts
eleven took place in  and  and though the result of this tour
is very recent history it is so important and raises such misgivings
for the future that it is well to consider it at some length

In the first place no eleven has ever left England with so much of
their countrymens confidence as this eleven of Stoddarts A great
many thought that it was absolutely the best selection that could have
been made It is easy to be wise after the event but even now it is
not at all certain that the bowling could be improved and this was
the notorious weak spot of the eleven In another part of this work is
given a possible first eleven of England but this selection is given
as far as the bowlers are concerned with no great confidence and the
truth must sadly be confessed that unless we mend our bowling ways we
shall very likely be defeated in our own country by the Australians in
 Up to the end of the first test match Stoddarts eleven had a
blaze of triumph in spite of the abnormal heat which knocked up more
than one of our eleven Stoddart had no doubt the worst of the luck
in losing the toss three times in the first four test matches but
unluckily what many of us dreaded occurred in the last matchhe won
the toss and lost the match MacLaren and Ranjitsinhji batted grandly
Storer Hayward and Druce passably but the rest proved more or less a
failure while on Australian wickets against weak English bowling the
batting of Darling and Hill was superb and that of C McLeod Gregory
Iredale Trumble and Trott very good But our team as a whole were not
strong enough in batting to make up for our bowling weakness and in a
word the Australians thoroughly outbowled us

The Australians in the first test match played the bowlers who had
performed so well in England in  with the addition of C McLeod
but in subsequent matches they played Noble and Howell and these two
bowlers have the knack of variety in their bowling and this combined
with the pace of Jones and the admirable steadiness and break of
Trumble made a combination of bowlers that on good hard wickets has
never been surpassed It is the future that troubles us where are our
bowlers In old days we could get one firstclass bowler a year out of
Nottingham alone but the supply seems to have come to an end but from
somewhere must come some bowlers of variety of pace break and head
or the old country must be content to take the lower room But if 
should turn out to be a wet year a very different tale may have to be
told

Taking both countries and excluding the Manchester match in 
abandoned on account of weather fiftyone test matches have now been
played of which England has won twentysix fourteen in Australia and
twelve at home Australia nineteen of which all but three were in
Australia and six have been drawn

The leading averages in batting in all the series in both countries
of test matches from  to  inclusive may prove of interest at
this stage but of course we exclude the players who only played in
comparatively few matches and we limit the number of innings to a
minimum of twelve The averages are as follows

  
                       No of   Times not                      
        Batsmen        Innings     out     Total runs  Average 
  
  K S Ranjitsinhji                                 
  F A Iredale                                      
  C Hill                                           
  A Shrewsbury                                   
  A E Stoddart                                    
  A C MacLaren                                    
  A G Steel                                        
  W G Grace                                     
  W L Murdoch                                     
  

Like all tables of averages the above is misleading Players like
Grace Murdoch and Shrewsbury played in the days when runs were not
so easily got and their performances may rank on a par with those of
MacLaren Ranjitsinhji and Hill and of course there have been many
innings played against equally good bowling but not in matches of
England v Australia No innings of greater merit has however been
played than Murdochs innings of  not out against England at the
Oval in 

Illustration THE CRITICS

With regard to the merits of the English and Australian bowlers we
think there are few English cricketers who would deny that Spofforth
is the best bowler ever seen on English grounds at any rate in modern
times and yet the statistics show that he is not at the head of the
average list

The following is the list of the first twelve bowlers

  
                 Balls  Runs  Wickets  Average 
  
  Lohmann                          
  Peel                          
  Turner                         
  Spofforth                      
  Boyle                            
  Briggs                         
  Hearne                           
  Palmer                         
  Richardson                     
  Giffen                        
  Trumble                        
  Jones                            
  

Spofforth although fourth only in the above table was on the whole
the greatest bowler for many of his great feats were performed in
other almost as important matches and it must also be remembered
that he never bowled for maidens but the figures of Peel who in
test matches has bowled more balls than anybody come up remarkably
well and considering the number of balls he bowled his record is an
extraordinary one

In addition to Spofforth the Australians have had a wonderfully good
lot of bowlers Palmer Garrett Boyle Allan Evans G Giffen and
since when this chapter was first writtenTurner Ferris and
H Trumble and as far as can be gathered from the disastrous tour of
Mr Stoddarts eleven in  Noble Howell and Jones Although the
previous remarks about Spofforth were written before Turner made such
a wonderful record on our English grounds we still think Spofforth
the best of all the bowlers It appears extraordinary at first sight
that a country whose whole population does not exceed that of London
should in the course of a few years have been able to develop such
exceptional talent We believe however that Australia will always
possess excellent bowlers for the following reason In Melbourne
Sydney and Adelaide the chief nurseries of Australian cricket the
grounds are so excellent and usually so hard and fast that no bowler
can possibly expect the slightest amount of success unless he possesses
some peculiarity of style or action pace or power over the ball mere
pace and accuracy are of no avail On the hardest and best wickets it
must be laid down as an axiom that bowlers with change of pace and turn
must form the bowling backbone of the future best eleven and these
qualities the young Australian cultivates with greater success than the
English In England the conditions are different as by reason of our
variable climate naturally weak bowling often becomes most effective
Young Australian bowlers have also ample opportunity for gaining
experience and developing their skill as there is in the colonies a
very great dearth of the professional element Members of the same club
have to rely for their batting practice on the bowling of one another
and their bowlers come to acquire some of the peculiarities above
mentioned that will strike terror into the hearts of their opponents in
the next tie of the cup contests These cup contests in Australia are
an excellent institution as professionalism is barred They produce
the greatest interest and excitement and each club does its utmost
to secure the muchcoveted distinction of being premier club for the
season The Australian climate is a great aid to bowling and fielding
Its warmth and mildness prevent the rheumatic affections that so often
attack the arms and shoulders of our players and the Australians
consequently retain their suppleness of limb and activity of youth
longer than their English cousins Nothing illustrates this better
than the prevalence of good throwing amongst Australian fieldsmen The
everyday sight on our own grounds of a man who has thrown his arm
out and can do nothing but jerk is almost unknown in Australia even
colonials who have passed their cricket prime and have reached the age
of thirtyeight or forty can still throw with much the same dash as of
old In our county teams we find a woeful deficiency in this essential
to good fielding the cold and damp of our northern climate having
penetrated into the bones and created a chronic and incurable stiffness

One occasionally hears a really good cricket story in Australia The
following was vouched for as a fact by several leading members of
Australian cricket and was told me as illustrative of the skill and
dash of some great fieldsman whom I have never had the good fortune to
meet This man was standing coverpoint one dayhis usual place in the
field He was marvellously quick sometimes indeed his returns were so
smart that none could tell whether he had used his right or left arm
He was however apt at times to be sleepy and inattentive to the game
On one occasion he was in this state and just as the bowler started
to bowl he noticed his sleepy coverpoint standing looking on the
ground with his back to the wickets Hulloa there wake up shouted
he Quick as lightning turned the coverpoint and seeing something
dark dashing past him made a dart and caught not the ball as he had
thought but a swallow Talk of Royle or Briggs after that

Writing at the close of Mr Stoddarts disastrous tour it must be
said that if the Australians bring over a representative team in 
it will be looked forward to with the keenest interest The  lot
did very well and it remains to be seen whether in  in matches
limited to three days and on English wickets our visitors can pull
off the rubber in the three test matches If they do they will receive
the hearty congratulations of every true English cricketer and at the
present time of writing it looks as if they had a great chance of so
doing but if they are wise they will try and unearth another batsman
of the stamp of McDonnell or Lyons




CHAPTER XI

THE UNIVERSITY CRICKET MATCH

BY THE HON R H LYTTELTON


If to play drawn matches be a constant reproach against certain
elevens neither University eleven can be blamed on this score
Sixtythree matches have been begun between these old rivals and no
fewer than sixty have been finished Of the three drawn matches one
the first ever played was confined to one day only the second was
so long ago as  and that was confined to two days whilst the
third in  was played in such unfavourable weather that not even
four days sufficed to finish the match All the rest have been fought
out to the end and of the sixty completed matches Cambridge has won
thirtytwo times and Oxford twentyeight thus Cambridge has a proud
balance of four in its favour All the matches except five have been
played at Lords the remaining five were played at Oxford three
on the Magdalen ground one on Cowley Marsh and one on Bullingdon
Green The dark blues appear to have been slightly favoured in this
respectfor presumably they knew their way about Oxford grounds better
than their rivalsand out of the five matches played at Oxford
Cambridge only succeeded in winning one The rules of qualification
to play in this match are now strict only in one particular and
that is that nobody is allowed to play more than four times Several
players have played five matches and their names are C H Ridding
A Ridding C D Marsham and R D Walker all Oxford men The fact
that some players play on a side for five years may constitute a slight
reason for causing the side they assist to lose matches and not win
them but during the last three years that Mr R D Walker helped his
University he also helped the Gentlemen of England in their annual
matches against the Players both at Lords and at the Oval and C D
Marsham was certainly not excelled by any gentleman bowler for accuracy
and general efficiency during all the years he played for Oxford
Oxford were strong all the five years he played and won four out of
the five matches the other match resulted in a victory for Cambridge
mainly owing to the performances both in batting and bowling of the
famous Mr J Makinson Not since  however when Mr R D Walker
last played for Oxford has any cricketer played more than four times
and since that time the rule has been well established limiting the
period to four years But there is considerable elasticity allowed in
permitting players to represent their University within those four
years A residence for a week is apparently sufficient provided that
the mans name is kept on the books of some College or Hall Mr
OBrien who represented Oxford in  and  resided for one
summer at New Inn Hall and never went near his University again but
if he had chosen and had been selected he might have played for the
full term of four years Mr Leslie after residing at Oxford for one
year went into business in London but played three years for Oxford
and till his last year performed yeomans service In  Makinsons
year Mr T W Wills with the concurrence and sanction of Oxford
played for Cambridge without ever having resided at Cambridge for one
single day though his name was entered on the College books However
his part in the match consisted of getting five runs in one innings and
bowling nine overs for one wicket It appears very clear then that
Oxford have profited by having five matches played on their own ground
and making use for five years of Mr C D Marsham the best bowler
they ever possessed to say nothing of Mr R D Walker

Of course the characteristics of University cricket have changed very
much following the example of cricket generally About the first match
of all the late Bishop of St Andrews Bishop Wordsworth who played
in it very kindly wrote the following note

 THE FIRST INTERUNIVERSITY CRICKET MATCH

 In the newly published Life of my younger brother Christopher the
 late Bishop of Lincoln the following words are to be found quoted
 from his private journalFriday no datebut early in June
  Heard from Charles He wishes that Oxford and Cambridge should
 play a match at cricket p  And as I have been asked to put
 upon paper what I can remember concerning the first InterUniversity
 Cricket Match with a view to its insertion in the present volume
 I venture to take those words for my text Yes I was then in my
 Freshmans year at Christ Church and both my brother and Ihe
 at Winchester and I at Harrowhad been in our respective school
 elevens But more than this as captain of the Harrow Eleven I had
 enjoyed what was then a novel experience in carrying on correspondence
 with brother captains at other public schoolsEton Winchester Rugby
 and even Charter House and I well remember how the last amused us at
 Harrow by the pompous and as we presumed to think bumptious style
 of his letter proposing to determine the superiority at cricket
 which has been so long undecided Having played against Eton for four
 years from the first match in  to  and in the first match
 against Winchester in the lastnamed year I had a large acquaintance
 among cricketers who had gone off from those schools and from Harrow
 to both Universities My brother as I have said was one of these
 but though successful in the Wykehamist Eleven at Lords in 
 when he got  runs in his second innings and caught our friend
 Henry Manningthe future cardinalof which he was wont to boast in
 after years he did not keep up his cricket at Cambridge whereas I
 continued to keep up mine at Oxford and was in the University Eleven
 during the whole time of my undergraduate course Nothing came of
 my wish to bring about a match between the Universities in 
 But in  the proposal was carried into effect Though an Oxford
 man my home was at Cambridge my father being Master of Trinity
 and this gave me opportunities for communicating with men of that
 University many of whom remained up for the vacations or for part of
 the vacations especially at Easter I remember calling upon Barnard
 of Kings who had been captain of an Eton Eleven against whom I had
 played and who was now one of the foremost Cambridge cricketers and
 he gave me reason to fear that no Kings man would be able to play at
 the time proposed early in June though that time would be within
 the Cambridge vacation and not within ours because their men at
 Kings were kept up longer than at the other Colleges And this I
 believe proved actually the case and if so some allowance should
 be made for it But the fact is there were similar difficulties on
 both sides and I am not sure they were not as great or greater upon
 ours In those anterailway days it was necessary to get permission
 from the College authorities to go up to London in term time and
 the permission was not readily granted To take my own caseMy
 conscience still rather smites me when I remember that in order to
 gain my end I had to present myself to the Dean and tell him that I
 wished to be allowed to go to Londonnot to play a game of cricket
 that would not have been listened tobut to consult a dentist a
 piece of Jesuitry which was understood I believe equally well on
 both sides at all events my tutor Longleyafterwards Archbishop of
 Canterburywas privy to it

 Thus though not without difficulties the match came on but
 unhappily the weather presenting a fresh difficulty it did not fully
 go off We could only play a single innings with the result which the
 score shows The precise day in June on which it was played has been
 disputed One report gives the th another states that the match
 did not take place on the th as intended but was deferred for a few
 days I can only say that I do not remember any postponement as I
 think I should do had such been the case and what is more a few
 days later would have brought it within our vacation and so would
 have rendered my piece of Jesuitism unnecessary The players on the
 Cambridge side were mostly Etonians though there was I think no
 Kings man among them and on the Oxford side mostly Wykehamists We
 scored  runs to our opponents  but it cannot be said we were a
 strong eleven The bowling was divided between Bayley and me and the
 state of the ground being in my favour I was singularly successful
 with my lefthand twist from the off bringing down no less than seven
 wickets in the one innings for only  runs Jenner famous as a
 wicketkeeper and well known afterwards as Sir Herbert Jenner Fust
 was the only batsman who made any stand against it He had learnt by
 painful experience how to deal with it We had been antagonists in
 the Eton and Harrow match of  and I can well remember even now
 though it is  years ago his look of ineffable disgust and dismay
 when I had pitched a ball some four or five inches wide to the off
 and he had shouldered his bat meaning to punish it as it rose by a
 smart cut to point the tortuous creature shot in obliquely and took
 his middle stump when he had only got two runs Precisely the same
 happened again in his second innings only then he got no runs at all
 Again in Eton v Harrow  I had bowled him at  And yet he was
 considered the best bat on the Eton side next to Barnard He now made
  runs while no one else on the Cambridge side scored more than 
 He was also successful as a bowler taking five wickets mine included
 against which he had a very strong claim though I do not remember
 that he had much reputation in that line and certainly upon the whole
 the Cambridge bowling must have been very indifferent to allow some of
 our men to run up the scores which stand to their names

 Though often successful as a bowler lefthanded underhand batting
 righthanded was if I may be bold to say so my forte In 
 the next year after this match my average upwards of  was higher
 than that of any other in the Oxford eleven I mention this with the
 less compunction because in the second InterUniversity match my name
 appears without a run in either innings and I wish to state how
 the failure is to be accounted for In that year  the first
 InterUniversity boatrace took place at Henley and I was one of
 the eight As boating and cricket were then carried on in the same
 summer term and the race and the match were both to come off in the
 same week I wished to resign my place in the eleven But this was not
 allowed I had therefore no alternative but to make my appearance and
 do my best though I had not played once before during the season and
 though I was suffering from the effects of my rowing in a way which
 made it almost impossible for me to hold a bat However though I got
 no runs I was so far of use that I bowled two and caught two of our
 opponents and we won the match not quite so triumphantly as in 
 if a drawn match can be so described but quite easily enough as
 we had won the boatrace quite easily two days before Wednesday
 June th

 Of the players in the two elevens who contended at Lords more than
  years ago fiveif not sixI believe are still living Who shall
 say how much the lengthening of their days beyond the ordinary span of
 our existence here is to be attributed to Crickets manly toil

 I have now done the best I could to comply with the request made to
 me as an old cricketer and if I have been garrulous and if I have
 been egotistical I can fairly plead that this is no more than was
 to be expected when an ultraoctogenarian was applied to for his
 reminiscences

  CHARLES WORDSWORTH

  ST ANDREWS May  

In the match of  Oxford strange to relate got a total of 
runs and exactly realised  runs in the third match in  while
Cambridge got  runs in the fifth match in  but from  to
 when Cambridge scored  runs there was no innings played by
either side which resulted in  runs and this notwithstanding the
gigantic number of extras that were sometimes given Cambridge in
 won by  runs but scored in the two innings  by extras In
 Cambridge again won by  runs and scored  by extras while
Oxford in  gained  by extras losing the match however by 
runs After  scores of  runs and over became more frequent and
still extras formed a formidable item in the various totals Cambridge
gave  extras out of a total of  in  or  run in every  and
Oxford in the same year gave Cambridge  extras out of a total of 
or an average of a little under  in every  We have made a careful
comparison showing the different totals and the percentage of extras
and have found the following remarkable fact in the first twentysix
matches the total of runs scored came to  the number of extras
amounted to  making the percentage of extras to runs amount to a
little over  to  In the thirtyfour succeeding matches  runs
were scored and  extras reducing the proportion to  to  In
other words for the first twentysix matches extras constituted  per
cent of the total amount scored while during the thirty succeeding
years they only amount to  per cent

As might be expected the weak point in University cricket is the
bowling and the tendency of modern InterUniversity matches is an
undue largeness of scores though when the improved condition of the
wickets is taken into account there exists some ground for hoping
that University bowling is better than it was ten years ago But when
the fact is considered that young amateurs in the prime of life play
every year on frequently perfect wickets it is rather surprising that
the scoring is not even larger That it is not so is chiefly owing
to nerve that grand disturbing element in all cricket calculations
It is far the most important contest of the year for all the players
concerned and if you were to ask any University cricketer which match
or matches he felt most was hoped of him he would certainly quote the
InterUniversity matches he took part in It is a match therefore
famous for wrecking the reputation of batsmen Still one may be allowed
to hope that amateur bowling may improve as amateur wicketkeeping has
done Since  Cambridge has had as real good bowlers Messrs Steel
Studd Rock Woods Jackson and for one year Mr Wells while Oxford
in our judgment has during the same period turned out only three
really good bowlers Messrs Evans Berkeley and Cunliffe and for one
year Bardswell

These ten good bowlers may be compared with the greatest in former
daysMessrs C D Marsham Traill Maitland Fellowes Kenney and
Butler of Oxford and Lang Salter Plowden Pelham and Powys of
Cambridge who were all fast except Maitland Pelham and Plowden
while only three of the later lot of ten Messrs Woods Evans and
Jackson were fast the other seven being slow or medium

No fewer than eightythree men have played four matches and it is
curious to notice that out of these eightythree there are only one
Oxford man and three Cambridge men who have played in four winning
elevens The three Cambridge men are Messrs T A Anson W Mills and
W de St Croix and the one Oxford man is Mr S C Voules Mr Voules
played in the four winning elevens of    and  Messrs
T A Anson and W de St Croix played in the four winning elevens of
   and  and Mr W Mills played in   
and  Two unfortunate Cambridge men had the bad luck to play four
losing matchesnamely Messrs R D Balfour and G H Tuck in the
years    and  So far no Oxford man has had this fate
Cambridge once won five consecutive matches and on two occasions they
have won four while Oxford has twice won four consecutive matches As
may be expected the runs scored by the more recent batsmen altogether
exceed the earlier players efforts Up to  when Mr Yardley made
the first hundred Mr Bullocks  for Oxford obtained in  was
the highest individual score and the highest individual aggregates in
any one match are  in  by Mr R T King  by Mr Makinson in
  by Mr Mitchell in   by the same gentleman in 
and  by Mr C E Green in  One of Mr Kings innings was not
completed So Mr Yardley in  beat the record of any two aggregates
by his one innings except Mr Greens innings in  Since  the
individual scores of  have come fast and furious and altogether
twenty hundreds have been played nine by Cambridge to eleven by
Oxford Mr Yardley is still in the proud position of being the only
batsman who has twice got into three figures and nobody who saw either
of his great performances will ever forget it Unless however there
is a change for the better in bowling or an alteration in the laws
it is certain that hundreds will come with comparative frequency and
we cannot help pining for a return to the old state of things when
 was reckoned a very large total The highest aggregate in any one
match is Mr Jardines  in  and the highest individual score is
Mr Keys  in  No performances are however entitled to more
credit than Mr Makinsons aggregate of  in  and Mr Mitchells
 in  and the fewer long scores made in former days made a far
larger proportion of the total runs obtained by the whole side Mr
Makinsons runs in  were obtained against perhaps the best bowling
eleven that Oxford ever possessed containing Messrs C D Marsham A
Payne W Fellowes and W Fiennes while Mr Mitchells score in 
was not much less than half of the total score of his side Against
him are to be found the names of Plowden Lang Salter and Lyttelton
and never in any match except in the previous year when they had the
same quartet has Cambridge been so strong in bowling as they were in
 The highest average has been secured by Mr Key of Oxford and
this amounts to no less than  Close behind him comes Mr Wright of
Cambridge with an average of  then Mr Mitchell with  and
Mr Yardley with  Mr Mitchells average is remarkable as his
highest score was  though he was once not out Mr Wright was twice
not out Mr Key and Mr Mitchell once each Mr Yardley however was
always got out in the end In estimating these averages we are only
reckoning the players who represented their University for four years

The earlier bowlers as far as wickets are a guide carry all before
them Not until the twentieth match played in Mr C D
Marshams first yearwas any analysis kept To judge however by
the standard of wickets Mr G E Yonge of Oxford who in four years
obtained thirtynine wickets Mr E W Blore and Mr Sayres both of
Cambridge who in the same time got thirtytwo are entitled to the
highest place

Naturally enough as Mr Marsham played five years and was also the
best bowler on the whole that Oxford ever turned out most wickets
fell to his share He got forty wickets at a cost of  runsthat
is to say of only  runs a wicketa great performance under any
circumstances Two wides only were scored against Mr Marsham and
there is no record of a no ball He bowled a strictly orthodox
roundarm of fast medium pace and generally round the wicket

Mr E M Kenney was a very fast and dangerous lefthand bowler most
terrifying to a nervous batsman for he delivered that unpleasant sort
of ball which pursues the batsman and is apt to adopt a pugilistic
metaphor to get in heavily on the ribs During the three years that
Mr Makinson played for Cambridge he took twentyone wickets at a cost
of  runs or just  runs a wicket and when it is remembered that he
was also distinctly the best bat in the two elevens each of the three
years he played it may be safely assumed that as an allround man
he has never had a superior with the exception of Mr A G Steel
At the same time it must be admitted that in bowling he was quite as
successful against Oxford as his merits justified

The famous Cambridge fast bowler Mr R Lang played three years
and got fifteen wickets at a cost of only  runs or a fraction over
 runs per wicketan analysis that has never been surpassed and
deserves to be quoted as an example for young players to emulate In
 he bowled in the two innings twentyone overs for  runs and
six wickets In  he lost his pace owing to an injured arm and was
unsuccessful bowling twentysix overs for  runs and no wicket In
 in the two innings he bowled twentynine overs for  runs and
nine wickets and to take the first innings alone we find he bowled
only thirtyfour balls for  runs and five wickets all clean bowled
Considering his pace he was very straight and only bowled  wides
in all three matches H W Salter of Cambridge played two years
and obtained fourteen wickets for  runs or a fraction over  runs
a wicket another extraordinary performance Mr H M Plowden who
played four years from  lowered nineteen wickets for  runs
or an average of  runs a wicket In no previous or subsequent years
has either University been so amply provided with bowling strength as
was Cambridge during these three years as besides Salter Lang and
Plowden in  she had Messrs E B Fawcett and D R Onslow and in
 and  the Hon C G Lyttelton who bowled for the Gentlemen

The greatest bowling feat in the whole history of University cricket
belongs to Mr S E Butler of Eton and Oxford renown and took place
in  Cambridge had some good bats in her elevenMessrs Money
Tobin Fryer Scott Yardley and Thornton a rough and ready hitter in
the person of Mr Cobden and a fair batsman in Mr Stedman But Mr
Butler found an oldfashioned Lords wicket and he bowled a terrific
pace and got on a spot which shot and made his balls break considerably
down the hill He got the whole ten wickets in one innings and in
the match he lowered fifteen wickets for  runs His bowling was
unplayable on the first day eight of the ten wickets in the first
innings were clean bowled and twelve out of the whole fifteen

Mr Woods who played for Cambridge for the four years ending 
bowled  overs for  runs and thirtysix wickets an average of
five wickets per innings at  runs per wicket a great record for these
daysa feat great enough to entitle him to an honorary degree in the
opinion of the Master of Peterhouse

Mr Berkeley had during his four years an uphill task as he was
in three losing elevens and that means a heavy handicap as every
cricketer knows But considering that he was the only real bowler on
his side during all the four years he played his record of  overs
for  runs and twentyseven wickets and  runs per wicket is very
good and such a bowler deserved a better fate than to play in three
defeats out of four matches

It will interest and comfort young cricketers to remind them how many
great batsmen have failed in these matches We feel sure that these
latter will excuse us for pointing out their shortcomings for they
will know that we do so only to sustain their weaker brethren and
illustrate the glorious uncertainty of the game The late Mr John
Walker who for several years represented the Gentlemen got  runs in
six innings or a proud average of  His younger brother Mr R D
Walker the silverhaired veteran of five InterUniversity contests
gallantly led off with an innings of  but the result of his five
years batting against Cambridge was  runs in ten innings his first
innings in fact amounting to onehalf of the total runs he scored in
five years Yet he played for the Gentlemen in   and 
and these were the last three years he played for Oxford M A W
Ridley played for four years and his runs for seven innings came to a
total of  or an average of  runs per innings as once he carried
his bat The present Lord Cobham who played for the Gentlemen of
England his first year at Cambridge batted exactly on a par with Mr
Ridley as he also made  runs in six innings and was once not out
Cambridge men of his date will tell you that on Fenners nobody was
ever more dangerous and his scores for those days were enormous Mr
C G Laneof whom the poet wrote

    You may join with me in wishing that the Oval once again
    May resound with hearty plaudits to the praise of Mr Lane

played seven innings for a total of  runs Take courage then young
cricketer and know that if you fail you fail in good company

Most extraordinary have been the vicissitudes of fortune in several of
these matches Oxford in  had a fine eleven which easily defeated
Cambridge by eight wickets and in  they played no fewer than
eight of their old eleven Cambridge played seven and the four new
men were the famous pair of young Etonians Messrs Longman and Tabor
the Harrovian Mr Baily and the Wykehamist Mr Raynor The odds on
Oxford at the start were about  to  Yet Cambridge on winning the
toss put together the largest total yet realised by either side in any
one innings namely  runs The two Etonian freshmen were on the
whole entitled to the chief honours on this occasion as for the first
time they made over  runs before the fall of a wicket Mr Longman
was badly run out by Mr Yardley after batting for about two and a
half hours or else another  runs might have been put on When the
Oxford eleven went in to bat not one of them could look at Mr Powys
the fastest bowler of the day except Messrs Ottaway and Tylecote who
both played remarkably well in the second innings Mr Powys secured
thirteen wickets at a cost of  runs or a trifle under  runs a
wicket

Everybody has heard of the run success of Cambridge in  and
the run victory of Oxford in  The difference between the two
matches consisted in the fact that in  not till the last wicket
was actually bowled down did it appear possible for Oxford to lose
in  the issue was quite doubtful till Mr A F Smith made that
fatal stroke to a plain lob Cambridge in  were on the whole
the favourites not that there was much to choose between the two
elevens but because they had won the three previous years In batting
Cambridge had Messrs Dale Money and Yardley and Oxford Messrs
Ottaway Pauncefote and Tylecotequite a case of six of one and half
a dozen of the other though Yardley was far the most dangerous man
In bowling Oxford were handicapped by Mr Butlers strained arm which
prevented him from bowling more than a few overs but they possessed
Messrs Belcher and Francis two good fast bowlers Cambridge had
Cobden for a fast bowler Harrison Ward for a medium pace and Bourne
for slow round So while Mr Francis was some way the best fast bowler
of the two elevens Oxford were deficient in variety while Cambridge
possessed all paces and also Mr Moneys lobs Cambridge won the toss
and put together  runs the good bats all failing and only Mr
Scott doing credit to himself by an innings of  Oxford scored more
equally though neither Ottaway nor Pauncefote contributed more than
modest double figures the total nevertheless came to  or a
majority of  The next hours play apparently saw Cambridge utterly
routed Mr Dale stopped all that time but nobody stopped with him
The total at the fall of the fifth wicket was  or only  on We
are going to win a match at last said one of the Oxonians to another
who had been educated at Rugby Wait a bit said the Rugbeian who
turned his head and saw Yardley advancing to the wicket I have
seen this man get  before now The companion of the last speaker
possibly had not seen Yardley perform this feat but he had not long
to wait There are several batsmen whose play baffles criticism and
Yardley was one of them He certainly played some balls in a manner
that purists found fault with but good judges of the game could see
that there was genius in his method and genius as we all know rises
above canons and criticism If Mr Yardley had not touched a bat for
six months still he might walk to the wickets and play a magnificent
innings for genius requires little or no practice Those familiar with
his play knew that they might look out for squalls if he was allowed
to get set Mr Dale was at the other end playing every ball with a
perfectly straight bat and in the most correct style In the minds of
both of them it was a crisis for each knew that unless they put on a
lot of runs the match was lost as five of their side were out One
mistake and Cambridge would have to retire beaten But no mistake was
made Yardley got set the bowling was fast and so was the ground and
the former was hit into a complete knot There seemed to be no prospect
of getting either of them out when Mr Yardley sent a ball hard back
to the bowler who made a fine catch off a fine hit and the Cambridge
man retired with the first InterUniversity  Mr Dale made a leg
hit and was splendidly caught by Mr Ottaway with one hand over the
ropes

In a short time the innings was over and Oxford had to face a total
of  to win the match In these days on a hard wicket this is
regarded as a comparatively easy feat but runs were not so easy to
accumulate eighteen years ago and the betting was now even Cambridge
for choice One Oxford wicket was soon got and then a long stand was
made by Messrs Fortescue and Ottaway both of whom played excellent
cricket The total was brought up to  for only one wicket the
betting veered round to  to  on Oxford and Mr Ward was put on to
bowl This change was the turning point of the game Mr Fortescue
was soon bowled so was Mr Pauncefote and with the total at  the
betting was again evens Oxford for choice Mr Ward had found his
spot and was bowling with deadly precision when Mr Tylecote came in
Both Ottaway and Tylecote now batted cautiously and well and Mr Ward
went off for a time Mr Tylecote was a very good bat but compared
to Ottaway only mortal how on earth Ottaway was to be got out was a
problem that seemed wellnigh insoluble The total went up to  or
only  runs to win and seven wickets to go down the betting  to  on
Oxford A yell was heard and Mr Tylecote was bowled by Mr Ward and
Mr Townshend came in

Mr Ward from the pavilion end was at this stage bowling to Ottaway
who made a characteristic hit low and not hard to shortleg Mr
Fryer was not a good field and Cambridge generally were fielding
badly but he rose to the occasion and made a good catch close to the
ground so close that Ottaway appealed but in vain and the score
stood at  for  wickets down runs wanted to win Mr Hill now
came in and began to play a free confident game at once A bye was
run and a sharp run was made by Townshend by a hit to third man
but Townshend was then caught off Ward and Francis came in and
after making a single was lbw to the same bowler During Hills
partnership with Townshend and Francis he knocked up  runs by good
bustling play and he now stood at the nursery end to receive the last
ball of an over from Ward  runs being wanted to win and Butler
in the other end Hill hit the ball fairly hard to sharp shortleg
and Bourne measured his length on the ground stopped the ball and
converted the hit from a fourer to a single Hill got to the other end
an over was called and the ball tossed to Cobden who was faced by
Hill  runs being wanted to win and  to tie

We say with confidence that never can one over bowled by any bowler
at any future time surpass the over that Cobden was about to deliver
then and it deserves a minute description Cobden took a long run and
bowled very fast and was for his pace a straight bowler But he bowled
with little or no break had not got a puzzling delivery and though
effective against inferior bats would never have succeeded in bowling
out a man like Mr Ottaway if he had sent a thousand balls to him
However on the present occasion Ottaway was out those he had to bowl
to were not firstrate batsmen and Cobden could bowl a good yorker

You might almost have heard a pin drop as Cobden began his run and
the ball whizzed from his hand Mr Hill played the ball slowly to
coverpoint and rather a sharp run was made As the match stood
Oxford wanted  to tie and  to win and three wickets to go down Mr
Butler to receive the ball The second ball that Cobden bowled was
very similar to the first straight and well up on the off stump Mr
Butler did what anybody else except Louis Hall or Shrewsbury would
have done namely let drive vigorously Unfortunately he did not keep
the ball down and it went straight and hard a catch to Mr Bourne
to whom everlasting credit is due for he held it and away went Mr
Butleramidst Cambridge shouts this time The position was getting
serious for neither Mr Stewart nor Mr Belcher was renowned as a
batsman Rather pale but with a jaunty air that cricketers are well
aware frequently conceals a sickly feeling of nervousness Mr Belcher
walked to the wicket and took his guard He felt that if only he could
stop one ball and be bowled out the next still Mr Hill would get
another chance of a knock and the match would probably be won Cobden
had bowled two balls and two more wickets had to be got if therefore
a wicket was got each ball the match would be won by Cambridge and Mr
Hill would have no further opportunity of distinguishing himself In a
dead silence Cobden again took the ball and bowled a fast ball well up
on the batsmans legs A vision of the winning hit flashed across Mr
Belchers brain and he raised his bat preparatory to performing great
things hit at the ball and missed it and he was bowled off his legs
There was still one more ball wanted to complete the over and Mr
Belcher a sad man walked away amid an uproarious storm of cheers

Matters were becoming distinctly grave and very irritating must
it have been to Mr Hill who was like a billiardplayer watching
his rival in the middle of a big break he could say a good deal and
think a lot but he could do nothing Mr Stewart spes ultima of
Oxford with feelings that are utterly impossible to describe padded
and gloved nervously took off his coat in the pavilion If ever a man
deserved pity Mr Stewart deserved it on that occasion He did not
profess to be a good bat and his friends did not claim so much for
him he was an excellent wicketkeeper but he had to go in at a crisis
that the best bat in England would not like to face Mr Pauncefote
the Oxford captain was seen addressing a few words of earnest
exhortation to him and with a rather sick feeling Mr Stewart went
to the wicket Mr Hill looked at him cheerfully but very earnestly
did Mr Stewart wish the next ball well over He took his guard and
held his hands low on the bat handle which was fixed fast as a tree
on the blockhole for Mr Pauncefote had earnestly entreated Mr
Stewart to put the bat straight in the blockhole and keep it there
without moving it This was not by any means bad advice for the bat
covers a great deal of the wicket and though it is a piece of counsel
not likely to be offered to W G Grace or Stoddart it might not
have been inexpedient to offer it to Mr Stewart Here then was the
situationMr Stewart standing manfully up to the wicket Mr Cobden
beginning his run and a perfectly dead silence in the crowd Whiz went
the ball but alasas many other people cricketers and politicians
alike have donethe good advice is neglected and Stewart instead of
following his captains exhortation to keep his bat still and upright
in the blockhole just lifted it fly went the bails and Cambridge
had won the match by two runs The situation was bewildering Nobody
could quite realise what had happened for a second or so but then
Up went Mr Absaloms hat down the pavilion steps with miraculous
rapidity flew the Rev A R Ward and smash went Mr Charles Marshams
umbrella against the pavilion brickwork

One word more about this nevertobeforgotten match The unique
performance of Cobden has unduly cast in the shade Mr Wards
performance in the second innings It was a good wicket and Oxford
had certainly on the whole a good batting eleven Yet Mr Ward bowled
thirtytwo overs for  runs and got six wickets and of those six
wickets five were certainly the best batsmen on the side He clean
bowled Messrs Fortescue Pauncefote and Tylecote and got out in
other ways Messrs Ottaway Townshend and Francis It is hardly too
much to say that in this innings Mr Ward got the six best wickets and
Mr Cobden the four worst In the whole match Mr Ward got nine wickets
for  runs and this again let it be said on an excellent ground
Comparisons are odious however and the four Cambridge men Yardley
Dale Ward and Cobden have no reason to be jealous of each other and
every reason to be satisfied with themselves

Oxford have got a victory to set off against this Cambridge triumph
in  It took place five years later and though Mr Ridleys
bowling at the finish was not condensed into one sensational over like
Cobdens still the greatest credit is due to him for putting himself
on at the right moment fully realising an undoubted truth that lobs
are most terrifying to very nervous players at a crisis

Comparing the two elevens on paper it would appear that Oxford were
the better bowling eleven and were considerably superior in fielding
In  Cambridge deserved to have lost the match on account of their
bad fielding in  they succeeded in doing so Messrs Webbe and
Lang started by making  for the first wicket and Mr Webbe was twice
badly missed at shortslip Mr Lang ought to have been easily stumped
In Oxfords second innings four Oxford wickets including Ridley and
Webbe were down for  Mr Briggs came in and was badly missed at
shortslip directly and disaster was averted for some time and Mr
Game who scored  was missed shortly after he went to the wicket
The Oxford fielding was very fine all through though one member missed
two easy catches The bowling was more evenly divided Oxford had more
bowlers than Cambridge though Messrs Sharpe and Patterson were as
good as or better than Messrs Lang and Buckland But besides these
two Oxford had Mr Royle and Mr Ridley and Mr Kelcey while the two
Cambridge bowlers had to do most of the work

In batting the position was somewhat similar Ridley and Webbe were
superior to Longman and the second best Cantab but on the other hand
Cambridge were stronger all through On the whole the sides were very
even

Oxford made a good start thanks to the politeness of the Cambridge
field though both Webbe and Lang played well and fair scores were
made by Ridley Pulman and Buckland but at no time during the match
did Mr Ridley appear at home to Mr Pattersons bowling The total
reached  and there were  extras of which  were byes and the
Cambridge wicketkeeping was not up to the mark Cambridge batted on
the whole disappointingly in the first innings the captain Mr G H
Longman played a very good innings of  but the other scores were
below what was expected and again did extras prove of great value for
Cambridge realised  thereby But on the whole the Oxford fielding
was very fine and both Messrs Longman and Blacker who played good
steady cricket found great difficulty in getting the ball away

At the close of the Cambridge innings Oxford had a valuable balance of
 in their favour and most thoroughly did they deserve this advantage
on account of their very superior fielding It is always consoling to
an eleven who are beginning their second innings to feel that every
hit adds to the total that the other side must get before they can
win and that their energy is not to be applied towards wiping off a
deficit Oxford had this balance of  in their favour and very sorely
was it needed for their wickets fell with depressing rapidity Both
Sharpe and Patterson bowled admirably the former had both Lang and
Campbell with the score at  only Ridley again fell to Patterson with
the total at  and at  Webbe was out to a good running catch from
shortslip to shortleg

The match now looked well for Cambridge as Ridley and Webbe were far
superior to their comrades Mr Webbe had scored most consistently all
through the year this second innings of  contained no mistake and
nobody ever could have looked more firmly set for a large score Four
wickets for  was a very bad start but again did the Cambridge eleven
show great politeness to their opponents for directly Mr Briggs came
in he was badly missed at shortslip off Mr Sharpe and Messrs Briggs
and Pulman raised the score to  when the former was clean bowled
by a lob Mr Pulman stayed till the total reached  when he was
stumped off Mr Sharpe for an admirable innings of  He had played
very well in his first innings but his second stopped an undeniable
rot was quite chanceless and no innings under the circumstances could
have been more useful Mr Game then came in and again did Cambridge
rise to the occasion and miss him off an easy chance when he had made
 only and he showed his gratitude by hitting up  before he was
well caught the total being  Mr Buckland was clean bowled by
Mr Patterson first ball and nine runs later Mr Royle was stumped
having played a most useful innings of  Both Messrs Tylecote and
Kelcey smacked up small double figures and the total of the innings
was a very much better score than at one time seemed probable If
the chances had been taken the total might not have reached  and if
a list could be made of the matches lost by bad catching angels would
weep

Oxfords second innings was not over till a quarter to seven but Mr
Ridley rightly insisted on the letter of the law being kept and five
minutes before the drawing of the stumps Oxford were in the field and
two nervous Cambridge batsmen in a fading light were walking slowly to
the wickets Only one over was bowled and a leghit for four was the
only result

Illustration THE INTERVAL

We have said that the Oxford captain rightly insisted on Cambridge
going in and we contend that Mr Ridley acted wisely and not unfairly
in so doing He had the law on his side and if the law is not to be
enforced in the University match when is it ever likely to be Mr
Ridley also probably anticipated the fact that the Cambridge captain
would be unwilling to run the chance of sacrificing one of his good
wickets and that the order of going in would be altered This may be a
considerable disadvantage to the side it is not certain that it was in
the present case but Mr Macan who went in fifth wicket down in the
first innings had to go in considerably later in the second innings
and thus a good batsman was wasted

Messrs Sharpe and Hamilton went in first at the beginning of the
third day Cambridge wanted  runs to win and had all their wickets
standing Both Sharpe and Hamilton played well at the start and
brought the score up to  when the latter put his leg in front and
departed Mr Lucas came in but was clean bowled for  runs two
wickets for  Mr Longman the captain came in and played steadily
and well and the bowling for the first time in the innings seemed to
be collared Lang went off Ridley bowled three overs for  runs
and Mr Royle took the ball Mr Royles bowling proved the turning
point of the game He was not by any means an accurate bowler but at
times his balls broke fast and were most difficult to play He bowled
three maidens and with the fifteenth ball clean bowled Mr Sharpe
who had played an excellent innings of  He had stepped into the
breach overnight and gone in when twilight was coming on having passed
through that ordeal safely he completed a most useful innings next
day Messrs Longman and Sharpe had brought the score from  to 
but Royle made Blacker play a ball on at  and clean bowled Longman
at  for a second very good innings The ball that bowled Mr Longman
was a dead shooter of the old sort which came back also considerably
Messrs Greenfield and Lyttelton were now in together and the score
again steadily rose though Mr Lyttelton was manifestly uneasy with
Royles bowling However the total came to  when Lyttelton was
badly missed and a snick put  on the board but at  Greenfield
made a bad hit and was caught at midoff and in walked Mr Sims Sims
this year was a powerful and dangerous batin fact he was the most
determined hitter in the two elevens and on the present occasion
he made a great bid for victory He possessed a bulldog courage in
whatever he undertook and his contemporaries at Cambridge could
scarcely believe that so strong a man could have caught a chill and
died so quickly as he did some few years later while in full work as
an energetic clergyman in the North of England Shortly after Sims had
gone in Lyttelton was a second time missed though fortunately for
Oxford the mistake mattered little for from a fine leghit he was
grandly caught by Webbe close to the ropes while running at full speed
It was not a high hit but it would have hit a spectator on the nose
if the fieldsman had not caught it There was no finer bit of fielding
in the match than this and it was hard to be got out in such a way
though the batsman was lucky to have made  runs The score was 
when Lyttelton was out or  to win and  wickets to go down and the
betting  to  on Oxford Messrs Sims and Patterson played well and
brought the score to  or  to win when down came the rain and
play was stopped for an hour and a half It rained hard for a time and
Oxford had to turn out to bowl with a wet ball and field on slippery
ground Mr Patterson played well and Sims shut his teeth and went
to work with savage determination The runs came fast in  minutes
the score had been raised from  to  when Ridley went on to bowl
and with his first ball clean bowled Patterson Macan then came in and
made a single  to win and a mighty whack did one of Ridleys balls
then get from Sims who sent the ball over the bowlers head to the
ropes like a cannon shot and Lang took the ball from Royle  runs
being wanted to win the match for Cambridge A legbye was got from
Langs first ball and a no ball followed making  to win It appeared
good odds on Cambridge for Sims did not look like getting out and
his hits had a way of going to the boundary Be it remembered that the
ball was wet and heavy and forgetfulness of this fact on the part of
Sims at this stage cost him his wicket and Cambridge the match Mr
Game was fielding deep squareleg close to the ropes by the tennis
court and Pulman was on the on side close to the lefthand corner of
the enclosure that stands on the left facing the pavilion There was
a considerable space between these two fields and off the full pitch
on his legs which Sims now received from Lang the ball might have been
swept safely under the ropes anywhere between the two men But Sims
no doubt felt as strong and as lusty as an eagle and forgetting that
the ball was wet and heavy got under it and tried to lift it over the
ropes The sodden ball refused to go so far and Pulman running some
distance made what with the ball dry and of a normal weight would have
been an ordinary country catch With the ball wet and heavy however
his success was the more commendable and back to the pavilion
crestfallen and sad went Sims Returning for a moment to the run
match the two men for whom sympathy may be felt because the game did
not result in favour of their side were Ottaway in  and Sims in
 Ottaway got out when his side wanted  runs to win and had four
wickets to go down and Sims when only  runs were wanted and there
were two wickets to fall Both are now dead but as long as any matches
in England are remembered these two innings will be borne in the memory
of those who witnessed them

Mr Smith had to face a crisis he had long been dreading and he
walked apprehensively to the wicket Mr Macan who was in had only
received two or three balls so both had to feel their way cautiously
It is perhaps true to say that at the extreme moments of nervousness
climatic surroundings have no effect on the constitution be this as
it may the air was chilly the ground was wet and the sun invisible
Probably Mr Smith felt as cold as if he had been in a damp cellar A
wellknown Harrovian told the writer at this stage that he had seen Mr
Smith get over  runs against the famous George Freemans bowling
What did that matter if he was unable to get six runs against Ridleys
lobs He somehow or other stopped two balls in a doubtful sort of
style and played slowly forward to the third thinking that after the
manner of lobs it would twist The wet ground prevented this it went
on and hit the middle stump and Oxford won the match by six runs

We regard this match as a model of what a cricket match should be
the runs were not too numerous the interest was kept up to the very
end It would have been hard lines perhaps for Oxford to have lost the
match for the rain that fell in Cambridges last innings was unlucky
for the dark blue it is impossible to bowl or field well with a wet
ball and it happened that Sims was just the man to take advantage of
this state of things The bowling was managed with great skill by Mr
Ridley and as we have said before he realised an undoubted truth
that lobs are often fatal to a batsman who is paralysed by nervousness

It is not easy to say with any certainty that the bowling at the
Universities is better or worse than it was We are inclined to think
that writing in  there are signs that it is better than it was
between the years  and  but not equal to the days of C
D Marsham R Lang Plowden and Kenney but in those days it was
quite possible for a side to have weak bowling and yet get out their
opponents with the help of the more difficult wickets This was the
case in  Oxford were led by the famous Mr Mitchell and were a
strong batting eleven Cambridge were fairly strong in batting but
they deliberately chose to meet Oxford with only two bowlers Messrs
Curteis and Pelham So well did these two gentlemen perform that almost
to the very end the result was doubtful Messrs Fowler and Booth each
succeeded in getting a wicket in the first innings and Mr Booth one
in the second innings but between them they only bowled twentytwo
overs in the whole match while Mr Curteis bowled seventyfive overs
for eight wickets and Mr Pelham fiftysix overs for five wickets
This was a fine match won at the finish by a grand innings of Mr
Mitchells No man ever went in at a more critical time than he did
this second innings neither did anybody ever bat with better nerve
Out of  required to win the match no fewer than  not out fell
to his share and Oxford won by four wickets The Cambridge eleven
of  had a most extraordinary run of success never as far as we
know equalled by any University eleven They won no fewer than eight
matches and not a defeat or a draw is found against them They beat
Oxford by  runs and the Australians in one innings There is no
doubt that during that year if a representative English eleven had
been chosen to play Australia or any other eleven no fewer than four
out of the Cambridge eleven would have been found in the English team
They were not all good but the superlative excellence of those four
made the eleven one of the best that has yet played in these matches
and that of  was almost as good

It may interest some of our readers if we make a few remarks as to the
standing of the various public schools in regard to the composition of
the University elevens We have analysed the elevens from  to 
inclusive and as is perhaps natural Eton comes first having had
during that period fiftynine of her alumni representing one or other
of the Universities We are not reckoning the number of years that each
played but fiftynine different Etonians have in the last thirtythree
years played in the University match thirtyfour for Cambridge
twentyfive for Oxford Harrow is represented by fortysix players
twentyfour at Oxford and twentytwo at Cambridge Rugby comes next
with twentynine nineteen for Oxford and ten for Cambridge At one
time Rugby was almost on a level with Eton and Harrow for from the
years  to  inclusive there were always two Rugby men playing in
the match and sometimes more since that time however more than two
Rugbeians have never played two have played only twice and from 
downwards two only have played Mr Leslie and Mr Warner were the last
good cricketers Rugby sent out and her prowess seems much diminished
as compared with the days of Pauncefote Yardley Francis Kenney and
Case Winchester has been represented by twentythree of whom all but
three have played for Oxford while out of eighteen Marlborough men
twelve have played for Oxford but Cambridge men will ever gratefully
tender their thanks to Marlborough for the services of Mr A G Steel
by far the greatest player ever turned out by that school and perhaps
the best allround cricketer that has yet played for either University
Seventeen Cliftonians have played for Oxford and two for Cambridge
but eleven out of fourteen Uppingham boys have represented Cambridge
Repton has contributed nine players five representing Cambridge and
four Oxford Charterhouse has had nine University players Tonbridge
six Cheltenham and Westminster have had five and on the whole the
proportion between Oxford and Cambridge has been about equal

Of allround players both Universities have had their full share in
numbers Cambridge has been helped by Makinson A G Steel C T
Studd and F S Jackson and Oxford by Messrs Maitland R D Walker
and S C Voules The great strength of Oxford in the years 
arose not only from the fact that in Mr Mitchell it possessed one
of the five greatest bats in England but also that it had four such
wonderful allround men as Messrs Voules Walker Evans and Inge in
 and the same quartette with the substitution of Mr Maitland for
Mr Inge in  and  But not one of the five was quite equal
to any one of the Cambridge quartette and when we say this we take
as our basis the performances of the four in the University matches
and we do not consider the men who played before  for it is
difficult to make fair comparisons over so long a distance of time The
abovementioned four will be found in the first halfdozen of batsmen
and in the first halfdozen of bowlers Messrs Makinson Yardley
Lucas A Lyttelton A G Steel C T Studd F S Jackson and N
F Druce are the best batsmen from Cambridge and Messrs Mitchell
Maitland Ottaway Pauncefote E F S Tylecote Key Rashleigh and
Palairet the best from Oxford In bowling the champions from Oxford
are Messrs Marsham Traill Kenney S E Butler and Berkeley from
Cambridge Messrs Plowden Pelham Lang Woods and A G Steel This
is an opinion only and would have to be considerably altered if we
were to take another basis than the InterUniversity match to draw our
conclusions from Mr Kenney never played for the Gentlemen against the
Players and neither he nor Mr Plowden could be compared as a bowler
to Mr Kempson whose performance against the Players is historical
But he failed against Oxford In the same way Lord Cobham Mr Ridley
and Mr Lane were each as good as Mr Pauncefote but they failed in
the InterUniversity match and consequently are out of our list

FOOTNOTES

 The difficulty of getting accurate facts about this unique over
has been immense The author has before him the written statement
of Mr Hill a copy of the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News
containing a letter of Mr Yardley who was keeping wicket and was
therefore in a position to judge and a letter from Mr Cobden and Mr
Belcher In the first edition of this book Mr Stewart is said to have
been bowled off his legs this is inaccurate and the author apologizes
for the blunder Mr Cobden complains of the account generally and
says that all three balls were of a good length and that he never
bowled better balls in all his life The author in the above has
written what he believes to be accurate relying chiefly on the written
evidence of Messrs Hill Yardley and Belcher and in a less degree
from what he has heard from some spectators It was not Stewart that
was bowled off his legs but Belcher and in order that the public
may form their own judgment the written statements of Messrs Hill
Yardley and Belcher are here inserted Mr Hill writesBelcher was
bowled with a yorker halfvolley and Stewart with a halfvolley but
whether off his leg or not I do not remember Mr Hill also writes
that on meeting Cobden some years later Cobden repeated that they were
three of the best balls he ever bowled to which Mr Hill replied that
they were all halfvolleys and that he believed that if he had had any
one of them he could have won the match with a fourer Now Mr Yardley
in allusion to the authors statement that the ball that Butler was
caught off was straight and well up on the off stump writes As a
matter of fact the ball in question was a very long hop extremely wide
on the off so much so that I have no hesitation in stating that if Mr
Butler had made no attempt to strike at it the umpire would have called
a wide The batsman however was possessed of an exceptionally long
reach and just managed to strike the ball with the extreme end of his
bat to coverpoint where it was beautifully caught by Mr Bourne

Now as to Belchers ball Mr Yardley says The ball in question was
the most delicious halfvolley on the legs which Mr Belcher did his
utmost to hit out of Lords ground Fortunately for Cambridge his deeds
were not so good as his intentions for he hit too hard at the ball
which he missed and which striking him on the left leg cannoned on
to his right leg and from thence on to his wicket

On the point of Mr Stewarts ball Mr Yardley writes This fourth and
last ball was the only straight one of that celebrated over It was
an exceedingly long hop scarcely pitching halfway and coming along
surprisingly slow off the pitch Had it not been for that circumstance
Mr Stewart would probably have not lost his wicket as he did for
it was only at the very last moment that he neglected his captains
instructions and removed his bat from the blockhole thereby allowing
the ball to strike his off stump about threequarters of the way up
Mr Yardley also writes that the scene appears to him as vivid after a
lapse of twenty years as it did then

Mr Belcher writes I am quite certain that I was bowled off my
legs the ball to the best of my recollection hit me just below the
knee of the right leg and went into the wicket At any rate I am quite
clear as to my leg being hit and my impression is that it was a very
goodlength ball and not a halfvolley I dont think I hit at it all
Of course at such a distance of time my recollections are somewhat
vague but the one point I am quite sure of is that I was bowled off
my leg

With these extracts before them the matter is now left to posterity




CHAPTER XII

GENTLEMEN AND PLAYERS

BY THE HON R H LYTTELTON


At first sight it appears impossible that amateursmen who play when
they chance to find it convenientshould be able to hold their own
against professional cricketers who make the game the business of their
lives Cricket however is the one game where the two classes contend
more or less on an equality unless football be also an exception Many
amateur cricketers are not bound to work for their daily bread and
they can consequently find time to play as much as a professional if
the accepted slang in which the adjective is employed as a substantive
be permissible Such was the state of things a few years ago when the
Walkers the Graces Mr Buchanan and others could always be depended
on to take part in the annual matches against the Players

But there are other reasons besides and here we tread on rather
delicate ground Suffice it to say that at one time and that was when
the Gentlemen used heavily to defeat the Players there was such a very
thin borderline between the status of the amateur and professional
that a definition of amateur was often asked for and never obtained
The position was getting acute when finally the Marylebone Club which
is not in the habit of moving except when very strong pressure is
exerted was obliged to discuss and legislate on the matter Broadly
speaking the rule stands that amateurs may take expenses and a
difficult and delicate point is now set at rest

It is a striking illustration of the great popularity of the game
that a large and increasing number of men annually give themselves up
to the profession of cricket and it is only in cricket that amateurs
and professionals regularly compete against each other We have heard
that from the county of Nottingham alone several hundred professional
bowlers emerge every year and go to fulfil cricket engagements in
various parts of the kingdom The limits of cricket seem likely to
be extended and we know of several English professionals who have
accepted offers from America and elsewhere So long ago as  the
famous Wm Caffyn was engaged in Australia later on Jesse Hide of
Sussex was in South Australia and several other players have been in
America All professionals or nearly all first come into notice as
bowlers A club with a ground wants a man who can bowl to its members
for an evenings practice and he has to be there to attend on any
member who may happen to come As a rule also he is required to play
for the club in the Saturday matches and he may earn by way of fixed
salary together with what he makes by bowling at a shilling for half
an hour l or l per week

If the club is situated in a county which possesses a county club
the professional may have inducements held out to him to take up a
permanent residence and become a naturalised resident The county of
Nottingham for instance has only one county eleven but she has
hundreds of professionals These men get engagements in all directions
and if they are good enough to be asked to play for their adopted
county it would be hard to deprive them of a livelihood though no
doubt it is provoking to Nottingham to see the success of Lancashire
largely owing to the play of Briggs a Notts man of whose virtues
Lancashire became aware before his own county Nor is Briggs a solitary
specimen for Walter Wright Lockwood Bean Brown and Wheeler play
respectively for Kent Surrey Sussex Cheshire and Leicestershire

The congestion of professional ability in certain favoured districts
is hard to explain Every cricketer has heard of Lascelles Hall the
famous village near Huddersfield to which Bates the Lockwoods the
Thewlises and Allan Hill belong There are several villages and small
towns near Nottingham where cricketers appear indigenous to the soil
just as primroses are in certain localities There have always been
cricketers in these parts and so sure is this constant supply that
some scientific society ought really to go down and inspect the spot
make a theory to explain the phenomenon and read a paper about it
Nottingham itself raised and reared Daft Shrewsbury Gunn Scotton
and Selby the famous SuttoninAshfield nursed Morley J C Shaw
Barnes and Briggs in their infancy There are several large towns in
Yorkshire such as Sheffield Leeds and other manufacturing centres
where the traditions of the place are in favour of cricket but it
is curious to observe that though it was not so in the days of Noah
Mann David Harris and the Hambledon Club the modern professional now
springs mainly from populous centres The only reason we can give for
this is that for young players between the ages of eight and eighteen
practice is everything and of this youngsters can generally make sure
in populous places In a rural district the same chances may seldom
occur In Nottingham and the West Riding towns hundreds of boys may be
seen playing almost at the mouth of coalpits and the practice they
get enables them to become professional players

Amateurs are not by any means in the same situation Apart from the
natural qualifications any lad may chance to possess he is largely
benefited or the reverse by the atmosphere of the schools to which
he is sent About the age of thirteen he is sent to a large public
school where cricket is regularly taught and he has a great deal of
experience if he can manage to get into his school eleven After that
he may go to Oxford or Cambridge and if he is fond of the game he may
play an unlimited quantity of cricket Many amateurs after they leave
the university disappear for ever from firstclass cricket as their
time then ceases to be their own

When we examine the MCC cricket Scores and Biographies we find
the same story over and over again This year the Gentlemen had to
regret the absence of Messrs Hankey and Kempson Mr Felix did not
play for the Gentlemen they as usual losing one of their best men
In a footnote attached to the score of the  match at Lords the
editor gives a list of no fewer than sixteen gentlemen who had to
abandon the game when in their prime It was in consequence of this
that in  a match was tried between Gentlemen and Players all under
thirty but with no better success for the Gentlemen

The first Gentlemen and Players match took place in  on the old
Lords ground so the contest between these teams is not so old by one
year as the Eton and Harrow It is true that in The Cricket Field
Mr Pycroft says that Lord F Beauclerk and the Hons H and T Tufton
had previously made an attempt to get a Gentlemen and Players match
and the Players won giving the services of T Walker Beldham and
Hammond These three men were nearly the best in England and to call
the Players a representative eleven without them was absurd The same
objection may be mentioned in discussing the next match in 
when the Gentlemen were helped by two of the foremost players this
made a more equal match but apparently rather too much was given
for the amateurs beat the Players in an innings and  runs Beldham
and Lambert were the two given men and at that time Lambert was
unquestionably the finest player of the day A second match was played
a fortnight later when the amateurs were a second time victorious
and in this case Lambert alone was given After this match there was
a considerable hiatus for the rival teams did not meet again till
 when a match was played on even terms the Players winning by six
wickets Mr Budd scored  for the Gentlemen and Tom Beagley  for
the Players

                Worthy Beagley
    Who is quite at the top
    With the bat hes first rate a brick wall at longstop

Mr Budd in this match stumped six of the Players and only one bye was
recorded against him and the longstop In  T C Howard who had
bowled for the Players was transferred to the Gentlemen and they won
by  runs In  the Gentlemen scored  and the Players  for six
wickets at which stage the Gentlemen succumbed and gave up the match
Beagley who appeared to be partial to amateur bowling made  not
out and began the long list of hundreds that have since been obtained
in this match In  Lord F Beauclerk bowled finely Mr Vigne
stumped four and caught two at the wicket Mr Budd made  runs and
the Gentlemen won by six wickets Elated by this victory in  the
amateurs again threw down the gauntlet on even terms and were defeated
heavily by  runs

This knockdown blow must have cowed the Gentlemen for in the next
four matches they played fourteen sixteen with Mathews and seventeen
in the two matches of  and each side won two In  there was
no match and in  and  they stole two players to help them
This was a period when the superiority of the professionals was very
marked for in   and  odds were given on each occasion but
still victory refused to crown the efforts of the amateurs In 
the Gentlemen defended smaller wickets than those of their opponents
but the game was admitted to be a failure The extraordinary result of
all the matches between  and  in which the Gentlemen had odds
was that out of eight matches the Players won six The bowling of W
Lillywhite Cobbett and others was far too good for the amateurs and
the records of the Players were wonderful

In  however for the first time the famous Alfred Mynn appeared
on the scene This crack amateur was the idol of Kent and the terror
of his opponents Very tall in stature and heavy in weight he was at
that time and for many years subsequently one of the fastest bowlers in
England His physique was enormous and he could bowl a great number
of balls without any sacrifice of pace or precision When asked how
many balls he should like the over to consist of he said as far as he
was concerned he should like a hundred He was a hard hitter fond of
driving the ball in front of the wicket and was probably the champion
at the then frequently played singlewicket matches It must have been
a fine sight to see Alfred Mynn advance and deliver the ball he took
a short run and held himself up to nearly his full height as the ball
left his hand He was of unfailing good humour and is immortalised in
by far the best cricket poem yet published which may be found in the
Scores and Biographies vol ii p  Altogether he was one of
the leading players of his day and his arrival gave a strength to the
amateurs that was sorely needed

    Proudly sadly we will name himto forget him were a sin
    Lightly lie the turf upon thee kind and manly Alfred Mynn

In  the match was played on even terms but again the result
was disastrous to the amateurs for they were beaten in an innings
and  runs nor did the assistance of Cobbett and Redgate two of
the crack bowlers of the day save them from defeat in  though
Alfred Mynn scored  and bowled down four wickets In  eighteen
Gentlemen won by  runs and again was Alfred Mynn to the fore for
he scored  and  and got eight wickets In the following year was
played a match when the Gentlemen defended three wickets  inches
by  and the Players four  inches by  The match was the famous
Barn Door Match or Wards Folly but again the impotence of
the amateurs batting caused them to be defeated in one innings and
 runs Thirteen was the highest amateur score and the only double
figure and Lillywhite and Redgate apparently did what they liked in
the way of bowling In  Alfred Mynn was away so the amateurs
helped themselves to Pilch Cobbett and Wenman three good men from
the professional ranks they lost the match however by  runs
This was the last match in which odds have been given A drawn game
was played in  and twice the Players were victorious in  and
 In  and  the Gentlemen gained two victories the match in
 being their first win on even terms since  Mynn and Sir F
Bathurst got all the wickets for the Gentlemen the former scored 
and  and Mr Felix played a fine innings of  having been missed
badly at shortslip before he scored In  the Gentlemen actually
won in one innings on even terms for the first time on record Again
Alfred Mynn did excellent service for he made  runs and lowered
eight wickets Mr C G Taylor scored  runs and then his hat fell
on the wicket or rather it was knocked off which showed that Lords
had a way of testing the bravery as well as the skill of batsmen In
 the Gentlemen lost the services of Mr Felix perhaps their best
bat and Sir F Bathurst their second best bowler and were defeated
by  runs The famous William Lillywhite who handled the ball as he
would do a brick and Hillyer were the crack professional bowlers at
this time and sad havoc they made of amateur wickets Lillywhite was
fiftytwo years old in  two years older than W G Grace who in
the year  is par excellence the veteran cricketer The era of
Alfred Mynn and Sir F Bathurst was the golden age of amateur bowling
for Mynn was at the top of the tree in this department of the game
for a far longer period than any amateur has been since He played
twenty matches for the Gentlemen against the Players and though he
was generally on the losing side did great things both with bat and
ball especially with the latter In  the Players again won old
Lillywhite aged fiftythree taking twelve wickets for  runsa
remarkable performance

The match for the year  is an historical one for one or two
reasons It was the first time that George Parr aged  and William
Clarke aged  represented the Players Both were Nottingham men
the younger was very nearly the best bat in England and the elder if
not the best bowler all round certainly by far the most successful
bowler of lobs that has ever appeared Clarke had played for thirty
seasons before he was chosen to represent the Players He died in
 at the age of  played cricket during the last year of his
life and took a wicket with the last ball he ever bowled He was head
and captain of the All England Eleven which used to tour about the
country Very amusing work it must have been for old Clarke bowling
on rough provincial grounds to provincial batsmen and who can wonder
that he with several other bowling captains had a great dislike to
taking himself off He was oneeyed having lost his right eye while
indulging in the manly game of fives He certainly got a lot of wickets
in the best of matches but there is nothing to guide speculation as
to how Clarke and Lillywhite would have fared if they had bowled to
W G Grace and McLaren Round old Clarkes head as round the heads
of Fuller Pilch Alfred Mynn and William Lillywhite an aureole has
gathered they are the great lights of that epoch of cricket and
during his career old Clarke must have been one of those few bowlers
who generally made fools of batsmen

To return to this year of  as it was Parr and Clarkes first
Gentlemen and Players so it was C G Taylors last This great
player at all games was an Eton and Cambridge man and like many old
cricketers formed the theme of poets Taylor the most graceful of
all one writes and again he is represented as being

    Unlike our common sons whose gradual ray
    Expands from twilight into purer day
    His blaze broke forth at once in full meridian sway

Mr C G Taylor was evidently born with an eye he often ran out to
bowling to drive could field splendidly either at point coverpoint
or midwicket and bowled slow roundarm we are told both well and
gracefully We suspect that as may be inferred from the description
of his style of play there was a weak place in his defence and he
used to have long bouts of small scores But so graceful and altogether
fascinating was his style that all his great innings were indelibly
stamped on the memory of those who witnessed them In this his last
Gentlemen and Players match he got  and  It was a great match won
by the Gentlemen by one wicket and the credit was due to Messrs R P
Long and Taylor for batting and to Alfred Mynn and Sir F Bathurst for
bowling

In the following year  the Players again won but at this period
the sides were far more even than they had been before for any long
time together The redoubtable bowlers Mynn and Bathurst were helped by
Harvey Fellows the celebrated Etonian and George Yonge the Oxonian
and we doubt if the Gentlemen have ever been so strong in this line
since These two bowled out the Players in  for  and  runs
Mynn getting eight wickets in the second innings and hitting up 
runs In this year in fact it is a question if the amateurs were not
stronger in bowling than batting

In the next year  further triumph awaited the amateurs for
winning the toss they scored  runs compelled the Players to follow
on and won the match in one innings and  runs Alfred Mynn did not
get a wicket but Harvey Fellows bowled his fastest first hurt his
opponents and then got them out Old Wm Lillywhite played his last
Gentlemen and Players match this year and we read that he refused to
bat in his second innings because he was hurt by Mr Fellows He was 
years old so may be excused if he felt a little nervous on old Lords
ground at standing up to one who used to make the ball hum like a top

The famous Nonpareil bowler as old Lillywhite was called was the
king of bowlers in the days when he flourished Mr Robert Grimston
who remembered him well said that though a slow bowler he was quicker
off the ground than Alfred Shaw He lived in the days when wides were
common but it is recorded that during his whole career he did not
deliver half a dozen He was born in Sussex in  and played as a
given man for the Gentlemen in  and  after that began his
long career as principal bowler for the Players He was therefore
no less than  years of age when he played his first match for the
Players If to other cricketers may be given the credit of inventing
roundarm bowling still to Lillywhite and Broadbridge all honour is
due for having been the first really good roundarm bowlers Lillywhite
bowled in seventeen matches against the Gentlemen and got  wickets
or close upon eight wickets per match He was occasionally useful as a
bat and though he refused to go in as just recorded he had plenty
of pluck when younger for in a single wicket match he stood up for
 balls to George Brown to whose bowling Little Dench of Brighton
used to longstop with a sack stuffed full of straw to protect his
chest Batting gloves were not used in those days and Lillywhite had
his fingers broken three times before they were invented Fuller Pilch
played his last Gentlemen and Players match this year which is famous
for witnessing the farewell of such great cricketers as himself and
William Lillywhite Pilch was born in  and was therefore  years
old in 

    Another young tailor as fine a young man
    As eer hit a ball and then afterwards ran

Pilch was undoubtedly the champion of his day and his mantle fell on
George Parr He was the originator of what we call in modern times
forward play and his object was the sound one of smothering the ball
at the pitch He was the worst enemy of William Clarke for he left
his ground to balls that were well up and ran him down with a straight
bat He was one of the dauntless five that carried Kent into a unique
position among cricket counties

    And with five such mighty cricketers twas but natural to win
    As Felix Wenman Hillyer Fuller Pilch and Alfred Mynn

In  the famous Johnny Wisden came to the front and the Players
grew stronger and George Parr made  runs not out Wisden and Clarke
bowled unchanged and got rid of their rivals for  and  winning
the match in one innings and  runs in  and in  they also
won in a single innings Wisden Grundy and Caffyn were three fine
allround men and Joe Guy of Nottingham was apparently quite at home
to amateur bowling Both Mynn and Fellows had lost their devil or
perhaps it might be more correct to say that the latter had lost his
straightness and accuracy In  the Players won by five wickets and
the great Alfred Mynn retires from the scene as far as this match is
concerned

In  fine bowling won the Gentlemen a match by  runs Both Sir F
Bathurst and Mr Kempson bowled unchanged all through the two innings
of the Players and got rid of them for  and  Martingell got seven
wickets for  runs in the second innings of the Gentlemen so this
was essentially a bowlers match and though it is an historical fact
that it was the first time the Gentlemen never had to change their
bowling in  Mynn and Sir F Bathurst got all the wickets and Mr
Taylor was only on for a few overs Sir F Bathurst might therefore
have bowled one end all the time if Mr Taylor had relieved Mynn At
any rate to Sir F Bathurst is due the credit of being one of the main
causes of two defeats of the Players He was a fast bowler with a low
delivery but very straight

In  both sides played weak four Players refusing to come forward
because of a dispute between Clarke and the MCC and the Gentlemen
losing Messrs Hankey and Kempson An uneventful match was the result
and the Players again won From  to  the match was played
on even terms but the Players had a run of victory and not once
during that time did the Gentlemen prove successful There is no doubt
that the batting strength of the Players during these years was very
considerable and though George Parr Hayward and Carpenter did not
score their hundreds as the men of modern times so often have done
they made their fifties and sixties with nearly the same consistency
Parr was a most regular scorer during the decade between  and 
and his average for the whole series of these matches must have been
very high

In  the Players won easily by seven wickets though the
Gentlemen began well but in their second innings Dean and John
Lillywhite got them out for  five consecutive wickets falling
without a run In  the Gentlemen lost several of their best men
but the famous Oxonians Messrs Marsham and Payne bowled finely
and though the Players had only  to get to win they only pulled
through by two wickets Willsher played this year for the first time
and he and Wisden were too much for the Gentlemen The year  was
an historical one for two reasons In the first place at Lords was
played one of the closest matches of the series a game also famous
for one of those great batting feats the recollection of which lingers
long and in the second place because a second match was played for the
first time at the Oval The historical innings was that of Mr Reginald
Hankey whom George Parr considers the finest bat he ever saw This is
the proverbial effort quoted by all who saw it as the masterpiece of
its day and Mr Grace himself has never played an innings that made
more sensation Mr Hankey got  runs in an hour and threequarters
and hit the fast bowling of Willsher Wisden Jackson and Stephenson
all over the ground Messrs Hankey Haygarth Drake and Lane amassed
 runs the other seven only  between them and in the end the
players won by  runs Mr Drake played his hardest to win making a
score of  out of 

Illustration Kennington Oval 

At the Oval the Players won easily by ten wickets and on this ground
the Gentlemen lost every match till  In those days the Oval was
what we should call a better ground than Lordsthat is to say it
was more in favour of the batsmen and long scores and consequently
the weak amateur bowling was at a considerable discount In  at
the Oval the Players won by three wickets and R Daft played for the
Gentlemen for the first and only time At Lords in the same year the
Gentlemen collapsed in batting and lost by  runs the bowling of
Jackson being at this period an object of dread among the amateurs
In  the Players won both matches easily and the famous Robert
Carpenter made his first appearance scoring  runs at the Oval

In  at the Oval the Players won by eight wickets Mr T E
Bagge made two scores of  and  and the scoring altogether was
very large for those days Carpenter made  in his one innings At
Lords the other great Cambridgeshire player Tom Hayward came on the
scene with a vengeance scoring  runs and the Players won in one
innings and  runs though George Parr could not play At this time
the tremendous bowling of Jackson and Willsher was at its best and
Hayward Carpenter Parr and Daft were too good for amateur bowling
In  the Players won in one innings and  runs at Lords and in
one innings and  runs at the Oval Carpenter for the second time
making a hundred

In  a famous drawn match was played at the Oval Over  runs were
made in each innings and there was curious equality of scoring the
highest figures on each side being  made by Mr John Walker for
the Gentlemen and by Hayward for the Players The match was drawn
the Players having lost eight wickets and still wanting  runs Mr
Walker was bowling lobs a good deal in this match and whilst Anderson
and Stephenson were batting just before stumps were drawn at the end
of the day each having made  the famous Tom Lockyer who could
not endure lobs was continually to be seen nervously looking at the
clock to go in against these dreaded balls was a privilege he did not
covet Willsher Parr and Daft could not play for the Players nor
Messrs Makinson and Mitchell for the Gentlemen At Lords a match was
played between the elevens all the engaged being under thirty and
the Players won by  runs Mr C D Marsham the steadiest of all
Gentlemen bowlers played his last Gentlemen and Players match this
year He had taken part in ten matches but never had the good luck to
be on the winning side

In  the great Hayward made  runs in his only innings and
nobody else except Mr Walker got  runs in the match which the
Players won by eight wickets Jackson and Tarrant being quite
unplayable on the rough Lords wicket Mr R A H Mitchell played
for the first time and with the exception of Mr Grace no greater
batsman has appeared for the Gentlemen though he did not play for
many years At the Oval in the same year Mr Mitchell scored  and 
but the Gentlemen were weak in bowling and the Players won by nine
wickets At Lords in  Tarrant and Willsher bowled unchanged during
the match and the Gentlemen scored  in the two innings but at the
Oval there were a lot of runs made Stephenson putting together 
and Messrs C G Lyttelton and Makinson playing two fine innings for
the Gentlemen

In  began what brought about a revolution in cricket for W G
Grace played his first match and at once began to score Originally
more famous as a bowler he has since made runs in a manner and to an
extent altogether unparalleled in the history of cricket and soon
after his appearance the almost dull monotony of professional victory
was changed for the almost equally dull monotony of professional
defeat When he first began to play there was a schism in the
professional ranks which lasted several years between  and 
many of the crack Northern players refused to play at the Oval and
soon afterwards at Lords also It is a curious fact that at Lords in
 the amateurs won by eight wickets scoring a victory for the first
time since  after losing nineteen matches in succession This was
W G Graces first match and George Parrs last the latter having
scored sixty runs in his actual last innings Grace was sixteen years
old and Parr who first played in  was  Parrs average for
these matches was no less than twentyeight and his was altogether one
of the best and longest careers ever seen

Up to  Mr Grace had played  innings in these matches and
averaged  runs an innings From that date to the present he has
averaged  runs an innings and it is not easy to say that anybody
is his superior now in  The cricket schism weakened the Players
very much for several years at the beginning of his career and the
matches were in consequence not so interesting At the Oval in 
the Gentlemen followed their innings but won the match by  runs and
this was the first time they were successful at the Kennington ground
but no Northern players appeared except Grundy Wootton Luke Greenwood
and Alfred Shaw It was the same story in  and in every match
till  the amateurs were generally successful Since that period
however it has always been considered a special honour to be asked to
represent either eleven and the Committees at both Lords and the Oval
now offer higher terms to the professionals for this than for any other
match For some reason which we are totally unable to explain between
the years  and  there was a blight on the Players Their
batting fell off to an extraordinary extent nor was their fast bowling
at all up to the level of what it used to be Of course W G Grace
was the main cause of the apparent weakness of the bowling but this
could not account for the great batting deterioration The Players won
at the Oval in  and did not win again till  though one match
was drawn considerably in their favour Up to  including the Oval
matches and omitting three unfinished the Players lost twelve matches
in succession mainly owing to Mr Grace

If we take the best of the innings of  played in these matches to
the year  we find that there have been  individual innings of
over  runs played and Mr Grace has played eleven himself or
nearly a third of the whole and when we remember that he has had a
great deal of bowling to do as well it may be said with confidence
that no such performances for so many years have ever been seen in the
history of cricket In  he got  runs at Lords and  at the
Oval and in the latter match scored seven wickets in the Players
second innings In  the Gentlemen won by seven wickets having
to go in for  runs to win Mr Grace had got  runs in his first
innings went in first in the second innings stayed in till  runs
were scored and was then out for  The match was won by seven
wickets

The most exciting match that has occurred was in the year  The
Players made  and the Gentlemen  in the first innings and the
players  in the second Consequently to win the match  runs were
wanted by the Gentlemen The wicket was not quite a firstrate one
and good judges anticipated a close finish Grace made  and Alfred
Lyttelton  but Watson Ulyett and Morley bowled well and the
Gentlemen wanted  runs to win when nine wickets had fallen Mr W S
Patterson and G F Grace were in and gradually by excellent play
the runs were secured In  there was another most exciting match at
Lords when both sides were the strongest that could have been chosen
except that Shrewsbury did not assist the Players The wicket was very
difficult from start to finish and the Players only required  runs
to win It was Mr Woods first year of firstclass cricket and he
obtained ten wickets for  runs His bowling together with that of
Mr Smith and Mr Steel got the Players out for  and the Gentlemen
won the match by  runs

In  a tie match was played at the Oval for the first and only
time The wicket was difficult on the third day and the Gentlemen
who lost the services of Mr W G Grace for the first time since
 were  runs ahead on the first innings Bates did well for the
Players in the second innings and scored  runs making his last 
runs in eight hits Rain fell in the night and Flowers found a spot
Mr Lucas who scored  not out was really caught at point when he
had got  but the catch was a low one and neither umpire would give a
decision when appealed to So he continued his innings which was hard
for the Players Fourteen were wanted when Mr Rotherham joined Mr
Lucas and when  runs were wanted Bates badly missed Rotherham When
the match was a tie Peate was put on and clean bowled Rotherham with
his second ball The Players had rather hard lines in Lucass case but
they lost the match through the bad miss of Bates

In  following the good example set by Sir F Bathurst and Kempson
the Gentlemen won the Oval match without once having to change their
bowlers Messrs Steel and Evans were the heroes Evans got ten
wickets and Steel nine The wicket was difficult but the batting was
feeble and only realised totals of  and 

For the last few years the Players have gradually recovered their lost
prestige and reached the highwater mark of excellence in  when
for the first time since  they won both matches in one innings
each At the date of writing  the two sides present very much the
same features as have distinguished them hitherto The amateurs are as
strong and perhaps a little stronger in batting the professionals
much stronger in bowling though not perhaps so much so as at most
previous epochs but there is one remarkable difference and that is
in wicketkeeping In old days the professionals were vastly superior
to the amateurs now there is practically nothing between them and
this fact is probably because of the greater accuracy of modern
amateur bowling which makes it easier to take and does not knock the
wicketkeeper about so much

A survey of the whole series of matches points to the fact that as
is natural the Gentlemen have been and probably will be beaten as
a general rule Every cricketer knows what it is to play in an eleven
with a comrade either a batsman or bowler of commanding superiority
Such a man makes an eleven He does this by giving confidence to the
other ten members of the team They feel that the match does not depend
on them that if they fail he will pull them through and consequently
they go in boldly and score The two notable instances of one man
making an eleven are W G Grace and Spofforth Of course there were
good players amongst the Australians and amongst the Gentlemen but
the presence of Grace and Spofforth was an incalculable benefit The
Australians began a match feeling sure that even if they did not run
up large scores Spofforth would get rid of their opponents for less

In conclusion let us express a hope that the Gentlemen and Players
match will never fall through for having been played off and on
since  it has a notable history and it ought to be the summit of
ambition in every cricketer be he amateur or professional to appear
in these great classic contests




CHAPTER XIII

THE ART OF TRAINING YOUNG CRICKETERS

BY R A H MITCHELL


Illustration A sixyear old

If you want to play cricket you must begin as a boy is a true if
not an original remark We remember asking a member of a wellknown
cricketing fraternity what promise a younger brother gave of future
excellence and his reply was Hes no goodbut then he hasnt had a
chance for he was so delicate he couldnt begin till he was six years
old We do not ourselves presume to say that the game must necessarily
be learnt whilst a child is under his nurses care but nevertheless we
know of no instance unless Mr A E Stoddart forms an exception to
the rule of anyone attaining to the first rank who has not received
his early lessons in the noble game while still a boy If this be so
it is of interest to all cricketers to consider what training a boy
ought to have Is he to be left merely to the light of nature and his
own powers of observation or is he to be systematically coached and
taught daily how each stroke is to be made and each ball bowled Many
think that a training of this kind can hardly be begun too soon or
carried out with too great care and rigour This may be so but we
are by no means inclined to agree with such a Spartan discipline We
believe that in games as in life if a thing is worth doing at all
it is worth doing well but although we claim to be second to none in
our keenness to see good boy cricketers we differ in the method we
advocate from those who support so severe a system of coaching young
boys

Let us give some reasons in support of our view In the first place
success in cricket and not in cricket alone depends on the enjoyment
and interest taken in the game and we believe that there is great
danger of destroying this enjoyment and interest by incessant coaching
and teaching at too early an age In the second place all coaching has
a tendency at first to eradicate individual peculiarities and to cramp
a natural style Mr W G Grace Mr A G Steel Shrewsbury and many
other wellknown batsmen have peculiarities of their own which could
not have been taught in early boyhood but which might very easily
have been cramped and perhaps entirely obliterated much to their
detriment in the hands of even a skilful coach We do not deprecate
all advice even to very young boys but we dislike anything that tends
to interfere with the powers of nature and although we shall be told
that a good teacher merely directs them in the best possible way we do
not think that the advantage likely to be gained will at all compensate
for a cramped style or loss of enjoyment What should be taught and
when we will endeavour to suggest as we proceed

Illustration OUR NATIONAL GAME

First however one word to anxious parents and teachers of the art
It is quite hopeless to expect that every boy can be made into a
cricketer Countless are the excuses we hear to cover the feebleness
and incapacity of wouldbe players made sometimes by their parents
sometimes by themselves They have never been coached or they have
been badly coached they have been made to play too much or they
cant play often enough the ground they play on is so rough or it is
so easy that they cant play on more difficult ground They used to
bowl very well but they were overbowled or they were never put on
or they are always put on at the wrong end or the catches are always
missed off their bowling These and many other excuses are urged on
their behalf but those who have watched cricket for but a few years
will soon learn to take such futile pleas for what they are worth No
boy can become a good cricketer who has not a natural capacity for the
game The batsman must have a good eye and is all the better for a good
nerve the fieldsman must be active the bowlerah what must he have
Nascitur non fit we will not commit ourselves at present to his
requirements

In saying this do not let it be supposed that we wish those only to
play cricket who are likely to become good cricketersfar from it but
we are concerned with the game as an art and not as an exercise and do
not wish to raise vain hopes of success where success is impossible

Now let us consider the three great departments of the game in detail
for although they are necessarily and closely connected we cannot
treat of batting bowling and fielding in the same paragraph

The batsman then first demands our attention not because he is more
useful to his side than the bowler but because it is here that more
may be taught than in any other department of the game Take a boy ten
years oldwe start with double figures let it be an omen for his
futurewhat can we tell him Very little we think but certainly
this never to move his right foot but to plant it firmly just inside
the crease with the toe barely clear of the legstump

The left foot should also be placed in the same line but it must be
moved into the position which is found to be the easiest for playing or
hitting any given ball The batsman must learn to stand perfectly still
with his eye fixed on the bowlers hand and he must try to think of
the ball and the ball alone any fidgeting about is apt to interfere
with an accurate habit of sight A boy should also be told to drive the
ball in front of the wicket and along the ground We do not approve
of the cut for young boys it is the batsmans most finished stroke
but it is absolutely fatal when attempted at an unsuitable ball This
is all we think it necessary to teach our juvenile batsman though
occasional hints beyond this may sometimes be useful Do not however
cramp a boy who is disposed to hit but tell him to hit straight it is
easier at a later age to stop hitting than to teach it For this reason
singlewicket matches among small boys are not without their use as
they naturally encourage hard hitting in front of the wicket

A danger which is not sufficiently guarded against at some private
schools is the habit of allowing young boys to play to fast bowling
masters and others take part in the games and the practice and bowl at
a pace which would be called medium in a mans match but which is very
fast for boys under fourteen years of age The result of this is that
boys learn to be afraid of the ball and if they once show fear they
will never become good players It seems all but impossible to restore
confidence even at a much later age and we know of many instanceswe
will not be so unkind as to mention namesin which boys with great
natural powers have never overcome their fear of the ball which they
had acquired before coming to a public school For the same reason the
growing custom of small boys playing in mens matches is to be strongly
deprecated

Illustration LUCIEN DAVIS

Drawing away from the wicket

Boys matches we strongly approve of but boys of fourteen and under
ought not to play in matches with fullgrown men If a boy with a
natural gift for cricket has learnt by the time he enters a public
school to stand firmly and play the ball in front of the wicket he has
learnt all that is necessary to turn him out a good batsman later on
but if fast bowling has taught him to fear the ball we have but little
hope of ever seeing him attain to the first class

A few years have elapsed and our young batsman at the age of thirteen
or fourteen is passing into the larger sphere of a public school What
ought to be his training there

It cannot be expected that he will receive the same attention that will
be given at a later age when he is a candidate for his school eleven
nor do we think that he need be subjected to any rigorous system of
coaching On the other hand he ought to have some one of experience
to give him occasional hints and instil into him the true principles
of the game Above everything else he should have good ground to play
upon so that if his confidence has not been previously shaken he
will not now learn to shrink from the ball The question of ground must
always be a great difficulty for although it may be easy to get an
extent sufficient to satisfy the requirements of a large public school
it is no easy matter to keep it in proper order and provide good match
and practice wickets throughout the summer for a large number of boys
especially as the ground is generally required for football or other
purposes during the winter However the better the ground the better
the batsmen and if this be true a good ground is one of the most
important requirements in the training of our cricketers

As a boy grows in years he will require and will probably get
more instruction and if he meets with a coach of good judgment and
experience he will soon learn all that can be taught His success will
depend on his own natural powers his temper and his perseverance We
do not propose to deal in detail with all the duties of a coach but
perhaps a few hints may not be altogether out of place

First of all then we would say do not coach a boy too often Once a
week is all that is either necessary or desirable A boy who is anxious
to learn will lay to heart the hints and instructions he has received
and he will find it easier to carry them out when he is practising with
his schoolfellows than when he is actually receiving instruction from a
coach A new attitude or a new stroke always presents great difficulty
easy as it may seem in itself and a boy who is trying something new
will not at first play better and will become nervous and disheartened
if he is being too constantly pressed by an ardent teacher

Do not let a boy practise for more than half an hour at a time or he
will become careless and lose interest During that time he should play
to both fast and slow bowling but never to more than two bowlers and
it would be well if he could play for a quarter of an hour to two slow
bowlers and another quarter to two fast It is confusing to some boys
to receive fast and slow balls alternately particularly when they are
trying to alter or improve some point of style under the direction of a
coach

Do not allow boys to play to fast bowling on bad wickets slow bowling
on a bad wicket is a good lesson occasionally as it necessitates
careful watching of the ball and accurate timing but fast bowling
on bumpy ground can only do harm Never allow throwing instead of
bowlingit does infinite mischief

A coach will naturally have to give instruction on numerous points and
try to get his pupil to carry out what he teaches but there is one
warning which must be impressed on the lad more strongly than anything
else It is this when you go to the wicket in a match dont be
thinking of this or that position or this or that stroke but fix your
eye on the bowlers hand as he comes up to bowl Think of and watch
the ball only if you learn correct habits in practice your instinct
will throw you into the right position and enable you to make the right
stroke provided that your eye does not fail you with the ball

We do not purpose to describe how each stroke should be made or to
enumerate all the instructions that should be given to the youthful
batsman for such details would be long and wearisome and entirely
unnecessary for the guidance of anyone who understands the true
principles of the game and certainly no one ought to try and teach
until he has at all events theoretically mastered these though it
is by no means necessary for a good coach to be himself a firstrate
exponent of the batsmans art We would point out however that
apart from natural gifts over which the coach has no control the
most important point to teach the batsman is first to watch the
ball secondly to throw himself at the right moment into the right
positionif he can do this it is an easy matter to hit or play almost
any given ball thirdly to meet the ball either in playing back or
forward and not to play in front of the left foot when playing forward
or behind the right when playing back

And now what are we to say of the bowlers art How are we to teach
our boys the most unteachable department of the game This part of our
subject we approach with many misgivings and though we wish to limit
our advice to what is strictly practical we feel that this very limit
will make many think that our hints are but meagre and uninteresting

We must again put back the clock oh that some of us decrepit
cricketers could do so in reality to the age of ten Again we ask
for some natural power of propelling a ball with ease strength
proportioned to age perseverance and a real love of the game Given
these materials to work upon how are we to begin First of all let
the distance be short certainly not more than eighteen yards at the
age of ten let the ball be smaller and lighter than the regulation
size and let a boy be taught at first to aim only at one length as he
becomes fairly master of straightness and pitch let him try to vary
the length a little but not too often or he may sacrifice regularity
and injure his delivery Change of pace can hardly be looked for at
this age but great care should be taken to prevent a boy from bowling
fast and he should not bowl for long together In practice it is a
good plan to take alternate overs with another boy as it is easier
to bowl four or five balls well and then rest than to go on bowling a
greater number A boy should be taught to measure the distance he runs
before delivering the ball and he should learn to bowl on both sides
of the wicket Great care should be taken to prevent a boy from bowling
too much and if his bowling seems to be getting worse rather than
better let him leave off for some days We offer no advice on the more
abstruse arts of bowling as the subject has been exhaustively treated
in a previous chapter

Supposing that our boy bowler has by the age of fourteen acquired
straightness and pitch with some power of variation will he have a
fair chance of improving his bowling and distinguishing himself when
at a public school We fear that this will be a trying timeindeed
must be so even if he is taken in hand by some one who understands
and takes an interest in the game In the first place batting is more
attractive to most boys in the second the young bowler will probably
have a very indifferent field and the missing of catches tempts
the youthful player to abandon the slower pace for the faster with
disastrous results to himself Almost all young boys wish to bowl as
fast as they can and this ends frequently in ruining a good action and
a good arm which had at one time threatened the fall of many a good
wicket

At this point then in a bowlers career public schools we think
have something to answer for but we do not agree with those who say
that subsequently when a boy is old enough to be a candidate for his
school eleven there is any great lack of system or careful training
Rather if a short digression may be pardoned we think that the
Universities or the laziness of University men may chiefly be blamed
for the dearth of gentlemen bowlers Our argument shortly stated is
this If we compare gentlemen bowlers of the age of nineteen with
professionals of the same age we shall find that the former have
nothing to fear from the comparison But pass on for five or six years
and the gentlemen are seen to be behind in the race for preeminence
Can this be the fault of public schools Is it not rather that after
leaving school few scarcely any systematically practise bowling
although they are just at the right age to improve having stronger
muscles and more experience to say nothing of leisure hours and
increased opportunities If University men would practise their bowling
both at nets and in matches with the same assiduity that boys do at
a public school we think that it would approach more nearly to the
professional standard than it now does

We do not propose to offer our readers any special advice as to the
method of attack which will naturally vary with different batsmen
Experience and observation will suggest what may be done if we can
only teach our young bowler to bowl straight to vary his length and
as he gets older his pace and if nature has given him strength and a
happy genius enables him to make the ball turn more or less at will
Let us leave the bowler himself and see if we can offer any hints on
providing him with a good field

It is a common fallacy to suppose that anyone can field well if he
takes the trouble to do so With this we cannot agree but we feel
strongly that most cricketers might improve themselves very much in
this department if they took the same pains they do to improve their
batting

But we must return to our small boys First of all let us teach them
to catch by throwing the ball from one to another and let the ball be
small proportioned to the size of their hands Teach them to take the
catch opposite the upper part of the chest when they can get to it
in that position and to draw their hands back as the ball comes into
them Do not keep them too long at this or they will find it irksome
Vary with a little ground fielding but do not let them throw too
often or too far or their arms will soon go and you will ruin your
bowlers and your throwers as well It is not however at this early
age that the most special attention ought to be given to fielding It
is rather at our public schools that we here look for improvement this
is the time at which we think most may be done As a boy gains strength
and activity he gains two of the qualities most necessary for a good
fieldsman and if nature has given him a good big pair of hands and
the power of throwing it will be owing to his laziness if he does not
become a valuable aid to any bowler We might dwell on the necessity
of keenness watchfulness in the field position for starting and
many other essentials but we have said enough for practical purposes
all else will be easily learnt by a boy who has the energy and
determination to train himself into a good field

It will be noticed that in our suggestions to the batsman we have not
advised him to make that use of his legs in defending his wicket which
now finds such favour with our leading players We confess to regarding
this as an ignoble art but we admit that if the lbw rule is to
continue as at present the art ignoble as it is must be taught in
selfdefence or our pupils will necessarily be handicapped in being
expected to stop balls which break and turn with their bat instead of
with their legs Fortunately age will relieve us personally of teaching
how this may best be done It is for the rising generation either to
alter the law or to learn the art of getting in front of the wicket
when the ball does not pitch straight

It is in vain to lament over long scores and unfinished matches
over dearth of bowlers and slackness in the field whilst all the
time we are doing everything we can to make matters easier and easier
for the batsman giving him perfect wickets on which he can score
 runs without getting out of breath devoting his legs to the new
purpose of systematically intercepting the more difficult balls How
different this from having honestly to run out every hit and from
being compelled to play a real snorter before the breath is fairly
recovered after the effort of running several fourers in succession




CHAPTER XIV

SINGLE WICKET

BY THE HON R H LYTTELTON


It is necessary in any work which professes to treat of cricket
generally that the laws and regulations of single wicket should be
discussed though the subject is not of much importance in these days
for as far as firstclass cricket is concerned the game played with
only one wicket has vanished altogether Some few years ago if an
ordinary threeday match were over early a scratch singlewicket match
was sometimes improvised but the effect was generally depressing

Few people now take the trouble to read through the rules which govern
singlewicket matches and the almost total disappearance of such games
may be mainly attributed to two circumstances  The great increase
in the number of threeday matches  the diminution in the number of
fast bowlers

In the days of Alfred Mynn and Fuller Pilch matches practically never
took more than two days and firstclass contests were in number about
onehalf what they are at present A professional of the front rank
such as Lohmann or Barnes now has to play two matches a week and if
a match is over on the second day he is only too glad to have a rest
before beginning again elsewhere it may be more than a hundred miles
away The public also have the opportunity of seeing such a quantity of
firstclass play that there is no demand for singlewicket matches

In the second place the rules of singlewicket cricket make it
essential that driving in front of the wicket must be the staple stroke
of the batsman and for this reason because the second rule provides
that to entitle the striker to a run the ball must be hit before the
bounds Now the bounds are placed twentytwo yards each in a line from
the off and leg stump and there must be bounds unless there are more
than four players on each side The third rule compels the striker
at the moment of hitting the ball to have one of his feet behind the
popping crease and on the ground These two laws contain the essence
of the game of cricket as played with a single wicket It is not sound
cricket to play any bowling that may be called slow in the widest sense
of the term with your right foot absolutely fixed In the chapter on
Batting the young player is advised to go out of his ground to slow
bowling of a certain length and drive But at single wicket the batsman
may not move even an inch in front of the popping crease to get a lob
for instance on the full pitch So the effect of bowling slows in a
singlewicket match is that a batsman must abandon what may be called
the orthodox and correct method of play and merely wait till he gets
a ball far enough up for him to drive it without getting out of his
ground

No correct player can ever drive slows unless they are right up
without going out of his ground and a great many would be so cramped
that they would be at a disadvantage altogether and obliged to play an
ugly pokey game If a slow bowler with perhaps two or three fields were
bowling to Mr Webbe who plays slows as well as anybody in England
that gentleman would find himself obliged to abandon his natural game
stand still watch the ball carefully and play it gently till he got
a real halfvolley or outrageous longhop off which he could score
But if certain skilful bowlers were on the batsman would very likely
have to wait the best part of an hour before such a ball came and it
would be sadly dull to watch such a game

If five play on a side bounds are abolished the slow bowling may get
hit behind the wicket and so the game becomes considerably livelier
The run consists of touching the bowlers stump with the bat and
getting back to the popping crease Thus one run at single wicket is
exactly equivalent to two at double wicket To get three runs in one
hit if there are two fields is almost an impossibility though it has
been done There is no wicketkeeper and nothing can be scored by
byes legbyes or overthrows To run a man out it is necessary that
the bowler run to the wicket and put it down unless of course it is
thrown down The fieldsman must return the ball so that it shall cross
the ground between the wicket and the bowling stump or between the
bowling stump and the bounds and three are scored for a lost ball

In very ancient times five players a side used often to contend at
single wicket and in this sort of match there are no bounds though
the batsman must have his right or left foot on the ground behind the
popping crease when the ball is hit

Singlewicket matches were once very common Indeed during the last
century they were played nearly as often as doublewicket games and we
will briefly notice some of the most famous

In the year  five of Kent with Minshull beat five of the famous
Hambledon Club by one wicket but in  the same five men of
Hambledon vanquished five men of England Happy village of Hambledon
that could thus defeat All England a deed that at double wicket no
county could accomplish now With the redoubtable Lumpy given the
same village in  beat England by  runs five players on a side
In the following year six of Hambledon beat six of Kent and the Duke
of Dorset Privy Councillor Knight of the Garter and Lord Steward of
the Kings Household played for the village against his own county
for what reason history telleth not John Nyren says that this nobleman
had the peculiar habit when unemployed of standing with his head on
one side He is also celebrated in verse

    Equalled by few he plays with glee
    Nor peevish seeks for victory
    His Grace for bowling cannot yield
    To none but Lumpy in the field
    And far unlike the modern way
    Of blocking every ball at play
    He firmly stands with bat upright
    And strikes with his athletic might
    Sends forth the ball across the mead
    And scores six notches for the deed

The Duke must have been the first who conceived the idea of
international cricket for while ambassador in France he wrote to
Golden of Chertsey to form an eleven to play at Paris Unfortunately
when they had got as far as Dover they met his Grace who had to flee
the faithless Frenchmen in consequence of a revolution and the match
was abandoned

Six of Hambledon again beat six of England in  but six of Kent
defeated the village in  This was a famous match though seeing
T Walker batting for nearly five hours for  runs must have been a
trifle monotonous A Kent player named Ring went in when  runs were
wanted to win and two more wickets to go down He made  overnight
and Sir Horace Mann promised him a pension if he carried out his bat
and we presume won the match He failed to do so but got out when 
runs were wanted Aylward then went in and played  balls before he
made the winning hit We hope Sir Horace Mann gave the pension to Ring
for he must have deserved it

Six of Hampshire twice beat England in  and in  a drawn match
was played between six of Kent and six of Hants In this match betting
at the start was  to  on Hants but David Harris was seized with
the gout and the betting therefore stood at  to  on Kent David
Harris used sometimes to walk to the ground on crutches but bowled
splendidly we are told when he got warm

In  three of SurreyWilliam Lambert Robinson and William
Beldhambeat three of EnglandBennett Fennex and Lord F
Beauclerkby  runs This was the famous match when Beldham father
of thirtynine childrennone so far as we know cricketerstook
a lump of wet dirt and sawdust and stuck it on to the ball which
developed an extraordinary twist and bowled Lord Frederick out His
lordship was of an irritable disposition and must have been very angry
at this for he had made  runs and was well set

In  Osbaldeston Budd and Lord F Beauclerk beat three of
EnglandSherman T C Howard and Lambert The famous Squire
Osbaldeston clean bowled all his rivals in each innings for  runs
only The Squire whose reputation as an allround sportsman still
survives was the fastest bowler of his day In  so great was his
fame and that of Lambert that they challenged Budd Humewood T C
Howard and George Brown but the four won in one innings which so
provoked the Squire that he withdrew from the MCCanother irritable
man

The celebrated William Lambert alone beat two accomplished cricketers
Lord F Beauclerk and Howard by  runs The Squire was too ill to
play so Lambert played them both and drew the stakes l Up to
 wides counted for nothing and Lambert bowled wides on purpose to
Lord F Beauclerk to put him out of temper They were a choleric race
in those days The fame of Lambert is tarnished for selling a match at
Nottingham and he was warned off the ground at Lords for ever

Mr Budd in  played a fast bowler called Brand the match ending
most disastrously for the latter Mr Budd went in first got  runs
knocked his wicket down on purpose and bowled his opponent out for 
Budd then got  again knocked his wicket down and again bowled his
rival out for nothing Mr Brand ended his days in a lunatic asylum we
hope the malady was not brought on by this match which was got up by
Mr Ward who backed Mr Brand

The two brothers Broadbridge one of whom was called our Jem beat
George Brown and Tom Marsden of Sheffield in  but were beaten
in the return match In  Alfred Mynn played his first important
singlewicket match against Thomas Hills Mynn winning with his wicket
standing Hills said that Mynn bowled at least  wides which seems
to prove that the chief bowlers of that day must have been slightly
deficient in accuracy Why in this match the wides were not reckoned is
not clear the rule scoring against the bowler having been put in force
some few years before A return match was played and Mynn again won
this time in one innings and Hills retired satisfied we suppose
that in Mynn he had found his master

In  Mynn and Pilch were perhaps the two greatest allround players
and Marsden of Sheffield in this year challenged the immortal Pilch
who won in one innings and  runs Pilch was not a great bowler
neither was he fast but Marsdens style was fast underhand and
Pilchs bat was too straight for such bowling In the return Pilch got
 runs in the first innings and  in the second and won the match
by  runs The supremacy of Pilch over Marsden was fully asserted by
these two matches and Marsden must have returned to Sheffield somewhat
crestfallen

    Next Marsden may come though it here must be stated
    That his skill down at Sheffield is oft overrated

But the Yorkshiremen we know are always proud of their countrymen
Pilch was a great batsman and we do not feel surprised that he scored
so largely against fast underhand bowling

The ground ought to have been now cleared for a match between Mynn and
Pilch and great would have been the interest if such a game had been
playedVoltigeur and The Flying Dutchman would have been nothing to
it The two men belonged to the same county so probably there was
wanting a sufficient motive but together they would probably have
beaten any three other cricketers

Mr Mynn next heavily defeated James Dearman of Sheffield twice in
the first match by  runs and again in one innings and  runs Mynn
scored  in the last innings off  hits which sounds strange but
then as is recorded navely in the Scores and Biographies Mynn was
always a great punisher

Mr Felix next challenged Mr Mynn and he must have been of a sanguine
temperament to have done so for though perhaps a better bat than
Mynn he was a lefthanded lob bowler a delivery not suited for
singlewicket matches The first game Mynn won in one innings and 
run only  runs being made in the whole match In Felixs second
innings Mynn bowled  balls for  runs Singlewicket matches had
already begun to get out of favour this was the most important that
had taken place for some time and Squire Osbaldeston was a spectator
In the return Mynn won by one wicket and this was a small scoring
match Mynn now was left unchallenged having won all the singlewicket
matches in which he was engaged alone In  Wisden beat Sherman
twice Thomas Hunt of Chesterfield was a great singlewicket
matchplayer and beat Chatterton Dakin Charley Brown and R C
Tinley

Singlewicket playing has been practically dead since  though
Hayward Carpenter and Tarrant played two matches about the year 
The subject possesses only an historical interest now but in old times
it created enormous excitement and no doubt the pride of the men of
Kent in Alfred Mynn was largely owing to his singlewicket prowess If
such matches were played on the smooth wickets of modern times the
fortunate man who won the toss might never be got out all day and the
game would become a burlesque on cricket Eleven fieldsmen and not one
bowler merely are now required to get out Mr Grace and Shrewsbury
and but few wickets are bowled down as compared with the days of fast
bowling and rough grounds When the All England elevens used to tour
about the country under the management first of William Clarke and then
of George Parr some of the best bowlers in England were to be found
in their ranks Jackson Willsher Furley Tarrant and others used
often to play and occasionally when the regular match was over one of
them would earn a cheap sort of notoriety by challenging eleven of the
natives at single wicket Eleven straight balls were sometimes found
sufficient to get the eleven out and one run by the England player
gave him the victory Such matches are absurd and it is not a matter
of regret that they are played no longer

However it seems right that a notice of the famous contests of old
should have been written on account of the interest they formerly
excited and on village greens where eccentricities of ground are to
be met with they may still perhaps be played But they are a relic of
the past
