TATYANA BORISSOVNA AND HER NEPHEW

Give me your hand gentle reader and come along with me It is glorious
weather there is a tender blue in the May sky the smooth young leaves
of the willows glisten as though they had been polished the wide even
road is all covered with that delicate grass with the little reddish
stalk that the sheep are so fond of nibbling to right and to left over
the long sloping hillsides the green rye is softly waving the shadows
of small clouds glide in thin long streaks over it In the distance is
the dark mass of forests the glitter of ponds yellow patches of
village larks in hundreds are soaring singing falling headlong with
outstretched necks hopping about the clods the crows on the highroad
stand still look at you peck at the earth let you drive close up and
with two hops lazily move aside On a hill beyond a ravine a peasant is
ploughing a piebald colt with a cropped tail and ruffled mane is
running on unsteady legs after its mother its shrill whinnying reaches
us We drive on into the birch wood and drink in the strong sweet
fresh fragrance Here we are at the boundaries The coachman gets down
the horses snort the tracehorses look round the centre horse in the
shafts switches his tail and turns his head up towards the wooden yoke
above it the great gate opens creaking the coachman seats
himself Drive on the village is before us Passing five homesteads
and turning off to the right we drop down into a hollow and drive along
a dyke the farther side of a small pond behind the round tops of the
lilacs and appletrees a wooden roof once red with two chimneys comes
into sight the coachman keeps along the hedge to the left and to the
spasmodic and drowsy baying of three pug dogs he drives through the wide
open gates whisks smartly round the broad courtyard past the stable and
the barn gallantly salutes the old housekeeper who is stepping
sideways over the high lintel in the open doorway of the storehouse and
pulls up at last before the steps of a dark house with light windows
We are at Tatyana Borissovnas And here she is herself opening the
window and nodding at us Good day maam

Tatyana Borissovna is a woman of fifty with large prominent grey eyes
a rather broad nose rosy cheeks and a double chin Her face is brimming
over with friendliness and kindness She was once married but was soon
left a widow Tatyana Borissovna is a very remarkable woman She lives
on her little property never leaving it mixes very little with her
neighbours sees and likes none but young people She was the daughter
of very poor landowners and received no education in other words she
does not know French she has never been in Moscowand in spite of all
these defects she is so good and simple in her manners so broad in her
sympathies and ideas so little infected with the ordinary prejudices of
country ladies of small means that one positively cannot help
marvelling at her Indeed a woman who lives all the year round in
the country and does not talk scandal nor whine nor curtsey is never
flurried nor depressed nor in a flutter of curiosity is a real
marvel She usually wears a grey taffetas gown and a white cap with
lilac streamers she is fond of good cheer but not to excess all the
preserving pickling and salting she leaves to her housekeeper What
does she do all day long you will ask Does she read No she
doesnt read and to tell the truth books are not written for her
If there are no visitors with her Tatyana Borissovna sits by herself at
the window knitting a stocking in winter in summer time she is in the
garden planting and watering her flowers playing for hours together
with her cats or feeding her doves She does not take much part in
the management of her estate But if a visitor pays her a callsome
young neighbour whom she likesTatyana Borissovna is all life directly
she makes him sit down pours him out some tea listens to his chat
laughs sometimes pats his cheek but says little herself in trouble or
sorrow she comforts and gives good advice How many people have confided
their family secrets and the griefs of their hearts to her and have
wept over her hands At times she sits opposite her visitor leaning
lightly on her elbow and looks with such sympathy into his face smiles
so affectionately that he cannot help feeling What a dear good woman
you are Tatyana Borissovna Let me tell you what is in my heart One
feels happy and warm in her small snug rooms in her house it is
always so to speak fine weather Tatyana Borissovna is a wonderful
woman but no one wonders at her her sound good sense her breadth and
firmness her warm sympathy in the joys and sorrows of othersin a
word all her qualities are so innate in her they are no trouble no
effort to her One cannot fancy her otherwise and so one feels no
need to thank her She is particularly fond of watching the pranks and
follies of young people she folds her hands over her bosom throws back
her head puckers up her eyes and sits smiling at them then all of a
sudden she heaves a sigh and says Ah my children my children
Sometimes one longs to go up to her take hold of her hands and say
Let me tell you Tatyana Borissovna you dont know your own value for
all your simplicity and lack of learning youre an extraordinary
creature Her very name has a sweet familiar ring one is glad to utter
it it calls up a kindly smile at once How often for instance have I
chanced to ask a peasant Tell me my friend how am I to get to
Gratchevka let us say Well sir you go on first to Vyazovoe and
from there to Tatyana Borissovnas and from Tatyana Borissovnas any
one will show you the way And at the name of Tatyana Borissovna the
peasant wags his head in quite a special way Her household is small in
accordance with her means The house the laundry the stores and the
kitchen are in the charge of the housekeeper Agafya once her nurse a
goodnatured tearful toothless creature she has under her two
stalwart girls with stout crimson cheeks like Antonovsky apples The
duties of valet steward and waiter are filled by Policarp an
extraordinary old man of seventy a queer fellow full of erudition
once a violinist and worshipper of Viotti with a personal hostility to
Napoleon or as he calls him Bonaparty and a passion for
nightingales He always keeps five or six of the latter in his room in
early spring he will sit for whole days together by the cage waiting
for the first trill and when he hears it he covers his face with his
hands and moans Oh piteous piteous and sheds tears in floods
Policarp has to help him his grandson Vasya a curlyheaded
sharpeyed boy of twelve Policarp adores him and grumbles at him from
morning till night He undertakes his education too Vasya he says
say Bonaparty was a scoundrel And whatll you give me granddad
Whatll I give you Ill give you nothing Why what are you
Arent you a Russian Im a Mtchanin granddad I was born in
Mtchensk Oh silly dunce but where is Mtchensk How can I tell
Mtchensks in Russia silly Well what then if it is in Russia
What then Why his Highness the late Prince Mihalo Ilarionovitch
GolenishtchevKutuzovSmolensky with Gods aid graciously drove
Bonaparty out of the Russian territories Its on that event the song
was composed Bonapartys in no mood to dance Hes lost the garters he
brought from France Do you understand he liberated your
fatherland And whats that to do with me Ah you silly boy Why
if his Highness Prince Mihalo Ilarionovitch hadnt driven out Bonaparty
some mounseer would have been beating you about the head with a stick
this minute Hed come up to you like this and say Koman voo porty
voo and then a box on the ear But Id give him one in the belly
with my fist But hed go on Bonzhur bonzhur veny ici and then a
cuff on the head And Id give him one in his legs his bandy legs
Youre quite right their legs are bandy Well but suppose he tied
your hands I wouldnt let him Id call Mihay the coachman to help
me But Vasya suppose you werent a match for the Frenchy even with
Mihay Not a match for him See how strong Mihay is Well and what
would you do with him Wed get him on his back we would And hed
shout Pardon pardon seevooplay Wed tell him None of your
seevooplays you old Frenchy Bravo Vasya Well now then shout
Bonapartys a scoundrel But you must give me some sugar You
scamp

Of the neighbouring ladies Tatyana Borissovna sees very little they do
not care about going to see her and she does not know how to amuse
them the sound of their chatter sends her to sleep she starts tries
to keep her eyes open and drops off again Tatyana Borissovna is not
fond of women as a rule One of her friends a good harmless young man
had a sister an old maid of thirtyeight and a half a goodnatured
creature but exaggerated affected and enthusiastic Her brother had
often talked to her of their neighbour One fine morning our old maid
has her horse saddled and without a word to any one sallies off to
Tatyana Borissovnas In her long habit a hat on her head a green veil
and floating curls she went into the hall and passing by the
panicstricken Vasya who took her for a woodwitch ran into the
drawingroom Tatyana Borissovna scared tried to rise but her legs
sank under her Tatyana Borissovna began the visitor in a
supplicating voice forgive my temerity I am the sister of your
friend Alexy Nikolaevitch K and I have heard so much about you
from him that I resolved to make your acquaintance Greatly honoured
muttered the bewildered lady The sister flung off her hat shook her
curls seated herself near Tatyana Borissovna took her by the hand
So this is she she began in a pensive voice fraught with feeling
this is that sweet clear noble holy being This is she that woman
at once so simple and so deep How glad I am how glad I am How we
shall love each other I can breathe easily at last I always fancied
her just so she added in a whisper her eyes riveted on the eyes of
Tatyana Borissovna You wont be angry with me will you my dear kind
friend Really Im delighted Wont you have some tea The lady
smiled patronisingly Wie wahr wie unreflectiert she murmured
as it were to herself Let me embrace you my dear one

The old maid stayed three hours at Tatyana Borissovnas never ceasing
talking an instant She tried to explain to her new acquaintance all her
own significance Directly after the unexpected visitor had departed
the poor lady took a bath drank some limeflower water and took to her
bed But the next day the old maid came back stayed four hours and
left promising to come to see Tatyana Borissovna every day Her idea
please to observe was to develop to complete the education of so rich
a nature to use her own expression and she would probably have really
been the death of her if she had not in the first place been utterly
disillusioned as regards her brothers friend within a fortnight and
secondly fallen in love with a young student on a visit in the
neighbourhood with whom she at once rushed into a fervid and active
correspondence in her missives she consecrated him as the manner of
such is to a noble holy life offered herself wholly a sacrifice
asked only for the name of sister launched into endless descriptions of
nature made allusions to Goethe Schiller Bettina and German
philosophy and drove the luckless young man at last to the blackest
desperation But youth asserted itself one fine morning he woke up with
such a furious hatred for his sister and best of friends that he
almost killed his valet in his passion and was snappish for a long
while after at the slightest allusion to elevated and disinterested
passion But from that time forth Tatyana Borissovna began to avoid all
intimacy with ladies of the neighbourhood more than ever

Alas nothing is lasting on this earth All I have related as to the way
of life of my kindhearted neighbour is a thing of the past the peace
that used to reign in her house has been destroyed for ever For more
than a year now there has been living with her a nephew an artist from
Petersburg This is how it came about

Eight years ago there was living with Tatyana Borissovna a boy of
twelve an orphan the son of her brother Andryusha Andryusha had
large clear humid eyes a tiny little mouth a regular nose and a
fine lofty brow He spoke in a low sweet voice was attentive and
coaxing with visitors kissed his aunties hand with an orphans
sensibility and one hardly had time to show oneself before he had put a
chair for one He had no mischievous tricks he was never noisy he
would sit by himself in a corner with a book and with such sedateness
and propriety never even leaning back in his chair When a visitor came
in Andryusha would get up with a decorous smile and a flush when the
visitor went away he would sit down again pull out of his pocket a
brush and a lookingglass and brush his hair From his earliest years
he had shown a taste for drawing Whenever he got hold of a piece of
paper he would ask Agafya the housekeeper for a pair of scissors at
once carefully cut a square piece out of the paper trace a border
round it and set to work he would draw an eye with an immense pupil or
a Grecian nose or a house with a chimney and smoke coming out of it in
the shape of a corkscrew a dog en face looking rather like a
bench or a tree with two pigeons on it and would sign it Drawn by
Andrei Byelovzorov such a day in such a year in the village of
MaliyaBriki He used to toil with special industry for a fortnight
before Tatyana Borissovnas birthday he was the first to present his
congratulations and offer her a roll of paper tied up with a pink
ribbon Tatyana Borissovna would kiss her nephew and undo the knot the
roll was unfolded and presented to the inquisitive gaze of the
spectator a round boldly sketched temple in sepia with columns and an
altar in the centre on the altar lay a burning heart and a wreath
while above on a curling scroll was inscribed in legible characters
To my aunt and benefactress Tatyana Borissovna Bogdanov from her
dutiful and loving nephew as a token of his deepest affection Tatyana
Borissovna would kiss him again and give him a silver rouble She did
not though feel any very warm affection for him Andryushas fawning
ways were not quite to her taste Meanwhile Andryusha was growing up
Tatyana Borissovna began to be anxious about his future An unexpected
incident solved the difficulty to her

One day eight years ago she received a visit from a certain Mr
Benevolensky Piotr Mihalitch a college councillor with a decoration
Mr Benevolensky had at one time held an official post in the nearest
district town and had been assiduous in his visits to Tatyana
Borissovna then he had moved to Petersburg got into the ministry and
attained a rather important position and on one of the numerous
journeys he took in the discharge of his official duties he remembered
his old friend and came back to see her with the intention of taking a
rest for two days from his official labours in the bosom of the peace
of nature Tatyana Borissovna greeted him with her usual cordiality
and Mr Benevolensky But before we proceed with the rest of the
story gentle reader let us introduce you to this new personage

Mr Benevolensky was a stoutish man of middle height and mild
appearance with little short legs and little fat hands he wore a roomy
and excessively spruce frockcoat a high broad cravat snowwhite
linen a gold chain on his silk waistcoat a gemring on his forefinger
and a white wig on his head he spoke softly and persuasively trod
noiselessly and had an amiable smile an amiable look in his eyes and
an amiable way of settling his chin in his cravat he was in fact an
amiable person altogether God had given him a heart too of the
softest he was easily moved to tears and to transports moreover he
was all aglow with disinterested passion for art disinterested it
certainly was for Mr Benevolensky if the truth must be told knew
absolutely nothing about art One is set wondering indeed whence by
virtue of what mysterious uncomprehended forces this passion had come
upon him He was to all appearance a practical even prosaic person
however we have a good many people of the same sort among us in
Russia

Their devotion to art and artists produces in these people an
inexpressible mawkishness it is distressing to have to do with them and
to talk to them they are perfect logs smeared with honey They never
for instance call Raphael Raphael or Correggio Correggio the
divine Sanzio the incomparable di Allegri they murmur and always
with the broadest vowels Every pretentious conceited homebred
mediocrity they hail as a genius the blue sky of Italy the lemons
of the South the balmy breezes of the banks of the Brenta are for
ever on their lips Ah Vasya Vasya or Oh Sasha Sasha they say
to one another with deep feeling we must away to the South we are
Greeks in soulancient Greeks One may observe them at exhibitions
before the works of some Russian painters these gentlemen it should be
noted are for the most part passionate patriots First they step
back a couple of paces and throw back their heads then they go up to
the picture again their eyes are suffused with an oily moisture
There you have it my God they say at last in voices broken with
emotion theres soul soul Ah what feeling what feeling Ah what
soul he has put into it what a mass of soul And how he has thought
it out thought it out like a master And oh the pictures in their
own drawingrooms Oh the artists that come to them in the evenings
drink tea and listen to their conversation And the views in
perspective they make them of their own rooms with a broom in the
foreground a little heap of dust on the polished floor a yellow
samovar on a table near the window and the master of the house himself
in skullcap and dressinggown with a brilliant streak of sunlight
falling on his cheek Oh the longhaired nurslings of the Muse wearing
spasmodic and contemptuous smiles that cluster about them Oh the
young ladies with faces of greenish pallor who squeal over their
pianos For that is the established rule with us in Russia a man cannot
be devoted to one art alonehe must have them all And so it is not to
be wondered at that these gentlemen extend their powerful patronage to
Russian literature also especially to dramatic literature The
Jacob Sannazars are written for them the struggle of unappreciated
talent against the whole world depicted a thousand times over still
moves them profoundly

The day after Mr Benevolenskys arrival Tatyana Borissovna told her
nephew at teatime to show their guest his drawings Why does he
draw said Mr Benevolensky with some surprise and he turned with
interest to Andryusha Yes he draws said Tatyana Borissovna hes
so fond of it and he does it all alone without a master Ah show
me show me cried Mr Benevolensky Andryusha blushing and smiling
brought the visitor his sketchbook Mr Benevolensky began turning it
over with the air of a connoisseur Good young man he pronounced at
last good very good And he patted Andryusha on the head Andryusha
intercepted his hand and kissed it Fancy now a talent like that
I congratulate you Tatyana Borissovna But what am I to do Piotr
Mihalitch I cant get him a teacher here To have one from the town is
a great expense our neighbours the Artamonovs have a drawingmaster
and they say an excellent one but his mistress forbids his giving
lessons to outsiders Hm pronounced Mr Benevolensky he pondered
and looked askance at Andryusha Well we will talk it over he added
suddenly rubbing his hands The same day he begged Tatyana Borissovnas
permission for an interview with her alone They shut themselves up
together In halfanhour they called AndryushaAndryusha went in Mr
Benevolensky was standing at the window with a slight flush on his face
and a beaming expression Tatyana Borissovna was sitting in a corner
wiping her eyes Come Andryusha she said at last you must thank
Piotr Mihalitch he will take you under his protection he will take you
to Petersburg Andryusha almost fainted on the spot Tell me
candidly began Mr Benevolensky in a voice filled with dignity and
patronising indulgence do you want to be an artist young man Do you
feel yourself consecrated to the holy service of Art I want to be an
artist Piotr Mihalitch Andryusha declared in a trembling voice I am
delighted if so it be It will of course continued Mr
Benevolenskybe hard for you to part from your revered aunt you must
feel the liveliest gratitude to her I adore my auntie Andryusha
interrupted blinking Of course of course thats readily understood
and does you great credit but on the other hand consider the pleasure
that in the future your success Kiss me Andryusha muttered
the kindhearted lady Andryusha flung himself on her neck There now
thank your benefactor Andryusha embraced Mr Benevolenskys stomach
and stretching on tiptoe reached his hand and imprinted a kiss which
his benefactor though with some show of reluctance accepted He
had to be sure to pacify the child and after all might reflect that
he deserved it Two days later Mr Benevolensky departed taking with
him his new protg

During the first three years of Andryushas absence he wrote pretty
often sometimes enclosing drawings in his letters From time to time
Mr Benevolensky added a few words for the most part of approbation
then the letters began to be less and less frequent and at last ceased
altogether A whole year passed without a word from her nephew and
Tatyana Borissovna was beginning to be uneasy when suddenly she got the
following note

DEAREST AUNTIEPiotr Mihalitch my patron died three days ago A
severe paralytic stroke has deprived me of my sole support To be sure
I am now twenty I have made considerable progress during the last seven
years I have the greatest confidence in my talent and can make my
living by means of it I do not despair but all the same send me
if you can as soon as convenient  roubles I kiss your hand and
remain etc

Tatyana Borissovna sent her nephew  roubles Two months later he
asked for more she got together every penny she had and sent it him
Not six weeks after the second donation he was asking a third time for
help ostensibly to buy colours for a portrait bespoken by Princess
Tertereshenev Tatyana Borissovna refused Under these circumstances
he wrote to her I propose coming to you to regain my health in the
country And in the May of the same year Andryusha did in fact return
to MaliyaBriki

Tatyana Borissovna did not recognise him for the first minute From his
letter she had expected to see a wasted invalid and she beheld a stout
broadshouldered fellow with a big red face and greasy curly hair The
pale slender little Andryusha had turned into the stalwart Andrei
Ivanovitch Byelovzorov And it was not only his exterior that was
transformed The modest spruceness the sedateness and tidiness of his
earlier years was replaced by a careless swagger and slovenliness quite
insufferable he rolled from side to side as he walked lolled in
easychairs put his elbows on the table stretched and yawned and
behaved rudely to his aunt and the servants Im an artist he would
say a free Cossack Thats our sort Sometimes he did not touch a
brush for whole days together then the inspiration as he called it
would come upon him then he would swagger about as if he were drunk
clumsy awkward and noisy his cheeks were flushed with a coarse
colour his eyes dull he would launch into discourses upon his talent
his success his development the advance he was making It turned
out in actual fact that he had barely talent enough to produce passable
portraits He was a perfect ignoramus had read nothing why should an
artist read indeed Nature freedom poetry were his fitting elements
he need do nothing but shake his curls talk and suck away at his
eternal cigarette Russian audacity is a fine thing but it doesnt suit
every one and Polezhaevs at secondhand without the genius are
insufferable beings Andrei Ivanovitch went on living at his aunts he
did not seem to find the bread of charity bitter notwithstanding the
proverb Visitors to the house found him a mortal nuisance He would sit
at the piano a piano too had been installed at Tatyana Borissovnas
and begin strumming The Swift Sledge with one finger he would strike
some chords tap on the keys and for hours together he would howl
Varlamovs songs The Solitary Pine or No doctor no dont come to
me in the most distressing manner and his eyes seemed to disappear
altogether his cheeks were so puffed out and tense as drums Then he
would suddenly strike up Be still distracting passions tempest
Tatyana Borissovna positively shuddered

Its a strange thing she observed to me one day the songs they
compose nowadays theres something desperate about them in my day they
were very different We had mournful songs too but it was always a
pleasure to hear them For instance

  Come come to me in the meadow
     Where I am awaiting thee
   Come come to me in the meadow
     Where Im shedding tears for thee
   Alas thourt coming to the meadow
     But too late dear love for me


Tatyana Borissovna smiled slyly

I agonise I agonise yelled her nephew in the next room

Be quiet Andryusha

My souls consumed apart from thee the indefatigable singer
continued

Tatyana Borissovna shook her head

Ah these artists these artists

A year has gone by since then Byelovzorov is still living at his
aunts and still talking of going back to Petersburg He has grown as
broad as he is long in the country His auntwho could have imagined
such a thingidolises him and the young girls of the neighbourhood
are falling in love with him

Many of her old friends have given up going to Tatyana Borissovnas

DEATH

I have a neighbour a young landowner and a young sportsman One fine
July morning I rode over to him with a proposition that we should go out
grouseshooting together He agreed Only lets go he said to my
underwoods at Zusha I can seize the opportunity to have a look at
Tchapligino you know my oakwood theyre felling timber there By all
means He ordered his horse to be saddled put on a green coat with
bronze buttons stamped with a boars head a gamebag embroidered in
crewels and a silver flask slung a newfangled French gun over his
shoulder turned himself about with some satisfaction before the
lookingglass and called his dog Hope a gift from his cousin an old
maid with an excellent heart but no hair on her head We started My
neighbour took with him the village constable Arhip a stout squat
peasant with a square face and jaws of antediluvian proportions and an
overseer he had recently hired from the Baltic provinces a youth of
nineteen thin flaxenhaired and shortsighted with sloping shoulders
and a long neck Herr Gottlieb von der Kock My neighbour had himself
only recently come into the property It had come to him by inheritance
from an aunt the widow of a councillor of state Madame KardonKataev
an excessively stout woman who did nothing but lie in her bed sighing
and groaning We reached the underwoods You wait for me here at the
clearing said Ardalion Mihalitch my neighbour addressing his
companions The German bowed got off his horse pulled a book out of
his pocketa novel of Johanna Schopenhauers I fancyand sat down
under a bush Arhip remained in the sun without stirring a muscle for an
hour We beat about among the bushes but did not come on a single
covey Ardalion Mihalitch announced his intention of going on to the
wood I myself had no faith somehow in our luck that day I too
sauntered after him We got back to the clearing The German noted the
page got up put the book in his pocket and with some difficulty
mounted his bobtailed brokenwinded mare who neighed and kicked at
the slightest touch Arhip shook himself gave a tug at both reins at
once swung his legs and at last succeeded in starting his torpid and
dejected nag We set off

I had been familiar with Ardalion Mihalitchs wood from my childhood I
had often strolled in Tchapligino with my French tutor Monsieur Dsir
Fleury the kindest of men who had however almost ruined my
constitution for life by dosing me with Lerouxs mixture every evening
The whole wood consisted of some two or three hundred immense oaks and
ashtrees Their stately powerful trunks were magnificently black
against the transparent golden green of the nut bushes and
mountainashes higher up their wide knotted branches stood out in
graceful lines against the clear blue sky unfolding into a tent
overhead hawks honeybuzzards and kestrels flew whizzing under the
motionless treetops variegated woodpeckers tapped loudly on the stout
bark the blackbirds belllike trill was heard suddenly in the thick
foliage following on the everchanging note of the goldhammer in the
bushes below was the chirp and twitter of hedgewarblers siskins and
peewits finches ran swiftly along the paths a hare would steal along
the edge of the wood halting cautiously as he ran a squirrel would hop
sporting from tree to tree then suddenly sit still with its tail over
its head In the grass among the high anthills under the delicate shade
of the lovely feathery deepindented bracken were violets and lilies
of the valley and funguses russet yellow brown red and crimson in
the patches of grass among the spreading bushes red strawberries were to
be found And oh the shade in the wood In the most stifling heat
at midday it was like night in the wood such peace such fragrance
such freshness I had spent happy times in Tchapligino and so I
must own it was with melancholy feelings I entered the wood I knew so
well The ruinous snowless winter of  had not spared my old
friends the oaks and the ashes withered naked covered here and there
with sickly foliage they struggled mournfully up above the young growth
which took their place but could never replace them Footnote In
 there were severe frosts and no snow fell up to the very end of
December all the wintercorn was frozen and many splendid oakforests
were destroyed by that merciless winter It will be hard to replace
them the productive force of the land is apparently diminishing in the
interdicted wastelands visited by processions with holy images and
so not to be touched instead of the noble trees of former days
birches and aspens grow of themselves and indeed they have no idea
among us of planting woods at allAuthors Note

Some trees still covered with leaves below fling their lifeless
ruined branches upwards as it were in reproach and despair in others
stout dead dry branches are thrust out of the midst of foliage still
thick though with none of the luxuriant abundance of old others have
fallen altogether and lie rotting like corpses on the ground Andwho
could have dreamed of this in former daysthere was no shadeno shade
to be found anywhere in Tchapligino Ah I thought looking at the
dying trees isnt it shameful and bitter for you Koltsovs lines
recurred to me

  What has become
   Of the mighty voices
   The haughty strength
   The royal pomp
   Where now is the
   Wealth of green


How is it Ardalion Mihalitch I began that they didnt fell these
trees the very next year You see they wont give for them now a tenth
of what they would have done before

He merely shrugged his shoulders

You should have asked my aunt that the timber merchants came offered
money down pressed the matter in fact

Mein Gott mein Gott Von der Kock cried at every step Vat a
bity vat a bity

Whats a bity observed my neighbour with a smile

That is how bitiful I meant to say

What particularly aroused his regrets were the oaks lying on the
groundand indeed many a miller would have given a good sum for them
But the constable Arhip preserved an unruffled composure and did not
indulge in any lamentations on the contrary he seemed even to jump
over them and crack his whip on them with a certain satisfaction

We were getting near the place where they were cutting down the trees
when suddenly a shout and hurried talk was heard following on the crash
of a falling tree and a few instants after a young peasant pale and
dishevelled dashed out of the thicket towards us

What is it where are you running Ardalion Mihalitch asked him

He stopped at once

Ah Ardalion Mihalitch sir an accident

What is it

Maksim sir crushed by a tree

How did it happen Maksim the foreman

The foreman sir Wed started cutting an ashtree and he was standing
looking on He stood there a bit and then off he went to the well
for some waterwanted a drink seeminglywhen suddenly the ashtree
began creaking and coming straight towards him We shout to him Run
run run He should have rushed to one side but he up and ran
straight before him He was scared to be sure The ashtree covered
him with its top branches But why it fell so soon the Lord only
knows Perhaps it was rotten at the core

And so it crushed Maksim

Yes sir

To death

No sir hes still alivebut as good as dead his arms and legs are
crushed I was running for Seliverstitch for the doctor

Ardalion Mihalitch told the constable to gallop to the village for
Seliverstitch while he himself pushed on at a quick trot to the
clearing I followed him

We found poor Maksim on the ground The peasants were standing about
him We got off our horses He hardly moaned at all from time to time
he opened his eyes wide looked round as it were in astonishment and
bit his lips fast turning blue The lower part of his face was
twitching his hair was matted on his brow his breast heaved
irregularly he was dying The light shade of a young limetree glided
softly over his face

We bent down to him He recognised Ardalion Mihalitch

Please sir he said to him hardly articulately send for the
priest tell the Lord has punished me arms legs all
smashed todays Sunday and I I see didnt let
the lads off work

He ceased out of breath

And my money for my wife after deducting Onesim here knows
whom I what I owe

Weve sent for the doctor Maksim said my neighbour perhaps you may
not die yet

He tried to open his eyes and with an effort raised the lids

No Im dying Here here it is coming here it Forgive me
lads if in any way

God will forgive you Maksim Andreitch said the peasants thickly with
one voice and they took off their caps do you forgive us

He suddenly shook his head despairingly his breast heaved with a
painful effort and he fell back again

We cant let him lie here and die though cried Ardalion Mihalitch
lads give us the mat from the cart and carry him to the hospital

Two men ran to the cart

I bought a horse yesterday faltered the dying man off Efim
Sitchovsky paid earnest money so the horse is mine Give it
to my wife

They began to move him on to the mat He trembled all over like a
wounded bird and stiffened

He is dead muttered the peasants

We mounted our horses in silence and rode away

The death of poor Maksim set me musing How wonderfully indeed the
Russian peasant dies The temper in which he meets his end cannot be
called indifference or stolidity he dies as though he were performing a
solemn rite coolly and simply

A few years ago a peasant belonging to another neighbour of mine in the
country got burnt in the drying shed where the corn is put He would
have remained there but a passing pedlar pulled him out halfdead he
plunged into a tub of water and with a run broke down the door of the
burning outhouse I went to his hut to see him It was dark smoky
stifling in the hut I asked Where is the sick man There sir on
the stove the sorrowing peasant woman answered me in a singsong
voice I went up the peasant was lying covered with a sheepskin
breathing heavily Well how do you feel The injured man stirred on
the stove all over burns within sight of death as he was tried to
rise Lie still lie still lie still Well how are you In a bad
way surely said he Are you in pain No answer Is there anything
you wantNo answer Shouldnt I send you some tea or anything
Theres no need I moved away from him and sat down on the bench I
sat there a quarter of an hour I sat there half an hourthe silence of
the tomb in the hut In the corner behind the table under the holy
pictures crouched a little girl of twelve years old eating a piece of
bread Her mother threatened her every now and then In the outer room
there was coming and going noise and talk the brothers wife was
chopping cabbage Hey Aksinya said the injured man at last What
Some kvasAksinya gave him some kvas Silence again I asked in a
whisper Have they given him the sacrament Yes So then
everything was in order he was waiting for death that was all I could
not bear it and went away

Again I recall how I went one day to the hospital in the village of
Krasnogorye to see the surgeon Kapiton a friend of mine and an
enthusiastic sportsman

This hospital consisted of what had once been the lodge of the
manorhouse the lady of the manor had founded it herself in other
words she ordered a blue board to be nailed up above the door with an
inscription in white letters Krasnogorye Hospital and had herself
handed to Kapiton a red album to record the names of the patients in On
the first page of this album one of the toadying parasites of this Lady
Bountiful had inscribed the following lines

  Dans ces beaux lieux o rgne lallgresse
   Ce temple fut ouvert par la Beaut
   De vos seigneurs admirez la tendresse
   Bons habitants de Krasnogori


while another gentleman had written below

  Et moi aussi jaime la nature
                          JEAN KOBYLIATNIKOFF


The surgeon bought six beds at his own expense and had set to work in a
thankful spirit to heal Gods people Besides him the staff consisted
of two persons an engraver Pavel liable to attacks of insanity and a
onearmed peasant woman Melikitrisa who performed the duties of cook
Both of them mixed the medicines and dried and infused herbs they too
controlled the patients when they were delirious The insane engraver
was sullen in appearance and sparing of words at night he would sing a
song about lovely Venus and would besiege every one he met with a
request for permission to marry a girl called Malanya who had long been
dead The onearmed peasant woman used to beat him and set him to look
after the turkeys Well one day I was at Kapitons We had begun
talking over our last days shooting when suddenly a cart drove into
the yard drawn by an exceptionally stout horse such as are only found
belonging to millers In the cart sat a thickset peasant in a new
greatcoat with a beard streaked with grey Hullo Vassily Dmitritch
Kapiton shouted from the window please come in The miller of
Liobovshin he whispered to me The peasant climbed groaning out of the
cart came into the surgeons room and after looking for the holy
pictures crossed himself bowing to them Well Vassily Dmitritch any
news But you must be ill you dont look well Yes Kapiton
Timofeitch theres something not right Whats wrong with you
Well it was like this Kapiton Timofeitch Not long ago I bought some
millstones in the town so I took them home and as I went to lift them
out of the cart I strained myself or something Id a sort of rick in
the loins as though something had been torn away and ever since Ive
been out of sorts Today I feel worse than ever Hm commented
Kapiton and he took a pinch of snuff thats a rupture no doubt But
is it long since this happened Its ten days now Ten days The
surgeon drew a long inward breath and shook his head Let me examine
you Well Vassily Dmitritch he pronounced at last I am sorry for
you heartily sorry but things arent right with you at all youre
seriously ill stay here with me I will do everything I can for my
part though I cant answer for anything So bad as that muttered
the astounded peasant Yes Vassily Dmitritch it is bad if youd come
to me a day or two sooner it would have been nothing much I could have
cured you in a trice but now inflammation has set in before we know
where we are therell be mortification But it cant be Kapiton
Timofeitch I tell you it is so But how comes it The surgeon
shrugged his shoulders And I must die for a trifle like that I
dont say that only you must stop here The peasant pondered and
pondered his eyes fixed on the floor then he glanced up at us
scratched his head and picked up his cap Where are you off to
Vassily Dmitritch Where why home to be sure if its so bad I must
put things to rights if its like that But youll do yourself harm
Vassily Dmitritch you will really Im surprised how you managed to
get here you must stop No brother Kapiton Timofeitch if I must
die Ill die at home why die here Ive got a home and the Lord knows
how it will end No one can tell yet Vassily Dmitritch how it will
end Of course there is danger considerable danger theres no
disputing that but for that reason you ought to stay here The
peasant shook his head No Kapiton Timofeitch I wont stay but
perhaps you will prescribe me a medicine Medicine alone will be no
good I wont stay I tell you Well as you like Mind you dont
blame me for it afterwards

The surgeon tore a page out of the album and writing out a
prescription gave him some advice as to what he could do besides The
peasant took the sheet of paper gave Kapiton halfarouble went out of
the room and took his seat in the cart Well goodbye Kapiton
Timofeitch dont remember evil against me and remember my orphans if
anything Oh do stay Vassily The peasant simply shook his head
struck the horse with the reins and drove out of the yard The road was
muddy and full of holes the miller drove cautiously without hurry
guiding his horse skilfully and nodding to the acquaintances he met
Three days later he was dead

The Russians in general meet death in a marvellous way Many of the
dead come back now to my memory I recall you my old friend who left
the university with no degree Avenir Sorokoumov noblest best of men
I see once again your sickly consumptive face your lank brown tresses
your gentle smile your ecstatic glance your long limbs I can hear
your weak caressing voice You lived at a Great Russian landowners
called Gur Krupyanikov taught his children Fofa and Zyozya Russian
grammar geography and history patiently bore all the ponderous jokes
of the said Gur the coarse familiarities of the steward the vulgar
pranks of the spiteful urchins with a bitter smile but without
repining you complied with the caprices of their bored and exacting
mother but to make up for it all what bliss what peace was yours in
the evening after supper when free at last of all duties you sat at
the window pensively smoking a pipe or greedily turned the pages of a
greasy and mutilated number of some solid magazine brought you from the
town by the landsurveyorjust such another poor homeless devil as
yourself How delighted you were then with any sort of poem or novel
how readily the tears started into your eyes with what pleasure you
laughed what genuine love for others what generous sympathy for
everything good and noble filled your pure youthful soul One must tell
the truth you were not distinguished by excessive sharpness of wit
Nature had endowed you with neither memory nor industry at the
university you were regarded as one of the least promising students at
lectures you slumbered at examinations you preserved a solemn silence
but who was beaming with delight and breathless with excitement at a
friends success a friends triumphs Avenir Who had a blind
faith in the lofty destiny of his friends who extolled them with pride
who championed them with angry vehemence who was innocent of envy as of
vanity who was ready for the most disinterested selfsacrifice who
eagerly gave way to men who were not worthy to untie his latchet
That was you all you our good Avenir I remember how brokenheartedly
you parted from your comrades when you were going away to be a tutor in
the country you were haunted by presentiment of evil And indeed
your lot was a sad one in the country you had no one there to listen to
with veneration no one to admire no one to love The
neighboursrude sons of the steppes and polished gentlemen
aliketreated you as a tutor some with rudeness and neglect others
carelessly Besides you were not prepossessing in person you were
shy given to blushing getting hot and stammering Even your health
was no better for the country air you wasted like a candle poor
fellow It is true your room looked out into the garden wild cherries
appletrees and limes strewed their delicate blossoms on your table
your inkstand your books on the wall hung a blue silk watchpocket a
parting present from a kindhearted sentimental German governess with
flaxen curls and little blue eyes and sometimes an old friend from
Moscow would come out to you and throw you into ecstasies with new
poetry often even with his own But oh the loneliness the
insufferable slavery of a tutors lot the impossibility of escape the
endless autumns and winters the everadvancing disease Poor poor
Avenir

I paid Sorokoumov a visit not long before his death He was then hardly
able to walk The landowner Gur Krupyanikov had not turned him out of
the house but had given up paying him a salary and had taken another
tutor for Zyozya Fofa had been sent to a school of cadets Avenir
was sitting near the window in an old easychair It was exquisite
weather The clear autumn sky was a bright blue above the darkbrown
line of bare limes here and there a few last leaves of lurid gold
rustled and whispered about them The earth had been covered with frost
now melting into dewdrops in the sun whose ruddy rays fell aslant
across the pale grass there was a faint crisp resonance in the air the
voices of the labourers in the garden reached us clearly and distinctly
Avenir wore an old Bokhara dressinggown a green neckerchief threw a
deathly hue over his terribly sunken face He was greatly delighted to
see me held out his hand began talking and coughing at once I made
him be quiet and sat down by him On Avenirs knee lay a manuscript
book of Koltsovs poems carefully copied out he patted it with a
smile Thats a poet he stammered with an effort repressing his
cough and he fell to declaiming in a voice scarcely audible

  Can the eagles wings
     Be chained and fettered
   Can the pathways of heaven
     Be closed against him


I stopped him the doctor had forbidden him to talk I knew what would
please him Sorokoumov never as they say kept up with the science of
the day but he was always anxious to know what results the leading
intellects had reached Sometimes he would get an old friend into a
corner and begin questioning him he would listen and wonder take every
word on trust and even repeat it all after him He took a special
interest in German philosophy I began discoursing to him about Hegel
this all happened long ago as you may gather Avenir nodded his head
approvingly raised his eyebrows smiled and whispered I see I see
ah thats splendid splendid The childish curiosity of this poor
dying homeless outcast moved me I confess to tears It must be noted
that Avenir unlike the general run of consumptives did not deceive
himself in regard to his disease But what of thathe did not sigh
nor grieve he did not even once refer to his position

Rallying his strength he began talking of Moscow of old friends of
Pushkin of the drama of Russian literature he recalled our little
suppers the heated debates of our circle with regret he uttered the
names of two or three friends who were dead

Do you remember Dasha he went on Ah there was a heart of pure
gold What a heart and how she loved me What has become of her now
Wasted and fallen away poor dear I daresay

I had not the courage to disillusion the sick man and indeed why
should he know that his Dasha was now broader than she was long and
that she was living under the protection of some merchants the brothers
Kondatchkov that she used powder and paint and was for ever swearing
and scolding

But cant we I thought looking at his wasted face get him away
from here Perhaps there may still be a chance of curing him But
Avenir cut short my suggestion

No brother thanks he said it makes no difference where one dies
I shant live till the winter you see Why give trouble for nothing
Im used to this house Its true the people

Theyre unkind eh I put in

No not unkind but woodenheaded creatures However I cant complain
of them There are neighbours theres a Mr Kasatkins daughter a
cultivated kind charming girl not proud

Sorokoumov began coughing again

I shouldnt mind anything he went on after taking breath if theyd
only let me smoke my pipe But Ill have my pipe if I die for it
he added with a sly wink Thank God I have had life enough I have
known so many fine people

But you should at least write to your relations I interrupted

Why write to them They cant be any help when I die theyll hear of
it But why talk about it Id rather youd tell me what you saw
abroad

I began to tell him my experiences He seemed positively to gloat over
my story Towards evening I left and ten days later I received the
following letter from Mr Krupyanikov

I have the honour to inform you my dear sir that your friend the
student living in my house Mr Avenir Sorokoumov died at two oclock
in the afternoon three days ago and was buried today at my expense
in the parish church He asked me to forward you the books and
manuscripts enclosed herewith He was found to have twentytwo roubles
and a half which with the rest of his belongings pass into the
possession of his relatives Your friend died fully conscious and I
may say with so little sensibility that he showed no signs of regret
even when the whole family of us took a last farewell of him My wife
Kleopatra Aleksandrovna sends you her regards The death of your friend
has of course affected her nerves as regards myself I am thank God
in good health and have the honour to remain your humble servant

G KRUPYANIKOV

Many more examples recur to me but one cannot relate everything I will
confine myself to one

I was present at an old ladys deathbed the priest had begun reading
the prayers for the dying over her but suddenly noticing that the
patient seemed to be actually dying he made haste to give her the cross
to kiss The lady turned away with an air of displeasure Youre in too
great a hurry father she said in a voice almost inarticulate in
too great a hurry She kissed the cross put her hand under the
pillow and expired Under the pillow was a silver rouble she had meant
to pay the priest for the service at her own death

Yes the Russians die in a wonderful way

THE SINGERS

The small village of Kolotovka once belonged to a lady known in the
neighbourhood by the nickname of Skinflint in illusion to her keen
business habits her real name is lost in oblivion but has of late
years been the property of a German from Petersburg The village lies on
the slope of a barren hill which is cut in half from top to bottom by a
tremendous ravine It is a yawning chasm with shelving sides hollowed
out by the action of rain and snow and it winds along the very centre
of the village street it separates the two sides of the unlucky hamlet
far more than a river would do for a river could at least be crossed
by a bridge A few gaunt willows creep timorously down its sandy sides
at the very bottom which is dry and yellow as copper lie huge slabs of
argillaceous rock A cheerless position theres no denying yet all the
surrounding inhabitants know the road to Kolotovka well they go there
often and are always glad to go

At the very summit of the ravine a few paces from the point where it
starts as a narrow fissure in the earth there stands a small square
hut It stands alone apart from all the others It is thatched and has
a chimney one window keeps watch like a sharp eye over the ravine and
on winter evenings when it is lighted from within it is seen far away
in the dim frosty fog and its twinkling light is the guiding star of
many a peasant on his road A blue board is nailed up above the door
this hut is a tavern called the Welcome Resort Spirits are sold here
probably no cheaper than the usual price but it is far more frequented
than any other establishment of the same sort in the neighbourhood The
explanation of this is to be found in the tavernkeeper Nikolai
Ivanitch

Nikolai Ivanitchonce a slender curlyheaded and rosycheeked young
fellow now an excessively stout grizzled man with a fat face sly and
goodnatured little eyes and a shiny forehead with wrinkles like lines
drawn all over ithas lived for more than twenty years in Kolotovka
Nikolai Ivanitch is a shrewd acute fellow like the majority of
tavernkeepers Though he makes no conspicuous effort to please or to
talk to people he has the art of attracting and keeping customers who
find it particularly pleasant to sit at his bar under the placid and
genial though alert eye of the phlegmatic host He has a great deal of
common sense he thoroughly understands the landowners conditions of
life the peasants and the tradesmans He could give sensible advice
on difficult points but like a cautious man and an egoist prefers to
stand aloof and at mostand that only in the case of his favourite
customersby remote hints dropped as it were unintentionally to
lead them into the true way He is an authority on everything that is of
interest or importance to a Russian on horses and cattle on timber
bricks and crockery on woollen stuffs and on leather on songs and
dances When he has no customers he is usually sitting like a sack on
the ground before the door of his hut his thin legs tucked under him
exchanging a friendly greeting with every passerby He has seen a great
deal in his time many a score of petty landowners who used to come to
him for spirits he has seen pass away before him he knows everything
that is done for eighty miles round and never gossips never gives a
sign of knowing what is unsuspected by the most keensighted
policeofficer He keeps his own counsel laughs and makes his glasses
ring His neighbours respect him the civilian general Shtcherpetenko
the landowner highest in rank in the district gives him a condescending
nod whenever he drives past his little house Nikolai Ivanitch is a man
of influence he made a notorious horsestealer return a horse he had
taken from the stable of one of his friends he brought the peasants of
a neighbouring village to their senses when they refused to accept a new
overseer and so on It must not be imagined though that he does this
from love of justice from devotion to his neighbourno he simply
tries to prevent anything that might in any way interfere with his
ease and comfort Nikolai Ivanitch is married and has children His
wife a smart sharpnosed and keeneyed woman of the tradesman class
has grown somewhat stout of late years like her husband He relies on
her in everything and she keeps the key of the cashbox Drunken
brawlers are afraid of her she does not like them they bring little
profit and make a great deal of noise those who are taciturn and surly
in their cups are more to her taste Nikolai Ivanitchs children are
still small the first four all died but those that are left take after
their parents it is a pleasure to look at their intelligent healthy
little faces

It was an insufferably hot day in July when slowly dragging my feet
along I went up alongside the Kolotovka ravine with my dog towards the
Welcome Resort The sun blazed as it were fiercely in the sky baking
the parched earth relentlessly the air was thick with stifling dust
Glossy crows and ravens with gaping beaks looked plaintively at the
passersby as though asking for sympathy only the sparrows did not
droop but pluming their feathers twittered more vigorously than ever
as they quarrelled among the hedges or flew up all together from the
dusty road and hovered in grey clouds over the green hempfields I was
tormented by thirst There was no water near in Kolotovka as in many
other villages of the steppes the peasants having no spring or well
drink a sort of thin mud out of the pond For no one could call that
repulsive beverage water I wanted to ask for a glass of beer or kvas at
Nikolai Ivanitchs

It must be confessed that at no time of the year does Kolotovka present
a very cheering spectacle but it has a particularly depressing effect
when the relentless rays of a dazzling July sun pour down full upon the
brown tumbledown roofs of the houses and the deep ravine and the
parched dusty common over which the thin longlegged hens are straying
hopelessly and the remains of the old manorhouse now a hollow grey
framework of aspenwood with holes instead of windows overgrown with
nettles wormwood and rank grass and the pond black as though charred
and covered with goose feathers with its edge of halfdried mud and
its brokendown dyke near which on the finely trodden ashlike earth
sheep breathless and gasping with the heat huddle dejectedly together
their heads drooping with weary patience as though waiting for this
insufferable heat to pass at last With weary steps I drew near Nikolai
Ivanitchs dwelling arousing in the village children the usual wonder
manifested in a concentrated meaningless stare and in the dogs an
indignation expressed in such hoarse and furious barking that it seemed
as if it were tearing their very entrails and left them breathless and
choking when suddenly in the tavern doorway there appeared a tall
peasant without a cap in a frieze cloak girt about below his waist
with a blue handkerchief He looked like a houseserf thick grey hair
stood up in disorder above his withered and wrinkled face He was
calling to some one hurriedly waving his arms which obviously were not
quite under his control It could be seen that he had been drinking
already

Come come along he stammered raising his shaggy eyebrows with an
effort Come Blinkard come along Ah brother how you creep along
pon my word Its too bad brother Theyre waiting for you within and
here you crawl along Come

Well Im coming Im coming called a jarring voice and from behind
a hut a little short fat lame man came into sight He wore a rather
tidy cloth coat pulled half on and a high pointed cap right over his
brows which gave his round plump face a sly and comic expression His
little yellow eyes moved restlessly about his thin lips wore a
continual forced smile while his sharp long nose peered forward
saucily in front like a rudder Im coming my dear fellow He went
hobbling towards the tavern What are you calling me for Whos
waiting for me

What am I calling you for repeated the man in the frieze coat
reproachfully Youre a queer fish Blinkard we call you to come to
the tavern and you ask what for Here are honest folks all waiting for
you Yashka the Turk and the Wild Master and the boothkeeper from
Zhizdry Yashkas got a bet on with the boothkeeper the stakes a pot
of beerfor the one that does best sings the best I mean do you
see

Is Yashka going to sing said the man addressed as Blinkard with
lively interest But isnt it your humbug Gabbler

Im not humbugging answered the Gabbler with dignity its you are
crazy I should think he would sing since hes got a bet on it you
precious innocent you noodle Blinkard

Well come in simpleton retorted the Blinkard

Then give us a kiss at least lovey stammered the Gabbler opening
wide his arms

Get out you great softy responded the Blinkard contemptuously
giving him a poke with his elbow and both stooping entered the low
doorway

The conversation I had overheard roused my curiosity exceedingly More
than once rumours had reached me of Yashka the Turk as the best singer
in the vicinity and here was an opportunity all at once of hearing him
in competition with another master of the art I quickened my steps and
went into the house

Few of my readers have probably had an opportunity of getting a good
view of any village taverns but we sportsmen go everywhere They are
constructed on an exceedingly simple plan They usually consist of a
dark outershed and an inner room with a chimney divided in two by a
partition behind which none of the customers have a right to go In
this partition there is a wide opening cut above a broad oak table At
this table or bar the spirits are served Sealed up bottles of various
sizes stand on the shelves right opposite the opening In the front
part of the room devoted to customers there are benches two or three
empty barrels and a corner table Village taverns are for the most part
rather dark and you hardly ever see on their wainscotted walls any of
the glaring cheap prints which few huts are without

When I went into the Welcome Resort a fairly large party were already
assembled there

In his usual place behind the bar almost filling up the entire opening
in the partition stood Nikolai Ivanitch in a striped print shirt with
a lazy smile on his full face he poured out with his plump white hand
two glasses of spirits for the Blinkard and the Gabbler as they came in
behind him in a corner near the window could be seen his sharpeyed
wife In the middle of the room was standing Yashka the Turk a thin
graceful fellow of threeandtwenty dressed in a long skirted coat of
blue nankin He looked a smart factory hand and could not to judge by
his appearance boast of very good health His hollow cheeks his large
restless grey eyes his straight nose with its delicate mobile
nostrils his pale brown curls brushed back over the sloping white brow
his full but beautiful expressive lips and his whole face betrayed a
passionate and sensitive nature He was in a state of great excitement
he blinked his breathing was hurried his hands shook as though in
fever and he was really in a feverthat sudden fever of excitement
which is so wellknown to all who have to speak and sing before an
audience Near him stood a man of about forty with broad shoulders and
broad jaws with a low forehead narrow Tartar eyes a short flat nose
a square chin and shining black hair coarse as bristles The expression
of his facea swarthy face with a sort of leaden hue in itand
especially of his pale lips might almost have been called savage if it
had not been so still and dreamy He hardly stirred a muscle he only
looked slowly about him like a bull under the yoke He was dressed in a
sort of surtout not over new with smooth brass buttons an old black
silk handkerchief was twisted round his immense neck He was called the
Wild Master Right opposite him on a bench under the holy pictures was
sitting Yashkas rival the boothkeeper from Zhizdry he was a short
stoutlybuilt man about thirty pockmarked and curlyheaded with a
blunt turnup nose lively brown eyes and a scanty beard He looked
keenly about him and sitting with his hands under him he kept
carelessly swinging his legs and tapping with his feet which were
encased in stylish topboots with a coloured edging He wore a new thin
coat of grey cloth with a plush collar in sharp contrast with the
crimson shirt below buttoned close across the chest In the opposite
corner to the right of the door a peasant sat at the table in a
narrow shabby smockfrock with a huge rent on the shoulder The
sunlight fell in a narrow yellowish streak through the dusty panes of
the two small windows but it seemed as if it struggled in vain with the
habitual darkness of the room all the objects in it were dimly as it
were patchily lighted up On the other hand it was almost cool in the
room and the sense of stifling heat dropped off me like a weary load
directly I crossed the threshold

My entrance I could see was at first somewhat disconcerting to Nikolai
Ivanitchs customers but observing that he greeted me as a friend they
were reassured and took no more notice of me I asked for some beer and
sat down in the corner near the peasant in the ragged smock

Well well piped the Gabbler suddenly draining a glass of spirits at
one gulp and accompanying his exclamation with the strange
gesticulations without which he seemed unable to utter a single word
what are we waiting for If were going to begin then begin Hey
Yasha

Begin begin chimed in Nikolai Ivanitch approvingly

Lets begin by all means observed the boothkeeper coolly with a
selfconfident smile Im ready

And Im ready Yakov pronounced in a voice thrilled with excitement

Well begin lads whined the Blinkard But in spite of the
unanimously expressed desire neither began the boothkeeper did not
even get up from the benchthey all seemed to be waiting for something

Begin said the Wild Master sharply and sullenly Yashka started The
boothkeeper pulled down his girdle and cleared his throat

But whos to begin he inquired in a slightly changed voice of the
Wild Master who still stood motionless in the middle of the room his
stalwart legs wide apart and his powerful arms thrust up to the elbow
into his breeches pockets

You you boothkeeper stammered the Gabbler you to be sure
brother

The Wild Master looked at him from under his brows The Gabbler gave a
faint squeak in confusion looked away at the ceiling twitched his
shoulder and said no more

Cast lots the Wild Master pronounced emphatically and the pot on
the table

Nikolai Ivanitch bent down and with a gasp picked up the pot of beer
from the floor and set it on the table

The Wild Master glanced at Yakov and said Come

Yakov fumbled in his pockets took out a halfpenny and marked it with
his teeth The boothkeeper pulled from under the skirts of his long
coat a new leather purse deliberately untied the string and shaking
out a quantity of small change into his hand picked out a new
halfpenny The Gabbler held out his dirty cap with its broken peak
hanging loose Yakov dropped his halfpenny in and the boothkeeper his

You must pick out one said the Wild Master turning to the Blinkard

The Blinkard smiled complacently took the cap in both hands and began
shaking it

For an instant a profound silence reigned the halfpennies clinked
faintly jingling against each other I looked round attentively every
face wore an expression of intense expectation the Wild Master himself
showed signs of uneasiness my neighbour even the peasant in the
tattered smock craned his neck inquisitively The Blinkard put his hand
into the cap and took out the boothkeepers halfpenny every one drew a
long breath Yakov flushed and the boothkeeper passed his hand over
his hair

There I said youd begin cried the Gabbler didnt I say so

There there dont cluck remarked the Wild Master contemptuously
Begin he went on with a nod to the boothkeeper

What song am I to sing asked the boothkeeper beginning to be
nervous

What you choose answered the Blinkard sing what you think best

What you choose to be sure Nikolai Ivanitch chimed in slowly
smoothing his hand on his breast youre quite at liberty about that
Sing what you like only sing well and well give a fair decision
afterwards

A fair decision of course put in the Gabbler licking the edge of
his empty glass

Let me clear my throat a bit mates said the boothkeeper fingering
the collar of his coat

Come come no nonsensebegin protested the Wild Master and he
looked down

The boothkeeper thought a minute shook his head and stepped forward
Yakovs eyes were riveted upon him

But before I enter upon a description of the contest itself I think it
will not be amiss to say a few words about each of the personages taking
part in my story The lives of some of them were known to me already
when I met them in the Welcome Resort I collected some facts about the
others later on

Let us begin with the Gabbler This mans real name was Evgraf
Ivanovitch but no one in the whole neighbourhood knew him as anything
but the Gabbler and he himself referred to himself by that nickname so
well did it fit him Indeed nothing could have been more appropriate to
his insignificant everrestless features He was a dissipated
unmarried houseserf whose own masters had long ago got rid of him and
who without any employment without earning a halfpenny found means to
get drunk every day at other peoples expense He had a great number of
acquaintances who treated him to drinks of spirits and tea though they
could not have said why they did so themselves for far from being
entertaining in company he bored every one with his meaningless
chatter his insufferable familiarity his spasmodic gestures and
incessant unnatural laugh He could neither sing nor dance he had
never said a clever or even a sensible thing in his life he chattered
away telling lies about everythinga regular Gabbler And yet not a
single drinking party for thirty miles around took place without his
lank figure turning up among the guests so that they were used to him
by now and put up with his presence as a necessary evil They all it
is true treated him with contempt but the Wild Master was the only one
who knew how to keep his foolish sallies in check

The Blinkard was not in the least like the Gabbler His nickname too
suited him though he was no more given to blinking than other people
it is a wellknown fact that the Russian peasants have a talent for
finding good nicknames In spite of my endeavours to get more detailed
information about this mans past many passages in his life have
remained spots of darkness to me and probably to many other people
episodes buried as the bookmen say in the darkness of oblivion I
could only find out that he was once a coachman in the service of an old
childless lady that he had run away with three horses he was in charge
of had been lost for a whole year and no doubt convinced by
experience of the drawbacks and hardships of a wandering life he had
gone back a cripple and flung himself at his mistresss feet He
succeeded in a few years in smoothing over his offence by his exemplary
conduct and gradually getting higher in her favour at last gained her
complete confidence was made a bailiff and on his mistresss death
turned outin what way was never knownto have received his freedom
He got admitted into the class of tradesmen rented patches of market
garden from the neighbours grew rich and now was living in ease and
comfort He was a man of experience who knew on which side his bread
was buttered was more actuated by prudence than by either good or
illnature had knocked about understood men and knew how to turn them
to his own advantage He was cautious and at the same time
enterprising like a fox though he was as fond of gossip as an old
woman he never let out his own affairs while he made everyone else
talk freely of theirs He did not affect to be a simpleton though as
so many crafty men of his sort do indeed it would have been difficult
for him to take any one in in that way I have never seen a sharper
keener pair of eyes than his tiny cunning little peepers as they call
them in Orel They were never simply looking about they were always
looking one up and down and through and through The Blinkard would
sometimes ponder for weeks together over some apparently simple
undertaking and again he would suddenly decide on a desperately bold
line of action which one would fancy would bring him to ruin But it
would be sure to turn out all right everything would go smoothly He
was lucky and believed in his own luck and believed in omens He was
exceedingly superstitious in general He was not liked because he would
have nothing much to do with anyone but he was respected His whole
family consisted of one little son whom he idolised and who brought
up by such a father is likely to get on in the world Little
Blinkardll be his father over again is said of him already in
undertones by the old men as they sit on their mud walls gossiping on
summer evenings and every one knows what that means there is no need
to say more

As to Yashka the Turk and the boothkeeper there is no need to say much
about them Yakov called the Turk because he actually was descended
from a Turkish woman a prisoner from the war was by nature an artist
in every sense of the word and by calling a ladler in a paper factory
belonging to a merchant As for the boothkeeper his career I must
own I know nothing of he struck me as being a smart townsman of the
tradesman class ready to turn his hand to anything But the Wild Master
calls for a more detailed account

The first impression the sight of this man produced on you was a sense
of coarse heavy irresistible power He was clumsily built a
shambler as they say about us but there was an air of triumphant
vigour about him andstrange to sayhis bearlike figure was not
without a certain grace of its own proceeding perhaps from his
absolutely placid confidence in his own strength It was hard to decide
at first to what class this Hercules belonged he did not look like a
houseserf nor a tradesman nor an impoverished clerk out of work nor
a small ruined landowner such as takes to being a huntsman or a
fighting man he was in fact quite individual No one knew where he
came from or what brought him into our district it was said that he
came of free peasantproprietor stock and had once been in the
government service somewhere but nothing positive was known about this
and indeed there was no one from whom one could learncertainly not
from him he was the most silent and morose of men So much so that no
one knew for certain what he lived on he followed no trade visited no
one associated with scarcely anyone yet he had money to spend little
enough it is true still he had some In his behaviour he was not
exactly retiringretiring was not a word that could be applied to him
he lived as though he noticed no one about him and cared for no one
The Wild Master that was the nickname they had given him his real name
was Perevlyesov enjoyed an immense influence in the whole district he
was obeyed with eager promptitude though he had no kind of right to
give orders to anyone and did not himself evince the slightest
pretension to authority over the people with whom he came into casual
contact He spokethey obeyed strength always has an influence of its
own He scarcely drank at all had nothing to do with women and was
passionately fond of singing There was much that was mysterious about
this man it seemed as though vast forces sullenly reposed within him
knowing as it were that once roused once bursting free they were
bound to crush him and everything they came in contact with and I am
greatly mistaken if in this mans life there had not been some such
outbreak if it was not owing to the lessons of experience to a narrow
escape from ruin that he now kept himself so tightly in hand What
especially struck me in him was the combination of a sort of inborn
natural ferocity with an equally inborn generositya combination I
have never met in any other man

And so the boothkeeper stepped forward and half shutting his eyes
began singing in high falsetto He had a fairly sweet and pleasant
voice though rather hoarse he played with his voice like a woodlark
twisting and turning it in incessant roulades and trills up and down the
scale continually returning to the highest notes which he held and
prolonged with special care Then he would break off and again suddenly
take up the first motive with a sort of goahead daring His modulations
were at times rather bold at times rather comical they would have
given a connoisseur great satisfaction and have made a German furiously
indignant He was a Russian tenore di grazia tnor lger He
sang a song to a lively dancetune the words of which all that I could
catch through the endless maze of variations ejaculations and
repetitions were as follows

  A tiny patch of land young lass
     Ill plough for thee
   And tiny crimson flowers young lass
     Ill sow for thee


He sang all listened to him with great attention He seemed to feel
that he had to do with really musical people and therefore was exerting
himself to do his best And they really are musical in our part of the
country the village of Sergievskoe on the Orel highroad is deservedly
noted throughout Russia for its harmonious chorussinging The
boothkeeper sang for a long while without evoking much enthusiasm in
his audience he lacked the support of a chorus but at last after one
particularly bold flourish which set even the Wild Master smiling the
Gabbler could not refrain from a shout of delight Everyone was roused
The Gabbler and the Blinkard began joining in in an undertone and
exclaiming Bravely done Take it you rogue Sing it out you
serpent Hold it That shake again you dog you May Herod confound
your soul and so on Nikolai Ivanitch behind the bar was nodding his
head from side to side approvingly The Gabbler at last was swinging his
legs tapping with his feet and twitching his shoulder while Yashkas
eyes fairly glowed like coal and he trembled all over like a leaf and
smiled nervously The Wild Master alone did not change countenance and
stood motionless as before but his eyes fastened on the boothkeeper
looked somewhat softened though the expression of his lips was still
scornful Emboldened by the signs of general approbation the
boothkeeper went off in a whirl of flourishes and began to round off
such trills to turn such shakes off his tongue and to make such
furious play with his throat that when at last pale exhausted and
bathed in hot perspiration he uttered the last dying note his whole
body flung back a general united shout greeted him in a violent
outburst The Gabbler threw himself on his neck and began strangling him
in his long bony arms a flush came out on Nikolai Ivanitchs oily
face and he seemed to have grown younger Yashka shouted like mad
Capital capitaleven my neighbour the peasant in the torn smock
could not restrain himself and with a blow of his fist on the table he
cried Aha well done damn my soul well done And he spat on one
side with an air of decision

Well brother youve given us a treat bawled the Gabbler not
releasing the exhausted boothkeeper from his embraces youve given us
a treat theres no denying Youve won brother youve won I
congratulate youthe quarts yours Yashkas miles behind you I
tell you miles take my word for it And again he hugged the
boothkeeper to his breast

There let him alone let him alone theres no being rid of you
said the Blinkard with vexation let him sit down on the bench hes
tired see Youre a ninny brother a perfect ninny What are you
sticking to him like a wet leaf for

Well then let him sit down and Ill drink to his health said the
Gabbler and he went up to the bar At your expense brother he
added addressing the boothkeeper

The latter nodded sat down on the bench pulled a piece of cloth out of
his cap and began wiping his face while the Gabbler with greedy
haste emptied his glass and with a grunt assumed after the manner
of confirmed drinkers an expression of careworn melancholy

You sing beautifully brother beautifully Nikolai Ivanitch observed
caressingly And now its your turn Yasha mind now dont be afraid
We shall see whos who we shall see The boothkeeper sings
beautifully though pon my soul he does

Very beautifully observed Nikolai Ivanitchs wife and she looked
with a smile at Yakov

Beautifully ha repeated my neighbour in an undertone

Ah a wild man of the woods the Gabbler vociferated suddenly and
going up to the peasant with the rent on his shoulder he pointed at him
with his finger while he pranced about and went off into an insulting
guffaw Ha ha get along wild man of the woods Heres a ragamuffin
from Woodland village What brought you here he bawled amidst
laughter

The poor peasant was abashed and was just about to get up and make off
as fast as he could when suddenly the Wild Masters iron voice was
heard

What does the insufferable brute mean he articulated grinding his
teeth

I wasnt doing nothing muttered the Gabbler I didnt I
only

There all right shut up retorted the Wild Master Yakov begin

Yakov took himself by his throat

Well really brothers something Hm I dont know on my word
what

Come thats enough dont be timid For shame why go back Sing
the best you can by Gods gift

And the Wild Master looked down expectant Yakov was silent for a
minute he glanced round and covered his face with his hand All had
their eyes simply fastened upon him especially the boothkeeper on
whose face a faint involuntary uneasiness could be seen through his
habitual expression of selfconfidence and the triumph of his success
He leant back against the wall and again put both hands under him but
did not swing his legs as before When at last Yakov uncovered his face
it was pale as a dead mans his eyes gleamed faintly under their
drooping lashes He gave a deep sigh and began to sing The first
sound of his voice was faint and unequal and seemed not to come from
his chest but to be wafted from somewhere afar off as though it had
floated by chance into the room A strange effect was produced on all of
us by this trembling resonant note we glanced at one another and
Nikolai Ivanitchs wife seemed to draw herself up This first note was
followed by another bolder and prolonged but still obviously
quivering like a harpstring when suddenly struck by a stray finger it
throbs in a last swiftlydying tremble the second was followed by a
third and gradually gaining fire and breadth the strains swelled into
a pathetic melody Not one little path ran into the field he sang
and sweet and mournful it was in our ears I have seldom I must
confess heard a voice like it it was slightly hoarse and not
perfectly true there was even something morbid about it at first but
it had genuine depth of passion and youth and sweetness and a sort of
fascinating careless pathetic melancholy A spirit of truth and fire
a Russian spirit was sounding and breathing in that voice and it
seemed to go straight to your heart to go straight to all that was
Russian in it The song swelled and flowed Yakov was clearly carried
away by enthusiasm he was not timid now he surrendered himself wholly
to the rapture of his art his voice no longer trembled it quivered
but with the scarce perceptible inward quiver of passion which pierces
like an arrow to the very soul of the listeners and he steadily gained
strength and firmness and breadth I remember I once saw at sunset on a
flat sandy shore when the tide was low and the seas roar came weighty
and menacing from the distance a great white seagull it sat
motionless its silky bosom facing the crimson glow of the setting sun
and only now and then opening wide its great wings to greet the
wellknown sea to greet the sinking lurid sun I recalled it as I
heard Yakov He sang utterly forgetful of his rival and all of us he
seemed supported as a bold swimmer by the waves by our silent
passionate sympathy He sang and in every sound of his voice one seemed
to feel something dear and akin to us something of breadth and space
as though the familiar steppes were unfolding before our eyes and
stretching away into endless distance I felt the tears gathering in my
bosom and rising to my eyes suddenly I was struck by dull smothered
sobs I looked roundthe innkeepers wife was weeping her bosom
pressed close to the window Yakov threw a quick glance at her and he
sang more sweetly more melodiously than ever Nikolai Ivanitch looked
down the Blinkard turned away the Gabbler quite touched stood his
gaping mouth stupidly open the humble peasant was sobbing softly in the
corner and shaking his head with a plaintive murmur and on the iron
visage of the Wild Master from under his overhanging brows there slowly
rolled a heavy tear the boothkeeper raised his clenched fist to his
brow and did not stir I dont know how the general emotion would
have ended if Yakov had not suddenly come to a full stop on a high
exceptionally shrill noteas though his voice had broken No one called
out or even stirred every one seemed to be waiting to see whether he
was not going to sing more but he opened his eyes as though wondering
at our silence looked round at all of us with a face of inquiry and
saw that the victory was his

Yasha said the Wild Master laying his hand on his shoulder and he
could say no more

We all stood as it were petrified The boothkeeper softly rose and
went up to Yakov

You yours youve won he articulated at last with an effort
and rushed out of the room His rapid decided action as it were broke
the spell we all suddenly fell into noisy delighted talk The Gabbler
bounded up and down stammered and brandished his arms like millsails
the Blinkard limped up to Yakov and began kissing him Nikolai Ivanitch
got up and solemnly announced that he would add a second pot of beer
from himself The Wild Master laughed a sort of kind simple laugh
which I should never have expected to see on his face the humble
peasant as he wiped his eyes cheeks nose and beard on his sleeves
kept repeating in his corner Ah beautiful it was by God blast me
for the son of a dog but it was fine while Nikolai Ivanitchs wife
her face red with weeping got up quickly and went away Yakov was
enjoying his triumph like a child his whole face was tranformed his
eyes especially fairly glowed with happiness They dragged him to the
bar he beckoned the weeping peasant up to it and sent the innkeepers
little son to look after the boothkeeper who was not found however
and the festivities began Youll sing to us again youre going to
sing to us till evening the Gabbler declared flourishing his hands in
the air

I took one more look at Yakov and went out I did not want to stayI
was afraid of spoiling the impression I had received But the heat was
as insupportable as before It seemed hanging in a thick heavy layer
right over the earth over the dark blue sky tiny bright fires seemed
whisking through the finest almost black dust Everything was still
and there was something hopeless and oppressive in this profound hush of
exhausted nature I made my way to a hayloft and lay down on the
freshcut but already almost dry grass For a long while I could not go
to sleep for a long while Yakovs irresistible voice was ringing in my
ears At last the heat and fatigue regained their sway however and
I fell into a dead sleep When I waked up everything was in darkness
the hay scattered around smelt strong and was slightly damp through the
slender rafters of the halfopen roof pale stars were faintly twinkling
I went out The glow of sunset had long died away and its last trace
showed in a faint light on the horizon but above the freshness of the
night there was still a feeling of heat in the atmosphere lately baked
through by the sun and the breast still craved for a draught of cool
air There was no wind nor were there any clouds the sky all round was
clear and transparently dark softly glimmering with innumerable but
scarcely visible stars There were lights twinkling about the village
from the flaring tavern close by rose a confused discordant din amid
which I fancied I recognised the voice of Yakov Violent laughter came
from there in an outburst at times I went up to the little window and
pressed my face against the pane I saw a cheerless though varied and
animated scene all were drunkall from Yakov upwards With breast
bared he sat on a bench and singing in a thick voice a street song to
a dancetune he lazily fingered and strummed on the strings of a
guitar His moist hair hung in tufts over his fearfully pale face In
the middle of the room the Gabbler completely screwed and without
his coat was hopping about in a dance before the peasant in the grey
smock the peasant on his side was with difficulty stamping and
scraping with his feet and grinning meaninglessly over his dishevelled
beard he waved one hand from time to time as much as to say Here
goes Nothing could be more ludicrous than his face however much he
twitched up his eyebrows his heavy lids would hardly rise but seemed
lying upon his scarcely visible dim and mawkish eyes He was in that
amiable frame of mind of a perfectly intoxicated man when every
passerby directly he looks him in the face is sure to say Bless
you brother bless you The Blinkard as red as a lobster and his
nostrils dilated wide was laughing malignantly in a corner only
Nikolai Ivanitch as befits a good tavernkeeper preserved his
composure unchanged The room was thronged with many new faces but the
Wild Master I did not see in it

I turned away with rapid steps and began descending the hill on which
Kolotovka lies At the foot of this hill stretches a wide plain plunged
in the misty waves of the evening haze it seemed more immense and was
as it were merged in the darkening sky I walked with long strides
along the road by the ravine when all at once from somewhere far away
in the plain came a boys clear voice Antropka Antropkaaa He
shouted in obstinate and tearful desperation with long long drawing
out of the last syllable

He was silent for a few instants and started shouting again His voice
rang out clear in the still lightly slumbering air Thirty times at
least he had called the name Antropka When suddenly from the farthest
end of the plain as though from another world there floated a scarcely
audible reply

Whaat

The boys voice shouted back at once with gleeful exasperation

Come here devil woood imp

What foor replied the other after a long interval

Because dad wants to thrash you the first voice shouted back
hurriedly

The second voice did not call back again and the boy fell to shouting
Antropka once more His cries fainter and less and less frequent still
floated up to my ears when it had grown completely dark and I had
turned the corner of the wood which skirts my village and lies over
three miles from Kolotovka Antropkaaa was still audible in the
air filled with the shadows of night

PIOTR PETROVITCH KARATAEV

One autumn five years ago I chanced when on the road from Moscow to
Tula to spend almost a whole day at a posting station for want of
horses I was on the way back from a shooting expedition and had been
so incautious as to send my three horses on in front of me The man in
charge of the station a surly elderly man with hair hanging over his
brows to his very nose with little sleepy eyes answered all my
complaints and requests with disconnected grumbling slammed the door
angrily as though he were cursing his calling in life and going out on
the steps abused the postilions who were sauntering in a leisurely way
through the mud with the weighty wooden yokes on their arms or sat
yawning and scratching themselves on a bench and paid no special
attention to the wrathful exclamations of their superior I had already
sat myself down three times to tea had several times tried in vain to
sleep and had read all the inscriptions on the walls and windows I was
overpowered by fearful boredom In chill and helpless despair I was
staring at the upturned shafts of my carriage when suddenly I heard the
tinkling of a bell and a small trap drawn by three jaded horses drew
up at the steps The new arrival leaped out of the trap and shouting
Horses and look sharp he went into the room While he was listening
with the strange wonder customary in such cases to the overseers answer
that there were no horses I had time to scan my new companion from top
to toe with all the greedy curiosity of a man bored to death He
appeared to be nearly thirty Smallpox had left indelible traces on his
face which was dry and yellowish with an unpleasant coppery tinge his
long blueblack hair fell in ringlets on his collar behind and was
twisted into jaunty curls in front his small swollen eyes were quite
expressionless a few hairs sprouted on his upper lip He was dressed
like a dissipated country gentleman given to frequenting horsefairs
in a rather greasy striped Caucasian jacket a faded lilac silktie a
waistcoat with copper buttons and grey trousers shaped like huge
funnels from under which the toes of unbrushed shoes could just be
discerned He smelt strongly of tobacco and spirits on his fat red
hands almost hidden in his sleeves could be seen silver and Tula
rings Such figures are met in Russia not by dozens but by hundreds an
acquaintance with them is not to tell the truth productive of any
particular pleasure but in spite of the prejudice with which I looked
at the newcomer I could not fail to notice the recklessly goodnatured
and passionate expression of his face

This gentlemans been waiting more than an hour here too observed the
overseer indicating me

More than an hour The rascal was making fun of me

But perhaps he doesnt need them as I do answered the new comer

I know nothing about that said the overseer sulkily

Then is it really impossible Are there positively no horses

Impossible Theres not a single horse

Well tell them to bring me a samovar Ill wait a little theres
nothing else to be done

The new comer sat down on the bench flung his cap on the table and
passed his hand over his hair

Have you had tea already he inquired of me

Yes

But wont you have a little more for company

I consented The stout red samovar made its appearance for the fourth
time on the table I brought out a bottle of rum I was not wrong in
taking my new acquaintance for a country gentleman of small property
His name was Piotr Petrovitch Karataev

We got into conversation In less than halfanhour after his arrival
he was telling me his whole life with the most simplehearted openness

Im on my way to Moscow now he told me as he sipped his fourth glass
theres nothing for me to do now in the country

How so

Well its come to that My propertys in disorder Ive ruined my
peasants I must confess there have been bad years bad harvests and
all sorts of illluck you know Though indeed he added looking
away dejectedly how could I manage an estate

Whys that

But no he interrupted me there are people like me who make good
managers You see he went on screwing his head on one side and
sucking his pipe assiduously looking at me I dare say you think Im
not much but you see I must confess Ive had a very middling
education I wasnt well off I beg your pardon Im an open man and if
you come to that

He did not complete his sentence but broke off with a wave of the hand
I began to assure him that he was mistaken that I was highly delighted
to meet him and so on and then observed that I should have thought a
very thorough education was not indispensable for the good management of
property

Agreed he responded I agree with you But still a special sort of
dispositions essential There are some may do anything they like and
its all right but I Allow me to ask are you from Petersburg or
from Moscow

Im from Petersburg

He blew a long coil of smoke from his nostrils

And Im going in to Moscow to be an official

What department do you mean to enter

I dont know thats as it happens Ill own to you Im afraid of
official life ones under responsibility at once Ive always lived in
the country Im used to it you know but now theres no help for
it its through poverty Oh poverty how I hate it

But then you will be living in the capital

In the capital Well I dont know what there is thats pleasant in
the capital We shall see may be its pleasant too Though nothing
I fancy could be better than the country

Then is it really impossible for you to live at your country place

He gave a sigh

Quite impossible Its so to say not my own now

Why how so

Well a good fellow therea neighbouris in possession a bill of
exchange

Poor Piotr Petrovitch passed his hand over his face thought a minute
and shook his head

Well I must own though he added after a brief silence I
cant blame anybody its my own fault I was fond of cutting a dash I
am fond of cutting a dash damn my soul

You had a jolly life in the country I asked him

I had sir he responded emphatically looking me straight in the
face twelve harriersharriers I can tell you such as you dont very
often see The last words he uttered in a drawl with great
significance A grey hare theyd double upon in no time After the red
foxthey were devils regular serpents And I could boast of my
greyhounds too Its all a thing of the past now Ive no reason to lie
I used to go out shooting too I had a dog called the Countess a
wonderful setter with a firstrate scentshe took everything
Sometimes Id go to a marsh and call Seek If she refused you might
go with a dozen dogs and youd find nothing But when she was after
anything it was a sight to see her And in the house so wellbred If
you gave her bread with your left hand and said A Jews tasted it
she wouldnt touch it but give it with your right and say The young
ladys had some and shed take it and eat it at once I had a pup of
herscapital pup he was and I meant to bring him with me to Moscow
but a friend asked me for him together with a gun he said In Moscow
youll have other things to think of I gave him the pup and the gun
and so you know it stayed there

But you might go shooting in Moscow

No what would be the use I didnt know when to pull myself up so now
I must grin and bear it

But there kindly tell me rather about the living in Moscowis it
dear

No not very

Not very And tell me please are there any gypsies in Moscow

What sort of gypsies

Why such as hang about fairs

Yes there are in Moscow

Well thats good news I like gypsies damn my soul I like em

And there was a gleam of reckless merriment in Piotr Petrovitchs eyes
But suddenly he turned round on the bench then seemed to ponder
dropped his eyes and held out his empty glass to me

Give me some of your rum he said

But the teas all finished

Never mind as it is without tea Ahh Karataev laid his head in
his hands and leaned his elbows on the table I looked at him without
speaking and although I was expecting the sentimental exclamations
possibly even the tears of which the inebriate are so lavish yet when
he raised his head I was I must own impressed by the profoundly
mournful expression of his face

Whats wrong with you

Nothing I was thinking of old times An anecdote that I would
tell it you but I am ashamed to trouble you

What nonsense

Yes he went on with a sighthere are cases like mine for
instance Well if you like I will tell you Though really I dont
know

Do tell me dear Piotr Petrovitch

Very well though its a Well do you see he began but upon my
word I dont know

Come thats enough dear Piotr Petrovitch

All right This then was what befel me so to say I used to live in
the country All of a sudden I took a fancy to a girl Ah what a
girl she was handsome clever and so good and sweet Her name was
Matrona But she wasnt a ladythat is you understand she was a serf
simply a serfgirl And not my girl she belonged to someone elsethat
was the trouble Well so I loved herits really an incident that one
can hardly well and she loved me too And so Matrona began begging
me to buy her off from her mistress and indeed the thought had
crossed my mind too But her mistress was a rich dreadful old body
she lived about twelve miles from me Well so one fine day as the
saying is I ordered my team of three horses to be harnessed abreast to
the droshkyin the centre Id a firstrate goer an extraordinary
Asiatic horse for that reason called LampurdosI dressed myself in my
best and went off to Matronas mistress I arrived it was a big house
with wings and a garden Matrona was waiting for me at the bend of
the road she tried to say a word to me but she could only kiss her
hand and turn away Well so I went into the hall and asked if the
mistress were at home And a tall footman says to me What name
shall I say I answered Say brother Squire Karataev has called on a
matter of business The footman walked away I waited by myself and
thought I wonder how itll be I daresay the old beastll screw out a
fearful price for all shes so rich Five hundred roubles shell ask I
shouldnt be surprised Well at last the footman returned saying If
you please walk up I followed him into the drawingroom A little
yellowish old woman sat in an armchair blinking What do you want To
begin with you know I thought it necessary to say how glad I was to
make her acquaintance You are making a mistake I am not the
mistress here Im a relation of hers What do you want I remarked
upon that I had to speak to the mistress herself Marya Ilyinishna
is not receiving today she is unwell What do you want Theres
nothing for it I thought to myself so I explained my position to her
The old lady heard me out Matrona what Matrona

Matrona Fedorovna Kuliks daughter

Fedor Kuliks daughter But how did you come to know her By
chance And is she aware of your intention Yes The old lady was
silent for a minute Then Ah Ill let her know it the worthless
hussy she said I was astounded I must confess What ever for upon
my word Im ready to pay a good sum if you will be so good as to
name it

The old hag positively hissed at me A surprising idea youve
concocted there as though we needed your money Ill teach her Ill
show her Ill beat the folly out of her The old lady choked with
spitefulness Wasnt she well off with us pray Ah shes a little
devil God forgive my transgressions I fired up Ill confess What
are you threatening the poor girl for How is she to blame The old
lady crossed herself Ah Lord have mercy on me do you suppose Id
But shes not yours you know Well Marya Ilyinishna knows best
about that its not your business my good sir but Ill show that chit
of a Matrona whose serf she is Ill confess I almost fell on the
damned old woman but I thought of Matrona and my hands dropped I was
more frightened than I can tell you I began entreating the old lady
Take what you like I said But what use is she to you I like her
good maam put yourself in my position Allow me to kiss your little
hand And I positively kissed the wretchs hand Well mumbled the
old witch Ill tell Marya Ilyinishnaits for her to decide you come
back in a couple of days I went home in great uneasiness I began to
suspect that Id managed the thing badly that Id been wrong in
letting her notice my state of mind but I thought of that too late Two
days after I went to see the mistress I was shown into a boudoir
There were heaps of flowers and splendid furniture the lady herself was
sitting in a wonderful easychair with her head lolling back on a
cushion and the same relation was sitting there too and some young
lady with white eyebrows and a mouth all awry in a green gowna
companion most likely The old lady said through her nose Please be
seated I sat down She began questioning me as to how old I was and
where Id been in the service and what I meant to do and all that very
condescendingly and solemnly I answered minutely The old lady took a
handkerchief off the table flourished it fanning herself Katerina
Karpovna informed me says she of your scheme she informed me of it
but I make it my rule says she not to allow my people to leave my
service It is improper and quite unsuitable in a wellordered house
it is not good order I have already given my orders says she There
will be no need for you to trouble yourself further says she Oh no
trouble really But can it be Matrona Fedorovna is so necessary to
you No says she she is not necessary Then why wont you part
with her to me Because I dont choose to I dont chooseand thats
all about it Ive already says she given my orders she is being
sent to a village in the steppes I was thunderstruck The old lady
said a couple of words in French to the young lady in green she went
out I am says she a woman of strict principles and my health is
delicate I cant stand being worried You are still young and Im an
old woman and entitled to give you advice Wouldnt it be better for
you to settle down get married to look out a good match wealthy
brides are few but a poor girl of the highest moral character could
be found I stared do you know at the old lady and didnt understand
what she was driving at I could hear she was talking about marriage
but the village in the steppes was ringing in my ears all the while Get
married what the devil

Here he suddenly stopped in his story and looked at me

Youre not married I suppose

No

There of course I could see it I couldnt stand it But upon my
word maam what on earth are you talking about How does marriage come
in I simply want to know from you whether you will part with your
serfgirl Matrona or not The old lady began sighing and groaning Ah
hes worrying me ah send him away ah The relation flew to her and
began scolding me while the lady kept on moaning What have I done to
deserve it I suppose Im not mistress in my own house Ah ah I
snatched my hat and ran out of the house like a madman

Perhaps he continued you will blame me for being so warmly attached
to a girl of low position I dont mean to justify myself exactly
either but so it came to pass Would you believe it I had no
rest by day or by night I was in torment Besides I thought I
have ruined the poor girl At times I thought that she was herding
geese in a smock and being illtreated by her mistresss orders and
the bailiff a peasant in tarred boots reviling her with foul abuse I
positively fell into a cold sweat Well I could not stand it I found
out what village she had been sent to mounted my horse and set off I
only got there the evening of the next day Evidently they hadnt
expected such a proceeding on my part and had given no order in regard
to me I went straight to the bailiff as though I were a neighbour I go
into the yard and look around there was Matrona sitting on the steps
leaning on her elbow She was on the point of crying out but I held up
my finger and pointed outside towards the open country I went into the
hut I chatted away a bit to the bailiff told him ten thousand lies
seized the right moment and went out to Matrona She poor girl fairly
hung round my neck She was pale and thin my poor darling I kept
saying to her do you know There its all right Matrona its all
right dont cry and my own tears simply flowed and flowed Well
at last though I was ashamed I said to her Matrona tears are no
help in trouble but we must act as they say resolutely you must run
away with me thats how we must act Matrona fairly swooned away
How can it be I shall be ruined they will be the death of me
altogether You silly who will find you They will find me they
will be sure to find me Thank you Piotr PetrovitchI shall never
forget your kindness but now you must leave me such is my fate it
seems Ah Matrona Matrona I thought you were a girl of character
And indeed she had a great deal of character She had a heart a
heart of gold Why should you be left here It makes no difference
things cant be worse Come tell meyouve felt the bailiffs fists
eh Matrona fairly crimsoned and her lips trembled But therell be
no living for my family on my account Why your family nowwill they
send them for soldiers Yes theyll send my brother for a soldier
And your father Oh they wont send father hes the only good
tailor among us

There you see and it wont kill your brother Would you believe it
Id hard work to persuade her she even brought forward a notion that I
might have to answer for it But thats not your affair said I
However I did carry her off not that time but another one night I
came with a light cart and carried her off

You carried her off

Yes Well so she lived in my house It was a little house and Id
few servants My people I will tell you frankly respected me they
wouldnt have betrayed me for any reward I began to be as happy as a
prince Matrona rested and recovered and I grew devoted to her
And what a girl she was It seemed to come by nature She could sing
and dance and play the guitar I didnt show her to my neighbours
I was afraid theyd gossip But there was one fellow my bosom friend
Gornostaev Panteleyyou dont know him He was simply crazy about her
hed kiss her hand as though she were a lady he would really And I
must tell you Gornostaev was not like me he was a cultivated man
had read all Pushkin sometimes hed talk to Matrona and me so that
we pricked up our ears to listen He taught her to write such a queer
chap he was And how I dressed herbetter than the governors wife
really I had a pelisse made her of crimson velvet edged with fur
Ah how that pelisse suited her It was made by a Moscow madame in a
new fashion with a waist And what a wonderful creature Matrona was
Sometimes shed fall to musing and sit for hours together looking at
the ground without stirring a muscle and Id sit too and look at her
and could never gaze enough just as if I were seeing her for the first
time Then she would smile and my heart would give a jump as though
someone were tickling me Or else shed suddenly fall to laughing
joking dancing she would embrace me so warmly so passionately that
my head went round From morning to evening I thought of nothing but
how I could please her And would you believe it I gave her presents
simply to see how pleased she would be the darling all blushing with
delight How she would try on my present how she would come back with
her new possession on and kiss me Her father Kulik got wind of it
somehow the old man came to see us and how he wept In that way
we lived for five months and I should have been glad to live with her
for ever but for my cursed illluck

Piotr Petrovitch stopped

What was it happened I asked him sympathetically He waved his hand

Everything went to the devil I was the ruin of her too My little
Matrona was passionately fond of driving in sledges and she used to
drive herself she used to put on her pelisse and her embroidered
Torzhok gloves and cry out with delight all the way We used to go out
sledging always in the evening so as not to meet any one you know So
once it was such a splendid day you know frosty and clear and no wind
we drove out Matrona had the reins I looked where she was driving
Could it be to Kukuyevka her mistresss village Yes it was to
Kukuyevka I said to her You mad girl where are you going She gave
me a look over her shoulder and laughed Let me she said for a
lark Well thought I come what may To drive past her
mistresss house was nice wasnt it Tell me yourselfwasnt it nice
So we drove on The shafthorse seemed to float through the air and the
tracehorses went I can tell you like a regular whirlwind We were
already in sight of Kukuyevka when suddenly I see an old green coach
crawling along with a groom on the footboard up behind It was the
mistressthe mistress driving towards us My heart failed me but
Matronahow she lashed the horses with the reins and flew straight
towards the coach The coachman he you understand sees us flying to
meet him meant you know to move on one side turned too sharp and
upset the coach in a snowdrift The window was broken the mistress
shrieked Ai ai ai ai ai ai The companion wailed Help help
while we flew by at the best speed we might We galloped on but I
thought Evil will come of it I did wrong to let her drive to
Kukuyevka And what do you think Why the mistress had recognised
Matrona and me too the old wretch and made a complaint against me
My runaway serfgirl said she is living at Mr Karataevs and
thereupon she made a suitable present Lo and behold the captain of
police comes to me and he was a man I knew Stepan Sergyeitch Kuzovkin
a good fellow thats to say really a regular bad lot So he came up
and said this and that and How could you do so Piotr Petrovitch
The liability is serious and the laws very distinct on the subject I
tell him Well well have a talk about that of course but come
youll take a little something after your drive He agreed to take
something but he said Justice has claims Piotr Petrovitch think for
yourself Justice to be sure said I of course but I have
heard say youve a little black horse Would you be willing to exchange
it for my Lampurdos But theres no girl called Matrona Fedorovna in
my keeping Come says he Piotr Petrovitch the girls with you
were not living in Switzerland you know though my little horse
might be exchanged for Lampurdos I might to be sure accept it in that
way However I managed to get rid of him somehow that time But the
old lady made a greater fuss than ever ten thousand roubles she said
she wouldnt grudge over the business You see when she saw me she
suddenly took an idea into her head to marry me to her young lady
companion in green that I found out later that was why she was so
spiteful What ideas wont these great ladies take into their heads
It comes through being dull I suppose Things went badly with me I
didnt spare money and I kept Matrona in hiding No they harassed me
and turned me this way and that I got into debt I lost my health
So one night as I lay in my bed thinking My God why should I suffer
so What am I to do since I cant get over loving her There I
cant and thats all about it into the room walked Matrona I had
hidden her for the time at a farmhouse a mile and a half from my house
I was frightened What have they discovered you even there No
Piotr Petrovitch said she no one disturbs me at Bubnova but will
that last long My heart she said is torn Piotr Petrovitch I am
sorry for you my dear one never shall I forget your goodness Piotr
Petrovitch but now Ive come to say goodbye to you What do you
mean what do you mean you mad girl Goodbye how goodbye
Yes I am going to give myself up But Ill lock you up in a
garret mad girl Do you mean to destroy me Do you want to kill me
or what The girl was silent she looked on the floor Come speak
speak I cant bear to cause you any more trouble Piotr Petrovitch
Well one might talk to her as one pleased But do you know little
fool do you know mad

And Piotr Petrovitch sobbed bitterly

Well what do you think he went on striking the table with his fist
and trying to frown while the tears still coursed down his flushed
cheeks the girl gave herself up She went and gave herself up

The horses are ready the overseer cried triumphantly entering the
room

We both stood up

What became of Matrona I asked

Karataev waved his hand

                                   

A year after my meeting with Karataev I happened to go to Moscow One
day before dinner for some reason or other I went into a caf
in the Ohotny rowan original Moscow caf In the billiardroom
across clouds of smoke I caught glimpses of flushed faces whiskers
oldfashioned Hungarian coats and newfangled Slavonic costumes

Thin little old men in sober surtouts were reading the Russian papers
The waiters flitted airily about with trays treading softly on the
green carpets Merchants with painful concentration were drinking tea
Suddenly a man came out of the billiardroom rather dishevelled and
not quite steady on his legs He put his hands in his pockets bent his
head and looked aimlessly about

Ba ba ba Piotr Petrovitch How are you

Piotr Petrovitch almost fell on my neck and slightly staggering drew
me into a small private room

Come here he said carefully seating me in an easychair here you
will be comfortable Waiter beer No I mean champagne There Ill
confess I didnt expect I didnt expect Have you been here long
Are you staying much longer Well God has brought us as they say
together

Yes do you remember

To be sure I remember to be sure I remember he interrupted me
hurriedly its a thing of the past

Well what are you doing here my dear Piotr Petrovitch

Im living as you can see Lifes firstrate here theyre a merry lot
here Here Ive found peace

And he sighed and raised his eyes towards heaven

Are you in the service

No Im not in the service yet but I think I shall enter But whats
the service People are the chief thing What people I have got to
know here

A boy came in with a bottle of champagne on a black tray

There and this is a good fellow Isnt that true Vasya that
youre a good fellow To your health

The boy stood a minute shook his head decorously smiled and went out

Yes there are capital people here pursued Piotr Petrovitch people
of soul of feeling Would you like me to introduce yousuch jolly
chaps Theyll all be glad to know you I say Bobrov is dead
thats a sad thing

What Bobrov

Sergay Bobrov he was a capital fellow he took me under his wing as an
ignoramus from the wilds And Panteley Gornostaev is dead All dead
all

Have you been living all the time in Moscow You havent been away to
the country

To the country My country place is sold

Sold

By auction There what a pity you didnt buy it

What are you going to live on Piotr Petrovitch

I shant die of hunger God will provide when Ive no money I shall
have friends And what is money Dust and ashes Gold is dust

He shut his eyes felt in his pocket and held out to me in the palm of
his hand two sixpences and a penny

Whats that Isnt it dust and ashes and the money flew on the
floor But you had better tell me have you read Polezhaev

Yes

Have you seen Motchalov in Hamlet

No I havent

Youve not seen him not seen him And Karataevs face turned
pale his eyes strayed uneasily he turned away a faint spasm passed
over his lips Ah Motchalov Motchalov To dieto sleep he said
in a thick voice

  No more and by a sleep to say we end
   The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
   That flesh is heir to tis a consummation
   Devoutly to be wished To dieto sleep


To sleepto sleep he muttered several times

Tell me please I began but he went on with fire

  Who would bear the whips and scorns of time
   The oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely
   The insolence of office and the spurns
   That patient merit of the unworthy takes
   When he himself might his quietus make
   With a bare bodkin Nymph in thy orisons
   Be all my sins remembered


And he dropped his head on the table He began stammering and talking at
random Within a month he delivered with fresh fire

  A little month or ere those shoes were old
   With which she followed my poor fathers body
   Like Niobeall tears why she even she
   O God a beast that wants discourse of reason
   Would have mourned longer


He raised a glass of champagne to his lips but did not drink off the
wine and went on

  For Hecuba
  Whats Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba
  That he should weep for her
  But Im a dull and muddy mettledrascal
  Who calls me coward gives me the lie i the throat
   Why I should take it for it cannot be
  But I am pigeonlivered and lack gall
  To make oppression bitter


Karataev put down the glass and grabbed at his head I fancied I
understood him

Well well he said at last one must not rake up the past Isnt
that so and he laughed To your health

Shall you stay in Moscow I asked him

I shall die in Moscow

Karataev called a voice in the next room Karataev where are you
Come here my dear fellow

Theyre calling me he said getting up heavily from his seat
Goodbye come and see me if you can I live in

But next day through unforeseen circumstances I was obliged to leave
Moscow and I never saw Piotr Petrovitch Karataev again

THE TRYST

I was sitting in a birchwood in autumn about the middle of September
From early morning a fine rain had been falling with intervals from
time to time of warm sunshine the weather was unsettled The sky was at
one time overcast with soft white clouds at another it suddenly cleared
in parts for an instant and then behind the parting clouds could be
seen a blue bright and tender as a beautiful eye I sat looking about
and listening The leaves faintly rustled over my head from the sound
of them alone one could tell what time of year it was It was not the
gay laughing tremor of the spring nor the subdued whispering the
prolonged gossip of the summer nor the chill and timid faltering of
late autumn but a scarcely audible drowsy chatter A slight breeze was
faintly humming in the treetops Wet with the rain the copse in its
inmost recesses was for ever changing as the sun shone or hid behind a
cloud at one moment it was all a radiance as though suddenly
everything were smiling in it the slender stems of the thinlygrowing
birchtrees took all at once the soft lustre of white silk the tiny
leaves lying on the earth were on a sudden flecked and flaring with
purplish gold and the graceful stalks of the high curly bracken
decked already in their autumn colour the hue of an overripe grape
seemed interlacing in endless tangling crisscross before ones eyes
then suddenly again everything around was faintly bluish the glaring
tints died away instantaneously the birchtrees stood all white and
lustreless white as freshfallen snow before the cold rays of the
winter sun have caressed it and slily stealthily there began drizzling
and whispering through the wood the finest rain The leaves on the
birches were still almost all green though perceptibly paler only here
and there stood one young leaf all red or golden and it was a sight to
see how it flamed in the sunshine when the sunbeams suddenly pierced
with tangled flecks of light through the thick network of delicate
twigs freshly washed by the sparkling rain Not one bird could be
heard all were in hiding and silent except that at times there rang
out the metallic belllike sound of the jeering tomtit Before halting
in this birch copse I had been through a wood of tall aspentrees with
my dog I confess I have no great liking for that tree the aspen with
its palelilac trunk and the greyishgreen metallic leaves which it
flings high as it can and unfolds in a quivering fan in the air I do
not care for the eternal shaking of its round slovenly leaves
awkwardly hooked on to long stalks It is only fine on some summer
evenings when rising singly above low undergrowth it faces the
reddening beams of the setting sun and shines and quivers bathed from
root to top in one unbroken yellow glow or when on a clear windy day
it is all rippling rustling and whispering to the blue sky and every
leaf is as it were taken by a longing to break away to fly off and
soar into the distance But as a rule I dont care for the tree and
so not stopping to rest in the aspen wood I made my way to the
birchcopse nestled down under one tree whose branches started low down
near the ground and were consequently capable of shielding me from the
rain and after admiring the surrounding view a little I fell into that
sweet untroubled sleep only known to sportsmen

I cannot say how long I was asleep but when I opened my eyes all the
depths of the wood were filled with sunlight and in all directions
across the joyously rustling leaves there were glimpses and as it were
flashes of intense blue sky the clouds had vanished driven away by the
blustering wind the weather had changed to fair and there was that
feeling of peculiar dry freshness in the air which fills the heart with
a sense of boldness and is almost always a sure sign of a still bright
evening after a rainy day I was just about to get up and try my luck
again when suddenly my eyes fell on a motionless human figure I looked
attentively it was a young peasant girl She was sitting twenty paces
off her head bent in thought and her hands lying in her lap one of
them halfopen held a big nosegay of wild flowers which softly
stirred on her checked petticoat with every breath Her clean white
smock buttoned up at the throat and wrists lay in short soft folds
about her figure two rows of big yellow beads fell from her neck to her
bosom She was very pretty Her thick fair hair of a lovely almost
ashen hue was parted into two carefully combed semicircles under the
narrow crimson fillet which was brought down almost on to her forehead
white as ivory the rest of her face was faintly tanned that golden hue
which is only taken by a delicate skin I could not see her eyesshe
did not raise them but I saw her delicate high eyebrows her long
lashes they were wet and on one of her cheeks there shone in the sun
the traces of quickly drying tears reaching right down to her rather
pale lips Her little head was very charming altogether even her rather
thick and snub nose did not spoil her I was especially taken with the
expression of her face it was so simple and gentle so sad and so full
of childish wonder at its own sadness She was obviously waiting for
some one something made a faint crackling in the wood she raised her
head at once and looked round in the transparent shade I caught a
rapid glimpse of her eyes large clear and timorous like a fawns
For a few instants she listened not moving her wide open eyes from the
spot whence the faint sound had come she sighed turned her head
slowly bent still lower and began sorting her flowers Her eyelids
turned red her lips twitched faintly and a fresh tear rolled from
under her thick eyelashes and stood brightly shining on her cheek
Rather a long while passed thus the poor girl did not stir except for
a despairing movement of her hands now and thenand she kept listening
listening Again there was a crackling sound in the wood she
started The sound did not cease grew more distinct and came closer
at last one could hear quick resolute footsteps She drew herself up and
seemed frightened her intent gaze was all aquiver all aglow with
expectation Through the thicket quickly appeared the figure of a man
She gazed at it suddenly flushed gave a radiant blissful smile tried
to rise and sank back again at once turned white and confused and
only raised her quivering almost supplicating eyes to the man
approaching when the latter stood still beside her

I looked at him with curiosity from my ambush I confess he did not make
an agreeable impression on me He was to judge by external signs the
pampered valet of some rich young gentleman His attire betrayed
pretensions to style and fashionable carelessness he wore a shortish
coat of a bronze colour doubtless from his masters wardrobe buttoned
up to the top a pink cravat with lilac ends and a black velvet cap
with a gold ribbon pulled forward right on to his eyebrows The
round collar of his white shirt mercilessly propped up his ears and
cut his cheeks and his starched cuffs hid his whole hand to the red
crooked fingers adorned by gold and silver rings with turquoise
forgetmenots His red fresh impudentlooking face belonged to the
order of faces which as far as I have observed are almost always
repulsive to men and unfortunately are very often attractive to women
He was obviously trying to give a scornful and bored expression to his
coarse features he was incessantly screwing up his milky grey
eyessmall enough at all times he scowled dropped the corners of his
mouth affected to yawn and with careless though not perfectly natural
nonchalance pushed back his modishly curled red locks or pinched the
yellow hairs sprouting on his thick upper lipin fact he gave himself
insufferable airs He began his antics directly he caught sight of the
young peasant girl waiting for him slowly with a swaggering step he
went up to her stood a moment shrugging his shoulders stuffed both
hands in his coat pockets and barely vouchsafing the poor girl a
cursory and indifferent glance he dropped on to the ground

Well he began still gazing away swinging his leg and yawning have
you been here long

The girl could not at once answer

Yes a long while Viktor Alexandritch she said at last in a voice
hardly audible

Ah He took off his cap majestically passed his hand over his thick
stiffly curled hair which grew almost down to his eyebrows and looking
round him with dignity he carelessly covered his precious head again
And I quite forgot all about it Besides it rained He yawned
again Lots to do theres no looking after everything and hes
always scolding We set off tomorrow

Tomorrow uttered the young girl And she fastened her startled eyes
upon him

Yes tomorrow Come come come please he added in a tone of
vexation seeing she was shaking all over and softly bending her head
please Akulina dont cry You know I cant stand that And he
wrinkled up his snub nose Else Ill go away at once What
sillinesssnivelling

There I wont I wont cried Akulina hurriedly gulping down her
tears with an effort You are starting tomorrow she added after a
brief silence when will God grant that we see each other again Viktor
Alexandritch

We shall see each other we shall see each other If not next
yearthen later The master wants to enter the service in Petersburg I
fancy he went on pronouncing his words with careless condescension
through his nose and perhaps we shall go abroad too

You will forget me Viktor Alexandritch said Akulina mournfully

No why so I wont forget you only you be sensible dont be a fool
obey your father And I wont forget younoo And he placidly
stretched and yawned again

Dont forget me Viktor Alexandritch she went on in a supplicating
voice I think none could love you as I do I have given you
everything You tell me to obey my father Viktor Alexandritch
But how can I obey my father

Why not He uttered these words as it were from his stomach lying
on his back with his hands behind his head

But how can I Viktor Alexandritchyou know yourself

She broke off Viktor played with his steel watchchain

Youre not a fool Akulina he said at last so dont talk nonsense
I desire your gooddo you understand me To be sure youre not a
foolnot altogether a mere rustic so to say and your mother too
wasnt always a peasant Still youve no educationso you ought to do
what youre told

But its fearful Viktor Alexandritch

Ooh thats nonsense my dear a queer thing to be afraid of What
have you got there he added moving closer to her flowers

Yes Akulina responded dejectedly Thats some wild tansy I picked
she went on brightening up a little its good for calves And this is
budmarigoldagainst the kings evil Look what an exquisite flower
Ive never seen such a lovely flower before These are forgetmenots
and thats motherdarling And these I picked for you she added
taking from under a yellow tansy a small bunch of blue cornflowers
tied up with a thin blade of grass Do you like them

Viktor languidly held out his hand took the flowers carelessly sniffed
at them and began twirling them in his fingers looking upwards
Akulina watched him In her mournful eyes there was such tender
devotion adoring submission and love She was afraid of him and did
not dare to cry and was saying goodbye to him and admiring him for the
last time while he lay lolling like a sultan and with magnanimous
patience and condescension put up with her adoration I must own I
glared indignantly at his red face on which under the affectation of
scornful indifference one could discern vanity soothed and satisfied
Akulina was so sweet at that instant her whole soul was confidingly and
passionately laid bare before him full of longing and caressing
tenderness while he he dropped the cornflowers on the grass
pulled out of the side pocket of his coat a round eyeglass set in a
brass rim and began sticking it in his eye but however much he tried
to hold it with his frowning eyebrow his pursedup cheek and nose the
eyeglass kept tumbling out and falling into his hand

What is it Akulina asked at last in wonder

An eyeglass he answered with dignity

What for

Why to see better

Show me

Viktor scowled but gave her the glass

Dont break it look out

No fear I wont break it She put it to her eye I see nothing
she said innocently

But you must shut your eye he retorted in the tones of a displeased
teacher She shut the eye before which she held the glass

Not that one not that one you fool the other cried Viktor and he
took away his eyeglass without allowing her to correct her mistake

Akulina flushed a little gave a faint laugh and turned away

Its clear its not for the likes of us she said

I should think not indeed

The poor girl was silent and gave a deep sigh

Ah Viktor Alexandritch what it will be like for me to be without
you she said suddenly

Victor rubbed the glass on the lappet of his coat and put it back in his
pocket

Yes yeshe said at last at first it will be hard for you
certainly He patted her condescendingly on the shoulder she softly
took his hand from her shoulder and timidly kissed it There there
youre a good girl certainly he went on with a complacent smile
but whats to be done You can see for yourself me and the master
could never stay on here it will soon be winter now and winter in the
countryyou know yourselfis simply disgusting Its quite another
thing in Petersburg There there are simply such wonders as a silly girl
like you could never fancy in your dreams Such horses and streets and
society and civilisationsimply marvellous Akulina listened with
devouring attention her lips slightly parted like a child But
whats the use he added turning over on the ground of my telling
you all this Of course you cant understand it

Why so Viktor Alexandritch I understand I understood everything

My eye what a girl it is

Akulina looked down

You used not to talk to me like that once Viktor Alexandritch she
said not lifting her eyes

Once once My goodness he remarked as though in indignation

They both were silent

Its time I was going said Viktor and he was already rising on to
his elbow

Wait a little longer Akulina besought him in a supplicating voice

What for Why Ive said goodbye to you

Wait a little repeated Akulina

Viktor lay down again and began whistling Akulina never took her eyes
off him I could see that she was gradually being overcome by emotion
her lips twitched her pale cheeks faintly glowed

Viktor Alexandritch she began at last in a broken voice its too
bad of you it is too bad of you Viktor Alexandritch indeed it is

Whats too bad he asked frowning and he slightly raised his head and
turned it towards her

Its too bad Viktor Alexandritch You might at least say one kind word
to me at parting you might have said one little word to me a poor
luckless forlorn

But what am I to say to you

I dont know you know that best Viktor Alexandritch Here you are
going away and one little word What have I done to deserve it

Youre such a queer creature What can I do

One word at least

There she keeps on at the same thing he commented with annoyance
and he got up

Dont be angry Viktor Alexandritch she added hurriedly with
difficulty suppressing her tears

Im not angry only youre silly What do you want You know I cant
marry you can I I cant can I What is it you want then eh He
thrust his face forward as though expecting an answer and spread his
fingers out

I want nothing nothing she answered falteringly and she ventured
to hold out her trembling hands to him but only a word at parting

And her tears fell in a torrent

There that means shes gone off into crying said Viktor coolly
pushing down his cap on to his eyes

I want nothing she went on sobbing and covering her face with her
hands but what is there before me in my family what is there before
me what will happen to me what will become of me poor wretch They
will marry me to a hateful poor forsaken Poor me

Sing away sing away muttered Viktor in an undertone fidgeting with
impatience as he stood

And he might say one word one word He might say Akulina I

Sudden heartbreaking sobs prevented her from finishing she lay with
her face in the grass and bitterly bitterly she wept Her whole body
shook convulsively her neck fairly heaved Her longsuppressed grief
broke out in a torrent at last Viktor stood over her stood a moment
shrugged his shoulders turned away and strode off

A few instants passed she grew calmer raised her head jumped up
looked round and wrung her hands she tried to run after him but her
legs gave way under hershe fell on her knees I could not refrain
from rushing up to her but almost before she had time to look at me
making a superhuman effort she got up with a faint shriek and vanished
behind the trees leaving her flowers scattered on the ground

I stood a minute picked up the bunch of cornflowers and went out of
the wood into the open country The sun had sunk low in the pale clear
sky its rays too seemed to have grown pale and chill they did not
shine they were diffused in an unbroken watery light It was within
halfanhour of sunset but there was scarcely any of the glow of
evening A gusty wind scurried to meet me across the yellow parched
stubble little curledup leaves scudding hurriedly before it flew by
across the road along the edge of the copse the side of the copse
facing the fields like a wall was all shaking and lighted up by tiny
gleams distinct but not glowing on the reddish plants the blades of
grass the straws on all sides were sparkling and stirring innumerable
threads of autumn spiderwebs I stopped I felt sad at heart under
the bright but chill smile of fading nature the dismal dread of coming
winter seemed to steal upon me High overhead flew a cautious crow
heavily and sharply cleaving the air with his wings he turned his head
looked sideways at me flapped his wings and cawing abruptly vanished
behind the wood a great flock of pigeons flew up playfully from a
threshing floor and suddenly eddying round in a column scattered
busily about the country Sure sign of autumn Some one came driving
over the bare hillside his empty cart rattling loudly

I turned homewards but it was long before the figure of poor Akulina
faded out of my mind and her cornflowers long since withered are
still in my keeping

THE HAMLET OF THE SHTCHIGRI DISTRICT

On one of my excursions I received an invitation to dine at the house of
a rich landowner and sportsman Alexandr Mihalitch G His property
was four miles from the small village where I was staying at the time I
put on a frockcoat an article without which I advise no one to travel
even on a hunting expedition and betook myself to Alexandr Mihalitchs
The dinner was fixed for six oclock I arrived at five and found
already a great number of gentlemen in uniforms in civilian dress and
other nondescript garments My host met me cordially but soon hurried
away to the butlers pantry He was expecting a great dignitary and was
in a state of agitation not quite in keeping with his independent
position in society and his wealth Alexandr Mihalitch had never
married and did not care for women his house was the centre of a
bachelor society He lived in grand style he had enlarged and
sumptuously redecorated his ancestral mansion spent fifteen thousand
roubles on wine from Moscow every year and enjoyed the highest public
consideration Alexandr Mihalitch had retired from the service ages ago
and had no ambition to gain official honours of any kind What could
have induced him to go out of his way to procure a guest of high
official position and to be in a state of excitement from early morning
on the day of the grand dinner That remains buried in the obscurity of
the unknown as a friend of mine an attorney is in the habit of saying
when he is asked whether he takes bribes when kindlydisposed persons
offer them

On parting from my host I began walking through the rooms Almost all
the guests were utterly unknown to me about twenty persons were already
seated at the cardtables Among these devotees of preference were two
warriors with aristocratic but rather battered countenances a few
civilian officials with tight high cravats and drooping dyed
moustaches such as are only to be found in persons of resolute
character and strict conservative opinions these conservative persons
picked up their cards with dignity and without turning their heads
glared sideways at everyone who approached and five or six local petty
officials with fair round bellies fat moist little hands and staid
immovable little legs These worthies spoke in a subdued voice smiled
benignly in all directions held their cards close up to their very
shirtfronts and when they trumped did not flap their cards on the
table but on the contrary shed them with an undulatory motion on the
green cloth and packed their tricks together with a slight unassuming
and decorous swish The rest of the company were sitting on sofas or
hanging in groups about the doors or at the windows one gentleman no
longer young though of feminine appearance stood in a corner
fidgeting blushing and twisting the seal of his watch over his stomach
in his embarrassment though no one was paying any attention to him
some others in swallowtail coats and checked trousers the handiwork of
the tailor and Perpetual Master of the Tailors Corporation Firs
Klyuhin were talking together with extraordinary ease and liveliness
turning their bald greasy heads from side to side unconstrainedly as
they talked a young man of twenty shortsighted and fairhaired
dressed from head to foot in black obviously shy smiled
sarcastically

I was beginning however to feel bored when suddenly I was joined by a
young man one Voinitsin by name a student without a degree who
resided in the house of Alexandr Mihalitch in the capacity ofit
would be hard to say precisely of what He was a firstrate shot and
could train dogs I had known him before in Moscow He was one of those
young men who at every examination played at dumbshow that is to
say did not answer a single word to the professors questions Such
persons were also designated the bearded students You will gather
that this was in long past days This was how it used to be they would
call Voinitsin for example Voinitsin who had sat upright and
motionless in his place bathed in a hot perspiration from head to foot
slowly and aimlessly looked about him got up hurriedly buttoned up his
undergraduates uniform and edged up to the examiners table Take a
paper please the professor would say to him pleasantly Voinitsin
would stretch out his hand and with trembling fingers fumble at the
pile of papers No selecting if you please observed in a jarring
voice an assistantexaminer an irritable old gentleman a professor in
some other faculty conceiving a sudden hatred for the unlucky bearded
one Voinitsin resigned himself to his fate took a paper showed the
number on it and went and sat down by the window while his predecessor
was answering his question At the window Voinitsin never took his eyes
off his paper except that at times he looked slowly round as before
though he did not move a muscle But his predecessor would finish at
last and would be dismissed with Good you can go or even Good
indeed very good according to his abilities Then they call
Voinitsin Voinitsin gets up and with resolute step approaches the
table Read your question they tell him Voinitsin raises the paper
in both hands up to his very nose slowly reads it and slowly drops his
hands Well now your answer please the same professor remarks
languidly throwing himself backwards and crossing his arms over his
breast

There reigns the silence of the tomb Why are you silent Voinitsin is
mute The assistantexaminer begins to be restive Well say
something Voinitsin is as still as if he were dead All his companions
gaze inquisitively at the back of his thick closecropped motionless
head The assistantexaminers eyes are almost starting out of his head
he positively hates Voinitsin Well this is strange really observes
the other examiner Why do you stand as if you were dumb Come dont
you know it if so say so Let me take another question the
luckless youth articulates thickly The professors look at one another
Well take one the headexaminer answers with a wave of the hand
Voinitsin again takes a paper again goes to the window again returns
to the table and again is silent as the grave The assistantexaminer
is capable of devouring him alive At last they send him away and mark
him a nought You would think Now at least he will go Not a bit of
it He goes back to his place sits just as immovably to the end of the
examination and as he goes out exclaims Ive been on the rack what
illluck and the whole of that day he wanders about Moscow clutching
every now and then at his head and bitterly cursing his luckless fate
He never of course touched a book and the next day the same story was
repeated

So this was the Voinitsin who joined me We talked about Moscow about
sport

Would you like me he whispered to me suddenly to introduce you to
the first wit of these parts

If you will be so kind

Voinitsin led me up to a little man with a high tuft of hair on his
forehead and moustaches in a cinnamoncoloured frockcoat and striped
cravat His yellow mobile features were certainly full of cleverness
and sarcasm His lips were perpetually curved in a flitting ironical
smile little black eyes screwed up with an impudent expression looked
out from under uneven lashes Beside him stood a country gentleman
broad soft and sweeta veritable sugarandhoney mixturewith one
eye He laughed in anticipation at the witticisms of the little man and
seemed positively melting with delight Voinitsin presented me to the
wit whose name was Piotr Petrovitch Lupihin We were introduced and
exchanged the preliminary civilities

Allow me to present to you my best friend said Lupihin suddenly in a
strident voice seizing the sugary gentleman by the arm

Come dont resist Kirila Selifanitch he added were not going to
bite you I commend him to you he went on while the embarrassed
Kirila Selifanitch bowed with about as much grace as if he were
undergoing a surgical operation hes a most superior gentleman He
enjoyed excellent health up to the age of fifty then suddenly conceived
the idea of doctoring his eyes in consequence of which he has lost one
Since then he doctors his peasants with similar success They to be
sure repay with similar devotion

What a fellow it is muttered Kirila Selifanitch And he laughed

Speak out my friend eh speak out Lupihin rejoined Why they may
elect you a judge I shouldnt wonder and they will too you see
Well to be sure the secretaries will do the thinking for you we may
assume but you know youll have to be able to speak anyhow even if
only to express the ideas of others Suppose the governor comes and
asks Why is it the judge stammers And theyd say lets assume
Its a paralytic stroke Then bleed him hed say And it would be
highly indecorous in your position youll admit

The sugary gentleman was positively rolling with mirth

You see he laughs Lupihin pursued with a malignant glance at Kirila
Selifanitchs heaving stomach And why shouldnt he laugh he added
turning to me he has enough to eat good health and no children his
peasants arent mortgagedto be sure he doctors themand his wife is
cracked Kirila Selifanitch turned a little away as though he were not
listening but he still continued to chuckle I laugh too while my
wife has eloped with a landsurveyor He grinned Didnt you know
that What Why one fine day she ran away with him and left me a
letter

Dear Piotr Petrovitch she said forgive me carried away by passion
I am leaving with the friend of my heart And the landsurveyor only
took her fancy through not cutting his nails and wearing tight trousers
Youre surprised at that Why this she said is a man with no
dissimulation about him But mercy on us Rustic fellows like us
speak the truth too plainly But let us move away a bit Its not for
us to stand beside a future judge

He took me by the arm and we moved away to a window

Ive the reputation of a wit here he said to me in the course of
conversation You need not believe that Im simply an embittered man
and I do my railing aloud thats how it is Im so free and easy in my
speech And why should I mince matters if you come to that I dont
care a straw for anyones opinion and Ive nothing to gain Im
spitefulwhat of that A spiteful man at least needs no wit And
however enlightening it may be you wont believe it I say now I
say look at our host There what is he running to and fro like that
for Upon my word he keeps looking at his watch smiling perspiring
putting on a solemn face keeping us all starving for our dinner Such a
prodigy a real court grandee Look look hes running againbounding
positively look

And Lupihin laughed shrilly

The only pity is there are no ladies he resumed with a deep sigh
its a bachelor party else thats when your humble servant gets on
Look look he cried suddenly Prince Kozelskys comethat tall man
there with a beard in yellow gloves You can see at once hes been
abroad and he always arrives as late Hes as heavy I tell you by
himself as a pair of merchants horses and you should see how
condescendingly he talks with your humble servant how graciously he
deigns to smile at the civilities of our starving mothers and
daughters And he sometimes sets up for a wit but he is only here
for a little time and oh his witticisms Its for all the world like
hacking at a ships cable with a blunt knife He cant bear me Im
going to bow to him

And Lupihin ran off to meet the prince

And here comes my special enemy he observed turning all at once to
me Do you see that fat man with the brown face and the bristles on his
head over there thats got his cap clutched in his hand and is
creeping along by the wall and glaring in all directions like a wolf I
sold him for  roubles a horse worth  and that stupid animal has
a perfect right now to despise me though all the while he is so
destitute of all faculty of imagination especially in the morning
before his tea or after dinner that if you say Good morning to him
hell answer Is it And here comes the general pursued Lupihin
the civilian general a retired destitute general He has a daughter
of beetrootsugar and a manufactory with scrofula Beg pardon Ive
got it wrong but there you understand Ah and the architects
turned up here A German and wears moustaches and does not understand
his businessa natural phenomenon though what need for him to
understand his business so long as he takes bribes and sticks in pillars
everywhere to suit the tastes of our pillars of society

Lupihin chuckled again But suddenly a wave of excitement passed over
the whole house The grandee had arrived The host positively rushed
into the hall After him ran a few devoted members of the household and
eager guests The noisy talk was transformed into a subdued pleasant
chat like the buzzing of bees in spring within their hives Only the
turbulent wasp Lupihin and the splendid drone Kozelsky did not
subdue their voices And behold at last the queenthe great
dignitary entered Hearts bounded to meet him sitting bodies rose even
the gentleman who had bought a horse from Lupihin poked his chin into
his chest The great personage kept up his dignity in an inimitable
manner throwing his head back as though he were bowing he uttered a
few words of approbation of which each was prefaced by the syllable
er drawled through his nose with a sort of devouring indignation
he looked at Prince Kozelskys democratic beard and gave the destitute
general with the factory and the daughter the forefinger of his right
hand After a few minutes in the course of which the dignitary had had
time to observe twice that he was very glad he was not late for dinner
the whole company trooped into the diningroom the swells first

There is no need to describe to the reader how they put the great man in
the most important place between the civilian general and the marshal
of the province a man of an independent and dignified expression of
face in perfect keeping with his starched shirtfront his expanse of
waistcoat and his round snuffbox full of French snuff how our host
bustled about and ran up and down fussing and pressing the guests to
eat smiling at the great mans back in passing and hurriedly snatching
a plate of soup or a bit of bread in a corner like a schoolboy how the
butler brought in a fish more than a yard long with a nosegay in its
mouth how the surlylooking footmen in livery sullenly plied every
gentleman now with Malaga now dry Madeira and how almost all the
gentlemen particularly the more elderly ones drank off glass after
glass with an air of reluctantly resigning themselves to a sense of
duty and finally how they began popping champagne bottles and
proposing toasts all that is probably only too well known to the
reader But what struck me as especially noteworthy was the anecdote
told us by the great man himself amid a general delighted silence
SomeoneI fancy it was the destitute general a man familiar with
modern literaturereferred to the influence of women in general and
especially on young men Yes yes chimed in the great man thats
true but young men ought to be kept in strict subjection or else very
likely theyll go out of their senses over every petticoat A smile
of childlike delight flitted over the faces of all the guests positive
gratitude could be seen in one gentlemans eyes For young men are
idiots The great man I suppose for the sake of greater
impressiveness sometimes changed the accepted accentuation of words

My son Ivan for instance he went on the fools only just
twentyand all at once he comes to me and says Let me be married
father I told him he was a fool told him he must go into the service
first Well there was despairtears but with me no
nonsense The words no nonsense the great man seemed to enunciate
more with his stomach than his lips he paused and glanced majestically
at his neighbour the general while he raised his eyebrows higher than
any one could have expected The civilian general nodded agreeably a
little on one side and with extraordinary rapidity winked with the eye
turned to the great man And what do you think the great man began
again now he writes to me himself and thanks me for looking after him
when he was a fool So thats the way to act All the guests of
course were in complete agreement with the speaker and seemed quite
cheered up by the pleasure and instruction they derived from him
After dinner the whole party rose and moved into the drawingroom with
a great deal of noisedecorous however and as it were licensed for
the occasion They sat down to cards

I got through the evening somehow and charging my coachman to have my
carriage ready at five oclock next morning I went to my room But I
was destined in the course of that same day to make the acquaintance
of a remarkable man

In consequence of the great number of guests staying in the house no
one had a bedroom to himself In the small greenish damp room to which
I was conducted by Alexandr Mihalitchs butler there was already
another guest quite undressed On seeing me he quickly ducked under
the bedclothes covered himself up to the nose turned a little on the
soft featherbed and lay quiet keeping a sharp lookout from under the
round frill of his cotton nightcap I went up to the other bed there
were only two in the room undressed and lay down in the damp sheets
My neighbour turned over in bed I wished him goodnight

Halfanhour went by In spite of all my efforts I could not get to
sleep aimless and vague thoughts kept persistently and monotonously
dragging one after another on an endless chain like the buckets of a
hydraulic machine

Youre not asleep I fancy observed my neighbour

No as you see I answered And youre not sleepy either are you

Im never sleepy

Hows that

Oh I go to sleepI dont know what for I lie in bed and lie in bed
and so get to sleep

Why do you go to bed before you feel sleepy

Why what would you have me do

I made no answer to my neighbours question

I wonder he went on after a brief silence how it is there are no
fleas here Where should there be fleas if not here one wonders

You seem to regret them I remarked

No I dont regret them but I like everything to be consecutive

Oho thought I what words he uses

My neighbour was silent again

Would you like to make a bet with me he said again rather loudly

What about

I began to be amused by him

Hm what about Why about this Im certain you take me for a
fool

Really I muttered astounded

For an ignoramus for a rustic of the steppes Confess

I havent the pleasure of knowing you I responded What can make you
infer

Why the sound of your voice is enough you answer me so carelessly
But Im not at all what you suppose

Allow me

No you allow me In the first place I speak French as well as you
and German even better secondly I have spent three years abroadin
Berlin alone I lived eight months Ive studied Hegel honoured sir I
know Goethe by heart add to that I was a long while in love with a
German professors daughter and was married at home to a consumptive
lady who was bald but a remarkable personality So Im a bird of your
feather Im not a barbarian of the steppes as you imagine I too
have been bitten by reflection and theres nothing obvious about me

I raised my head and looked with redoubled attention at the queer
fellow By the dim light of the nightlamp I could hardly distinguish
his features

There youre looking at me now he went on setting his nightcap
straight and probably youre asking yourself How is it I didnt
notice him today Ill tell you why you didnt notice me because I
didnt raise my voice because I get behind other people hang about
doorways and talk to no one because when the butler passes me with a
tray he raises his elbow to the level of my shoulder And how is it
all that comes about From two causes first Im poor and secondly
Ive grown humble Tell the truth you didnt notice me did you

Certainly Ive not had the pleasure

There there he interrupted me I knew that

He raised himself and folded his arms the long shadow of his cap was
bent from the wall to the ceiling

And confess now he added with a sudden sideway glance at me I
must strike you as a queer fellow an original as they say or possibly
as something worse perhaps you think I affect to be original

I must repeat again that I dont know you

He looked down an instant

Why have I begun talking so unexpectedly to you a man utterly a
strangerthe Lord the Lord only knows He sighed Not through the
natural affinity of our souls Both you and I are respectable people
thats to say egoists neither of us has the least concern with the
other isnt it so But we are neither of us sleepy so why not chat
Im in the mood and thats rare with me Im shy do you see and not
shy because Im a provincial of no rank and poor but because Im a
fearfully vain person But at times under favourable circumstances
occasions which I could not however particularise nor foresee my
shyness vanishes completely as at this moment for instance At this
moment you might set me face to face with the Grand Lama and Id ask
him for a pinch of snuff But perhaps you want to go to sleep

Quite the contrary I hastened to respond it is a pleasure for me to
talk to you

That is I amuse you you mean to say All the better And so I
tell you they call me here an original thats what they call me when
my name is casually mentioned among other gossip No one is much
concerned about my fate They think it wounds me Oh good Lord
if they only knew its just whats my ruin that there is absolutely
nothing original in menothing except such freaks as for instance my
conversation at this moment with you but such freaks are not worth a
brass farthing Thats the cheapest and lowest sort of originality

He turned facing me and waved his hands

Honoured sir he cried I am of the opinion that life on earths only
worth living as a rule for original people its only they who have a
right to live Man verre nest pas grand maisje bois dans mon
verre said someone Do you see he added in an undertone how
well I pronounce French What is it to one if ones a capacious brain
and understands everything and knows a lot and keeps pace with the
age if ones nothing of ones own of oneself One more storehouse for
hackneyed commonplaces in the world and what good does that do to
anyone No better be stupid even but in ones own way One should have
a flavour of ones own ones individual flavour thats the thing And
dont suppose that I am very exacting as to that flavour God forbid
There are no end of original people of the sort I mean look where you
willtheres an original every live man is an original but I am not
to be reckoned among them

And yet he went on after a brief silence in my youth what
expectations I aroused What a high opinion I cherished of my own
individuality before I went abroad and even at first after my return
Well abroad I kept my ears open held aloof from everyone as befits a
man like me who is always seeing through things by himself and at the
end has not understood the A B C

An original an original he hurried on shaking his head
reproachfully They call me an original In reality it turns out
that theres not a man in the world less original than your humble
servant I must have been born even in imitation of someone else Oh
dear It seems I am living too in imitation of the various authors
studied by me in the sweat of my brow I live and Ive studied and
fallen in love and married in fact as it were not through my own
willas it were fulfilling some sort of duty or sort of fatewhos
to make it out

He tore the nightcap off his head and flung it on the bed

Would you like me to tell you the story of my life he asked me in an
abrupt voice or rather a few incidents of my life

Please do me the favour

Or no Id better tell you how I got married You see marriage is an
important thing the touchstone that tests the whole man in it as in a
glass is reflected But that sounds too hackneyed If youll
allow me Ill take a pinch of snuff

He pulled a snuffbox from under his pillow opened it and began again
waving the open snuffbox about

Put yourself honoured sir in my place Judge for yourself what
now what tell me as a favour what benefit could I derive from the
encyclopaedia of Hegel What is there in common tell me between that
encyclopaedia and Russian life and how would you advise me to apply it
to our life and not it the encyclopaedia only but German philosophy in
general I will say morescience itself

He gave a bound on the bed and muttered to himself gnashing his teeth
angrily

Ah thats it thats it Then why did you go trailing off abroad
Why didnt you stay at home and study the life surrounding you on the
spot You might have found out its needs and its future and have come
to a clear comprehension of your vocation so to say But upon my
word he went on changing his tone again as though timidly justifying
himself where is one to study what no sage has yet inscribed in any
book I should have been glad indeed to take lessons of herof Russian
life I meanbut shes dumb the poor dear You must take her as she
is but thats beyond my power you must give me the inference you must
present me with a conclusion Here you have a conclusion too listen to
our wise men of Moscowtheyre a set of nightingales worth listening
to arent they Yes thats the pity of it that they pipe away like
Kursk nightingales instead of talking as the people talk Well I
thought and thoughtScience to be sure I thought is everywhere
the same and truth is the sameso I was up and off in Gods name to
foreign parts to the heathen What would you have I was infatuated
with youth and conceit I didnt want you know to get fat before my
time though they say its healthy Though indeed if nature doesnt
put the flesh on your bones you wont see much fat on your body

But I fancy he added after a moments thought I promised to tell
you how I got marriedlisten First I must tell you that my wife is no
longer living secondly secondly I see I must give you some account
of my youth or else you wont be able to make anything out of it
But dont you want to go to sleep

No Im not sleepy

Thats good news Hark how vulgarly Mr Kantagryuhin is snoring in
the next room I was the son of parents of small propertyI say
parents because according to tradition I had once had a father as
well as a mother I dont remember him he was a narrowminded man Ive
been told with a big nose freckles and red hair he used to take
snuff on one side of his nose only his portrait used to hang in my
mothers bedroom and very hideous he was in a red uniform with a black
collar up to his ears They used to take me to be whipped before him
and my mother used always on such occasions to point to him saying He
would give it to you much more if he were here You can imagine what an
encouraging effect that had on me I had no brother nor sisterthats
to say speaking accurately I had once had a brother knocking about
with the English disease in his neck but he soon died And why ever
one wonders should the English disease make its way to the Shtchigri
district of the province of Kursk But thats neither here nor there My
mother undertook my education with all the vigorous zeal of a country
lady of the steppes she undertook it from the solemn day of my birth
till the time when my sixteenth year had come You are following my
story

Yes please go on

All right Well when I was sixteen my mother promptly dismissed my
teacher of French a German Filipvitch from the Greek settlement of
Nyezhin She conducted me to Moscow put down my name for the
university and gave up her soul to the Almighty leaving me in the
hands of my uncle the attorney KoltunBabur one of a sort wellknown
not only in the Shtchigri district My uncle the attorney KoltunBabur
plundered me to the last halfpenny after the custom of guardians
But again thats neither here nor there I entered the universityI
must do so much justice to my motherrather well grounded but my lack
of originality was even then apparent My childhood was in no way
distinguished from the childhood of other boys I grew up just as
languidly and dullymuch as if I were under a featherbedjust as
early I began repeating poetry by heart and moping under the pretence of
a dreamy inclination for whatwhy for the beautiful and so
on In the university I went on in the same way I promptly got into a
circle Times were different then But you dont know perhaps
what sort of thing a students circle is I remember Schiller said
somewhere

  Gefhrlich ists den Leu zu wecken
  Und schrecklich ist des Tigers Zahn
  Doch das schrecklichste der Schrecken
  Das ist der Mensch in seinem Wahn


He didnt mean that I can assure you he meant to say Das ist
ein circle in der Stadt Moskau

But what do you find so awful in the circle I asked

My neighbour snatched his cap and pulled it down on to his nose

What do I find so awful he shouted Why this the circle is the
destruction of all independent development the circle is a hideous
substitute for society woman life the circle oh wait a bit Ill
tell you what a circle is A circle is a slothful dull living side by
side in common to which is attached a serious significance and a show
of rational activity the circle replaces conversation by debate trains
you in fruitless discussion draws you away from solitary useful
labour develops in you the itch for authorshipdeprives you in fact
of all freshness and virgin vigour of soul The circlewhy its
vulgarity and boredom under the name of brotherhood and friendship a
concatenation of misunderstandings and cavillings under the pretence of
openness and sympathy in the circlethanks to the right of every
friend at all hours and seasons to poke his unwashed fingers into the
very inmost soul of his comradeno one has a single spot in his soul
pure and undefiled in the circle they fall down before the shallow
vain smart talker and the premature wiseacre and worship the
rhymester with no poetic gift but full of subtle ideas in the circle
young lads of seventeen talk glibly and learnedly of women and of love
while in the presence of women they are dumb or talk to them like a
bookand what do they talk about The circle is the hotbed of glib
fluency in the circle they spy on one another like so many police
officials Oh circle thourt not a circle but an enchanted ring
which has been the ruin of many a decent fellow

Come youre exaggerating allow me to observe I broke in

My neighbour looked at me in silence

Perhaps God knows perhaps But you see theres only one pleasure
left your humble servant and thats exaggerationwell that was the
way I spent four years in Moscow I cant tell you my dear sir how
quickly how fearfully quickly that time passed its positively
painful and vexatious to remember Some mornings one gets up and its
like sliding downhill on little sledges Before one can look round
ones flown to the bottom its evening already and already the sleepy
servant is pulling on ones coat one dresses and trails off to a
friend and may be smokes a pipe drinks weak tea in glasses and
discusses German philosophy love the eternal sunshine of the spirit
and other farfetched topics But even there I met original independent
people however some men stultify themselves and warp themselves out of
shape still nature asserts itself I alone poor wretch moulded myself
like soft wax and my pitiful little nature never made the faintest
resistance Meantime I had reached my twentyfirst year I came into
possession of my inheritance or more correctly speaking that part of
my inheritance which my guardian had thought fit to leave me gave a
freed houseserf Vassily Kudryashev a warranty to superintend all my
patrimony and set off abroad to Berlin I was abroad as I have already
had the pleasure of telling you three years Well There too abroad
too I remained the same unoriginal creature In the first place I need
not say that of Europe of European life I really learnt nothing I
listened to German professors and read German books on their birthplace
that was all the difference I led as solitary a life as any monk I got
on good terms with a retired lieutenant weighed down like myself by a
thirst for knowledge but always dull of comprehension and not gifted
with a flow of words I made friends with slowwitted families from
Penza and other agricultural provinces hung about cafs read
the papers in the evening went to the theatre With the natives I
associated very little I talked to them with constraint and never had
one of them to see me at my own place except two or three intrusive
fellows of Jewish extraction who were constantly running in upon me and
borrowing moneythanks to der Russes gullibility A strange
freak of chance brought me at last to the house of one of my professors
It was like this I came to him to enter my name for a course of
lectures and he all of a sudden invited me to an evening party at his
house This professor had two daughters of twentyseven such stumpy
little thingsGod bless themwith such majestic noses frizzed curls
and paleblue eyes and red hands with white nails One was called
Linchen and the other Minchen I began to go to the professors I ought
to tell you that the professor was not exactly stupid but seemed as it
were dazed in his professorial desk he spoke fairly consecutively but
at home he lisped and always had his spectacles on his foreheadhe was
a very learned man though Well suddenly it seemed to me that I was in
love with Linchen and for six whole months this impression remained I
talked to her its true very littleit was more that I looked at her
but I used to read various touching passages aloud to her to press her
hand on the sly and to dream beside her in the evenings gazing
persistently at the moon or else simply up aloft Besides she made
such delicious coffee One asks oneselfwhat more could one desire
Only one thing troubled me at the very moments of ineffable bliss as
its called I always had a sort of sinking in the pit of the stomach
and a cold shudder ran down my back At last I could not stand such
happiness and ran away Two whole years after that I was abroad I went
to Italy stood before the Transfiguration in Rome and before the Venus
in Florence and suddenly fell into exaggerated raptures as though an
attack of delirium had come upon me in the evenings I wrote verses
began a diary in fact there too I behaved just like everyone else And
just mark how easy it is to be original I take no interest for
instance in painting and sculpture But simply saying so aloud
no it was impossible I must needs take a cicerone and run to gaze at
the frescoes

He looked down again and again pulled off his nightcap

Well I came back to my own country at last he went on in a weary
voice I went to Moscow In Moscow a marvellous transformation took
place in me Abroad I was mostly silent but now suddenly I began to
talk with unexpected smartness and at the same time I began to conceive
all sorts of ideas of myself There were kindly disposed persons to be
found to whom I seemed all but a genius ladies listened
sympathetically to my diatribes but I was not able to keep on the
summit of my glory One fine morning a slander sprang up about me who
had originated it I dont know it must have been some old maid of the
male sexthere are any number of such old maids in Moscow it sprang
up and began to throw off outshoots and tendrils like a strawberry
plant I was abashed tried to get out of it to break through its
clinging toilsthat was no good I went away Well in that too I
showed that I was an absurd person I ought to have calmly waited for
the storm to blow over just as one waits for the end of nettlerash
and the same kindlydisposed persons would have opened their arms to me
again the same ladies would have smiled approvingly again at my
remarks But whats wrong is just that Im not an original person
Conscientious scruples please to observe had been stirred up in me I
was somehow ashamed of talk talk without ceasing nothing but
talkyesterday in Arbat today in Truba tomorrow in
SivtsevyVrazhky and all about the same thing But if that is what
people want of me Look at the really successful men in that line they
dont ask its use on the contrary its all they need some will keep
their tongues wagging twenty years together and always in one
direction Thats what comes of selfconfidence and conceit I had
that too conceitindeed even now its not altogether stifled But
what was wrong was thatI say again Im not an original personI
stopped midway nature ought to have given me far more conceit or none
at all But at first I felt the change a very hard one moreover my
stay abroad too had utterly drained my resources while I was not
disposed to marry a merchants daughter young but flabby as a jelly
so I retired to my country place I fancy added my neighbour with
another glance sideways at me I may pass over in silence the first
impressions of country life references to the beauty of nature the
gentle charm of solitude etc

You can indeed I put in

All the more he continued as all thats nonsense at least as far
as Im concerned I was as bored in the country as a puppy locked up
though I will own that on my journey home when I passed through the
familiar birchwood in spring for the first time my head was in a whirl
and my heart beat with a vague sweet expectation But these vague
expectations as youre well aware never come to pass on the other
hand very different things do come to pass which you dont at all
expect such as cattle disease arrears sales by auction and so on
and so on I managed to make a shift from day to day with the aid of my
agent Yakov who replaced the former superintendent and turned out in
the course of time to be as great if not a greater robber and over and
above that poisoned my existence by the smell of his tarred boots
suddenly one day I remembered a family I knew in the neighbourhood
consisting of the widow of a retired colonel and her two daughters
ordered out my droshky and set off to see them That day must always be
a memorable one for me six months later I was married to the retired
colonels second daughter

The speaker dropped his head and lifted his hands to heaven

And now he went on warmly I couldnt bear to give you an
unfavourable opinion of my late wife Heaven forbid She was the most
generous sweetest creature a loving nature capable of any sacrifice
though I must between ourselves confess that if I had not had the
misfortune to lose her I should probably not be in a position to be
talking to you today since the beam is still there in my barn to
which I repeatedly made up my mind to hang myself

Some pears he began again after a brief pause need to lie in an
underground cellar for a time to come as they say to their real
flavour my wife it seems belonged to a similar order of natures
works Its only now that I do her complete justice Its only now for
instance that memories of some evenings I spent with her before
marriage no longer awaken the slightest bitterness but move me almost
to tears They were not rich people their house was very oldfashioned
and built of wood but comfortable it stood on a hill between an
overgrown courtyard and a garden run wild At the bottom of the hill ran
a river which could just be seen through the thick leaves A wide
terrace led from the house to the garden before the terrace flaunted a
long flowerbed covered with roses at each end of the flowerbed grew
two acacias which had been trained to grow into the shape of a screw by
its late owner A little farther in the very midst of a thicket of
neglected and overgrown raspberries stood an arbour smartly painted
within but so old and tumbledown outside that it was depressing to
look at it A glass door led from the terrace into the drawingroom in
the drawingroom this was what met the eye of the inquisitive spectator
in the various corners stoves of Dutch tiles a squeaky piano to the
right piled with manuscript music a sofa covered with faded blue
material with a whitish pattern a round table two whatnots of china
and glass knicknacks of the Catherine period on the wall the
wellknown picture of a flaxenhaired girl with a dove on her breast and
eyes turned upwards on the table a vase of fresh roses You see how
minutely I describe it In that drawingroom on that terrace was
rehearsed all the tragicomedy of my love The colonels wife herself
was an illnatured old dame whose voice was always hoarse with spitea
petty snappish creature Of the daughters one Vera did not differ in
any respect from the common run of young ladies of the provinces the
other Sofya I fell in love with The two sisters had another little
room too their common bedroom with two innocent little wooden
bedsteads yellowish albums mignonette portraits of friends sketched
in pencil rather badly among them was one gentleman with an
exceptionally vigorous expression of face and a still more vigorous
signature who had in his youth raised disproportionate expectations
but had come like all of us to nothing with busts of Goethe and
Schiller German books dried wreaths and other objects kept as
souvenirs But that room I rarely and reluctantly entered I felt
stifled there somehow And too strange to say I liked Sofya best of
all when I was sitting with my back to her or still more perhaps when
I was thinking or dreaming about her in the evening on the terrace At
such times I used to gaze at the sunset at the trees at the tiny
leaves already in darkness but standing out sharply against the rosy
sky in the drawingroom Sofya sat at the piano continually playing over
and over again some favourite passionately pathetic phrase from
Beethoven the illnatured old lady snored peacefully sitting on the
sofa in the diningroom which was flooded by a glow of lurid light
Vera was bustling about getting tea the samovar hissed merrily as
though it were pleased at something the cracknels snapped with a
pleasant crispness and the spoons tinkled against the cups the canary
which trilled mercilessly all day was suddenly still and only
chirruped from time to time as though asking for something from a
light transparent cloud there fell a few passing drops of rain And I
would sit and sit listen listen and look my heart would expand and
again it seemed to me that I was in love Well under the influence of
such an evening I one day asked the old lady for her daughters hand
and two months later I was married It seemed to me that I loved her
By now indeed its time I should know but by God even now I dont
know whether I loved Sofya She was a sweet creature clever silent
and warmhearted but God only knows from what cause whether from
living too long in the country or for some other reason there was at
the bottom of her heart if only there is a bottom to the heart a
secret wound or to put it better a little open sore which nothing
could heal to which neither she nor I could give a name Of the
existence of this sore of course I only guessed after marriage The
struggles I had over it nothing availed When I was a child I had a
little bird which had once been caught by the cat in its claws it was
saved and tended but the poor bird never got right it moped it pined
it ceased to sing It ended by a cat getting into its open cage one
night and biting off its beak after which it made up its mind at last
to die I dont know what cat had caught my wife in its claws but she
too moped and pined just like my unlucky bird Sometimes she obviously
made an effort to shake herself to rejoice in the open air in the
sunshine and freedom she would try and shrink up into herself again
And you know she loved me how many times has she assured me that she
had nothing left to wish foroof damn my soul and the light was
fading out of her eyes all the while I wondered whether there hadnt
been something in her past I made investigations there was nothing
forthcoming Well you may form your own judgment an original man would
have shrugged his shoulders and heaved a sigh or two perhaps and would
have proceeded to live his own life but I not being an original
creature began to contemplate a beam and halter My wife was so
thoroughly permeated by all the habits of an old maidBeethoven
evening walks mignonette corresponding with her friends albums et
ceterathat she never could accustom herself to any other mode of life
especially to the life of the mistress of a house and yet it seemed
absurd for a married woman to be pining in vague melancholy and singing
in the evening Waken her not at the dawn

Well we were blissful after that fashion for three years in the
fourth Sofya died in her first confinement and strange to say I had
felt as it were beforehand that she would not be capable of giving me
a daughter or a sonof giving the earth a new inhabitant I remember
how they buried her It was in the spring Our parish church was small
and old the screen was blackened the walls bare the brick floor worn
into hollows in parts there was a big oldfashioned holy picture in
each half of the choir They brought in the coffin placed it in the
middle before the holy gates covered it with a faded pall set three
candlesticks about it The service commenced A decrepit deacon with a
little shock of hair behind belted low down with a green kerchief was
mournfully mumbling before a readingdesk a priest also an old man
with a kindly purblind face in a lilac cassock with yellow flowers on
it served the mass for himself and the deacon At all the open windows
the fresh young leaves were stirring and whispering and the smell of
the grass rose from the churchyard outside the red flame of the
waxcandles paled in the bright light of the spring day the sparrows
were twittering all over the church and every now and then there came
the ringing cry of a swallow flying in under the cupola In the golden
motes of the sunbeams the brown heads of the few peasants kept rising
and dropping down again as they prayed earnestly for the dead in a thin
bluish stream the smoke issued from the holes of the censer I looked at
the dead face of my wife My God even deathdeath itselfhad not
set her free had not healed her wound the same sickly timid dumb
look as though even in her coffin she were ill at ease My heart
was filled with bitterness A sweet sweet creature she was and she did
well for herself to die

The speakers cheeks flushed and his eyes grew dim

When at last he began again I emerged from the deep depression
which overwhelmed me after my wifes death I resolved to devote myself
as it is called to work I went into a government office in the capital
of the province but in the great apartments of the government
institution my head ached and my eyesight too began to fail other
incidental causes came in I retired I had thought of going on a
visit to Moscow but in the first place I hadnt the money and
secondly Ive told you already Im resigned This resignation came
upon me both suddenly and not suddenly In spirit I had long ago
resigned myself but my brain was still unwilling to accept the yoke I
ascribed my humble temper and ideas to the influence of country life and
happiness On the other side I had long observed that all my
neighbours young and old alike who had been frightened at first by my
learning my residence abroad and my other advantages of education had
not only had time to get completely used to me but had even begun to
treat me halfrudely halfcontemptuously did not listen to my
observations and in talking to me no longer made use of superfluous
signs of respect I forgot to tell you too that during the first year
after my marriage I had tried to launch into literature and even sent
a thing to a journala story if Im not mistaken but in a little time
I received a polite letter from the editor in which among other
things I was told that he could not deny I had intelligence but he was
obliged to say I had no talent and talent alone was what was needed in
literature To add to this it came to my knowledge that a young man on
a visit from Moscowa most goodnatured youth toohad referred to me
at an evening party at the governors as a shallow person antiquated
and behind the times But my halfwilful blindness still persisted I
was unwilling to give myself a slap in the face you know at last one
fine morning my eyes were opened This was how it happened The
district captain of police came to see me with the object of calling my
attention to a tumbledown bridge on my property which I had absolutely
no money to repair After consuming a glass of vodka and a snack of
dried fish this condescending guardian of order reproached me in a
paternal way for my heedlessness sympathising however with my
position and only advising me to order my peasants to patch up the
bridge with some rubbish he lighted a pipe and began talking of the
coming elections A candidate for the honourable post of marshal of the
province was at that time one Orbassanov a noisy shallow fellow who
took bribes into the bargain Besides he was not distinguished either
for wealth or for family I expressed my opinion with regard to him and
rather casually too I regarded Mr Orbassanov I must own as beneath
my level The policecaptain looked at me patted me amicably on the
shoulder and said goodnaturedly Come come Vassily Vassilyevitch
its not for you and me to criticise men like thathow are we qualified
to Let the shoemaker stick to his last But upon my word I
retorted with annoyance whatever difference is there between me and
Mr Orbassanov The policecaptain took his pipe out of his mouth
opened his eyes wide and fairly roared Well youre an amusing chap
he observed at last while the tears ran down his cheeks what a joke
to make Ah you are a funny fellow And till his departure he never
ceased jeering at me now and then giving me a poke in the ribs with his
elbow and addressing me by my Christian name He went away at last
This was enough it was the last drop and my cup was overflowing I
paced several times up and down the room stood still before the
lookingglass and gazed a long long while at my embarrassed
countenance and deliberately putting out my tongue I shook my head
with a bitter smile The scales fell from my eyes I saw clearly more
clearly than I saw my face in the glass what a shallow insignificant
worthless unoriginal person I was

He paused

In one of Voltaires tragedies he went on wearily there is some
worthy who rejoices that he has reached the furthest limit of
unhappiness Though there is nothing tragic in my fate I will admit I
have experienced something of that sort I have known the bitter
transports of cold despair I have felt how sweet it is lying in bed
to curse deliberately for a whole morning together the hour and day of
my birth I could not resign myself all at once And indeed think of it
yourself I was kept by impecuniosity in the country which I hated I
was not fitted for managing my land nor for the public service nor for
literature nor anything my neighbours I didnt care for and books I
loathed as for the mawkish and morbidly sentimental young ladies who
shake their curls and feverishly harp on the word life I had ceased
to have any attraction for them ever since I gave up ranting and
gushing complete solitude I could not face I beganwhat do you
supposeI began hanging about visiting my neighbours As though drunk
with selfcontempt I purposely exposed myself to all sorts of petty
slights I was missed over in serving at table I was met with
supercilious coldness and at last was not noticed at all I was not
even allowed to take part in general conversation and from my corner I
myself used purposely to back up some stupid talker who in those days at
Moscow would have ecstatically licked the dust off my feet and kissed
the hem of my cloak I did not even allow myself to believe that I
was enjoying the bitter satisfaction of irony What sort of irony
indeed can a man enjoy in solitude Well so I have behaved for some
years on end and so I behave now

Really this is beyond everything grumbled the sleepy voice of Mr
Kantagryuhin from the next room what fool is it that has taken a fancy
to talk all night

The speaker promptly ducked under the clothes and peeping out timidly
held up his finger to me warningly

Shsh he whispered and as it were bowing apologetically in the
direction of Kantagryuhins voice he said respectfully I obey sir I
obey I beg your pardon Its permissible for him to sleep he ought
to sleep he went on again in a whisper he must recruit his
energieswell if only to eat his dinner with the same relish
tomorrow We have no right to disturb him Besides I think Ive told
you all I wanted to probably youre sleepy too I wish you goodnight

He turned away with feverish rapidity and buried his head in the pillow

Let me at least know I asked with whom I have had the pleasure

He raised his head quickly

No for mercys sake he cut me short dont inquire my name either
of me or of others Let me remain to you an unknown being crushed by
fate Vassily Vassilyevitch Besides as an unoriginal person I dont
deserve an individual name But if you really want to give me some
title call me call me the Hamlet of the Shtchigri district There
are many such Hamlets in every district but perhaps you havent come
across others After which goodbye

He buried himself again in his featherbed and the next morning when
they came to wake me he was no longer in the room He had left before
daylight

TCHERTOPHANOV AND NEDOPYUSKIN

One hot summer day I was coming home from hunting in a light cart
Yermola sat beside me dozing and scratching his nose The sleeping dogs
were jolted up and down like lifeless bodies under our feet The
coachman kept flicking gadflies off the horses with his whip The white
dust rose in a light cloud behind the cart We drove in between bushes
The road here was full of ruts and the wheels began catching in the
twigs Yermola started up and looked round Hullo he said there
ought to be grouse here Lets get out We stopped and went into the
thicket My dog hit upon a covey I took a shot and was beginning to
reload when suddenly there was a loud crackling behind me and a man on
horseback came towards me pushing the bushes apart with his hands
Sir peermit me to ask he began in a haughty voice by what right
you areershooting here sir The stranger spoke extraordinarily
quickly jerkily and condescendingly I looked at his face never in my
life have I seen anything like it Picture to yourselves gentle
readers a little flaxenhaired man with a little turnup red nose and
long red moustaches A pointed Persian cap with a crimson cloth crown
covered his forehead right down to his eyebrows He was dressed in a
shabby yellow Caucasian overcoat with black velveteen cartridge pockets
on the breast and tarnish silver braid on all the seams over his
shoulder was slung a horn in his sash was sticking a dagger A
rawboned hooknosed chestnut horse shambled unsteadily under his
weight two lean crookpawed greyhounds kept turning round just under
the horses legs The face the glance the voice every action the
whole being of the stranger was expressive of a wild daring and an
unbounded incredible pride his paleblue glassy eyes strayed about
with a sideway squint like a drunkards he flung back his head puffed
out his cheeks snorted and quivered all over as though bursting with
dignityfor all the world like a turkeycock He repeated his question

I didnt know it was forbidden to shoot here I replied

You are here sir he continued on my land

With your permission I will go off it

But peermit me to ask he rejoined is it a nobleman I have the
honour of addressing

I mentioned my name

In that case oblige me by hunting here I am a nobleman myself and am
very pleased to do any service to a nobleman And my name is Panteley
Tchertophanov He bowed hallooed gave his horse a lash on the neck
the horse shook its head reared shied and trampled on a dogs paws
The dog gave a piercing squeal Tchertophanov boiled over with rage
foaming at the mouth he struck the horse with his fist on the head
between the ears leaped to the ground quicker than lightning looked at
the dogs paw spat on the wound gave it a kick in the ribs to stop its
whining caught on to the horses forelock and put his foot in the
stirrup The horse flung up its head and with its tail in the air edged
away into the bushes he followed it hopping on one leg he got into
the saddle at last however flourished his whip in a sort of frenzy
blew his horn and galloped off I had not time to recover from the
unexpected appearance of Tchertophanov when suddenly almost without
any noise there came out of the bushes a stoutish man of forty on a
little black nag He stopped took off his green leather cap and in a
thin subdued voice he asked me whether I hadnt seen a horseman riding
a chestnut I answered that I had

Which way did the gentleman go he went on in the same tone without
putting on his cap

Over there

I humbly thank you sir

He made a kissing sound with his lips swung his legs against his
horses sides and fell into a jogtrot in the direction indicated I
looked after him till his peaked cap was hidden behind the branches
This second stranger was not in the least like his predecessor in
exterior His face plump and round as a ball expressed bashfulness
goodnature and humble meekness his nose also plump and round and
streaked with blue veins betokened a sensualist On the front of his
head there was not a single hair left some thin brown tufts stuck out
behind there was an ingratiating twinkle in his little eyes set in
long slits and a sweet smile on his red juicy lips He had on a coat
with a standup collar and brass buttons very worn but clean his cloth
trousers were hitched up high his fat calves were visible above the
yellow tops of his boots

Whos that I inquired of Yermola

That Nedopyuskin Tihon Ivanitch He lives at Tchertophanovs

What is he a poor man

Hes not rich but to be sure Tchertophanovs not got a brass
farthing either

Then why does he live with him

Oh they made friends Ones never seen without the other Its a
fact indeedwhere the horse puts its hoof there the crab sticks its
claw

We got out of the bushes suddenly two hounds gave tongue close to us
and a big hare bounded through the oats which were fairly high by now
The dogs hounds and harriers leaped out of the thicket after him and
after the dogs flew out Tchertophanov himself He did not shout nor
urge the dogs on nor halloo he was breathless and gasping broken
senseless sounds were jerked out of his gaping mouth now and then he
dashed on his eyes starting out of his head and furiously lashed at
his luckless horse with the whip The harriers were gaining on the
hare it squatted for a moment doubled sharply back and darted past
Yermola into the bushes The harriers rushed in pursuit Look out
look out the exhausted horseman articulated with effort in a sort of
stutter look out friend Yermola shot the wounded hare rolled
head over heels on the smooth dry grass leaped into the air and
squealed piteously in the teeth of a worrying dog The hounds crowded
about her Like an arrow Tchertophanov flew off his horse clutched
his dagger ran straddling among the dogs with furious imprecations
snatched the mangled hare from them and creasing up his whole face he
buried the dagger in its throat up to the very hilt buried it and
began hallooing Tihon Ivanitch made his appearance on the edge of the
thicket Hohohohohohohoho vociferated Tchertophanov a second
time Hohohoho his companion repeated placidly

But really you know one ought not to hunt in summer I observed to
Tchertophanov pointing to the trampleddown oats

Its my field answered Tchertophanov gasping

He pulled the hare into shape hung it on to his saddle and flung the
paws among the dogs

I owe you a charge my friend by the rules of hunting he said
addressing Yermola And you dear sir he added in the same jerky
abrupt voice my thanks

He mounted his horse

Peermit me to ask Ive forgotten your name and your fathers

Again I told him my name

Delighted to make your acquaintance When you have an opportunity hope
youll come and see me But where is that Fomka Tihon Ivanitch he
went on with heat the hare was run down without him

His horse fell down under him replied Tihon Ivanitch with a smile

Fell down Orbassan fell down Pugh tut Where is he

Over there behind the copse

Tchertophanov struck his horse on the muzzle with his whip and
galloped off at a breakneck pace Tihon Ivanitch bowed to me twice once
for himself and once for his companion and again set off at a trot into
the bushes

These two gentlemen aroused my curiosity keenly What could unite two
creatures so different in the bonds of an inseparable friendship I
began to make inquiries This was what I learned

Panteley Eremyitch Tchertophanov had the reputation in the whole
surrounding vicinity of a dangerous crackbrained fellow haughty and
quarrelsome in the extreme He had served a very short time in the army
and had retired from the service through difficulties with his
superiors with that rank which is generally regarded as equivalent to
no rank at all He came of an old family once rich his forefathers
lived sumptuously after the manner of the steppesthat is they
welcomed all invited or uninvited fed them to exhaustion gave out
oats by the quarter to their guests coachmen for their teams kept
musicians singers jesters and dogs on festive days regaled their
people with spirits and beer drove to Moscow in the winter with their
own horses in heavy old coaches and sometimes were for whole months
without a farthing living on homegrown produce The estate came into
Panteley Eremyitchs fathers hands in a crippled condition he in his
turn played ducks and drakes with it and when he died left his sole
heir Panteley the small mortgaged village of Bezsonovo with
thirtyfive souls of the male and seventysix of the female sex and
twentyeight acres and a half of useless land on the waste of
Kolobrodova no record of serfs for which could be found among the
deceaseds deeds The deceased had it must be confessed ruined himself
in a very strange way provident management had been his destruction
According to his notions a nobleman ought not to depend on merchants
townsmen and brigands of that sort as he called them he set up all
possible trades and crafts on his estate its both seemlier and
cheaper he used to say its provident management He never
relinquished this fatal idea to the end of his days indeed it was his
ruin But then what entertainment it gave him He never denied himself
the satisfaction of a single whim Among other freaks he once began
building after his own fancy so immense a family coach that in spite
of the united efforts of the peasants horses drawn together from the
whole village as well as their owners it came to grief and fell to
pieces on the first hillside Eremey Lukitch the name of Panteleys
father was Eremey Lukitch ordered a memorial to be put up on the
hillside but was not however at all abashed over the affair He
conceived the happy thought too of building a churchby himself of
coursewithout the assistance of an architect He burnt a whole forest
in making the bricks laid an immense foundation as though for a
provincial hall raised the walls and began putting on the cupola the
cupola fell down He tried againthe cupola again broke down he tried
the third timethe cupola fell to pieces a third time Good Eremey
Lukitch grew thoughtful there was something uncanny about it he
reflected some accursed witchcraft must have a hand in it and at
once he gave orders to flog all the old women in the village They
flogged the old women but they didnt get the cupola on for all that
He began reconstructing the peasants huts on a new plan and all on a
system of provident management he set them three homesteads together
in a triangle and in the middle stuck up a post with a painted
birdcage and flag Every day he invented some new freak at one time he
was making soup of burdocks at another cutting his horses tails off to
make caps for his servants at another proposing to substitute nettles
for flax to feed pigs on mushrooms He had once read in the
Moscow Gazette an article by a Harkov landowner HryakHrupyorsky
on the importance of morality to the wellbeing of the peasant and the
next day he gave forth a decree to all his peasants to learn off the
Harkov landowners article by heart at once The peasants learnt the
article the master asked them whether they understood what was said
in it The bailiff repliedthat to be sure they understood it About the
same time he ordered all his subjects with a view to the maintenance
of order and provident management to be numbered and each to have his
number sewn on his collar On meeting the master each was to shout
Number soandso is here and the master would answer affably
Go on in Gods name

In spite however of order and provident management Eremey Lukitch got
by degrees into a very difficult position he began at first by
mortgaging his villages and then was brought to the sale of them the
last ancestral home the village with the unfinished church was sold at
last for arrears to the Crown luckily not in the lifetime of Eremey
Lukitchhe could never have supported such a blowbut a fortnight
after his death He succeeded in dying at home in his own bed
surrounded by his own people and under the care of his own doctor but
nothing was left to poor Panteley but Bezsonovo

Panteley heard of his fathers illness while he was still in the
service in the very heat of the difficulties mentioned above He was
only just nineteen From his earliest childhood he had not left his
fathers house and under the guidance of his mother a very
goodnatured but perfectly stupid woman Vassilissa Vassilyevna he grew
up spoilt and conceited She undertook his education alone Eremey
Lukitch buried in his economical fancies had no thoughts to spare for
it It is true he once punished his son with his own hand for
mispronouncing a letter of the alphabet but Eremey Lukitch had received
a cruel and secret blow that day his best dog had been crushed by a
tree Vassilissa Vassilyevnas efforts in regard Panteleys education
did not however get beyond one terrific exertion in the sweat of her
brow she engaged him a tutor one Birkopf a retired Alsatian soldier
and to the day of her death she trembled like a leaf before him Oh
she thought if he throws us upIm lost Where could I turn Where
could I find another teacher Why with what pains what pains I enticed
this one away from our neighbours And Birkopf like a shrewd man
promptly took advantage of his unique position he drank like a fish
and slept from morning till night On the completion of his course of
science Panteley entered the army Vassilissa Vassilyevna was no more
she had died six months before that important event of fright She had
had a dream of a white figure riding on a bear Eremey Lukitch soon
followed his better half

At the first news of his illness Panteley galloped home at breakneck
speed but he did not find his father alive What was the amazement of
the dutiful son when he found himself utterly unexpectedly transformed
from a rich heir to a poor man Few men are capable of bearing so sharp
a reverse well Panteley was embittered made misanthropical by it From
an honest generous goodnatured fellow though spoilt and
hottempered he became haughty and quarrelsome he gave up associating
with the neighbourshe was too proud to visit the rich and he
disdained the poorand behaved with unheard of arrogance to everyone
even to the established authorities I am of the ancient hereditary
nobility he would say Once he had been on the point of shooting the
policecommissioner for coming into the room with his cap on his head
Of course the authorities on their side had their revenge and took
every opportunity to make him feel their power but still they were
rather afraid of him because he had a desperate temper and would
propose a duel with knives at the second word At the slightest retort
Tchertophanovs eyes blazed his voice broke Ah ererer he
stammered damn my soul and nothing could stop him And
moreover he was a man of stainless character who had never had a hand
in anything the least shady No one of course visited him and with
all this he was a goodhearted even a greathearted man in his own way
acts of injustice of oppression he would not brook even against
strangers he stood up for his own peasants like a rock What he
would say with a violent blow on his own head touch my people mine
My names not Tchertophanov if I

Tihon Ivanitch Nedopyuskin could not like Panteley Eremyitch pride
himself on his origin His father came of the peasant proprietor class
and only after forty years of service attained the rank of a noble Mr
Nedopyuskin the father belonged to the number of those people who are
pursued by misfortune with an obduracy akin to personal hatred For
sixty whole years from his very birth to his very death the poor man
was struggling with all the hardships calamities and privations
incidental to people of small means he struggled like a fish under the
ice never having enough food and sleepcringing worrying wearing
himself to exhaustion fretting over every farthing with genuine
innocence suffering in the service and dying at last in either a
garret or a cellar in the unsuccessful struggle to gain for himself or
his children a crust of dry bread Fate had hunted him down like a hare

He was a goodnatured and honest man though he did take bribesfrom a
threepenny bit up to a crown piece inclusive Nedopyuskin had a wife
thin and consumptive he had children too luckily they all died young
except Tihon and a daughter Mitrodora nicknamed the merchants
belle who after many painful and ludicrous adventures was married to
a retired attorney Mr Nedopyuskin had succeeded before his death in
getting Tihon a place as supernumerary clerk in some office but
directly after his fathers death Tihon resigned his situation Their
perpetual anxieties their heartrending struggle with cold and hunger
his mothers careworn depression his fathers toiling despair the
coarse aggressiveness of landladies and shopkeepersall the unending
daily suffering of their life had developed an exaggerated timidity in
Tihon at the mere sight of his chief he was faint and trembling like a
captured bird He threw up his office Nature in her indifference or
perhaps her irony implants in people all sorts of faculties and
tendencies utterly inconsistent with their means and their position in
society with her characteristic care and love she had moulded of Tihon
the son of a poor clerk a sensuous indolent soft impressionable
creaturea creature fitted exclusively for enjoyment gifted with an
excessively delicate sense of smell and of tasteshe had moulded him
finished him off most carefully and set her creation to struggle up on
sour cabbage and putrid fish And behold the creation did struggle up
somehow and began what is called life Then the fun began Fate
which had so ruthlessly tormented Nedopyuskin the father took to the
son too she had a taste for them one must suppose But she treated
Tihon on a different plan she did not torture him she played with him
She did not once drive him to desperation she did not set him to suffer
the degrading agonies of hunger but she led him a dance through the
whole of Russia from one end to the other from one degrading and
ludicrous position to another at one time Fate made him majordomo to
a snappish choleric Lady Bountiful at another a humble parasite on a
wealthy skinflint merchant then a private secretary to a goggleeyed
gentleman with his hair cut in the English style then she promoted him
to the post of something between butler and buffoon to a dogfancier
In short Fate drove poor Tihon to drink drop by drop to the dregs the
bitter poisoned cup of a dependent existence He had been in his time
the sport of the dull malignity and the boorish pranks of slothful
masters How often alone in his room released at last to go in
peace after a mob of visitors had glutted their taste for horseplay at
his expense he had vowed blushing with shame chill tears of despair
in his eyes that he would run away in secret would try his luck in the
town would find himself some little place as clerk or die once for all
of hunger in the street But in the first place God had not given him
strength of character secondly his timidity unhinged him and thirdly
how could he get himself a place whom could he ask Theyll never give
it me the luckless wretch would murmur tossing wearily in his bed
theyll never give it me And the next day he would take up the same
degrading life again His position was the more painful that with all
her care nature had not troubled to give him the smallest share of the
gifts and qualifications without which the trade of a buffoon is almost
impossible He was not equal for instance to dancing till he dropped
in a bearskin coat turned inside out nor making jokes and cutting
capers in the immediate vicinity of cracking whips if he was turned out
in a state of nature into a temperature of twenty degrees below
freezing as often as not he caught cold his stomach could not digest
brandy mixed with ink and other filth nor minced funguses and
toadstools in vinegar There is no knowing what would have become of
Tihon if the last of his patrons a contractor who had made his fortune
had not taken it into his head in a merry hour to inscribe in his will
And to Zyozo Tihon to wit Nedopyuskin I leave in perpetual
possession to him and his heirs the village of Bezselendyevka
lawfully acquired by me with all its appurtenances A few days later
this patron was taken with a fit of apoplexy after gorging on sturgeon
soup A great commotion followed the officials came and put seals on
the property

The relations arrived the will was opened and read and they called for
Nedopyuskin Nedopyuskin made his appearance The greater number of the
party knew the nature of Tihon Ivanitchs duties in his patrons
household he was greeted with deafening shouts and ironical
congratulations The landowner here is the new owner shouted the
other heirs Well really this put in one a noted wit and humourist
well really this one may say this positively is really what
one may call an heirapparent and they all went off into shrieks
For a long while Nedopyuskin could not believe in his good fortune They
showed him the will he flushed shut his eyes and with a despairing
gesture he burst into tears The chuckles of the party passed into a
deep unanimous roar The village of Bezselendyevka consisted of only
twentytwo serfs no one regretted its loss keenly so why not get some
fun out of it One of the heirs from Petersburg an important man with
a Greek nose and a majestic expression of face Rostislav Adamitch
Shtoppel went so far as to go up to Nedopyuskin and look haughtily at
him over his shoulder So far as I can gather honoured sir he
observed with contemptuous carelessness you enjoyed your position in
the household of our respected Fedor Fedoritch owing to your obliging
readiness to wait on his diversions The gentleman from Petersburg
expressed himself in a style insufferably refined smart and correct
Nedopyuskin in his agitation and confusion had not taken in the
unknown gentlemans words but the others were all quiet at once the
wit smiled condescendingly Mr Shtoppel rubbed his hands and repeated
his question Nedopyuskin raised his eyes in bewilderment and opened his
mouth Rostislav Adamitch puckered his face up sarcastically

I congratulate you my dear sir I congratulate you he went on its
true one may say not everyone would have consented to gain his daily
bread in such a fashion but de guslibus non est disputandum
that is everyone to his taste Eh

Someone at the back uttered a rapid decorous shriek of admiration and
delight

Tell us pursued Mr Shtoppel much encouraged by the smiles of the
whole party to what special talent are you indebted for your
goodfortune No dont be bashful tell us were all here so to
speak en famille Arent we gentlemen all here en famille

The relation to whom Rostislav Adamitch chanced to turn with this
question did not unfortunately know French and so he confined himself
to a faint grunt of approbation But another relation a young man with
patches of a yellow colour on his forehead hastened to chime in Wee
wee to be sure

Perhaps Mr Shtoppel began again you can walk on your hands your
legs raised so to say in the air

Nedopyuskin looked round in agony every face wore a taunting smile
every eye was moist with delight

Or perhaps you can crow like a cock

A loud guffaw broke out on all sides and was hushed at once stifled by
expectation

Or perhaps on your nose you can

Stop that a loud harsh voice suddenly interrupted Rostislav Adamitch
I wonder youre not ashamed to torment the poor man

Everyone looked round In the doorway stood Tchertophanov As a cousin
four times removed of the deceased contractor he too had received a
note of invitation to the meeting of the relations During the whole
time of reading the will he had kept as he always did haughtily apart
from the others

Stop that he repeated throwing his head back proudly

Mr Shtoppel turned round quickly and seeing a poorly dressed
unattractivelooking man he inquired of his neighbour in an undertone
cautions always a good thing

Whos that

Tchertophanovhes no great shakes the latter whispered in his ear

Rostislav Adamitch assumed a haughty air

And who are you to give orders he said through his nose drooping his
eyelids scornfully who may you be allow me to inquirea queer fish
upon my word

Tchertophanov exploded like gunpowder at a spark He was choked with
fury

Ssssss he hissed like one possessed and all at once he
thundered Who am I Who am I Im Panteley Tchertophanov of the
ancient hereditary nobility my forefathers served the Tsar and who may
you be

Rostislav Adamitch turned pale and stepped back He had not expected
such resistance

IIa fish indeed

Tchertophanov darted forward Shtoppel bounded away in great
perturbation the others rushed to meet the exasperated nobleman

A duel a duel a duel at once across a handkerchief shouted the
enraged Panteley or beg my pardonyes and his too

Pray beg his pardon the agitated relations muttered all round
Shtoppel hes such a madman hed cut your throat in a minute

I beg your pardon I beg your pardon I didnt know stammered
Shtoppel I didnt know

And beg his too vociferated the implacable Panteley

I beg your pardon too added Rostislav Adamitch addressing
Nedopyuskin who was shaking as if he were in an ague

Tchertophanov calmed down he went up to Tihon Ivanitch took him by
the hand looked fiercely round and as not one pair of eyes ventured
to meet his he walked triumphantly amid profound silence out of the
room with the new owner of the lawfully acquired village of
Bezselendyevka

From that day they never parted again The village of Bezselendyevka
was only seven miles from Bezsonovo The boundless gratitude of
Nedopyuskin soon passed into the most adoring veneration The weak
soft and not perfectly stainless Tihon bowed down in the dust before
the fearless and irreproachable Panteley Its no slight thing he
thought to himself sometimes to talk to the governor look him
straight in the face Christ have mercy on us doesnt he look at
him

He marvelled at him he exhausted all the force of his soul in his
admiration of him he regarded him as an extraordinary man as clever
as learned And theres no denying that bad as Tchertophanovs
education might be still in comparison with Tihons education it
might pass for brilliant Tchertophanov it is true had read little
Russian and knew French very badlyso badly that once in reply to the
question of a Swiss tutor Vous parlez franais monsieur he
answered Je ne comprehend and after a moments thought he
added pa but any way he was aware that Voltaire had once
existed and was a very witty writer and that Frederick the Great king
of Prussia had been distinguished as a great military commander Of
Russian writers he respected Derzhavin but liked Marlinsky and called
AmmalatBek the best of the pack

A few days after my first meeting with the two friends I set off for
the village of Bezsonovo to see Panteley Eremyitch His little house
could be seen a long way off it stood out on a bare place half a mile
from the village on the bluff as it is called like a hawk on a
ploughed field Tchertophanovs homestead consisted of nothing more
than four old tumbledown buildings of different sizesthat is a
lodge a stable a barn and a bathhouse Each building stood apart by
itself there was neither a fence round nor a gate to be seen My
coachman stopped in perplexity at a well which was choked up and had
almost disappeared Near the barn some thin and unkempt puppies were
mangling a dead horse probably Orbassan one of them lifted up the
bleeding nose barked hurriedly and again fell to devouring the bare
ribs Near the horse stood a boy of seventeen with a puffy yellow
face dressed like a Cossack and barelegged he looked with a
responsible air at the dogs committed to his charge and now and then
gave the greediest a lash with his whip

Is your master at home I inquired

The Lord knows answered the lad youd better knock

I jumped out of the droshky and went up to the steps of the lodge

Mr Tchertophanovs dwelling presented a very cheerless aspect the
beams were blackened and bulging forward the chimney had fallen off
the corners of the house were stained with damp and sunk out of the
perpendicular the small dusty bluish windows peeped out from under
the shaggy overhanging roof with an indescribably morose expression
some old vagrants have eyes that look like that I knocked no one
responded I could hear however through the door some sharply uttered
words

A B C there now idiot a hoarse voice was saying A B C D
no D E E E Now then idiot

I knocked a second time

The same voice shouted Come in whos there

I went into the small empty hall and through the open door I saw
Tchertophanov himself In a greasy oriental dressinggown loose
trousers and a red skullcap he was sitting on a chair in one hand he
gripped the face of a young poodle while in the other he was holding a
piece of bread just above his nose

Ah he pronounced with dignity not stirring from his seat delighted
to see you Please sit down I am busy here with Venzor Tihon
Ivanitch he added raising his voice come here will you Heres a
visitor

Im coming Im coming Tihon Ivanitch responded from the other room
Masha give me my cravat

Tchertophanov turned to Venzor again and laid the piece of bread on his
nose I looked round Except an extending table much warped with
thirteen legs of unequal length and four rush chairs worn into hollows
there was no furniture of any kind in the room the walls which had
been washed white ages ago with blue starshaped spots were peeling
off in many places between the windows hung a broken tarnished
lookingglass in a huge frame of red wood In the corners stood
pipestands and guns from the ceiling hung fat black cobwebs

A B C D Tchertophanov repeated slowly and suddenly he cried
furiously E E E E What a stupid brute

But the luckless poodle only shivered and could not make up his mind to
open his mouth he still sat wagging his tail uneasily and wrinkling up
his face blinked dejectedly and frowned as though saying to himself
Of course its just as you please

There eat come take it repeated the indefatigable master

Youve frightened him I remarked

Well he can get along then

He gave him a kick The poor dog got up softly dropped the bread off
his nose and walked as it were on tiptoe to the hall deeply wounded
And with good reason a stranger calling for the first time and to
treat him like that

The door from the next room gave a subdued creak and Mr Nedopyuskin
came in affably bowing and smiling

I got up and bowed

Dont disturb yourself dont disturb yourself he lisped

We sat down Tchertophanov went into the next room

You have been for some time in our neighbourhood began Nedopyuskin in
a subdued voice coughing discreetly into his hand and holding his
fingers before his lips from a feeling of propriety

I came last month

Indeed

We were silent for a little

Lovely weather we are having just now resumed Nedopyuskin and he
looked gratefully at me as though I were in some way responsible for the
weather the corn one may say is doing wonderfully

I nodded in token of assent We were silent again

Panteley Eremyitch was pleased to hunt two hares yesterday
Nedopyuskin began again with an effort obviously wishing to enliven the
conversation yes indeed very big hares they were sir

Has Mr Tchertophanov good hounds

The most wonderful hounds sir Nedopyuskin replied delighted one
may say the best in the province indeed He drew nearer to me
But then Panteley Eremyitch is such a wonderful man He has only to
wish for anythinghe has only to take an idea into his headand before
you can look round its done everything you may say goes like
clockwork Panteley Eremyitch I assure you

Tchertophanov came into the room Nedopyuskin smiled ceased speaking
and indicated him to me with a glance which seemed to say There you
will see for yourself We fell to talking about hunting

Would you like me to show you my leash Tchertophanov asked me and
not waiting for a reply he called Karp

A sturdy lad came in in a green nankin long coat with a blue collar
and livery buttons

Tell Fomka said Tchertophanov abruptly to bring in Ammalat and
Saiga and in good order do you understand

Karp gave a broad grin uttered an indefinite sound and went away
Fomka made his appearance well combed and tightly buttoned up in
boots and with the hounds From politeness I admired the stupid beasts
harriers are all exceedingly stupid Tchertophanov spat right into
Ammalats nostrils which did not however apparently afford that dog
the slightest satisfaction Nedopyuskin too stroked Ammalat from
behind We began chatting again By degrees Tchertophanov unbent
completely and no longer stood on his dignity nor snorted defiantly
the expression of his face changed He glanced at me and at
Nedopyuskin

Hey he cried suddenly why should she sit in there alone Masha hi
Masha come in here

Some one stirred in the next room but there was no answer

Maasha Tchertophanov repeated caressingly come in here Its all
right dont be afraid

The door was softly opened and I caught sight of a tall and slender
girl of twenty with a dark gypsy face goldenbrown eyes and hair
black as pitch her large white teeth gleamed between full red lips She
had on a white dress a blue shawl pinned close round her throat with a
gold brooch half hid her slender beautiful arms in which one could
see the fineness of her race She took two steps with the bashful
awkwardness of some wild creature stood still and looked down

Come let me introduce said Panteley Eremyitch wife she is not but
shes to be respected as a wife

Masha flushed slightly and smiled in confusion I made her a low bow I
thought her very charming The delicate falcon nose with distended
halftransparent nostrils the bold sweep of her high eyebrows the
pale almost sunken cheeksevery feature of her face denoted wilful
passion and reckless devilry From under the coil of her hair two rows
of little shining hairs ran down her broad necka sign of race and
vigour

She went to the window and sat down I did not want to increase her
embarrassment and began talking with Tchertophanov Masha turned her
head slyly and began peeping from under her eyelids at me stealthily
shyly and swiftly Her glance seemed to flash out like a snakes sting
Nedopyuskin sat beside her and whispered something in her ear She
smiled again When she smiled her nose slightly puckered up and her
upper lip was raised which gave her face something of the expression of
a cat or a lion

Oh but youre one of the hands off sort I thought in my turn
stealing a look at her supple frame her hollow breast and her quick
angular movements

Masha Tchertophanov asked dont you think we ought to give our
visitor some entertainment eh

Weve got some jam she replied

Well bring the jam here and some vodka too while youre about it
And I say Masha he shouted after her bring the guitar in too

Whats the guitar for Im not going to sing

Why

I dont want to

Oh nonsense youll want to when

What asked Masha rapidly knitting her brows

When youre asked Tchertophanov went on with some embarrassment

Oh

She went out soon came back with jam and vodka and again sat by the
window There was still a line to be seen on her forehead the two
eyebrows rose and drooped like a wasps antennae Have you ever
noticed reader what a wicked face the wasp has Well I thought
Im in for a storm The conversation flagged Nedopyuskin shut up
completely and wore a forced smile Tchertophanov panted turned red
and opened his eyes wide I was on the point of taking leave
Suddenly Masha got up flung open the window thrust out her head and
shouted lustily to a passing peasant woman Aksinya The woman
started and tried to turn round but slipped down and flopped heavily
on to a dungheap Masha threw herself back and laughed merrily
Tchertophanov laughed too Nedopyuskin shrieked with delight We all
revived The storm had passed off in one flash of lightning the air
was clear again

Halfanhour later no one would have recognised us we were chatting
and frolicking like children Masha was the merriest of all
Tchertophanov simply could not take his eyes off her Her face grew
paler her nostrils dilated her eyes glowed and darkened at the same
time It was a wild creature at play Nedopyuskin limped after her on
his short fat little legs like a drake after a duck Even Venzor
crawled out of his hidingplace in the hall stood a moment in the
doorway glanced at us and suddenly fell to jumping up into the air and
barking Masha flitted into the other room fetched the guitar flung
off the shawl from her shoulders seated herself quickly and raising
her head began singing a gypsy song Her voice rang out vibrating like
a glass bell when it is struck it flamed up and died away It filled
the heart with sweetness and pain Tchertophanov fell to dancing
Nedopyuskin stamped and swung his legs in tune Masha was all aquiver
like birchbark in the fire her delicate fingers flew playfully over
the guitar her darkskinned throat slowly heaved under the two rows of
amber All at once she would cease singing sink into exhaustion and
twang the guitar as it were involuntarily and Tchertophanov stood
still merely working his shoulders and turning round in one place
while Nedopyuskin nodded his head like a Chinese figure then she would
break out into song like a mad thing drawing herself up and holding up
her head and Tchertophanov again curtsied down to the ground leaped
up to the ceiling spun round like a top crying Quicker

Quicker quicker quicker Nedopyuskin chimed in speaking very fast

It was late in the evening when I left Bezsonovo

THE END OF TCHERTOPHANOV

I

It was two years after my visit that Panteley Eremyitchs troubles
beganhis real troubles Disappointments disasters even misfortunes
he had had before that time but he had paid no attention to them and
had risen superior to them in former days The first blow that fell upon
him was the most heartrending for him Masha left him

What induced her to forsake his roof where she seemed to be so
thoroughly at home it is hard to say Tchertophanov to the end of his
days clung to the conviction that a certain young neighbour a retired
captain of Uhlans named Yaff was at the root of Mashas desertion He
had taken her fancy according to Panteley Eremyitch simply by
constantly curling his moustaches pomading himself to excess and
sniggering significantly but one must suppose that the vagrant gypsy
blood in Mashas veins had more to do with it However that may have
been one fine summer evening Masha tied up a few odds and ends in a
small bundle and walked out of Tchertophanovs house

For three days before this she had sat crouched up in a corner huddled
against the wall like a wounded fox and had not spoken a word to any
one she had only turned her eyes about and twitched her eyebrows and
faintly gnashed her teeth and moved her arms as though she were
wrapping herself up This mood had come upon her before but had never
lasted long Tchertophanov knew that and so he neither worried himself
nor worried her But when on coming in from the kennels where in his
huntsmans words the last two hounds had departed he met a servant
girl who in a trembling voice informed him that Marya Akinfyevna sent
him her greetings and left word that she wished him every happiness
but she was not coming back to him any more Tchertophanov after
reeling round where he stood and uttering a hoarse yell rushed at once
after the runaway snatching up his pistol as he went

He overtook her a mile and a half from his house near a birch wood on
the highroad to the district town The sun was sinking on the horizon
and everything was suddenly suffused with purple glowtrees plants
and earth alike

To Yaff to Yaff groaned Tchertophanov directly he caught sight of
Masha Going to Yaff he repeated running up to her and almost
stumbling at every step

Masha stood still and turned round facing him

She stood with her back to the light and looked all black as though
she had been carved out of dark wood only the whites of her eyes stood
out like silvery almonds but the eyes themselvesthe pupilswere
darker than ever

She flung her bundle aside and folded her arms You are going to Yaff
wretched girl repeated Tchertophanov and he was on the point of
seizing her by the shoulder but meeting her eyes he was abashed and
stood uneasily where he was

I am not going to Mr Yaff Panteley Eremyitch replied Masha in soft
even tones its only I cant live with you any longer

Cant live with me Why not Have I offended you in some way

Masha shook her head Youve not offended me in any way Panteley
Eremyitch only my heart is heavy in your house Thanks for the past
but I cant stayno

Tchertophanov was amazed he positively slapped his thighs and bounced
up and down in his astonishment

How is that Here shes gone on living with me and known nothing but
peace and happiness and all of a suddenher hearts heavy and she
flings me over She goes and puts a kerchief on her head and is gone
She received every respect like any lady

I dont care for that in the least Masha interrupted

Dont care for it From a wandering gypsy to turn into a lady and she
doesnt care for it How dont you care for it you lowborn slave Do
you expect me to believe that Theres treachery hidden in
ittreachery

He began frowning again

Theres no treachery in my thoughts and never has been said Masha in
her distinct resonant voice Ive told you already my heart was
heavy

Masha cried Tchertophanov striking himself a blow on the chest with
his fist there stop it hush you have tortured me now its
enough O my God think only what Tisha will say you might have pity on
him at least

Remember me to Tihon Ivanitch and tell him

Tchertophanov wrung his hands No you are talking nonsenseyou are
not going Your Yaff may wait for you in vain

Mr Yaff Masha was beginning

A fine Mister Yaff Tchertophanov mimicked her Hes an
underhand rascal a low curthats what he isand a phiz like an
apes

For fully halfanhour Tchertophanov was struggling with Masha He came
close to her he fell back he shook his fists at her he bowed down
before her he wept he scolded

I cant repeated Masha I am so sad at heart devoured by
weariness

Little by little her face assumed such an indifferent almost drowsy
expression that Tchertophanov asked her if they had not drugged her
with laudanum

Its weariness she said for the tenth time

Then what if I kill you he cried suddenly and he pulled the pistol
out of his pocket

Masha smiled her face brightened

Well kill me Panteley Eremyitch as you will but go back I wont

You wont come back Tchertophanov cocked the pistol

I wont go back my dearie Never in my life will I go back My word is
steadfast

Tchertophanov suddenly thrust the pistol into her hand and sat down on
the ground

Then you kill me Without you I dont care to live I have grown
loathsome to youand everythings loathsome for me

Masha bent down took up her bundle laid the pistol on the grass its
mouth away from Tchertophanov and went up to him

Ah my dearie why torture yourself Dont you know what we gypsy girls
are Its our nature you must make up your mind to it When there comes
weariness the divider and calls the soul away to strange distant
parts how is one to stay here Dont forget your Masha you wont find
such another sweetheart and I wont forget you my dearie but our life
togethers over

I loved you Masha Tchertophanov muttered into the fingers in which
he had buried his face

And I loved you little friend Panteley Eremyitch

I love you I love you madly senselesslyand when I think now that
you in your right senses without rhyme or reason are leaving me like
this and going to wander over the face of the earthwell it strikes
me that if I werent a poor penniless devil you wouldnt be throwing me
over

At these words Masha only laughed

And he used to say I didnt care for money she commented and she
gave Tchertophanov a vigorous thump on the shoulder

He jumped up on to his feet

Come at least you must let me give you some moneyhow can you go like
this without a halfpenny But best of all kill me I tell you plainly
kill me once for all

Masha shook her head again Kill you Why get sent to Siberia my
dearie

Tchertophanov shuddered Then its only from thatfrom fear of penal
servitude

He rolled on the grass again

Masha stood over him in silence Im sorry for you dear she said
with a sigh youre a good fellow but theres no help for it
goodbye

She turned away and took two steps The night had come on by now and
dim shadows were closing in on all sides Tchertophanov jumped up
swiftly and seized Masha from behind by her two elbows

You are going away like this serpent to Yaff

Goodbye Masha repeated sharply and significantly she tore herself
away and walked off

Tchertophanov looked after her ran to the place where the pistol was
lying snatched it up took aim fired But before he touched the
trigger his arm twitched upwards the ball whistled over Mashas head
She looked at him over her shoulder without stopping and went on
swinging as she walked as though in defiance of him

He hid his faceand fell to running

But before he had run fifty paces he suddenly stood still as though
turned to stone A wellknown too wellknown voice came floating to
him Masha was singing It was in the sweet days of youth she sang
every note seemed to linger plaintive and ardent in the evening air
Tchertophanov listened intently The voice retreated and retreated at
one moment it died away at the next it floated across hardly audible
but still with the same passionate glow

She does it to spite me thought Tchertophanov but at once he
moaned oh no its her last farewell to me for everand he burst
into floods of tears

                                   

The next day he appeared at the lodgings of Mr Yaff who as a true man
of the world not liking the solitude of the country resided in the
district town to be nearer the young ladies as he expressed it
Tchertophanov did not find Yaff he had in the words of his valet set
off for Moscow the evening before

Then it is so cried Tchertophanov furiously there was an
arrangement between them she has run away with him but wait a bit

He broke into the young cavalry captains room in spite of the
resistance of the valet In the room there was hanging over the sofa a
portrait in oils of the master in the Uhlan uniform Ah here you are
you tailless ape thundered Tchertophanov he jumped on to the sofa
and with a blow of his fist burst a big hole in the taut canvas

Tell your worthless master he turned to the valet that in the
absence of his own filthy phiz the nobleman Tchertophanov put a hole
through the painted one and if he cares for satisfaction from me he
knows where to find the nobleman Tchertophanov or else Ill find him
out myself Ill fetch the rascally ape from the bottom of the sea

Saying these words Tchertophanov jumped off the sofa and majestically
withdrew

But the cavalry captain Yaff did not demand satisfaction from
himindeed he never met him anywhereand Tchertophanov did not think
of seeking his enemy out and no scandal followed Masha herself soon
after this disappeared beyond all trace Tchertophanov took to drink
however he reformed later But then a second blow fell upon him




II

This was the death of his bosom friend Tihon Ivanovitch Nedopyuskin His
health had begun to fail two years before his death he began to suffer
from asthma and was constantly dropping asleep and on waking up could
not at once come to himself the district doctor maintained that this
was the result of something rather like fits During the three days
which preceded Mashas departure those three days when her heart was
heavy Nedopyuskin had been away at his own place at Bezselendyevka he
had been laid up with a severe cold Mashas conduct was consequently
even more unexpected for him it made almost a deeper impression on him
than on Tchertophanov himself With his natural sweetness and
diffidence he gave utterance to nothing but the tenderest sympathy with
his friend and the most painful perplexity but it crushed and made
havoc of everything in him She has torn the heart out of me he would
murmur to himself as he sat on his favourite checked sofa and twisted
his fingers Even when Tchertophanov had got over it he Nedopyuskin
did not recover and still felt that there was a void within him
Here he would say pointing to the middle of his breast above his
stomach In that way he lingered on till the winter When the frosts
came his asthma got better but he was visited by not something
rather like a fit this time but a real unmistakable fit He did not
lose his memory at once he still knew Tchertophanov and his friends
cry of despair How can you desert me Tisha without my consent just
as Masha did He even responded with faltering uncertain tongue
OPaeyEeyitch I will obey you

This did not however prevent him from dying the same day without
waiting for the district doctor who on seeing the hardly cold body
found nothing left for him to do but with a melancholy recognition of
the instability of all things mortal to ask for a drop of vodka and a
snack of fish As might have been anticipated Tihon Ivanitch had
bequeathed his property to his revered patron and generous protector
Panteley Eremyitch Tchertophanov but it was of no great benefit to the
revered patron as it was shortly after sold by public auction partly
in order to cover the expense of a sepulchral monument a statue which
Tchertophanov and one can see his fathers craze coming out in him
here had thought fit to put up over the ashes of his friend This
statue which was to have represented an angel praying was ordered by
him from Moscow but the agent recommended to him conceiving that
connoisseurs in sculpture were not often to be met with in the
provinces sent him instead of an angel a goddess Flora which had for
many years adorned one of those neglected gardens near Moscow laid out
in the days of Catherine He had an excellent reason for doing so since
this statue though highly artistic in the rococo style with plump
little arms tossing curls a wreath of roses round the bare bosom and
a serpentine figure was obtained by him the agent for nothing And so
to this day the mythological goddess stands with one foot elegantly
lifted above the tomb of Tihon Ivanovitch and with a genuinely
Pompadour simper gazes at the calves and sheep those invariable
visitors of our village graveyards as they stray about her

On the loss of his faithful friend Tchertophanov again took to drink
and this time far more seriously Everything went utterly to the bad
with him He had no money left for sport the last of his meagre fortune
was spent the last of his few servants ran away Panteley Eremyitchs
isolation became complete he had no one to speak a word to even far
less to open his heart to His pride alone had suffered no diminution
On the contrary the worse his surroundings became the more haughty and
lofty and inaccessible he was himself He became a complete misanthrope
in the end One distraction one delight was left him a superb grey
horse of the Don breed named by him MalekAdel a really wonderful
animal

This horse came into his possession in this fashion

As he was riding one day through a neighbouring village Tchertophanov
heard a crowd of peasants shouting and hooting before a tavern In the
middle of the crowd stalwart arms were continually rising and falling in
exactly the same place

What is happening there he asked in the peremptory tone peculiar to
him of an old peasant woman who was standing on the threshold of her
hut Leaning against the doorpost as though dozing the old woman stared
in the direction of the tavern A whiteheaded urchin in a print smock
with a cypresswood cross on his little bare breast was sitting with
little outstretched legs and little clenched fists between her bast
slippers a chicken close by was chipping at a stale crust of ryebread

The Lord knows your honour answered the old woman Bending forward
she laid her wrinkled brown hand on the childs head They say our lads
are beating a Jew

A Jew What Jew

The Lord knows your honour A Jew came among us and where hes come
fromwho knows Vassya come to your mammy sir sh sh nasty brute

The old woman drove away the chicken while Vassya clung to her
petticoat

So you see theyre beating him sir

Why beating him What for

I dont know your honour No doubt he deserves it And indeed why
not beat him You know your honour he crucified Christ

Tchertophanov uttered a whoop gave his horse a lash on the neck with
the ridingwhip flew straight towards the crowd and plunging into it
began with the same ridingwhip thrashing the peasants to left and to
right indiscriminately shouting in broken tones Lawless brutes
lawless brutes Its for the law to punish and not private persons
The law the law the law

Before two minutes had passed the crowd had beaten a retreat in various
directions and on the ground before the tavern door could be seen a
small thin swarthy creature in a nankin long coat dishevelled and
mangled a pale face rolling eyes open mouth What was it
deadly terror or death itself

Why have you killed this Jew Tchertophanov shouted at the top of his
voice brandishing his ridingwhip menacingly

The crowd faintly roared in response One peasant was rubbing his
shoulder another his side a third his nose

Youre pretty free with your whip was heard in the back rows

Why have you killed the Jew you christened Pagans repeated
Tchertophanov

But at this point the creature lying on the ground hurriedly jumped on
to its feet and running up to Tchertophanov convulsively seized hold
of the edge of the saddle

Alive was heard in the background

Hes a regular cat

Your exshelency defend me save me the unhappy Jew was faltering
meanwhile his whole body squeezed up against Tchertophanovs foot or
they will murder me they will murder me your exshelency

What have they against you asked Tchertophanov

I cant tell so help me God Some cow hereabouts died so they
suspect me but I Well that well go into later
Tchertophanov interrupted but now you hold on to the saddle and
follow me And you he added turning to the crowd do you know
meIm the landowner Panteley Tchertophanov I live at
Bezsonovoand so you can take proceedings against me when you think
fitand against the Jew too while youre about it

Why take proceedings said a greybearded decentlooking peasant
bowing low the very picture of an ancient patriarch He had been no
whit behind the others in belabouring the Jew however We know your
honour Panteley Eremyitch well we thank your honour humbly for
teaching us better

Why take proceedings chimed in the others

As to the Jew well take it out of him another day He wont escape
us We shall be on the lookout for him

Tchertophanov pulled his moustaches snorted and went home at a
walking pace accompanied by the Jew whom he had delivered from his
persecutors just as he had once delivered Tihon Nedopyuskin



IV


A few days later the one groom who was left to Tchertophanov announced
that someone had come on horseback and wanted to speak to him
Tchertophanov went out on to the steps and recognised the Jew riding a
splendid horse of the Don breed which stood proud and motionless in the
middle of the courtyard The Jew was bareheaded he held his cap under
his arm and had thrust his feet into the stirrupstraps not into the
stirrups themselves the ragged skirts of his long coat hung down on
both sides of the saddle On seeing Tchertophanov he gave a smack with
his lips and ducked down with a twitch of the elbows and a bend of the
legs Tchertophanov however not only failed to respond to his
greeting but was even enraged by it he was all on fire in a minute a
scurvy Jew dare to ride a magnificent horse like that It was
positively indecent

Hi you Ethiopian fright he shouted get off at once if you dont
want to be flung off into the mud

The Jew promptly obeyed rolled off the horse like a sack and keeping
hold of the rein with one hand he approached Tchertophanov smiling
and bowing

What do you want Panteley Eremyitch inquired with dignity

Your exshelency deign to look what a horse said the Jew never
ceasing to bow for an instant

Er well the horse is all right Where did you get it from
Stole it I suppose

How can you say that your exshelency Im an honest Jew I didnt
steal it but I obtained it for your exshelencyreally And the
trouble the trouble I had to get it But then see what a horse it is
Theres not another horse like it to be found in all the Don country
Look your exshelency what a horse it is Here kindly step this way
Wo wo turn round stand sideways And well take off the
saddle What do you think of him your exshelency

The horse is all right repeated Tchertophanov with affected
indifference though his heart was beating like a sledgehammer in his
breast He was a passionate lover of horseflesh and knew a good
thing when he saw it

Only take a look at him your exshelency Pat him on the neck yes
yes hehehehe like this like this

Tchertophanov with apparent reluctance laid his hand on the horses
neck gave it a pat or two then passed his fingers from the forelock
along the spine and when he had reached a certain spot above the
kidneys like a connoisseur he lightly pressed that spot The horse
instantly arched its spine and looking round suspiciously at
Tchertophanov with its haughty black eye snorted and moved its hind
legs

The Jew laughed and faintly clapped his hands He knows his master
your exshelency his master

Dont talk nonsense Tchertophanov interrupted with vexation To buy
this horse from you I havent the means and as for presents I not
only wouldnt take them from a Jew I wouldnt take a present from
Almighty God Himself

As though I would presume to offer you a present mercy upon me cried
the Jew you buy it your exshelency and as to the little sumI
can wait for it

Tchertophanov sank into thought

What will you take for it he muttered at last between his teeth

The Jew shrugged his shoulders

What I paid for it myself Two hundred roubles

The horse was well worth twiceperhaps even three times that sum

Tchertophanov turned away and yawned feverishly

And the money when he asked scowling furiously and not looking
at the Jew

When your exshelency thinks fit

Tchertophanov flung his head back but did not raise his eyes Thats
no answer Speak plainly son of Herod Am I to be under an obligation
to you hey

Well lets say then the Jew hastened to add in six months time
Do you agree

Tchertophanov made no reply

The Jew tried to get a look at his face Do you agree You permit him
to be led to your stable

The saddle I dont want Tchertophanov blurted out abruptly Take
the saddledo you hear

To be sure to be sure I will take it faltered the delighted Jew
shouldering the saddle

And the money Tchertophanov pursued in six months And not two
hundred but two hundred and fifty Not a word Two hundred and fifty I
tell you to my account

Tchertophanov still could not bring himself to raise his eyes Never
had his pride been so cruelly wounded

Its plain its a present was the thought in his mind hes brought
it out of gratitude the devil And he would have liked to kiss the
Jew and he would have liked to beat him

Your exshelency began the Jew gaining a little courage and
grinning all over his face should after the Russian fashion take
from hand to hand

What next what an idea A Hebrew and Russian customs Hey you
there Take the horse lead him to the stable And give him some oats
Ill come myself and look after him And his name is to beMalekAdel

Tchertophanov turned to go up the steps but turning sharply back and
running up to the Jew he pressed his hand warmly The latter was
bending down to kiss his hand but Tchertophanov bounded back again
and murmuring Tell no one he vanished through the door




V

From that very day the chief interest the chief occupation the chief
pleasure in the life of Tchertophanov was MalekAdel He loved him as
he had not loved even Masha he became more attached to him than even to
Nedopyuskin And what a horse it was All firesimply explosive as
gunpowderand stately as a boyar Untiring enduring obedient
whatever you might put him to and costing nothing for his keep hed be
ready to nibble at the ground under his feet if there was nothing else
When he stepped at a walking pace it was like being lulled to sleep in
a nurses arms when he trotted it was like rocking at sea when he
galloped he outstripped the wind Never out of breath perfectly sound
in his wind Sinews of steel for him to stumble was a thing never
recorded To take a ditch or a fence was nothing to himand what a
clever beast At his masters voice he would run with his head in the
air if you told him to stand still and walked away from him he would
not stir directly you turned back a faint neigh to say Here I am
And afraid of nothing in the pitchdark in a snowstorm he would find
his way and he would not let a stranger come near him for anything he
would have had his teeth in him And a dog dare never approach him he
would have his foreleg on his head in a minute and that was the end of
the beast A horse of proper pride you might flourish a switch over him
as an ornamentbut God forbid you touched him But why say morea
perfect treasure not a horse

If Tchertophanov set to describing his MalekAdel he could not find
words to express himself And how he petted and pampered him His coat
shone like silvernot old but new silverwith a dark polish on it if
one passed ones hand over it it was like velvet His saddle his
cloth his bridleall his trappings in fact were so wellfitted in
such good order so brighta perfect picture Tchertophanov
himselfwhat more can we saywith his own hands plaited his
favourites forelocks and mane and washed his tail with beer and even
more than once rubbed his hoofs with polish Sometimes he would mount
MalekAdel and ride out not to see his neighbourshe avoided them as
of oldbut across their lands past their homesteads for them poor
fools to admire him from a distance Or he would hear that there was to
be a hunt somewhere that a rich landowner had arranged a meet in some
outlying part of his land he would be off there at once and would
canter in the distance on the horizon astounding all spectators by the
swiftness and beauty of his horse and not letting any one come close to
him Once some hunting landowner even gave chase to him with all his
suite he saw Tchertophanov was getting away and he began shouting
after him with all his might as he galloped at full speed Hey you
Here Take what you like for your horse I wouldnt grudge a thousand
Id give my wife my children Take my last farthing

Tchertophanov suddenly reined in MalekAdel The hunting gentleman flew
up to him My dear sir he shouted tell me what you want My dear
friend

If you were the Tsar said Tchertophanov emphatically and he had
never heard of Shakespeare you might give me all your kingdom for my
horse I wouldnt take it He uttered these words chuckled drew
MalekAdel up on to his haunches turned him in the air on his hind legs
like a top or teetotum and off He went like a flash over the stubble
And the hunting man a rich prince they said he was flung his cap on
the ground threw himself down with his face in his cap and lay so for
half an hour

And how could Tchertophanov fail to prize his horse Was it not thanks
to him he had again an unmistakable superiority a last superiority
over all his neighbours




VI

Meanwhile time went by the day fixed for payment was approaching
while far from having two hundred and fifty roubles Tchertophanov had
not even fifty What was to be done how could it be met Well he
decided at last if the Jew is relentless if he wont wait any longer
Ill give him my house and my land and Ill set off on my horse no
matter where Ill starve before Ill give up MalekAdel He was
greatly perturbed and even downcast but at this juncture Fate for the
first and last time was pitiful and smiled upon him some distant
kinswoman whose very name was unknown to Tchertophanov left him in
her will a sum immense in his eyesno less than two thousand roubles
And he received this sum in the very nick as they say of time the day
before the Jew was to come Tchertophanov almost went out of his mind
with joy but he never even thought of vodka from the very day
MalekAdel came into his hands he had not touched a drop

He ran into the stable and kissed his favourite on both sides of his
face above the nostrils where the horses skin is always so soft Now
we shall not be parted he cried patting MalekAdel on the neck under
his wellcombed mane When he went back into the house he counted out
and sealed up in a packet two hundred and fifty roubles Then as he lay
on his back and smoked a pipe he mused on how he would lay out the rest
of the moneywhat dogs he would procure real Kostroma hounds spot and
tan and no mistake He even had a little talk with Perfishka to whom
he promised a new Cossack coat with yellow braid on all the seams and
went to bed in a blissful frame of mind

He had a bad dream he dreamt he was riding out hunting not on
MalekAdel but on some strange beast of the nature of a unicorn a
white fox white as snow ran to meet him He tried to crack his
whip tried to set the dogs on herbut instead of his ridingwhip he
found he had a wisp of bast in his hand and the fox ran in front of
him putting her tongue out at him He jumped off his unicorn stumbled
he fell and fell straight into the arms of a policeconstable who
was taking him before the GovernorGeneral and whom he recognised as
Yaff

Tchertophanov waked up The room was dark the cocks were just crowing
for the second time Somewhere in the far far distance a horse
neighed Tchertophanov lifted up his head Once more a faint faint
neigh was heard

Thats MalekAdel neighing was his thought Its his neigh But
why so far away Bless us and save us It cant be

Tchertophanov suddenly turned chill all over he instantly leaped out
of bed fumbled after his boots and his clothes dressed himself and
snatching up the stabledoor key from under his pillow he dashed out
into the courtyard




VII

The stable was at the very end of the courtyard one wall faced the open
country Tchertophanov could not at once fit the key into the lockhis
hands were shakingand he did not immediately turn the key He stood
motionless holding his breath if only something would stir inside
Malek Malek he cried in a low voice the silence of death
Tchertophanov unconsciously jogged the key the door creaked and
opened So it was not locked He stepped over the threshold and
again called his horse this time by his full name MalekAdel But no
response came from his faithful companion only a mouse rustled in the
straw Then Tchertophanov rushed into one of the three horseboxes in
the stable in which MalekAdel was put He went straight to the
horsebox though it was pitchdark around Empty Tchertophanovs
head went round it seemed as though a bell was booming in his brain He
tried to say something but only brought out a sort of hiss and
fumbling with his hands above below on all sides breathless with
shaking knees he made his way from one horsebox to another to a
third full almost to the top with hay stumbled against one wall and
then the other fell down rolled over on his head got up and suddenly
ran headlong through the halfopen door into the courtyard

Stolen Perfishka Perfishka Stolen he yelled at the top of his
voice

The groom Perfishka flew headoverheels out of the loft where he slept
with only his shirt on

Like drunk men they ran against one another the master and his solitary
servant in the middle of the courtyard like madmen they turned round
each other The master could not explain what was the matter nor could
the servant make out what was wanted of him Woe woe wailed
Tchertophanov Woe woe the groom repeated after him A lantern
here light a lantern Light light broke at last from
Tchertophanovs fainting lips Perfishka rushed into the house

But to light the lantern to get fire was not easy lucifer matches
were regarded as a rarity in those days in Russia the last embers had
long ago gone out in the kitchen flint and steel were not quickly
found and they did not work well Gnashing his teeth Tchertophanov
snatched them out of the hands of the flustered Perfishka and began
striking a light himself the sparks fell in abundance in still greater
abundance fell curses and even groans but the tinder either did not
catch or went out again in spite of the united efforts of four swollen
cheeks and lips to blow it into a flame At last in five minutes not
sooner a bit of tallow candle was alight at the bottom of a battered
lantern and Tchertophanov accompanied by Perfishka dashed into the
stable lifted the lantern above his head looked round

All empty

He bounded out into the courtyard ran up and down it in all
directionsno horse anywhere The hurdlefence enclosing Panteley
Eremyitchs yard had long been dilapidated and in many places was bent
and lying on the ground Beside the stable it had been completely
levelled for a good yards width Perfishka pointed this spot out to
Tchertophanov

Master look here this wasnt like this today And see the ends of
the uprights sticking out of the ground that means someone has pulled
them out

Tchertophanov ran up with the lantern moved it about over the
ground

Hoofs hoofs prints of horseshoes fresh prints he muttered
speaking hurriedly They took him through here through here

He instantly leaped over the fence and with a shout MalekAdel
MalekAdel he ran straight into the open country

Perfishka remained standing bewildered at the fence The ring of light
from the lantern was soon lost to his eyes swallowed up in the dense
darkness of a starless moonless night

Fainter and fainter came the sound of the despairing cries of
Tchertophanov




VIII

It was daylight when he came home again He hardly looked like a human
being His clothes were covered with mud his face had a wild and
ferocious expression his eyes looked dull and sullen In a hoarse
whisper he drove Perfishka away and locked himself in his room He
could hardly stand with fatigue but he did not lie on his bed but sat
down on a chair by the door and clutched at his head

Stolen stolen

But in what way had the thief contrived by night when the stable was
locked to steal MalekAdel MalekAdel who would never let a stranger
come near him even by daysteal him too without noise without a
sound And how explain that not a yarddog had barked It was true there
were only two lefttwo young puppiesand those two probably burrowing
in rubbish from cold and hungerbut still

And what am I to do now without MalekAdel Tchertophanov brooded
Ive lost my last pleasure now its time to die Buy another horse
seeing the money has come But where find another horse like that

Panteley Eremyitch Panteley Eremyitch he heard a timid call at the
door

Tchertophanov jumped on to his feet

Who is it he shouted in a voice not his own

Its I your groom Perfishka

What do you want Is he found has he run home

No Panteley Eremyitch but that Jew chap who sold him

Well

Hes come

Hohohohoho yelled Tchertophanov and he at once flung open the
door Drag him here drag him along

On seeing the sudden apparition of his benefactors dishevelled
wildlooking figure the Jew who was standing behind Perfishkas back
tried to give them the slip but Tchertophanov in two bounds was upon
him and like a tiger flew at his throat

Ah hes come for the money for the money he cried as hoarsely as
though he were being strangled himself instead of strangling the Jew
you stole him by night and are come by day for the money eh Eh Eh

Mercy on us your exshelency the Jew tried to groan out

Tell me wheres my horse What have you done with him Whom have you
sold him to Tell me tell me tell me

The Jew by now could not even groan his face was rapidly turning livid
and even the expression of fear had vanished from it His hands dropped
and hung lifeless his whole body furiously shaken by Tchertophanov
waved backwards and forwards like a reed

Ill pay you your money Ill pay it you in full to the last farthing
roared Tchertophanov but Ill strangle you like any chicken if you
dont tell me at once

But you have strangled him already master observed the groom
Perfishka humbly

Then only Tchertophanov came to his senses

He let go of the Jews neck the latter fell heavily to the ground
Tchertophanov picked him up sat him on a bench poured a glass of
vodka down his throat and restored him to consciousness And having
restored him to consciousness he began to talk to him

It turned out that the Jew had not the slightest idea that MalekAdel
had been stolen And indeed what motive could he have to steal the
horse which he had himself procured for his revered Panteley
Eremyitch

Then Tchertophanov led him into the stable

Together they scrutinised the horseboxes the manger and the lock on
the door turned over the hay and the straw and then went into the
courtyard Tchertophanov showed the Jew the hoofprints at the fence
and all at once he slapped his thighs

Stay he cried Where did you buy the horse

In the district of Maloarchangel at Verhosensky Fair answered the
Jew

Of whom

A Cossack

Stay This Cossack was he a young man or old

Middleageda steady man

And what was he like What did he look like A cunning rascal I
expect

Sure to have been a rascal your exshelency

And I say what did he say this rascalhad he had the horse long

I recollect he said hed had it a long while

Well then no one could have stolen him but he Consider it yourself
listen stand here Whats your name

The Jew started and turned his little black eyes upon Tchertophanov

Whats my name

Yes yes what are you called

Moshel Leyba

Well judge then Moshel Leyba my friendyoure a man of sensewhom
would MalekAdel have allowed to touch him except his old master You
see he must have saddled him and bridled him and taken off his
cloththere it is lying on the hay and made all his arrangements
simply as if he were at home Why anyone except his master MalekAdel
would have trampled under foot Hed have raised such a din hed have
roused the whole village Do you agree with me

I agree I agree your exshelency

Well then it follows that first of all we must find this Cossack

But how are we to find him your exshelency I have only seen him one
little time in my life and where is he now and whats his name Alack
alack added the Jew shaking the long curls over his ears sorrowfully

Leyba shouted Tchertophanov suddenly Leyba look at me You see
Ive lost my senses Im not myself I shall lay hands on myself if
you dont come to my aid

But how can I

Come with me and let us find the thief

But where shall we go

Well go to the fairs the highways and byways to the horsestealers
to towns and villages and hamletseverywhere everywhere And dont
trouble about money Ive come into a fortune brother Ill spend my
last farthing but Ill get my darling back And he shant escape us
our enemy the Cossack Where he goes well go If hes hidden in the
earth well follow him If hes gone to the devil well follow him to
Satan himself

Oh why to Satan observed the Jew we can do without him

Leyba Tchertophanov went on Leyba though youre a Jew and your
creeds an accursed one youve a soul better than many a Christian
soul Have pity on me I cant go alone alone I can never carry the
thing through Im a hotheaded fellow but youve a braina brain
worth its weight in gold Your race are like that you succeed in
everything without being taught Youre wondering perhaps where I
could have got the money Come into my roomIll show you all the
money You may take it you may take the cross off my neck only give me
back MalekAdel give him me back again

Tchertophanov was shivering as if he were in a fever the sweat rolled
down his face in drops and mingling with his tears was lost in his
moustaches He pressed Leybas hands he besought him he almost kissed
him He was in a sort of delirium The Jew tried to object to
declare that it was utterly impossible for him to get away that he had
business It was useless Tchertophanov would not even hear
anything There was no help for it the poor Jew consented

The next day Tchertophanov set out from Bezsonovo in a peasant cart
with Leyba The Jew wore a somewhat troubled aspect he held on to the
rail with one hand while all his withered figure bounded up and down on
the jolting seat the other hand he held pressed to his bosom where lay
a packet of notes wrapped up in newspaper Tchertophanov sat like a
statue only moving his eyes about him and drawing in deep breaths in
his sash there was stuck a dagger

There the miscreant who has parted us must look out for himself now
he muttered as they drove out on the highroad

His house he left in the charge of Perfishka and an old cook a deaf old
peasant woman whom he took care of out of compassion

I shall come back to you on MalekAdel he shouted to them at parting
or never come back at all

You might as well be married to me at once jested Perfishka giving
the cook a dig in the ribs with his elbow No fear the masterll never
come back to us and here I shall be bored to death all alone




IX


A year passed a whole year no news had come of Panteley Eremyitch
The cook was dead Perfishka himself made up his mind to abandon the
house and go off to town where he was constantly being persuaded to
come by his cousin apprenticed to a barber when suddenly a rumour was
set afloat that his master was coming back The parish deacon got a
letter from Panteley Eremyitch himself in which he informed him of his
intention of arriving at Bezsonovo and asked him to prepare his servant
to be ready for his immediate return These words Perfishka understood
to mean that he was to sweep up the place a bit He did not however
put much confidence in the news he was convinced though that the
deacon had spoken the truth when a few days later Panteley Eremyitch in
person appeared in the courtyard riding on MalekAdel

Perfishka rushed up to his master and holding the stirrup would have
helped him to dismount but the latter got off alone and with a
triumphant glance about him cried in a loud voice I said I would find
MalekAdel and I have found him in spite of my enemies and of Fate
itself Perfishka went up to kiss his hand but Tchertophanov paid no
attention to his servants devotion Leading MalekAdel after him by the
rein he went with long strides towards the stable Perfishka looked
more intently at his master and his heart sank Oh how thin and old
hes grown in a year and what a stern grim face One would have
thought Panteley Eremyitch would have been rejoicing that he had gained
his end and he was rejoicing certainly and yet Perfishkas heart
sank he even felt a sort of dread Tchertophanov put the horse in its
old place gave him a light pat on the back and said There now
youre at home again and mind what youre about The same day he hired
a freedman out of work as watchman established himself again in his
rooms and began living as before

Not altogether as before however but of that later

The day after his return Panteley Eremyitch called Perfishka in to him
and for want of anyone else to talk to began telling himkeeping up
of course his sense of his own dignity and his bass voicehow he had
succeeded in finding MalekAdel Tchertophanov sat facing the window
while he told his story and smoked a pipe with a long tube while
Perfishka stood in the doorway his hands behind his back and
respectfully contemplating the back of his masters head heard him
relate how after many fruitless efforts and idle expeditions Panteley
Eremyitch had at last come to the fair at Romyon by himself without the
Jew Leyba who through weakness of character had not persevered but
had deserted him how on the fifth day when he was on the point of
leaving he walked for the last time along the rows of carts and all at
once he saw between three other horses fastened to the railingshe saw
MalekAdel How he knew him at once and how MalekAdel knew him too
and began neighing and dragging at his tether and scraping the earth
with his hoof

And he was not with the Cossack Tchertophanov went on still not
turning his head and in the same bass voice but with a gypsy
horsedealer I of course at once took hold of my horse and tried to
get him away by force but the brute of a gypsy started yelling as if
hed been scalded all over the market and began swearing hed bought
the horse off another gypsyand wanted to bring witnesses to prove
it I spat and paid him the money damn the fellow All I cared for
was that I had found my favourite and had got back my peace of mind
Moreover in the Karatchevsky district I took a man for the CossackI
took the Jew Leybas word for it that he was my thiefand smashed his
face for him but the Cossack turned out to be a priests son and got
damages out of mea hundred and twenty roubles Well moneys a thing
one may get again but the great thing is Ive MalekAdel back again
Im happy nowIm going to enjoy myself in peace And Ive one
instruction to give you Perfishka if ever you which God forbid catch
sight of the Cossack in this neighbourhood run the very minute without
saying a word and bring me my gun and I shall know what to do

This was what Panteley Eremyitch said to Perfishka this was how his
tongue spoke but at heart he was not so completely at peace as he
declared

Alas in his heart of hearts he was not perfectly convinced that the
horse he had brought back was really MalekAdel




X

Troubled times followed for Panteley Eremyitch Peace was just the last
thing he enjoyed He had some happy days it is true the doubt stirring
within him would seem to him all nonsense he would drive away the
ridiculous idea like a persistent fly and even laugh at himself but
he had bad days too the importunate thought began again stealthily
gnawing and tearing at his heart like a mouse under the floor and he
existed in secret torture On the memorable day when he found
MalekAdel Tchertophanov had felt nothing but rapturous bliss but
the next morning when in a lowpitched shed of the inn he began
saddling his recovered joy beside whom he had spent the whole night he
felt for the first time a certain secret pang He only shook his
head but the seed was sown During the homeward journey it lasted a
whole week doubts seldom arose in him they grew stronger and more
distinct directly he was back at Bezsonovo directly he was home again
in the place where the old authentic MalekAdel had lived On the
road home he had ridden at a quiet swinging pace looking in all
directions smoking a short pipe and not reflecting at all except at
times the thought struck him When the Tchertophanovs want a thing
they get it you bet and he smiled to himself but on his return home
it was a very different state of things All this however he kept to
himself vanity alone would have prevented him from giving utterance to
his inner dread He would have torn anyone to pieces who had dropped the
most distant hint that the new MalekAdel was possibly not the old one
he accepted congratulations on his successful recovery of his horse
from the few persons whom he happened to meet but he did not seek such
congratulations he avoided all contact with people more than evera
bad sign He was almost always putting MalekAdel through examinations
if one may use the expression he would ride him out to some point at a
little distance in the open country and put him to the proof or would
go stealthily into the stable lock the door after him and standing
right before the horses head look into his eyes and ask him in a
whisper Is it you Is it you You or else stare at him silently
and intently for hours together and then mutter brightening up Yes
its he Of course its he or else go out with a puzzled even
confused look on his face Tchertophanov was not so much confused by
the physical differences between this MalekAdel and that
one though there were a few such differences that ones tail
and mane were a little thinner and his ears more pointed and his
pasterns shorter and his eyes brighterbut all that might be only
fancy what confounded Tchertophanov most were so to say the moral
differences The habits of that one had been different all his
ways were not the same For instance that MalekAdel had looked
round and given a faint neigh every time Tchertophanov went into the
stable while this one went on munching hay as though nothing had
happened or dozed with his head bent Both of them stood still when
their master leaped out of the saddle but that one came at once
at his voice when he was called while this one stood stock
still That one galloped as fast but with higher and longer
bounds this one went with a freer step and at a more jolting
trot and at times wriggled with his shoesthat is knocked the back
one against the front one that one had never done anything so
disgracefulGod forbid This one it struck Tchertophanov kept
twitching his ears in such a stupid way while with that one it
was quite the contrary he used to lay one ear back and hold it so as
though on the alert for his master That one directly he saw
that it was dirty about him would at once knock on the partition of his
box with his hindleg but this one did not care if the dung was
heaped up to his belly That one if for instance he were set
facing the wind would take deep breaths and shake himself this
one simply snorted that one was put out by the rain this
one cared nothing for it This was a coarser beastcoarser And
there wasnt the gentleness in it and hard in the mouth it wasno
denying it That horse was a darling but this

This was what Tchertophanov sometimes thought and very bitter were
such thoughts to him At other times he would set his horse at full
gallop over some newly ploughed field or would make him leap down to
the very bottom of a hollow ravine and leap out again at the very
steepest point and his heart would throb with rapture a loud whoop
would break from his lips and he would know would know for certain
that it was the real authentic MalekAdel he had under him for what
other horse could do what this one was doing

However there were sometimes shortcomings and misfortunes even here
The prolonged search for MalekAdel had cost Tchertophanov a great deal
of money he did not even dream of Kostroma hounds now and rode about
the neighbourhood in solitude as before So one morning four miles from
Bezsonovo Tchertophanov chanced to come upon the same princes hunting
party before whom he had cut such a triumphant figure a year and a half
before And as fate would have it just as on that day a hare must go
leaping out from the hedge before the dogs down the hillside Tallyho
Tallyho All the hunt fairly flew after it and Tchertophanov flew
along too but not with the rest of the party but two hundred paces to
one side of it just as he had done the time before A huge watercourse
ran zigzagging across the hillside and as it rose higher and higher got
gradually narrower cutting off Tchertophanovs path At the point
where he had to jump it and where eighteen months before he actually
had jumped it it was eight feet wide and fourteen feet deep In
anticipation of a triumpha triumph repeated in such a delightful
wayTchertophanov chuckled exultantly cracked his ridingwhip the
hunting party were galloping too their eyes fixed on the daring rider
his horse whizzed along like a bullet and now the watercourse was just
under his nosenow now at one leap as then But MalekAdel pulled
up sharply wheeled to the left and in spite of Tchertophanovs
tugging him to the edge to the watercourse he galloped along beside
the ravine

He was afraid then did not trust himself

Then Tchertophanov burning with shame and wrath almost in tears
dropped the reins and set the horse going straight forward down the
hill away away from the hunting party if only not to hear them
jeering at him to escape as soon as might be from their damnable eyes

Covered with foam his sides lashed unmercifully MalekAdel galloped
home and Tchertophanov at once locked himself into his room

No its not he its not my darling He would have broken his neck
before he would have betrayed me




XI

What finally did for as they say Tchertophanov was the following
circumstance One day he sauntered riding on MalekAdel about the
backyards of the priests quarters round about the church of the parish
in which is Bezsonovo Huddled up with his Cossack fur cap pulled down
over his eyes and his hands hanging loose on the saddlebow he jogged
slowly on a vague discontent in his heart Suddenly someone called him

He stopped his horse raised his head and saw his correspondent the
deacon With a brown threecornered hat on his brown hair which was
plaited in a pigtail attired in a yellowish nankin long coat girt
much below the waist by a strip of blue stuff the servant of the altar
had come out into his backgarden and catching sight of Panteley
Eremyitch he thought it his duty to pay his respects to him and to
take the opportunity of doing so to ask him a question about something
Without some such hidden motive as we know ecclesiastical persons do
not venture to address temporal ones

But Tchertophanov was in no mood for the deacon he barely responded to
his bow and muttering something between his teeth he was already
cracking his whip when

What a magnificent horse you have the deacon made haste to add and
really you can take credit to yourself for it Truly youre a man of
amazing cleverness simply a lion indeed

His reverence the deacon prided himself on his fluency which was a
great source of vexation to his reverence the priest to whom the gift
of words had not been vouchsafed even vodka did not loosen his tongue

After losing one animal by the cunning of evil men continued the
deacon you did not lose courage in repining but on the other hand
trusting the more confidently in Divine Providence procured yourself
another in no wise inferior but even one may say superior
since

What nonsense are you talking Tchertophanov interrupted gloomily
what other horse do you mean This is the same one this is
MalekAdel I found him The fellows raving

Ay ay ay responded the deacon emphatically with a sort of drawl
drumming with his fingers in his beard and eyeing Tchertophanov with
his bright eager eyes Hows that sir Your horse God help my memory
was stolen a fortnight before Intercession last year and now were near
the end of November

Well what of that

The deacon still fingered his beard

Why it follows that more than a years gone by since then and your
horse was a dapple grey then just as it is now in fact it seems even
darker Hows that Grey horses get a great deal lighter in colour in a
year

Tchertophanov started as though someone had driven a dagger into
his heart It was true the grey colour did change How was it such a
simple reflection had never occurred to him

You damned pigtail get out he yelled suddenly his eyes flashing
with fury and instantaneously he disappeared out of the sight of the
amazed deacon

Well everything was over

Now at last everything was really over everything was shattered the
last card trumped Everything crumbled away at once before that word
lighter

Grey horses get lighter in colour

Gallop gallop on accursed brute You can never gallop away from that
word

Tchertophanov flew home and again locked himself up




XII

That this worthless jade was not MalekAdel that between him and
MalekAdel there was not the smallest resemblance that any man of the
slightest sense would have seen this from the first minute that he
Tchertophanov had been taken in in the vulgarest wayno that he
purposely of set intent tricked himself blinded his own eyesof all
this he had not now the faintest doubt

Tchertophanov walked up and down in his room turning monotonously on
his heels at each wall like a beast in a cage His vanity suffered
intolerably but he was not only tortured by the sting of wounded
vanity he was overwhelmed by despair stifled by rage and burning with
the thirst for revenge But rage against whom On whom was he to be
revenged On the Jew Yaff Masha the deacon the Cossackthief all
his neighbours the whole world himself His brain was giving way The
last card was trumped That simile gratified him And he was again the
most worthless the most contemptible of men a common laughingstock a
motley fool a damned idiot an object for jibesto a deacon He
fancied he pictured vividly how that loathsome pigtailed priest would
tell the story of the grey horse and the foolish gentleman O damn
In vain Tchertophanov tried to check his rising passion in vain he
tried to assure himself that this horse though not MalekAdel was
still a good horse and might be of service to him for many years to
come he put this thought away from him on the spot with fury as though
there were contained in it a new insult to that MalekAdel whom
he considered he had wronged so already Yes indeed this jade this
carrion he like a blind idiot had put on a level with him MalekAdel
And as to the service the jade could be to him as though he would
ever deign to get astride of him Never on no consideration He
would sell him to a Tartar for dogs meatit deserved no better end
Yes that would be best

For more than two hours Tchertophanov wandered up and down his room

Perfishka he called peremptorily all of a sudden run this minute to
the tavern fetch a gallon of vodka Do you hear A gallon and look
sharp I want the vodka here this very second on the table

The vodka was not long in making its appearance on Panteley Eremyitchs
table and he began drinking




XIII

If anyone had looked at Tchertophanov then if anyone could have been a
witness of the sullen exasperation with which he drained glass after
glasshe would inevitably have felt an involuntary shudder of fear The
night came on the tallow candle burnt dimly on the table
Tchertophanov ceased wandering from corner to corner he sat all
flushed with dull eyes which he dropped at one time on the floor at
another fixed obstinately on the dark window he got up poured out some
vodka drank it off sat down again again fixed his eyes on one point
and did not stironly his breathing grew quicker and his face still
more flushed It seemed as though some resolution were ripening within
him which he was himself ashamed of but which he was gradually getting
used to one single thought kept obstinately and undeviatingly moving up
closer and closer one single image stood out more and more distinctly
and under the burning weight of heavy drunkenness the angry irritation
was replaced by a feeling of ferocity in his heart and a vindictive
smile appeared on his lips

Yes the time has come he declared in a matteroffact almost weary
tone I must get to work

He drank off the last glass of vodka took from over his bed the
pistolthe very pistol from which he had shot at Mashaloaded it put
some cartridges in his pocketto be ready for anythingand went round
to the stables

The watchman ran up to him when he began to open the door but he
shouted to him Its I Are you blind Get out The watchman moved a
little aside Get out and go to bed Tchertophanov shouted at him
again theres nothing for you to guard here A mighty wonder a
treasure indeed to watch over He went into the stable MalekAdel
the spurious MalekAdel was lying on his litter Tchertophanov gave
him a kick saying Get up you brute Then he unhooked a halter from
a nail took off the horsecloth and flung it on the ground and roughly
turning the submissive horse round in the box led it out into the
courtyard and from the yard into the open country to the great
amazement of the watchman who could not make out at all where the
master was going off to by night leading an unharnessed horse He was
of course afraid to question him and only followed him with his eyes
till he disappeared at the bend in the road leading to a neighbouring
wood




XIV

Tchertophanov walked with long strides not stopping nor looking round
MalekAdelwe will call him by that name to the endfollowed him
meekly It was a rather clear night Tchertophanov could make out the
jagged outline of the forest which formed a black mass in front of him
When he got into the chill night air he would certainly have thrown off
the intoxication of the vodka he had drunk if it had not been for
another stronger intoxication which completely overmastered him His
head was heavy his blood pulsed in thuds in his throat and ears but he
went on steadily and knew where he was going

He had made up his mind to kill MalekAdel he had thought of nothing
else the whole day Now he had made up his mind

He went out to do this thing not only calmly but confidently
unhesitatingly as a man going about something from a sense of duty
This job seemed a very simple thing to him in making an end of the
impostor he was quits with everyone at oncehe punished himself for
his stupidity and made expiation to his real darling and showed the
whole world Tchertophanov worried himself a great deal about the
whole world that he was not to be trifled with And above all he
was making an end of himself too with the impostorfor what had he to
live for now How all this took shape in his brain and why it seemed
to him so simpleit is not easy to explain though not altogether
impossible stung to the quick solitary without a human soul near to
him without a halfpenny and with his blood on fire with vodka he was
in a state bordering on madness and there is no doubt that even in the
absurdest freaks of mad people there is to their eyes a sort of logic
and even justice Of his justice Tchertophanov was at any rate fully
persuaded he did not hesitate he made haste to carry out sentence on
the guilty without giving himself any clear definition of whom he meant
by that term To tell the truth he reflected very little on what he
was about to do I must I must make an end was what he kept stupidly
and severely repeating to himself I must make an end

And the guiltless guilty one followed in a submissive trot behind his
back But there was no pity for him in Tchertophanovs heart




XV

Not far from the forest to which he was leading his horse there
stretched a small ravine half overgrown with young oak bushes
Tchertophanov went down into it MalekAdel stumbled and almost fell
on him

So you would crush me would you you damned brute shouted
Tchertophanov and as though in selfdefence he pulled the pistol out
of his pocket He no longer felt furious exasperation but that special
numbness of the senses which they say comes over a man before the
perpetration of a crime But his own voice terrified himit sounded so
wild and strange under the cover of dark branches in the close decaying
dampness of the forest ravine Moreover in response to his exclamation
some great bird suddenly fluttered in a treetop above his head
Tchertophanov shuddered He had as it were roused a witness to his
actand where In that silent place where he should not have met a
living creature

Away with you devil to the four winds of heaven he muttered and
letting go MalekAdels rein he gave him a violent blow on the shoulder
with the butt end of the pistol MalekAdel promptly turned back
clambered out of the ravine and ran away But the thud of his hoofs
was not long audible The rising wind confused and blended all sounds
together

Tchertophanov too slowly clambered out of the ravine reached the
forest and made his way along the road homewards He was ill at ease
with himself the weight he had felt in his head and his heart had
spread over all his limbs he walked angry gloomy dissatisfied
hungry as though some one had insulted him snatched his prey his food
from him

The suicide baffled in his intent must know such sensations

Suddenly something poked him behind between his shoulder blades He
looked round MalekAdel was standing in the middle of the road He
had walked after his master he touched him with his nose to announce
himself

Ah shouted Tchertophanov of yourself of yourself you have come to
your death So there

In the twinkling of an eye he had snatched out his pistol drawn the
trigger turned the muzzle on MalekAdels brow fired

The poor horse sprung aside rose on its haunches bounded ten paces
away and suddenly fell heavily and gasped as it writhed upon the
ground

Tchertophanov put his two hands over his ears and ran away His knees
were shaking under him His drunkenness and revenge and blind
selfconfidenceall had flown at once There was left nothing but a
sense of shame and loathingand the consciousness unmistakeable that
this time he had put an end to himself too




XVI

Six weeks later the groom Perfishka thought it his duty to stop the
commissioner of police as he happened to be passing Bezsonovo

What do you want inquired the guardian of order

If you please your excellency come into our house answered the
groom with a low bow

Panteley Eremyitch I fancy is about to die so that Im afraid of
getting into trouble

What die queried the commissioner

Yes sir First his honour drank vodka every day and now hes taken
to his bed and got very thin I fancy his honour does not understand
anything now Hes lost his tongue completely

The commissioner got out of his trap

Have you sent for the priest at least Has your master been confessed
Taken the sacrament

No sir

The commissioner frowned How is that my boy How can that behey
Dont you know that for that youre liable to have to answer
heavilyhey

Indeed and I did ask him the day before yesterday and yesterday
again protested the intimidated groom Wouldnt you Panteley
Eremyitch says I let me run for the priest sir You hold your
tongue idiot says he mind your own business But today when I
began to address him his honour only looked at me and twitched his
moustache

And has he been drinking a great deal of vodka inquired the
commissioner

Rather But if you would be so good your honour come into his room

Well lead the way grumbled the commissioner and he followed
Perfishka

An astounding sight was in store for him In a damp dark backroom on
a wretched bedstead covered with a horsecloth with a rough felt cloak
for a pillow lay Tchertophanov He was not pale now but yellowish
green like a corpse with sunken eyes under leaden lids and a sharp
pinched nosestill reddishabove his dishevelled whiskers He lay
dressed in his invariable Caucasian coat with the cartridge pockets on
the breast and blue Circassian trousers A Cossack cap with a crimson
crown covered his forehead to his very eyebrows In one hand
Tchertophanov held his hunting whip in the other an embroidered
tobacco pouchMashas last gift to him On a table near the bed stood
an empty spirit bottle and at the head of the bed were two watercolour
sketches pinned to the wall one represented as far as could be made
out a fat man with a guitar in his handprobably Nedopyuskin the
other portrayed a horseman galloping at full speed The horse was
like those fabulous animals which are sketched by children on walls and
fences but the carefully washedin dappling of the horses grey coat
and the cartridge pocket on the riders breast the pointed toes of his
boots and the immense moustaches left no room for doubtthis sketch
was meant to represent Panteley Eremyitch riding on MalekAdel

The astonished commissioner of police did not know how to proceed The
silence of death reigned in the room Why hes dead already he
thought and raising his voice he said Panteley Eremyitch Eh
Panteley Eremyitch

Then something extraordinary occurred Tchertophanovs eyelids slowly
opened the eyes fast growing dim moved first from right to left then
from left to right rested on the commissionersaw him Something
gleamed in their dull whites the semblance of a flash came back to
them the blue lips were gradually unglued and a hoarse almost
sepulchral voice was heard

Panteley Eremyitch of the ancient hereditary nobility is dying who can
hinder him He owes no man anything asks nothing from any one Leave
him people Go

The hand holding the whip tried to lift it In vain The lips cleaved
together again the eyes closed and as before Tchertophanov lay on his
comfortless bed flat as an empty sack and his feet close together

Let me know when he dies the commissioner whispered to Perfishka as
he went out of the room and I suppose you can send for the priest now
You must observe due order give him extreme unction

Perfishka went that same day for the priest and the following morning
he had to let the commissioner know Panteley Eremyitch had died in the
night

When they buried him two men followed his coffin the groom Perfishka
and Moshel Leyba The news of Tchertophanovs death had somehow reached
the Jew and he did not fail to pay this last act of respect to his
benefactor

A LIVING RELIC

  O native land of long suffering
   Land of the Russian people
                                    F TYUTCHEV

A French proverb says that a dry fisherman and a wet hunter are a sorry
sight Never having had any taste for fishing I cannot decide what are
the fishermans feelings in fine bright weather and how far in bad
weather the pleasure derived from the abundance of fish compensates for
the unpleasantness of being wet But for the sportsman rain is a real
calamity It was to just this calamity that Yermola and I were exposed
on one of our expeditions after grouse in the Byelevsky district The
rain never ceased from early morning What didnt we do to escape it We
put macintosh capes almost right over our heads and stood under the
trees to avoid the raindrops The waterproof capes to say nothing of
their hindering our shooting let the water through in the most
shameless fashion and under the trees though at first certainly the
rain did not reach us afterwards the water collected on the leaves
suddenly rushed through every branch dripped on us like a waterspout a
chill stream made its way under our neckties and trickled down our
spines This was quite unpleasant as Yermola expressed it No
Piotr Petrovitch he cried at last we cant go on like
thisTheres no shooting today The dogs scent is drowned The guns
miss firePugh What a mess

Whats to be done I queried

Well lets go to Aleksyevka You dont know it perhapstheres a
settlement of that name belonging to your mother its seven miles from
here Well stay the night there and tomorrow

Come back here

No not hereI know of some places beyond Aleksyevkaever so much
better than here for grouse

I did not proceed to question my faithful companion why he had not taken
me to those parts before and the same day we made our way to my
mothers peasant settlement the existence of which I must confess I
had not even suspected up till then At this settlement it turned out
there was a little lodge It was very old but as it had not been
inhabited it was clean I passed a fairly tranquil night in it

The next day I woke up very early The sun had only just risen there
was not a single cloud in the sky everything around shone with a double
brilliancethe brightness of the fresh morning rays and of yesterdays
downpour While they were harnessing me a cart I went for a stroll
about a small orchard now neglected and run wild which enclosed the
little lodge on all sides with its fragrant sappy growth Ah how sweet
it was in the open air under the bright sky where the larks were
trilling whence their belllike notes rained down like silvery beads
On their wings doubtless they had carried off drops of dew and their
songs seemed steeped in dew I took my cap off my head and drew a glad
deep breath On the slope of a shallow ravine close to the hedge
could be seen a beehive a narrow path led to it winding like a snake
between dense walls of high grass and nettles above which struggled up
God knows whence brought the pointed stalks of darkgreen hemp

I turned along this path I reached the beehive Beside it stood a
little wattled shanty where they put the beehives for the winter I
peeped into the halfopen door it was dark still dry within there
was a scent of mint and balm In the corner were some trestles fitted
together and on them covered with a quilt a little figure of some
sort I was walking away

Master master Piotr Petrovitch I heard a voice faint slow and
hoarse like the whispering of marsh rushes

I stopped

Piotr Petrovitch Come in please the voice repeated It came from
the corner where were the trestles I had noticed

I drew near and was struck dumb with amazement Before me lay a living
human being but what sort of a creature was it

A head utterly withered of a uniform coppery huelike some very
ancient holy picture yellow with age a sharp nose like a keenedged
knife the lips could barely be seenonly the teeth flashed white and
the eyes and from under the kerchief some thin wisps of yellow hair
straggled on to the forehead At the chin where the quilt was folded
two tiny hands of the same coppery hue were moving the fingers slowly
twitching like little sticks I looked more intently the face far from
being ugly was positively beautiful but strange and dreadful and the
face seemed the more dreadful to me that on iton its metallic
cheeksI saw strugglingstruggling and unable to form itselfa
smile

You dont recognise me master whispered the voice again it seemed
to be breathed from the almost unmoving lips And indeed how should
you Im LukeryaDo you remember who used to lead the dance at your
mothers at Spasskoye Do you remember I used to be leader of the
choir too

Lukerya I cried Is it you Can it be

Yes its I masterI Lukerya

I did not know what to say and gazed in stupefaction at the dark
motionless face with the clear deathlike eyes fastened upon me Was it
possible This mummy Lukeryathe greatest beauty in all our
householdthat tall plump pinkandwhite singing laughing dancing
creature Lukerya our smart Lukerya whom all our lads were courting
for whom I heaved some secret sighsI a boy of sixteen

Mercy Lukerya I said at last what is it has happened to you

Oh such a misfortune befel me But dont mind me sir dont let my
trouble revolt you sit there on that little tuba little nearer or
you wont be able to hear meIve not much of a voice
nowadays Well I am glad to see you What brought you to
Aleksyevka

Lukerya spoke very softly and feebly but without pausing

Yermola the huntsman brought me here But you tell me

Tell you about my trouble Certainly sir It happened to me a long
while ago nowsix or seven years I had only just been betrothed then
to Vassily Polyakovdo you remember such a finelooking fellow he was
with curly hairhe waited at table at your mothers But you werent
in the country then you had gone away to Moscow to your studies We
were very much in love Vassily and me I could never get him out of my
head and it was in the spring it all happened Well one nightnot
long before sunrise it wasI couldnt sleep a nightingale in the
garden was singing so wonderfully sweet I could not help getting up
and going out on to the steps to listen It trilled and trilled and
all at once I fancied some one called me it seemed like Vassyas voice
so softly Lusha I looked round and being half asleep I suppose
I missed my footing and fell straight down from the topstep and flop
on to the ground And I thought I wasnt much hurt for I got up
directly and went back to my room Only it seems something inside mein
my bodywas broken Let me get my breathhalf a minute sir

Lukerya ceased and I looked at her with surprise What surprised me
particularly was that she told her story almost cheerfully without
sighs and groans not complaining nor asking for sympathy

Ever since that happened Lukerya went on I began to pine away and
get thin my skin got dark walking was difficult for me and thenI
lost the use of my legs altogether I couldnt stand or sit I had to
lie down all the time And I didnt care to eat or drink I got worse
and worse Your mamma in the kindness of her heart made me see
doctors and sent me to a hospital But there was no curing me And not
one doctor could even say what my illness was What didnt they do to
methey burnt my spine with hot irons they put me in lumps of ice
and it was all no good I got quite numb in the end

So the gentlemen decided it was no use doctoring me any more and there
was no sense in keeping cripples up at the great house well and so
they sent me herebecause Ive relations here So here I live as you
see

Lukerya was silent again and again she tried to smile

But this is awfulyour position I cried and not knowing how to
go on I asked and what of Vassily Polyakov A most stupid question
it was

Lukerya turned her eyes a little away

What of Polyakov He grievedhe grieved for a bitand he is married
to another a girl from Glinnoe Do you know Glinnoe Its not far from
us Her names Agrafena He loved me dearlybut you see hes a young
man he couldnt stay a bachelor And what sort of a helpmeet could I
be The wife he found for himself is a good sweet womanand they have
children He lives here hes a clerk at a neighbours your mamma let
him go off with a passport and hes doing very well praise God

And so you go on lying here all the time I asked again

Yes sir Ive been lying here seven years In the summertime I lie
here in this shanty and when it gets cold they move me out into the
bathhouse I lie there

Who waits on you Does any one look after you

Oh there are kind folks here as everywhere they dont desert me Yes
they see to me a little As to food I eat nothing to speak of but
water is here in the pitcher its always kept full of pure spring
water I can reach to the pitcher myself Ive one arm still of use
Theres a little girl here an orphan now and then she comes to see me
the kind child She was here just now You didnt meet her Such a
pretty fair little thing She brings me flowers Weve some in the
gardenthere were somebut theyve all disappeared But you know
wild flowers too are nice they smell even sweeter than garden flowers
Lilies of the valley now what could be sweeter

And arent you dull and miserable my poor Lukerya

Why what is one to do I wouldnt tell a lie about it At first it was
very wearisome but later on I got used to it I got more patientit
was nothing there are others worse off still

How do you mean

Why some havent a roof to shelter them and there are some blind or
deaf while I thank God have splendid sight and hear
everythingeverything If a mole burrows in the groundI hear even
that And I can smell every scent even the faintest When the buckwheat
comes into flower in the meadow or the limetree in the gardenI dont
need to be told of it even Im the first to know directly Anyway if
theres the least bit of a wind blowing from that quarter No he who
stirs Gods wrath is far worse off than me Look at this again anyone
in health may easily fall into sin but Im cut off even from sin The
other day father Aleksy the priest came to give me the sacrament and
he says Theres no need says he to confess you you cant fall
into sin in your condition can you But I said to him How about
sinning in thought father Ah well says he and he laughed
himself thats no great sin

But I fancy Im no great sinner even in that way in thought Lukerya
went on for Ive trained myself not to think and above all not to
remember The time goes faster

I must own I was astonished Youre always alone Lukerya how can you
prevent the thoughts from coming into your head or are you constantly
asleep

Oh no sir I cant always sleep Though Ive no great pain still
Ive an ache there right inside and in my bones too it wont let me
sleep as I ought No but there I lie by myself I lie here and lie
here and dont think I feel that Im alive I breathe and I put
myself all into that I look and listen The bees buzz and hum in the
hive a dove sits on the roof and coos a hen comes along with her
chickens to peck up crumbs or a sparrow flies in or a
butterflythats a great treat for me Last year some swallows even
built a nest over there in the corner and brought up their little ones
Oh how interesting it was One would fly to the nest press close feed
a young one and off again Look again the other would be in her place
already Sometimes it wouldnt fly in but only fly past the open door
and the little ones would begin to squeak and open their beaks
directlyI was hoping for them back again the next year but they say
a sportsman here shot them with his gun And what could he gain by it
Its hardly bigger the swallow than a beetleWhat wicked men you
are you sportsmen

I dont shoot swallows I hastened to remark

And once Lukerya began again it was comical really A hare ran in
it did really The hounds I suppose were after it anyway it seemed
to tumble straight in at the door It squatted quite near me and sat
so a long while it kept sniffing with its nose and twitching its
whiskerslike a regular officer and it looked at me It understood to
be sure that I was no danger to it At last it got up went hophop to
the door looked round in the doorway and what did it look like Such a
funny fellow it was

Lukerya glanced at me as much as to say Wasnt it funny To satisfy
her I laughed She moistened her parched lips

Well in the winter of course Im worse off because its dark to
burn a candle would be a pity and what would be the use I can read to
be sure and was always fond of reading but what could I read There
are no books of any kind and even if there were how could I hold a
book Father Aleksy brought me a calendar to entertain me but he saw it
was no good so he took and carried it away again But even though its
dark theres always something to listen to a cricket chirps or a
mouse begins scratching somewhere Thats when its a good thingnot to
think

And I repeat the prayers too Lukerya went on after taking breath a
little only I dont know many of themthe prayers I mean And
besides why should I weary the Lord God What can I ask Him for He
knows better than I what I need He has laid a cross upon me that means
that He loves me So we are commanded to understand I repeat the Lords
Prayer the Hymn to the Virgin the Supplication of all the Afflicted
and I lie still again without any thought at all and am all right

Two minutes passed by I did not break the silence and did not stir on
the narrow tub which served me as a seat The cruel stony stillness of
the living unlucky creature lying before me communicated itself to me
I too turned as it were numb

Listen Lukerya I began at last listen to the suggestion Im going
to make to you Would you like me to arrange for them to take you to a
hospitala good hospital in the town Who knows perhaps you might yet
be cured anyway you would not be alone

Lukeryas eyebrows fluttered faintly Oh no sir she answered in a
troubled whisper dont move me into a hospital dont touch me I
shall only have more agony to bear there How could they cure me now
Why there was a doctor came here once he wanted to examine me I
begged him for Christs sake not to disturb me It was no use He
began turning me over pounding my hands and legs and pulling me about
He said Im doing this for Science Im a servant of Sciencea
scientific man And you he said really oughtnt to oppose me
because Ive a medal given me for my labours and its for you
simpletons Im toiling He mauled me about told me the name of my
diseasesome wonderful long nameand with that he went away and all
my poor bones ached for a week after You say Im all alone always
alone Oh no Im not always they come to see meIm quietI dont
bother them The peasant girls come in and chat a bit a pilgrim woman
will wander in and tell me tales of Jerusalem of Kiev of the holy
towns And Im not afraid of being alone Indeed its betteray ay
Master dont touch me dont take me to the hospital Thank you you
are kind only dont touch me theres a dear

Well as you like as you like Lukerya You know I only suggested it
for your good

I know master that it was for my good But master dear who can help
another Who can enter into his soul Every man must help himself You
wont believe me perhaps I lie here sometimes so aloneand its as
though there were no one else in the world but me As if I alone were
living And it seems to me as though something were blessing meIm
carried away by dreams that are really marvellous

What do you dream of then Lukerya

That too master I couldnt say one cant explain Besides one
forgets afterwards Its like a cloud coming over and bursting then it
grows so fresh and sweet but just what it was theres no knowing Only
my idea is if folks were near me I should have nothing of that and
should feel nothing except my misfortune

Lukerya heaved a painful sigh Her breathing like her limbs was not
under her control

When I come to think master of you she began again you are very
sorry for me But you mustnt be too sorry really Ill tell you one
thing for instance I sometimes even now Do you remember how merry
I used to be in my time A regular madcap So do you know what I sing
songs even now

Sing You

Yes I sing the old songs songs for choruses for feasts Christmas
songs all sorts I know such a lot of them you see and Ive not
forgotten them Only dance songs I dont sing In my state now it
wouldnt suit me

How do you sing themto yourself

To myself yes and aloud too I cant sing loud but still one can
understand it I told you a little girl waits on me A clever little
orphan she is So I have taught her four songs she has learnt from me
already Dont you believe me Wait a minute Ill show you
directly

Lukerya took breath The thought that this halfdead creature was
making ready to begin singing raised an involuntary feeling of dread in
me But before I could utter a word a longdrawnout hardly audible
but pure and true note was quivering in my ears it was followed by
a second and a third In the meadows sang Lukerya She sang the
expression of her stony face unchanged even her eyes riveted on one
spot But how touchingly tinkled out that poor struggling little voice
that wavered like a thread of smoke how she longed to pour out all her
soul in it I felt no dread now my heart throbbed with unutterable
pity

Ah I cant she said suddenly Ive not the strength Im so upset
with joy at seeing you

She closed her eyes

I laid my hand on her tiny chill fingers She glanced at me and her
dark lids fringed with golden eyelashes closed again and were still
as an ancient statues An instant later they glistened in the
halfdarkness They were moistened by a tear

As before I did not stir

How silly I am said Lukerya suddenly with unexpected force and
opened her eyes wide she tried to wink the tears out of them I ought
to be ashamed What am I doing Its a long time since I have been like
this not since that day when VassyaPolyakov was here last spring
While he sat with me and talked I was all right but when he had gone
away how I did cry in my loneliness Where did I get the tears from
But there we girls get our tears for nothing Master added Lukerya
perhaps you have a handkerchief If you wont mind wipe my eyes

I made haste to carry out her desire and left her the handkerchief She
refused it at first What goods such a gift to me she said The
handkerchief was plain enough but clean and white Afterwards she
clutched it in her weak fingers and did not loosen them again As I got
used to the darkness in which we both were I could clearly make out her
features could even perceive the delicate flush that peeped out under
the coppery hue of her face could discover in the face so at least it
seemed to me traces of its former beauty

You asked me master Lukerya began again whether I sleep I sleep
very little but every time I fall asleep Ive dreamssuch splendid
dreams Im never ill in my dreams Im always so well and young
Theres one things sad I wake up and long for a good stretch and Im
all as if I were in chains I once had such an exquisite dream Shall I
tell it you Well listen I dreamt I was standing in a meadow and all
round me was rye so tall and ripe as gold and I had a reddish dog
with mesuch a wicked dog it kept trying to bite me And I had a
sickle in my hands not a simple sickle it seemed to be the moon
itselfthe moon as it is when its the shape of a sickle And with this
same moon I had to cut the rye clean Only I was very weary with the
heat and the moon blinded me and I felt lazy and cornflowers were
growing all about and such big ones And they all turned their heads to
me And I thought in my dream I would pick them Vassya had promised to
come so Id pick myself a wreath first Id still time to plait it I
began picking cornflowers but they kept melting away from between my
fingers do what I would And I couldnt make myself a wreath And
meanwhile I heard someone coming up to me so close and calling
Lusha Lusha Ah I thought what a pity I hadnt time No
matter I put that moon on my head instead of cornflowers I put it on
like a tiara and I was all brightness directly I made the whole field
light around me And behold over the very top of the ears there came
gliding very quickly towards me not Vassya but Christ Himself And how
I knew it was Christ I cant say they dont paint Him like thatonly
it was He No beard tall young all in white only His belt was
golden and He held out His hand to me Fear not said He My bride
adorned follow Me you shall lead the choral dance in the heavenly
kingdom and sing the songs of Paradise And how I clung to His hand
My dog at once followed at my heels but then we began to float
upwards He in front His wings spread wide over all the sky long
like a seagullsand I after Him And my dog had to stay behind Then
only I understood that that dog was my illness and that in the heavenly
kingdom there was no place for it

Lukerya paused a minute

And I had another dream too she began again but may be it was a
vision I really dont know It seemed to me I was lying in this very
shanty and my dead parents father and mother come to me and bow low
to me but say nothing And I asked them Why do you bow down to me
father and mother Because they said you suffer much in this
world so that you have not only set free your own soul but have taken
a great burden from off us too And for us in the other world it is much
easier You have made an end of your own sins now you are expiating our
sins And having said this my parents bowed down to me again and I
could not see them there was nothing but the walls to be seen I was in
great doubt afterwards what had happened with me I even told the priest
of it in confession Only he thinks it was not a vision because visions
come only to the clerical gentry

And Ill tell you another dream Lukerya went on I dreamt I was
sitting on the highroad under a willow I had a stick had a wallet on
my shoulders and my head tied up in a kerchief just like a pilgrim
woman And I had to go somewhere a long long way off on a pilgrimage
And pilgrims kept coming past me they came along slowly all going one
way their faces were weary and all very much like one another And I
dreamt that moving about among them was a woman a head taller than the
rest and wearing a peculiar dress not like oursnot Russian And her
face too was peculiara worn face and severe And all the others moved
away from her but she suddenly turns and comes straight to me She
stood still and looked at me and her eyes were yellow large and
clear as a falcons And I ask her Who are you And she says to me
Im your death Instead of being frightened it was quite the other
way I was as pleased as could be I crossed myself And the woman my
death says to me Im sorry for you Lukerya but I cant take you
with me Farewell Good God how sad I was then Take me said I
good mother take me darling And my death turned to me and began
speaking to me I knew that she was appointing me my hour but
indistinctly incomprehensibly After St Peters day said she
With that I awoke Yes I have such wonderful dreams

Lukerya turned her eyes upwards and sank into thought

Only the sad thing is sometimes a whole week will go by without my
getting to sleep once Last year a lady came to see me and she gave me
a little bottle of medicine against sleeplessness she told me to take
ten drops at a time It did me so much good and I used to sleep only
the bottle was all finished long ago Do you know what medicine that
was and how to get it

The lady had obviously given Lukerya opium I promised to get her
another bottle like it and could not refrain from again wondering aloud
at her patience

Ah master she answered why do you say so What do you mean by
patience There Simeon Stylites now had patience certainly great
patience for thirty years he stood on a pillar And another saint had
himself buried in the earth right up to his breast and the ants ate
his face And Ill tell you what I was told by a good scholar there
was once a country and the Ishmaelites made war on it and they
tortured and killed all the inhabitants and do what they would the
people could not get rid of them And there appeared among these people
a holy virgin she took a great sword put on armour weighing eighty
pounds went out against the Ishmaelites and drove them all beyond the
sea Only when she had driven them out she said to them Now burn me
for that was my vow that I would die a death by fire for my people
And the Ishmaelites took her and burnt her and the people have been
free ever since then That was a noble deed now But what am I

I wondered to myself whence and in what shape the legend of Joan of Arc
had reached her and after a brief silence I asked Lukerya how old she
was

Twentyeight or nine It wont be thirty But why count the
years Ive something else to tell you

Lukerya suddenly gave a sort of choked cough and groaned

You are talking a great deal I observed to her it may be bad for
you

Its true she whispered hardly audibly its time to end our talk
but what does it matter Now when you leave me I can be silent as long
as I like Any way Ive opened my heart

I began bidding her goodbye I repeated my promise to send her the
medicine and asked her once more to think well and tell meif there
wasnt anything she wanted

I want nothing I am content with all thank God she articulated with
very great effort but with emotion God give good health to all But
there master you might speak a word to your mammathe peasants here
are poorif she could take the least bit off their rent Theyve not
land enough and no advantages They would pray to God for you
But I want nothing Im quite contented with all

I gave Lukerya my word that I would carry out her request and had
already walked to the door She called me back again

Do you remember master she said and there was a gleam of something
wonderful in her eyes and on her lips what hair I used to have Do you
remember right down to my knees It was long before I could make up my
mind to it Such hair as it was But how could it be kept combed In
my state So I had it cut off Yes Well goodbye master I
cant talk any more

That day before setting off to shoot I had a conversation with the
village constable about Lukerya I learnt from him that in the village
they called Lukerya the Living Relic that she gave them no trouble
however they never heard complaint or repining from her She asks
nothing but on the contrary shes grateful for everything a gentle
soul one must say if any there be Stricken of God so the constable
concluded for her sins one must suppose but we do not go into that
And as for judging her nono we do not judge her Let her be

                                   

A few weeks later I heard that Lukerya was dead So her death had come
for her and after St Peters day They told me that on the day of
her death she kept hearing the sound of bells though it was reckoned
over five miles from Aleksyevka to the church and it was a weekday
Lukerya however had said that the sounds came not from the church but
from above Probably she did not dare to sayfrom heaven




XXIV

THE RATTLING OF WHEELS

Ive something to tell you observed Yermola coming into the hut to
see me I had just had dinner and was lying down on a travelling bed to
rest a little after a fairly successful but fatiguing day of
grouseshootingit was somewhere about the th of July and the heat
was terrific Ive something to tell you all our shots gone

I jumped off the bed

All gone Hows that Why we took pretty nearly thirty pounds with us
from the villagea whole bag

Thats so and a big bag it was enough for a fortnight But theres no
knowing There must have been a hole come in it or something anyway
theres no shot thats to say theres enough for ten charges left

What are we to do now The very best places are before uswere
promised six coveys for tomorrow

Well send me to Tula Its not so far from here only forty miles
Ill fly like the wind and bring forty pounds of shot if you say the
word

But when would you go

Why directly Why put it off Only I say we shall have to hire
horses

Why hire horses Why not our own

We cant drive there with our own The shaft horse has gone lame
terribly

Since whens that

Well the other day the coachman took him to be shod So he was shod
and the blacksmith I suppose was clumsy Now he cant even step on
the hoof Its a front leg He lifts it up like a dog

Well theyve taken the shoe off I suppose at least

No theyve not but of course they ought to take it off A nails
been driven right into the flesh I should say

I ordered the coachman to be summoned It turned out that Yermola had
spoken the truth the shafthorse really could not put its hoof to the
ground I promptly gave orders for it to have the shoe taken off and to
be stood on damp clay

Then do you wish me to hire horses to go to Tula Yermola persisted

Do you suppose we can get horses in this wilderness I exclaimed with
involuntary irritation The village in which we found ourselves was a
desolate Godforsaken place all its inhabitants seemed to be
povertystricken we had difficulty in discovering one hut moderately
roomy and even that one had no chimney

Yes replied Yermola with his habitual equanimity what you said
about this village is true enough but there used to be living in this
very place one peasanta very clever fellow rich too He had nine
horses Hes dead and his eldest son manages it all now The mans a
perfect fool but still hes not had time to waste his fathers wealth
yet We can get horses from him If you say the word I will fetch him
His brothers Ive heard say are smart chapsbut still hes their
head

Why so

Becausehes the eldest Of course the younger ones must obey Here
Yermola in reference to younger brothers as a class expressed himself
with a vigour quite unsuitable for print

Ill fetch him Hes a simple fellow With him you cant fail to come
to terms

While Yermola went after his simple fellow the idea occurred to me
that it might be better for me to drive into Tula myself In the first
place taught by experience I had no very great confidence in Yermola
I had once sent him to the town for purchases he had promised to get
through all my commissions in one day and was gone a whole week drank
up all the money and came back on foot though he had set off in my
racing droshky And secondly I had an acquaintance in Tula a
horsedealer I might buy a horse off him to take the place of the
disabled shafthorse

The things decided I thought Ill drive over myself I can sleep
just as well on the roadluckily the coach is comfortable

Ive brought him cried Yermola rushing into the hut a quarter of an
hour later He was followed by a tall peasant in a white shirt blue
breeches and bast shoes with white eyebrows and shortsighted eyes a
wedgeshaped red beard a long swollen nose and a gaping mouth He
certainly did look simple

Here your honour observed Yermola he has horsesand hes
willing

So be surely I the peasant began hesitatingly in a rather hoarse
voice shaking his thin wisps of hair and drumming with his fingers on
the band of the cap he held in his hands Surely I

Whats your name I inquired

The peasant looked down and seemed to think deeply My name

Yes what are you called

Why my name ull beFilofey

Well then friend Filofey I hear you have horses Bring a team of
three herewell put them in my coachits a light oneand you drive
me in to Tula Theres a moon now at night its light and its cool
for driving What sort of a road have you here

The road Theres naught amiss with the road To the main road it will
be sixteen milesnot more Theres one little place a bit
awkward but naught amiss else

What sort of little place is it thats awkward

Well well have to cross the river by the ford

But are you thinking of going to Tula yourself inquired Yermola

Yes

Oh commented my faithful servant with a shake of his head Ohoh
he repeated then he spat on the floor and walked out of the room

The expedition to Tula obviously no longer presented any features of
interest to him it had become for him a dull and unattractive business

Do you know the road well I said addressing Filofey

Surely we know the road Only so to say please your honour cant
so on the sudden so to say

It appeared that Yermola on engaging Filofey had stated that he could
be sure that fool as he was hed be paid and nothing more
Filofey fool as he wasin Yermolas wordswas not satisfied with
this statement alone He demanded of me fifty roublesan exorbitant
price I offered him tena low price We fell to haggling Filofey at
first was stubborn then he began to come down but slowly Yermola
entering for an instant began assuring me that foolHes fond of
the word seemingly Filofey remarked in a low voicethat fool cant
reckon money at all and reminded me how twenty years ago a posting
tavern established by my mother at the crossing of two highroads came
to complete grief from the fact that the old houseserf who was put
there to manage it positively did not understand reckoning money but
valued sums simply by the number of coinsin fact gave silver coins in
change for copper though he would swear furiously all the time

Ugh you Filofey youre a regular Filofey Yermola jeered at
lastand he went out slamming the door angrily

Filofey made him no reply as though admitting that to be called Filofey
wasas a factnot very clever of him and that a man might fairly be
reproached for such a name though really it was the village priest was
to blame in the matter for not having done better by him at his
christening

At last we agreed however on the sum of twenty roubles He went off
for the horses and an hour later brought five for me to choose from
The horses turned out to be fairly good though their manes and tails
were tangled and their bellies round and taut as drums With Filofey
came two of his brothers not in the least like him Little blackeyed
sharpnosed fellows they certainly produced the impression of smart
chaps they talked a great deal very fastclacked away as Yermola
expressed itbut obeyed the elder brother

They dragged the coach out of the shed and were busy about it and the
horses for an hour and a half first they let out the traces which were
of cord then pulled them too tight again Both brothers were very much
set on harnessing the roan in the shafts because him can do best
going downhill but Filofey decided for the shaggy one So the
shaggy one was put in the shafts accordingly

They heaped the coach up with hay put the collar off the lame
shafthorse under the seat in case we might want to fit it on to the
horse to be bought at Tula Filofey who had managed to run home and
come back in a long white loose ancestral overcoat a high sugarloaf
cap and tarred boots clambered triumphantly up on to the box I took
my seat looking at my watch it was a quarter past ten Yermola did
not even say goodbye to mehe was engaged in beating his
ValetkaFilofey tugged at the reins and shouted in a thin thin voice
Hey you little ones

His brothers skipped away on both sides lashed the tracehorses under
the belly and the coach started turned out of the gates into the
street the shaggy one tried to turn off towards his own home but
Filofey brought him to reason with a few strokes of the whip and
behold we were already out of the village and rolling along a fairly
even road between closegrowing bushes of thick hazels

It was a still glorious night the very nicest for driving A breeze
rustled now and then in the bushes set the twigs swinging and died away
again in the sky could be seen motionless silvery clouds the moon
stood high and threw a bright light on all around I stretched myself on
the hay and was just beginning to doze but I remembered the
awkward place and started up

I say Filofey is it far to the ford

To the ford Itll be near upon seven miles

Seven miles I mused We shant get there for another hour I can
have a nap meanwhile Filofey do you know the road well I asked
again

Surely how could I fail to know it Its not the first time Ive
driven

He said something more but I had ceased to listen I was asleep

I was awakened not as often happens by my own intention of waking in
exactly an hour but by a sort of strange though faint lapping
gurgling sound at my very ear I raised my head

Wonderful to relate I was lying in the coach as before but all round
the coach half a foot not more from its edge a sheet of water lay
shining in the moonlight broken up into tiny distinct quivering
eddies I looked in front On the box with back bowed and head bent
Filofey was sitting like a statue and a little further on above the
rippling water I saw the curved arch of the yoke and the horses heads
and backs And everything as motionless as noiseless as though in some
enchanted realm in a dreama dream of fairyland What does it
mean I looked back from under the hood of the coach Why we are
in the middle of the river the bank was thirty paces from us

Filofey I cried

What he answered

What indeed Upon my word Where are we

In the river

I see were in the river But like this we shall be drowned directly
Is this how you cross the ford Eh Why youre asleep Filofey Answer
do

Ive made a little mistake observed my guide

Ive gone to one side a bit wrong but now weve got to wait a bit

Got to wait a bit What ever are we going to wait for

Well we must let the shaggy one look about him which way he turns his
head that way weve got to go

I raised myself on the hay The shafthorses head stood quite
motionless Above the head one could only see in the bright moonlight
one ear slightly twitching backwards and forwards

Why hes asleep too your shaggy one

No responded Filofey hes sniffing the water now

And everything was still again there was only the faint gurgle of the
water as before I sank into a state of torpor

Moonlight and night and the river and we in it

What is that croaking noise I asked Filofey

That Ducks in the reeds or else snakes

All of a sudden the head of the shafthorse shook his ears pricked up
he gave a snort began to move Hoho hohoo Filofey began suddenly
bawling at the top of his voice he sat up and brandished the whip The
coach was at once tugged away from where it had stuck it plunged
forward cleaving the waters of the river and moved along swaying and
lurching from side to side At first it seemed to me we were sinking
getting deeper however after two or three tugs and jolts the expanse
of water seemed suddenly lower It got lower and lower the coach
seemed to grow up out of it and now the wheels and the horses tails
could be seen and now stirring with a mighty splashing of big drops
scattering showers of diamondsno not diamondssapphires in the dull
brilliance of the moon the horses with a spirited pull all together
drew us on to the sandy bank and trotted along the road to the
hillside their shining white legs flashing in rivalry

What will Filofey say now was the thought that glanced through my
mind you see I was right or something of that sort But he said
nothing So I too did not think it necessary to reproach him for
carelessness and lying down in the hay I tried again to go to sleep

But I could not go to sleep not because I was not tired from hunting
and not because the exciting experience I had just been through had
dispelled my sleepiness it was that we were driving through such very
beautiful country There were liberal widestretching grassy riverside
meadows with a multitude of small pools little lakes rivulets creeks
overgrown at the ends with branches and osiersa regular Russian scene
such as Russians love like the scenes amid which the heroes of our old
legends rode out to shoot white swans and grey ducks The road we were
driven along wound in a yellowish ribbon the horses ran lightlyand I
could not close my eyes I was admiring And it all floated by softened
into harmony under the kindly light of the moon Filofeyhe too was
touched by it

Those meadows are called St Yegors he said turning to me And
beyond them come the Grand Dukes there are no other meadows like them
in all Russia Ah its lovely The shafthorse snorted and shook
itself God bless you commented Filofey gravely in an undertone
How lovely he repeated with a sigh then he gave a long sort of
grunt There mowing times just upon us and think what hay theyll
rake up thereregular mountainsAnd there are lots of fish in the
creeks Such bream he added in a singsong voice In one word lifes
sweetone doesnt want to die

He suddenly raised his hand

Hullo lookee over the lake is it a crane standing there Can it
be fishing at night Bless me its a branch not a crane Well that
was a mistake But the moon is always so deceptive

So we drove on and on But now the end of the meadows had been
reached little copses and ploughed fields came into view a little
village flashed with two or three lights on one sideit was only four
miles now to the main road I fell asleep

Again I did not wake up of my own accord This time I was roused by the
voice of Filofey

Master hey master

I sat up The coach was standing still on level ground in the very
middle of the highroad Filofey who had turned round on the box so as
to face me with wideopen eyes I was positively surprised at them I
couldnt have imagined he had such large eyes was whispering with
mysterious significance

A rattle a rattle of wheels

What do you say

I say theres a rattling Bend down and listen Do you hear it

I put my head out of the coach held my breath and did catch somewhere
in the distance far behind us a faint broken sound as of wheels
rolling

Do you hear it repeated Filofey

Well yes I answered Some vehicle is coming

Oh you dont hear shoo The tambourines and whistling tooDo
you hear Take off your cap you will hear better

I didnt take off my cap but I listened

Well yes perhaps But what of it

Filofey turned round facing the horses

Its a cart coming lightly ironrimmed wheels he observed and
he took up the reins Its wicked folks coming master hereabouts you
know near Tula they play a good many tricks

What nonsense What makes you suppose its sure to be wicked people

I speak the truth with tambourines and in an empty cart Who
should it be

Well is it much further to Tula

Theres twelve miles further to go and not a habitation here

Well then get on quicker its no good lingering

Filofey brandished the whip and the coach rolled on again

Though I did not put much faith in Filofey I could not go to sleep
What if it really is so A disagreeable sensation began to stir in me
I sat up in the coachtill then I had lain downand began looking in
all directions While I had been asleep a slight fog had come over not
the earth but the sky it stood high the moon hung a whitish patch in
it as though in smoke Everything had grown dim and blended together
though it was clearer near the ground Around us flat dreary country
fields nothing but fieldshere and there bushes and ravinesand again
fields mostly fallow with scanty dusty grass A wilderness
deathlike If only a quail had called

We drove on for half an hour Filofey kept constantly cracking his whip
and clicking with his lips but neither he nor I uttered a word So we
mounted the hillside Filofey pulled up the horses and promptly said
again

It is a rattle of wheels master yes it is

I poked my head out of the coach again but I might have stayed under
the cover of the hood so distinctly though still from a distance the
sound reached me of cartwheels men whistling the jingling of
tambourines and even the thud of horses hoofs I even fancied I could
hear singing and laughter The wind it is true was blowing from there
but there was no doubt that the unknown travellers were a good mile
perhaps two nearer us Filofey and I looked at one another he only
gave his hat a tweak forward from behind and at once bending over the
reins fell to whipping up the horses They set off at a gallop but
they could not gallop for long and fell back into a trot again Filofey
continued to whip them We must get away

I cant account for the fact that though I had not at first shared
Filofeys apprehensions about this time I suddenly gained the
conviction that we really were being followed by highwaymen I had
heard nothing new the same tambourines the same rattle of a cart
without a load the same intermittent whistling the same confused
uproar But now I had no doubt Filofey could not have made a
mistake

And now twenty minutes more had gone by During the last of these
twenty minutes even through the clatter and rumble of our own carriage
we could hear another clatter and another rumbling

Stop Filofey I said its no usethe ends the same

Filofey uttered a fainthearted wo The horses instantaneously
stopped as though delighted at the chance of resting

Mercy upon us the tambourines were simply booming away just behind our
backs the cart was rattling and creaking the men were whistling
shouting and singing the horses were snorting and thumping on the
ground with their hoofs They had overtaken us

Bad luck Filofey commented in an emphatic undertone and clicking
to the horses irresolutely he began to urge them on again But at that
very instant there was a sort of sudden rush and whizz and a very big
wide cart harnessed with three lean horses cut sharply at a rush up to
us galloped in front and at once fell into a walking pace blocking up
the road

A regular brigands trick murmured Filofey I must own I felt a cold
chill at my heart I fell to staring before me with strained
attention in the halfdarkness of the misty moonlight In the cart in
front of us werehalflying halfsittingsix men in shirts and in
unbuttoned rough overcoats two of them had no caps on huge feet in
boots were swinging and hanging over the cartrail arms were rising and
falling helterskelter bodies were jolting backwards and
forwards It was quite cleara drunken party Some were bawling at
random one was whistling very correctly and shrilly another was
swearing on the drivers seat sat a sort of giant in a cape driving
They went at a walking pace as though paying no attention to us

What was to be done We followed them also at a walking pace we
could do nothing else

For a quarter of a mile we moved along in this manner The suspense was
torturing To protect to defend ourselves was out of the question
There were six of them and I hadnt even a stick Should we turn back
But they would catch us up directly I remembered the line of Zhukovsky
in the passage where he speaks of the murder of fieldmarshal
Kamensky

  The scoundrel highwaymans vile axe


Or elsestrangling with filthy cord flung into a ditchthere to
choke and struggle like a hare in a trap

Ugh it was horrid

And they as before went on at a walking pace taking no notice of us

Filofey I whisperedjust try keep more to the right see if you can
get by

Filofey triedkept to the right but they promptly kept to the right
too It was impossible to get by

Filofey made another effort he kept to the left But there again
they did not let him pass the cart They even laughed aloud That meant
that they wouldnt let us pass

Then they are a bad lot Filofey whispered to me over his shoulder

But what are they waiting for I inquired also in a whisper

To reach the bridgeover there in frontin the hollowabove the
stream Theyll do for us there Thats always their way by
bridges Its a clear case for us master He added with a sigh
Theyll hardly let us go alive for the great thing for them is to keep
it all dark Im sorry for one thing master my horses are lost and my
brothers wont get them

I should have been surprised at the time that Filofey could still
trouble about his horses at such a moment but I must confess I had no
thoughts for him Will they really kill me I kept repeating
mentally Why should they Ill give them everything I have

And the bridge was getting nearer and nearer it could be more and more
clearly seen

Suddenly a sharp whoop was heard the cart before us as it were flew
ahead dashed along and reaching the bridge at once stopped
stockstill a little on one side of the road My heart fairly sank like
lead

Ah brother Filofey I said we are going to our death Forgive me
for bringing you to ruin

As though it were your fault master Theres no escaping ones fate
Come Shaggy my trusty little horse Filofey addressed the
shafthorse step on brother Do your last bit of service Its all
the same

And he urged his horses into a trot We began to get near the
bridgenear that motionless menacing cart In it everything was
silent as though on purpose Not a single halloo It was the stillness
of the pike or the hawk of every beast of prey as its victim
approaches And now we were level with the cart Suddenly the giant
in the cape sprang out of the cart and came straight towards us

He said nothing to Filofey but the latter of his own accord tugged at
the reins The coach stopped The giant laid both arms on the
carriage door and bending forward his shaggy head with a grin he
uttered the following speech in a soft even voice with the accent of a
factory hand

Honoured sir we are coming from an honest feastfrom a wedding weve
been marrying one of our fine fellowsthat is weve put him to bed
were all young lads reckless chapstheres been a good deal of
drinking and nothing to sober us so wouldnt your honour be so good as
to favour us the least little just for a dram of brandy for our mate
Wed drink to your health and remember your worship but if you wont
be gracious to uswell we beg you not to be angry

Whats the meaning of this I thought A joke a jeer

The giant continued to stand with bent head At that very instant the
moon emerged from the fog and lighted up his face There was a grin on
the face in the eyes and on the lips But there was nothing
threatening to be seen in it only it seemed as it were all on the
alert and the teeth were so white and large

I shall be pleased take this I said hurriedly and pulling my
purse out of my pocket I took out two silver roublesat that time
silver was still circulating in Russiahere if thats enough

Much obliged bawled the giant in military fashion and his fat
fingers in a flash snatched from menot the whole pursebut only the
two roubles much obliged He shook his hair back and ran up to the
cart

Lads he shouted the gentleman makes us a present of two silver
roubles They all began as it were gabbling at once The giant
rolled up on to the drivers seat

Good luck to you master

And that was the last we saw of them The horses dashed on the cart
rumbled up the hill once more it stood out on the dark line separating
the earth from the sky went down and vanished

And now the rattle of the wheels the shouts and tambourines could not
be heard

There was a deathlike silence

                                   

Filofey and I could not recover ourselves all at once

Ah youre a merry fellow he commented at last and taking off his
hat he began crossing himself Fond of a joke on my word he added
and he turned to me beaming all over But he must be a capital
fellowon my word Now now now little ones look alive Youre safe
We are all safe It was he who wouldnt let us get by it was he who
drove the horses What a chap for a joke Now now get on in Gods
name

I did not speak but I felt happy too We are safe I repeated to
myself and lay down on the hay Weve got off cheap

I even felt rather ashamed that I had remembered that line of
Zhukovskys

Suddenly an idea occurred to me

Filofey

What is it

Are you married

Yes

And have you children

Yes

How was it you didnt think of them You were sorry for your horses
werent you sorry for your wife and children

Why be sorry for them They werent going to fall into the hands of
thieves you know But I kept them in my mind all the while and I do
now surely Filofey paused May be it was for their sake
Almighty God had mercy on us

But if they werent highwaymen

How can we tell Can one creep into the soul of another Anothers
soul we know is a dark place But with the thought of God in the
heart things are always better No no Id my family all the
time Gee geeup little ones in Gods name

It was already almost daylight we began to drive into Tula I was
lying dreamy and halfasleep

Master Filofey said to me suddenly look there theyre stopping at
the tavern their cart

I raised my head there they were and their cart and horses In the
doorway of the drinkinghouse there suddenly appeared our friend the
giant in the cape Sir he shouted waving his cap were drinking
your healthHey coachman he added wagging his head at Filofey
you were a bit scared I shouldnt wonder hey

A merry fellow observed Filofey when we had driven nearly fifty yards
from the tavern

We got into Tula at last I bought shot and while I was about it tea
and spirits and even got a horse from the horsedealer

At midday we set off home again As we drove by the place where we
first heard the rattle of the cart behind us Filofey who having had
something to drink at Tula turned out to be very talkativehe even
began telling me fairytalesas he passed the place suddenly burst out
laughing

Do you remember master how I kept saying to you A rattle a
rattle of wheels I said

He waved his hand several times This expression struck him as most
amusing The same evening we got back to his village

I related the adventure that had befallen us to Yermola Being sober
he expressed no sympathy he only gave a gruntwhether of approval or
reproach I imagine he did not know himself But two days later he
informed me with great satisfaction that the very night Filofey and I
had been driving to Tula and on the very road a merchant had been
robbed and murdered I did not at first put much faith in this but
later on I was obliged to believe it it was confirmed by the police
captain who came galloping over in consequence

Was not that perhaps the wedding our brave spirits were returning
fromwasnt that the fine fellow they had put to bed in the words
of the jocose giant I stayed five days longer in Filofeys village
Whenever I meet him I always say to him A rattle of wheels Eh

A merry fellow he always answers and bursts out laughing




EPILOGUE

THE FOREST AND THE STEPPE

  And slowly something began to draw him
   Back to the country to the garden dark
   Where limetrees are so huge so full of shade
   And lilies of the valley sweet as maids
   Where rounded willows oer the waters edge
   Lean from the dyke in rows and where the oak
   Sturdily grows above the sturdy field
   Amid the smell of hemp and nettles rank
   There there in meadows stretching wide
   Where rich and black as velvet is the earth
   Where the sweet rye far as the eye can see
   Moves noiselessly in tender billowing waves
   And where the heavy golden light is shed
   From out of rounded white transparent clouds
   There it is good

   From a poem devoted to the flames


The reader is very likely already weary of my sketches I hasten to
reassure him by promising to confine myself to the fragments already
printed but I cannot refrain from saying a few words at parting about a
sportmans life

Hunting with a dog and a gun is delightful in itself fr sich
as they used to say in old days but let us suppose you were not born a
sportsman but are fond of nature all the same you cannot then help
envying us sportsmen Listen

Do you know for instance the delight of setting off before daybreak in
spring You come out on to the steps In the dark grey sky stars are
twinkling here and there a damp breeze in faint gusts flies to meet you
now and then there is heard the secret vague whispering of the night
the trees faintly rustle wrapt in darkness And now they pull the hood
over the cart and lay a box with the samovar at your feet The
tracehorses move restlessly snort and daintily paw the ground a
couple of white geese only just awake waddle slowly and silently
across the road On the other side of the hedge in the garden the
watchman is snoring peacefully every sound seems to stand still in the
frozen airsuspended not moving You take your seat the horses start
at once the cart rolls off with a loud rumble You drivedrive past
the church downhill to the right across the dyke The pond is just
beginning to be covered with mist You are rather chilly you cover your
face with the collar of your fur cloak you doze The horses hoofs
splash sonorously through the puddles the coachman begins to whistle
But by now you have driven over three miles the rim of the sky
flushes crimson the jackdaws are heard fluttering clumsily in the
birchtrees sparrows are twittering about the dark hayricks The air is
clearer the road more distinct the sky brightens the clouds look
whiter and the fields look greener In the huts there is the red light
of flaming chips from behind gates comes the sound of sleepy voices
And meanwhile the glow of dawn is beginning already streaks of gold are
stretching across the sky mists are gathering in clouds over the
ravines the larks are singing musically the breeze that ushers in the
dawn is blowing and slowly the purple sun floats upward There is a
perfect flood of light your heart is fluttering like a bird Everything
is fresh gay delightful One can see a long way all round That way
beyond the copse a village there further another with a white
church and there a birchwood on the hill behind it the marsh for
which you are bound Quicker horses quicker Forward at a good
trot There are three miles to gonot more The sun mounts swiftly
higher the sky is clear It will be a glorious day A herd of cattle
comes straggling from the village to meet us You go up the hill
What a view The river winds for ten miles dimly blue through the mist
beyond it meadows of watery green beyond the meadows sloping hills in
the distance the plovers are wheeling with loud cries above the marsh
through the moist brilliance suffused in the air the distance stands out
clearly not as in the summer How freely one drinks in the air how
quickly the limbs move how strong is the whole man clasped in the
fresh breath of spring

And a summer morninga morning in July Who but the sportsman knows how
soothing it is to wander at daybreak among the underwoods The print of
your feet lies in a green line on the grass white with dew You part
the drenched bushes you are met by a rush of the warm fragrance stored
up in the night the air is saturated with the fresh bitterness of
wormwood the honey sweetness of buckwheat and clover in the distance
an oak wood stands like a wall and glows and glistens in the sun it is
still fresh but already the approach of heat is felt The head is faint
and dizzy from the excess of sweet scents The copse stretches on
endlessly Only in places there are yellow glimpses in the distance
of ripening rye and narrow streaks of red buckwheat Then there is the
creak of cartwheels a peasant makes his way among the bushes at a
walkingpace and sets his horse in the shade before the heat of the
day You greet him and turn away the musical swish of the scythe is
heard behind you The sun rises higher and higher The grass is speedily
dry And now it is quite sultry One hour passes another The sky
grows dark over the horizon the still air is baked with piercing
heat Where can one get a drink here brother you inquire of the
mower Yonder in the ravines a well Through the thick hazelbushes
tangled by the clinging grass you drop down to the bottom of the
ravine Right under the cliff a little spring is hidden an oak bush
greedily spreads out its twigs like great fingers over the water great
silvery bubbles rise trembling from the bottom covered with fine
velvety moss You fling yourself on the ground you drink but you are
too lazy to stir You are in the shade you drink in the damp fragrance
you take your ease while the bushes face you glowing and as it were
turning yellow in the sun But what is that There is a sudden flying
gust of wind the air is astir all about you was not that thunder Is
it the heat thickening Is a storm coming on And now there is a
faint flash of lightning Ah this is a storm The sun is still
blazing you can still go on hunting But the stormcloud grows its
front edge drawn out like a long sleeve bends over into an arch The
grass the bushes everything around grows dark Make haste over
there you think you catch sight of a hay barn make haste You run
there go in What rain What flashes of lightning The water drips
in through some hole in the thatchroof on to the sweetsmelling hay
But now the sun is shining bright again The storm is over you come
out My God the joyous sparkle of everything the fresh limpid air
the scent of raspberries and mushrooms And then the evening comes on
There is the blaze of fire glowing and covering half the sky The sun
sets the air near has a peculiar transparency as of crystal over the
distance lies a soft warmlooking haze with the dew a crimson light is
shed on the fields lately plunged in floods of limpid gold from trees
and bushes and high stacks of hay run long shadows The sun has set
a star gleams and quivers in the fiery sea of the sunset and now it
pales the sky grows blue the separate shadows vanish the air is
plunged in darkness It is time to turn homewards to the village to the
hut where you will stay the night Shouldering your gun you move
briskly in spite of fatigue Meanwhile the night comes on now you
cannot see twenty paces from you the dogs show faintly white in the
dark Over there above the black bushes there is a vague brightness on
the horizon What is ita fire No it is the moon rising And
away below to the right the village lights are twinkling already
And here at last is your hut Through the tiny window you see a table
with a white cloth a candle burning supper

Another time you order the racing droshky to be got out and set off to
the forest to shoot woodcock It is pleasant making your way along the
narrow path between two high walls of rye The ears softly strike you in
the face the cornflowers cling round your legs the quails call around
the horse moves along at a lazy trot And here is the forest all shade
and silence Graceful aspens rustle high above you the longhanging
branches of the birches scarcely stir a mighty oak stands like a
champion beside a lovely limetree You go along the green path
streaked with shade great yellow flies stay suspended motionless in
the sunny air and suddenly dart away midges hover in a cloud bright
in the shade dark in the sun the birds are singing peacefully the
golden little voice of the warbler sings of innocent babbling
joyousness in sweet accord with the scent of the lilies of the valley
Further further deeper into the forest the forest grows more
dense An unutterable stillness falls upon the soul within without
too all is still and dreamy But now a wind has sprung up and the
treetops are booming like falling waves Here and there through last
years brown leaves grow tall grasses funguses stand apart under their
widebrimmed hats All at once a hare skips out the dog scurries after
it with a resounding bark

And how fair is this same forest in late autumn when the snipe are on
the wing They do not keep in the heart of the forest one must look for
them along the outskirts There is no wind and no sun no light no
shade no movement no sound the autumn perfume like the perfume of
wine is diffused in the soft air a delicate haze hangs over the yellow
fields in the distance The still sky is a peacefully untroubled white
through the bare brown branches in parts on the limes hang the last
golden leaves The damp earth is elastic under your feet the high dry
blades of grass do not stir long threads lie shining on the blanched
turf white with dew You breathe tranquilly but there is a strange
tremor in the soul You walk along the forests edge look after your
dog and meanwhile loved forms loved faces dead and living come to
your mind long long slumbering impressions unexpectedly awaken the
fancy darts off and soars like a bird and all moves so clearly and
stands out before your eyes The heart at one time throbs and beats
plunging passionately forward at another it is drowned beyond recall in
memories Your whole life as it were unrolls lightly and rapidly
before you a man at such times possesses all his past all his feelings
and his powersall his soul and there is nothing around to hinder
himno sun no wind no sound

And a clear rather cold autumn day with a frost in the morning when
the birch all golden like some tree in a fairy tale stands out
picturesquely against the pale blue sky when the sun standing low in
the sky does not warm but shines more brightly than in summer the
small aspen copse is all asparkle through and through as though it
were glad and at ease in its nakedness the hoarfrost is still white at
the bottom of the hollows while a fresh wind softly stirs up and drives
before it the falling crumpled leaves when blue ripples whisk gladly
along the river lifting rhythmically the heedless geese and ducks in
the distance the mill creaks halfhidden by the willows and with
changing colours in the clear air the pigeons wheel in swift circles
above it

Sweet too are dull days in summer though the sportsmen do not like
them On such days one cant shoot the bird that flutters up from under
your very feet and vanishes at once in the whitish dark of the hanging
fog But how peaceful how unutterably peaceful it is everywhere
Everything is awake and everything is hushed You pass by a tree it
does not stir a leaf it is musing in repose Through the thin steamy
mist evenly diffused in the air there is a long streak of black before
you You take it for a neighbouring copse close at hand you go upthe
copse is transformed into a high row of wormwood in the boundaryditch
Above you around you on all sidesmist But now a breeze is
faintly astir a patch of paleblue sky peeps dimly out through the
thinning as it were smoky mist a ray of golden yellow sunshine breaks
out suddenly flows in a long stream strikes on the fields and in the
copseand now everything is overcast again For long this struggle is
drawn out but how unutterably brilliant and magnificent the day becomes
when at last light triumphs and the last waves of the warmed mist here
unroll and are drawn out over the plains there wind away and vanish
into the deep tenderly shining heights

Again you set off into outlying country to the steppe For some ten
miles you make your way over crossroads and here at last is the
highroad Past endless trains of waggons past wayside taverns with
the hissing samovar under a shed wideopen gates and a well from one
hamlet to another across endless fields alongside green hempfields a
long long time you drive The magpies flutter from willow to willow
peasant women with long rakes in their hands wander in the fields a man
in a threadbare nankin overcoat with a wicker pannier over his
shoulder trudges along with weary step a heavy country coach
harnessed with six tall brokenwinded horses rolls to meet you The
corner of a cushion is sticking out of a window and on a sack up
behind hanging on to a string perches a groom in a furcloak splashed
with mud to his very eyebrows And here is the little district town with
its crooked little wooden houses its endless fences its empty stone
shops its oldfashioned bridge over a deep ravine On on The
steppe country is reached at last You look from a hilltop what a
view Round low hills tilled and sown to their very tops are seen in
broad undulations ravines overgrown with bushes wind coiling among
them small copses are scattered like oblong islands from village to
village run narrow paths churches stand out white between
willowbushes glimmers a little river in four places dammed up by
dykes far off in a field in a line an old manorhouse with its
outhouses fruitgarden and threshingfloor huddles close up to a
small lake But on on you go The hills are smaller and ever smaller
there is scarcely a tree to be seen Here it is at lastthe boundless
untrodden steppe

And on a winter day to walk over the high snowdrifts after hares to
breathe the keen frosty air while halfclosing the eyes involuntarily
at the fine blinding sparkle of the soft snow to admire the emerald sky
above the reddish forest And the first spring day when everything is
shining and breaking up when across the heavy streams from the
melting snow there is already the scent of the thawing earth when on
the bare thawed places under the slanting sunshine the larks are
singing confidingly and with glad splash and roar the torrents roll
from ravine to ravine

But it is time to end By the way I have spoken of spring in spring it
is easy to part in spring even the happy are drawn away to the
distance Farewell reader I wish you unbroken prosperity

volunteer support

editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the US unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition
