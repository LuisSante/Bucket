Illustration Christmas Day


WHEN I awoke the next morning it seemed as if all the events of the
preceding evening had been a dream and nothing but the identity of the
ancient chamber convinced me of their reality While I lay musing on my
pillow I heard the sound of little feet pattering outside of the door
and a whispering consultation Presently a choir of small voices chanted
forth an old Christmas carol the burden of which was

                    Rejoice our Saviour He was born
                    On Christmas Day in the morning

I rose softly slipped on my clothes opened the door suddenly and
beheld one of the most beautiful little fairy groups that a painter
could imagine

It consisted of a boy and two girls the eldest not more than six and
lovely as seraphs They were going the rounds of the house and singing
at every chamber door but my sudden appearance frightened them into
mute bashfulness They remained for a moment playing on their lips with
their fingers and now and then stealing a shy glance from under their
eyebrows until as if by one impulse they scampered away and as they
turned an angle of the gallery I heard them laughing in triumph at
their escape

The house was surrounded with evergreens according to the English
custom which would have given almost an appearance of summer but the
morning was extremely frosty the light vapour of the preceding evening
had been precipitated by the cold and covered all the trees and every
blade of grass with its fine crystallisations

I had scarcely dressed myself when a servant appeared to invite me to
family prayers He showed me the way to a small chapel in the old wing
of the house where I found the principal part of the family already
assembled in a kind of gallery furnished with cushions hassocks and
large prayerbooks the servants were seated on benches below The old
gentleman read prayers from a desk in front of the gallery and Master
Simon acted as clerk and made the responses

Illustration The editions of Caxton and Wynkin de Worde were his
delight

The service was followed by a Christmas carol which Mr Bracebridge
himself had constructed from a poem of his favourite author Herrick
and it had been adapted to an old church melody by Master Simon As
there were several good voices among the household the effect was
extremely pleasing but I was particularly gratified by the exaltation
of heart and sudden sally of grateful feeling with which the worthy
Squire delivered one stanza his eyes glistening and his voice rambling
out of all the bounds of time and tune

              Tis thou that crownst my glittering hearth
                  With guiltlesse mirth
              And givst me wassaile bowles to drink
                  Spiced to the brink
              Lord tis Thy plentydropping hand
                  That soiles my land
              And givst me for my bushell sowne
                  Twice ten for one

Our breakfast consisted of what the Squire denominated true old English
fare He indulged in some bitter lamentations over modern breakfasts of
tea and toast which he censured as among the causes of modern
effeminacy and weak nerves and the decline of old English heartiness
and though he admitted them to his table to suit the palates of his
guests yet there was a brave display of cold meats wine and ale on
the sideboard

After breakfast I walked about the grounds with Frank Bracebridge and
Master Simon We were escorted by a number of gentlemanlike dogs that
seemed loungers about the establishment from the frisking spaniel to
the steady old staghound the last of which was of a race that had been
in the family time out of mind

The old mansion had a still more venerable look in the yellow sunshine
than by pale moonlight and I could not but feel the force of the
Squires idea that the formal terraces heavily moulded balustrades
and clipped yew trees carried with them an air of proud aristocracy

While we were talking we heard the distant toll of the village bell and
I was told that the Squire was a little particular in having his
household at church on a Christmas morning considering it a day of
pouring out of thanks and rejoicing for as old Tusser observed

        At Christmas be merry and thankful withal
        And feast thy poor neighbours the great and the small

If you are disposed to go to church said Frank Bracebridge I can
promise you a specimen of my cousin Simons musical achievements As the
church is destitute of an organ he has formed a band from the village
amateurs and established a musical club for their improvement he has
also sorted a choir as he sorted my fathers pack of hounds according
to the directions of Jervaise Markham in his Country Contentments
for the bass he has sought out all the deep solemn mouths and for the
tenor the loud ringing mouths among the country bumpkins and for
sweet mouths he has culled with curious taste among the prettiest
lasses in the neighbourhood though these last he affirms are the most
difficult to keep in tune

As the morning though frosty was remarkably fine and clear the most
of the family walked to the church which was a very old building of
grey stone and stood near a village about half a mile from the park
gate Adjoining it was a low snug parsonage which seemed coeval with
the church As we passed this sheltered nest the parson issued forth
and preceded us

I had expected to see a sleek wellconditioned pastor such as is often
found in a snug living in the vicinity of a rich patrons table but I
was disappointed The parson was a little meagre blacklooking man
with a grizzled wig that was too wide and stood off from each ear so
that his head seemed to have shrunk away within it like a dried filbert
in its shell He wore a rusty coat with great skirts and pockets that
would have held the church Bible and prayerbook and his small legs
seemed still smaller from being planted in large shoes decorated with
enormous buckles

I was informed by Frank Bracebridge that the parson had been a chum of
his fathers at Oxford and had received this living shortly after the
latter had come to his estate He was a complete blackletter hunter
and would scarcely read a work printed in the Roman character The
editions of Caxton and Wynkin de Worde were his delight and he was
indefatigable in his researches after such old English writers as have
fallen into oblivion from their worthlessness He had pored over these
old volumes so intensely that they seemed to have been reflected into
his countenance indeed which if the face be an index of the mind
might be compared to a titlepage of blackletter

On reaching the church porch we found the parson rebuking the
greyheaded sexton for having used mistletoe among the greens with which
the church was decorated It was he observed an unholy plant profaned
by having been used by the Druids in their mystic ceremonies and though
it might be innocently employed in the festive ornamenting of halls and
kitchens yet it had been deemed by the Fathers of the Church as
unhallowed and totally unfit for sacred purposes So tenacious was he
on this point that the poor sexton was obliged to strip down a great
part of the humble trophies of his taste before the parson would
consent to enter upon the service of the day

The interior of the church was venerable but simple on the walls were
several mural monuments of the Bracebridges and just beside the altar
was a tomb of ancient workmanship on which lay the effigy of a warrior
in armour with his legs crossed a sign of his having been a crusader
I was told it was one of the family who had signalised himself in the
Holy Land and the same whose picture hung over the fireplace in the
hall

The orchestra was in a small gallery and presented a most whimsical
grouping of heads piled one above the other among which I particularly
noticed that of the village tailor a pale fellow with a retreating
forehead and chin who played on the clarionet and seemed to have blown
his face to a point and there was another a short pursy man stooping
and labouring at a bass viol so as to show nothing but the top of a
round bald head like the egg of an ostrich There were two or three
pretty faces among the female singers to which the keen air of a frosty
morning had given a bright rosy tint but the gentlemen choristers had
evidently been chosen like old Cremona fiddles more for tone than
looks and as several had to sing from the same book there were
clusterings of odd physiognomies not unlike those groups of cherubs we
sometimes see on country tombstones

Illustration Winding all up by a nasal solo

The usual services of the choir were managed tolerably well But the
great trial was an anthem that had been prepared and arranged by Master
Simon and on which he had founded great expectation Unluckily there
was a blunder at the very outset the musicians became flurried Master
Simon was in a fever everything went on lamely and irregularly until
they came to a chorus beginning Now let us sing with one accord which
seemed to be a signal for parting company all became discord and
confusion each shifted for himself and got to the end as well or
rather as soon as he could except one old chorister in a pair of horn
spectacles bestriding and pinching a long sonorous nose who happening
to stand a little apart and being wrapped up in his own melody kept on
a quavering course wriggling his head ogling his book and winding all
up by a nasal solo of at least three bars duration

The parson gave us a most erudite sermon on the rites and ceremonies of
Christmas and the propriety of observing it not merely as a day of
thanksgiving but of rejoicing He kindled into warmth with the ardour
of his contest and the host of imaginary foes with whom he had to
combat had a stubborn conflict with old Prynne and two or three other
forgotten champions of the Roundheads on the subject of Christmas
festivity and concluded by urging his hearers in the most solemn and
affecting manner to stand to the traditionary customs of their fathers
and feast and make merry on this joyful anniversary of the Church

I have seldom known a sermon attended apparently with more immediate
effects for on leaving the church the congregation seemed one and all
possessed with the gaiety of spirit so earnestly enjoined by their
pastor The elder folks gathered in knots in the churchyard greeting
and shaking hands and the children ran about crying Ule Ule and
repeating some uncouth rhymes

                       Ule Ule
                       Three puddings in a pule
                       Crack nuts and cry ule

which the parson who had joined us informed me had been handed down
from days of yore The villagers doffed their hats to the Squire as he
passed giving him the good wishes of the season with every appearance
of heartfelt sincerity and were invited by him to the Hall to take
something to keep out the cold of the weather and I heard blessings
uttered by several of the poor which convinced me that in the midst of
his enjoyments the worthy old cavalier had not forgotten the true
Christmas virtue of charity

On our way homeward his heart seemed overflowing with generous and happy
feelings As we passed over a rising ground which commanded something of
a prospect the sounds of rustic merriment now and then reached our
ears the Squire paused for a few moments and looked around with an air
of inexpressible benignity

There was something truly cheering in this triumph of warmth and verdure
over the frosty thraldom of winter it was as the Squire observed an
emblem of Christmas hospitality breaking through the chills of ceremony
and selfishness and thawing every heart into a flow He pointed with
pleasure to the indications of good cheer reeking from the chimneys of
the comfortable farmhouses and low thatched cottages

The Squire went on to lament the deplorable decay of the games and
amusements which were once prevalent at this season among the lower
orders and countenanced by the higher when the old halls of castles
and manorhouses were thrown open at daylight when the tables were
covered with brawn and beef and humming ale when the harp and the
carol resounded all day long and when rich and poor were alike welcome
to enter and make merry

Illustration The dinner was served up in the Great Hall

                LO NOW IS COME THE JOYFULST FEAST
                LET EVERY MAN BE JOLLY
                EACH ROOME WITH YVIE LEAVES IS DREST
                AND EVERY POST WITH HOLLY

                NOW ALL OUR NEIGHBOURS CHIMNEYS SMOKE
                AND CHRISTMAS BLOCKS ARE BURNING
                THEIR OVENS THEY WITH BAKT MEATS CHOKE
                AND ALL THEIR SPITS ARE TURNING

We had not been long home when the sound of music was heard from a
distance A band of country lads without coats their shirtsleeves
fancifully tied with ribands their hats decorated with greens and
clubs in their hands were seen advancing up the avenue followed by a
large number of villagers and peasantry They stopped before the hall
door where the music struck up a peculiar air and the lads performed a
curious and intricate dance advancing retreating and striking their
clubs together keeping exact time to the music while one whimsically
crowned with a foxs skin the tail of which flaunted down his back
kept capering around the skirts of the dance and rattling a Christmas
box with many antic gesticulations

After the dance was concluded the whole party was entertained with
brawn and beef and stout homebrewed The Squire himself mingled among
the rustics and was received with awkward demonstrations of deference
and regard

It is true I perceived two or three of the younger peasants as they
were raising their tankards to their mouths when the Squires back was
turned making something of a grimace and giving each other the wink
but the moment they caught my eye they pulled grave faces and were
exceedingly demure With Master Simon however they all seemed more at
their ease

The bashfulness of the guests soon gave way before good cheer and
affability When the Squire had retired the merriment increased and
there was much joking and laughter particularly between Master Simon
and a hale ruddyfaced whiteheaded farmer who appeared to be the wit
of the village for I observed all his companions to wait with open
mouths for his retorts and burst into a gratuitous laugh before they
could well understand them

The whole house indeed seemed abandoned to merriment As I passed to
my room to dress for dinner I heard the sound of music in a small
court and looking through a window that commanded it I perceived a
band of wandering musicians with pandean pipes and tambourine a
pretty coquettish housemaid was dancing a jig with a smart country lad
while several of the other servants were looking on In the midst of her
sport the girl caught a glimpse of my face at the window and colouring
up ran off with an air of roguish affected confusion

I had finished my toilet and was loitering with Frank Bracebridge in
the library when we heard a distant thwacking sound which he informed
me was a signal for the serving up of the dinner

The dinner was served up in the great hall where the Squire always held
his Christmas banquet A blazing crackling fire of logs had been heaped
on to warm the spacious apartment and the flame went sparkling and
wreathing up the widemouthed chimney The great picture of the crusader
and his white horse had been profusely decorated with greens for the
occasion and holly and ivy had likewise been wreathed around the helmet
and weapons on the opposite wall Before these stood the two Yule
candles beaming like two stars of the first magnitude other lights
were distributed in branches and the whole array glittered like a
firmament of silver

We were ushered into this banqueting scene with the sound of minstrelsy
the old harper being seated on a stool beside the fireplace and
twanging his instrument with a vast deal more power than melody

The parson said grace which was not a short familiar one such as is
commonly addressed to the Deity in these unceremonious days but a long
courtly wellworded one of the ancient school

There was now a pause as if something was expected when suddenly the
butler entered the hall with some degree of bustle he was attended by a
servant on each side with a large waxlight and bore a silver dish on
which was an enormous pigs head decorated with rosemary with a lemon
in its mouth which was placed with great formality at the head of the
table The moment this pageant made its appearance the harper struck up
a flourish

Though prepared to witness many of these little eccentricities from
being apprised of the peculiar hobby of mine host yet I confess the
parade with which so odd a dish was introduced somewhat perplexed me
until I gathered from the conversation of the Squire and the parson that
it was meant to represent the bringing in of the boars head a dish
formerly served up with much ceremony and the sound of minstrelsy and
song at great tables on Christmas Day I like the old custom said
the Squire not merely because it is stately and pleasing in itself
but because it was observed at the College of Oxford at which I was
educated When I hear the old song chanted it brings to mind the time
when I was young and gamesomeand the noble old collegehalland my
fellowstudents loitering about in their black gowns many of whom poor
lads are now in their graves

The table was literally loaded with good cheer and presented an epitome
of country abundance in this season of overflowing larders A
distinguished post was allotted to ancient sirloin as mine host
termed it being as he added the standard of old English hospitality
and a joint of goodly presence and full of expectation

Illustration The little beings were as happy about him as the mock
fairies about Falstaff

When the cloth was removed the butler brought in a huge silver vessel
of rare and curious workmanship which he placed before the Squire Its
appearance was hailed with acclamation being the Wassail Bowl so
renowned in Christmas festivity The contents had been prepared by the
Squire himself

The old gentlemans whole countenance beamed with a serene look of
indwelling delight as he stirred this mighty bowl Having raised it to
his lips with a hearty wish of a merry Christmas to all present he
sent it brimming around the board for every one to follow his example
according to the primitive style pronouncing it the ancient fountain
of good feeling where all hearts meet together

There was much laughing and rallying as the honest emblem of Christmas
joviality circulated and was kissed rather coyly by the ladies When it
reached Master Simon he raised it in both hands and with the air of a
boon companion struck up an old Wassail chanson

                    The browne bowle
                    The merry browne bowle
                    As it goes round abouta
                            Fill
                            Still
                    Let the world say what it will
                    And drink your fill all outa

                    The deep canne
                    The merry deep canne
                    As thou dost freely quaffa

                    And sound a lusty laughaA



Footnote A

  From Poor Robins Almanack



The dinnertime passed away in this flow of innocent hilarity and
though the old hall may have resounded in its time with many a scene of
broader rout and revel yet I doubt whether it ever witnessed more
honest and genuine enjoyment

When the ladies had retired the conversation as usual became still
more animated The Squire told several long stories of early college
pranks and adventures

I found the tide of wine and wassail fast gaining on the dry land of
sober judgment The company grew merrier and louder as their jokes grew
duller Master Simon was in as chirping a humour as a grasshopper filled
with dew his old songs grew of a warmer complexion and he began to
talk maudlin about the widow

After the dinnertable was removed the hall was given up to the younger
members of the family who made its old walls ring with their merriment
as they played at romping games Master Simon who was the leader of
their revels and seemed on all occasions to fulfil the office of that
ancient potentate the Lord of Misrule was blinded in the midst of the
hall The little beings were as busy about him as the mock fairies about
Falstaff pinching him plucking at the skirts of his coat and tickling
him with straws

When I returned to the drawingroom I found the company seated around
the fire listening to the parson who was deeply ensconced in a
highbacked oaken chair From this venerable piece of furniture with
which his shadowy figure and dark weazen face so admirably accorded he
was dealing forth strange accounts of popular superstitions and legends
of the surrounding country with which he had become acquainted in the
course of his antiquarian researches He gave us several anecdotes of
the fancies of the neighbouring peasantry concerning the effigy of the
crusader which lay on the tomb by the church altar It was said to get
up from the tomb and walk the rounds of the churchyard in stormy nights
particularly when it thundered Some talked of gold and jewels buried in
the tomb over which the spectre kept watch and there was a story
current of a sexton in old times who endeavoured to break his way to the
coffin at night but just as he reached it received a violent blow from
the marble hand of the effigy which stretched him senseless on the
pavement From these and other anecdotes that followed the crusader
appeared to be the favourite hero of ghost stories throughout the
vicinity

Whilst we were all attention to the parsons stories our ears were
suddenly assailed by a burst of heterogeneous sounds from the hall in
which was mingled something like the clang of rude minstrelsy with the
uproar of many small voices and girlish laughter The door suddenly flew
open and a train came trooping into the room that might almost have
been mistaken for the breaking up of the court of Fairy That
indefatigable spirit Master Simon in the faithful discharge of his
duties as Lord of Misrule had conceived the idea of a Christmas
mummery or masking The old housekeeper had been consulted the antique
clothespresses and wardrobes rummaged and made to yield up the relics
of finery that had not seen the light for several generations

Illustration Master Simon led the van

Master Simon led the van as ancient Christmas quaintly apparelled in
a ruff a short cloak which had very much the aspect of one of the old
housekeepers petticoats and a hat that might have served for a village
steeple and must indubitably have figured in the days of the
Covenanters From under this his nose curved boldly forth flushed with
a frostbitten bloom that seemed the very trophy of a December blast
He was accompanied by the blueeyed romp dished up as Dame MincePie
in the venerable magnificence of faded brocade long stomacher peaked
hat and highheeled shoes The rest of the train had been metamorphosed
in various ways the girls trussed up in the finery of the ancient
belles of the Bracebridge line and the striplings bewhiskered with
burnt cork and gravely clad in broad skirts hanging sleeves and
fullbottomed wigs to represent characters celebrated in ancient
maskings

The irruption of this motley crew with beat of drum according to
ancient custom was the consummation of uproar and merriment Master
Simon covered himself with glory by the stateliness with which as
Ancient Christmas he walked a minuet with the peerless though
giggling Dame MincePie It was followed by a dance of all the
charactersa medley of quaint costumes

The worthy Squire contemplated these fantastic sports and the
resurrection of his old wardrobe with the simple relish of childish
delight

But enough of Christmas and its gambols it is time for me to pause in
this garrulity In writing to amuse if I fail the only evil is my own
disappointment If however I can by any lucky chance in these days of
evil rub out one wrinkle from the brow of care or beguile the heavy
heart of one moment of sorrow if I can now and then penetrate through
the gathering film of misanthropy prompt a benevolent view of human
nature and make my reader more in good humour with his fellowbeings
and himself surely surely I shall not then have written entirely in
vain

Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenbergtm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone For forty years he produced and
distributed Project Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support

Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the US unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility wwwgutenbergorg

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
