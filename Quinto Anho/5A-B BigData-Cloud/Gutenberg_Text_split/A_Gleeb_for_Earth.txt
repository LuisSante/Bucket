Dear Editor

My  year old boy Ronnie is typing this letter for me because he
can do it neater and use better grammar I had to get in touch with
somebody about this because if there is something to it then somebody
everybody is going to point finger at me Ivan Smernda and say Why
didnt you warn us

I could not go to the police because they are not too friendly to
me because of some of my guests who frankly are stew bums Also they
might think I was on booze too or maybe the hops and get my license
revoked I run a strictly legit hotel even though some of my guests
might be down on their luck now and then

What really got me mixed up in this was the mysterious disappearance of
two of my guests They both took a powder last Wednesday morning

Now get this In one room that of Joe Binkle which maybe is an alias
I find nothing but a suit of clothes some butts and the letters I
include here in same package Binkle had only one suit That I know
And this was it laying right in the middle of the room Inside the
coat was the vest inside the vest the shirt inside the shirt the
underwear The pants were up in the coat and inside of them was also
the underwear All this was buttoned up like Binkle had melted out of
it and dripped through a crack in the floor In a bureau drawer were
the letters I told you about

Now In the room right under Binkles lived another stew bum that
checked in Thursday  name Ed Smith alias maybe too This guy was a
real case He brought with him a big mirror with a heavy bronze frame
Airloom he says He pays a week in advance staggers up the stairs to
his room with the mirror and thats the last I see of him

In Smiths room on Wednesday I find only a suit of clothes the same
suit he wore when he came in In the coat the vest in the vest the
shirt in the shirt the underwear Also in the pants Also all in the
middle of the floor Against the far wall stands the frame of the
mirror Only the frame

What a spot to be in Now it might have been a gag Sometimes these
guys get funny ideas when they are on the stuff But then I read
the letters This knocks me for a loop They are all in different
handwritings All from different places Stamps all legit my kid says
India China England everywhere

My kid he reads He says its no joke He wants to call the cops or
maybe some doctor But I say no He reads your magazine so he says
write to you send you the letters You know what to do Now you have
them Maybe you print Whatever you do Mr Editor remember my place
the Plaza Ritz Arms is straight establishment I dont drink I never
touch junk not even aspirin

    Yours very truly

Dear Joe

Greetings greetings greetings Hold firm in your wretched projection
for tomorrow you will not be alone in the notworld In two days I
Glmpauszn will be born

Today I hang in our newly developed notpod just within the mirror
gateway torn with the agony that we calculated must go with such
tremendous wavelength fluctuations I have attuned myself to a fetus
within the body of a notwoman in the notworld Already I am static
and for hours have looked into this weird extension of the Universe
with fear and trepidation

As soon as my stasis was achieved I tried to contact you but got
no response What could have diminished your powers of articulate
wave interaction to make you incapable of receiving my messages and
returning them My wave went out to yours and found it barely pulsing
and surrounded with an impregnable chimera

Quickly from the notworld vibrations about you I learned the
notknowledge of your location So I must communicate with you by what
the notworld calls mail till we meet For this purpose I must
utilize the feeble vibrations of various notpeople through whose
inadequate articulation I will attempt to make my moves known to you
Each time I will pick a city other than the one I am in at the time

I Glmpauszn come equipped with powers evolved from your fragmentary
reports before you ceased to vibrate to us and with a vast treasury
of facts from indirect sources Soon our tortured people will be free
of the fearsome notfolk and I will be their liberator You failed in
your task but I will try to get you off with light punishment when we
return again

The hand that writes this letter is that of a boy in the notcity of
Bombay in the notcountry of India He does not know he writes it
Tomorrow it will be someone else You must never know of my exact
location for the notpeople might have access to the information

I must leave off now because the notchild is about to be born When it
is alone in the room it will be spirited away and I will spring from
the pod on the gateway into its crib and will be its exact vibrational
likeness

I have tremendous powers But the notpeople must never know I am among
them This is the only way I could arrive in the room where the gateway
lies without arousing suspicion I will grow up as the notchild in
order that I might destroy the notpeople completely

All is well only they shot this information file into my matrix too
fast Im having a hard time sorting facts and make the right decision
Gezsltrysk what a task

Farewell till later

Dear Joe


Mnghjkl fhfjgfhjklop phelnoprausynks No When I communicate with you
I see I must avoid those complexities of procedure for which there are
no terms in this language There is no way of describing to you in
notlanguage what I had to go through during the first moments of my
birth

Now I know what difficulties you must have had with your limited
equipment These notpeople are unpredictable and strange Their doctor
came in and weighed me again the day after my birth Consternation
reigned when it was discovered I was ten pounds heavier What
difference could it possibly make Many doctors then came in to see me
As they arrived hourly they found me heavier and heavier Naturally
since I am growing This is part of my instructions My notmother
Gezsltrysk then burst into tears The doctors conferred threw up
their hands and left

I learned the following day that the opposite component of my
notmother my notfather had been away riding on some conveyance
during my birth He was out on  what did they call it Oh yes a
bender He did not arrive till three days after I was born

When I heard them say that he was straightening up to come see me I
made a special effort and grew marvelously in one afternoon I was 
notworld inches tall by evening My notfather entered while I was
standing by the crib examining a syringe the doctor had left behind
He stopped in his tracks on entering the room and seemed incapable of
speech

Dredging into the treasury of knowledge I had come equipped with I
produced the proper phrase for occasions of this kind in the notworld

Poppa I said

This was the first use I had made of the socalled vocal cords that
are now part of my extended matrix The sound I emitted sounded
lowpitched guttural and penetrating even to myself It must have
jarred on my notfathers ears for he turned and ran shouting from the
room

They apprehended him on the stairs and I heard him babble something
about my being a monster and no child of his My notmother appeared at
the doorway and instead of being pleased at the progress of my growth
she fell down heavily She made a distinct thump on the floor

This brought the rest of them on the run so I climbed out the window
and retreated across a nearby field A prolonged search was launched
but I eluded them What unpredictable beings

I reported my tremendous progress back to our world including the
cleverness by which I managed to escape my pursuers I received a reply
from Blgftury which on careful analysis seems to be small praise
indeed In fact some of his phrases apparently contain veiled threats
But you know old Blgftury He wanted to go on this expedition himself
and its his nature never to flatter anyone

From now on I will refer to notpeople simply as people dropping the
qualifying preface except where comparisons must be made between this
alleged world and our own It is merely an offshoot of our primitive
mythology when this was considered a spirit world just as these people
refer to our world as nevernever land and other anomalies But we
learned otherwise while they never have

New sensations crowd into my consciousness and I am having a hard
time classifying them Anyway I shall carry on swiftly now to the
inevitable climax in which I singlehanded will obliterate the terror of
the notworld and return to our world a hero I cannot understand your
not replying to my letters I have given you a box number What could
have happened to your vibrations

Dear Joe

I had tremendous difficulty getting a letter off to you this time
My processoriginal with myself by the wayis to send out feeler
vibrations for what these people call the psychic individual Then I
establish contact with him while he sleeps and compel him without his
knowledge to translate my ideas into written language He writes my
letter and mails it to you Of course he has no awareness of what he
has done

My first five tries were unfortunate Each time I took control of an
individual who could not read or write Finally I found my man but
I fear his words are limited Ah well I had great things to tell
you about my progress but I cannot convey even a hint of how I have
accomplished these miracles through the thick skull of this incompetent

In simple terms then I crept into a cave and slipped into a kind of
sleep directing my squhjkl ulytz  uhrytzg  no it wont come out
Anyway I grew overnight to the size of an average person here

As I said before floods of impressions are driving into my xzbyl 
my brain  from various nerve and sense areas and I am having a hard
time classifying them My one idea was to get to a chemist and acquire
the stuff needed for the destruction of these people

Sunrise came as I expected According to my catalog of information the
impressions aroused by it are of beauty It took little conditioning
for me finally to react in this manner This is truly an efficient
mechanism I inhabit

I gazed about me at the mixture of lights forms and impressions
It was strange and  now I know  beautiful However I hurried
immediately toward the nearest chemist At the same time I looked up
and all about me at the beauty

Soon an individual approached I knew what to do from my information I
simply acted natural You know one of your earliest instructions was
to realize that these people see nothing unusual in you if you do not
let yourself believe they do

This individual I classified as a female of a singular variety here
Her hair was short her upper torso clad in a woolen garment She
wore  what are they  oh yes sneakers My attention was
diverted by a scream as I passed her I stopped

The woman gesticulated and continued to scream People hurried from
nearby houses I linked my hands behind me and watched the scene with
an attitude of mild interest They werent interested in me I told
myself But they were

I became alarmed dived into a bush and used a mechanism that you
unfortunately do not haveinvisibility I lay there and listened

He was stark naked the girl with the sneakers said

A figure I recognized as a police officer spoke to her

Lizzy youll just have to keep these crackpot friends of yours out of
this area

But

No more buckbathing Lizzy the officer ordered No more speeches
in the Square Not when it results in riots at five in the morning Now
where is your naked friend Im going to make an example of him

That was itI had forgotten clothes There is only one answer to this
oversight on my part My mind is confused by the barrage of impressions
that assault it I must retire now and get them all classified Beauty
pain fear hate love laughter I dont know one from the other I
must feel each become accustomed to it

The more I think about it the more I realize that the information I
have been given is very unrealistic You have been inefficient Joe
What will Blgftury and the others say of this My great mission is
impaired Farewell till I find a more intelligent mind so I can write
you with more enlightenment

Dear Joe

I received your first communication today It baffles me Do you greet
me in the proper fringezone manner No Do you express joy hope
pride helpfulness at my arrival No You ask me for a loan of five
bucks

It took me some time culling my information catalog to come up with
the correct variant of the slang term buck Is it possible that you
are powerless even to provide yourself with the wherewithal to live in
this inferior world

A reminder please You and II in particularare now engaged in
a struggle to free our world from the terrible maiming intrusions
of this notworld Through many long gleebs our people have lived
a semiterrorized existence while errant vibrations from this world
ripped across the closely joined vibration flux whose individual
fluctuations make up our sentient population

Even our eminent allhigh Frequency himself has often been jeopardized
by these people The notworld and our world are like two baskets
as you and I see them in our present forms Baskets woven with the
greatest intricacy design and color but baskets whose convex sides
are joined by a thin fringe of filaments Our world on the vibrational
plane extends just a bit into this the notworld But being a world
of higher vibration it is ultimately tenuous to these gross peoples
While we vibrate only within a restricted plane because of our purer
more stable existence these people radiate widely into our world

They even send what they call psychic reproductions of their own selves
into ours And most infamous of all they sometimes are able to force
some of our individuals over the fringe into their world temporarily
causing them much agony and fright

The latter atrocity is perpetrated through what these people call
mediums spiritualists and other fatuous names I intend to visit one
of them at the first opportunity to see for myself

Meanwhile as to you I would offer a few words of advice I picked
them up while examining the slang portion of my information catalog
which you unfortunately caused me to use So for the ultimate
causein this the penultimate adventure and for the glory and peace
of our worldshake a leg bub Straighten up and fly right In short
get hep

As far as the five bucks is concerned no dice

Dear Joe

Your letter was imponderable till I had thrashed through long passages
in my information catalog that I had never imagined I would need
Biological functions and bodily processes which are labeled here
revolting are used freely in your missive You can be sure they are
all being forwarded to Blgftury If I were not involved in the most
important part of my journeycompletion of the weapon against the
notworldersI would come to New York immediately You would rue that
day I assure you

Dear Joe

A great deal has happened to me since I wrote to you last
Systematically I have tested each emotion and sensation listed in
our catalog I have been as has been said in this world like a reed
bending before the winds of passion In fact Im rather badly bent
indeed Ah Youll pardon me but I just took time for what is known
quaintly in this tongue as a hooker of redeye Ha Ive mastered
even the vagaries of slang in the notlanguage Ahhh Pardon me
again I feel much better now

You see Joe as I attuned myself to the various impressions that
constantly assaulted my mind through this body I conditioned myself to
react exactly as our information catalog instructed me to

Now it is all automatic pure reflex A sensation comes to me when I am
burned then I experience a burning pain If the sensation is a tickle
I experience a tickle

This morning I have what is known medically as a syndrome  a group
of symptoms popularly referred to as a hangover  Ahhh Pardon me
again Strangely  now what was I saying Oh yes Ha ha Strangely
enough the reactions that come easiest to the people in this world
came most difficult to me Moneylove for example It is a great thing
here both among those who havent got it and those who have

I went out and got plenty of money I walked invisible into a bank and
carried away piles of it Then I sat and looked at it I took the money
to a remote room of the twenty room suite I have rented in the best
hotel here inno sorryand stared at it for hours

Nothing happened I didnt love the stuff or feel one way or the other
about it Yet all around me people are actually killing one another for
the love of it

Anyway Ahhh Pardon me I got myself enough money to fill ten or
fifteen rooms By the end of the week I should have all eighteen spare
rooms filled with money If I dont love it then Ill feel I have
failed This alcohol is taking effect now

Blgftury has been goading me for reports To hell with his reports
Ive got a lot more emotions to try such as romantic love Ive been
studying this phenomenon along with other racial characteristics of
these people in the movies This is the best place to see these
people as they really are They all go into the movie houses and there
do homage to their own images Very quaint type of idolatry

Love Ha What an adventure this is becoming

By the way Joe Im forwarding that five dollars You see it wont
cost me anything Itll come out of the pocket of the idiot whos
writing this letter Pretty shrewd of me eh

Im going out and look at that money again I think Im at last
learning to love it though not as much as I admire liquor Well one
simply must persevere I always say

Dear Joe

Now you tell me not to drink alcohol Why not You never mentioned it
in any of your vibrations to us gleebs ago when you first came across
to this world It will stint my powers Nonsense Already I have had a
quart of the liquid today I feel wonderful Get that I actually feel
wonderful in spite of this miserable imitation of a body

There are long hours during which I am so wellintegrated into this
body and this world that I almost consider myself a member of it Now
I can function efficiently I sent Blgftury some long reports today
outlining my experiments in the realm of chemistry where we must
finally defeat these people Of course I havent made the experiments
yet but I will This is not deceit merely realistic anticipation of
the inevitable Anyway what the old xbyzrt doesnt know wont muss his
vibrations

I went to what they call a nightclub here and picked out a
blondehaired woman the kind that the books say men prefer She was
attracted to me instantly After all the body I have devised is
perfect in every detail  actually a notworld ideal

I didnt lose any time overwhelming her susceptibilities I remember
distinctly that just as I stooped to pick up a large roll of money I
had dropped her eyes met mine and in them I could see her admiration
We went to my suite and I showed her one of the money rooms Would you
believe it She actually took off her shoes and ran around through the
money in her bare feet Then we kissed

Concealed in the dermis of the lips are tiny highly sensitized nerve
ends which send sensations to the brain The brain interprets these
impulses in a certain manner As a result the fate of secretion in the
adrenals on the ends of the kidneys increases and an enlivening of the
entire endocrine system follows Thus I felt the beginnings of love

I sat her down on a pile of money and kissed her again Again the
tingling again the secretion and activation I integrated myself
quickly

Now in all the motion picturestrue representations of life and love
in this worldthe man with a lot of money or virtue kisses the girl
and tries to induce her to do something biological She then refuses
This pleases both of them for he wanted her to refuse She in turn
wanted him to want her but also wanted to prevent him so that he would
have a high opinion of her Do I make myself clear

I kissed the blonde girl and gave her to understand what I then wanted
Well you can imagine my surprise when she said yes So I had failed I
had not found love

I became so abstracted by this problem that the blonde girl fell
asleep I thoughtfully drank quantities of excellent alcohol called gin
and didnt even notice when the blonde girl left

I am now beginning to feel the effects of this alcohol again Ha Dont
I wish old Blgftury were here in the vibrational pattern of an olive
Id get the blonde in and have her eat him out of a Martini That is a
gin mixture

I think Ill get a hot report off to the old soandso right now Itll
take him a gleeb to figure this one out Ill tell him Im setting up
an atomic reactor in the sewage systems here and that all we have to do
is activate it and all the notpeople will die of chain asphyxiation

Boy what an easy job this turned out to be Its just a vacation Joe
you old goldbricker imagine you here all these gleebs living off the
fat of the land Yak yak Affectionately

Dear Joe

All is lost unless we work swiftly I received your revealing letter
the morning after having a terrible experience of my own I drank a
lot of gin for two days and then decided to go to one of these seance
things

Somewhere along the way I picked up a redheaded girl When we got
to the darkened seance room I took the redhead into a corner and
continued my investigations into the realm of love I failed again
because she said yes immediately

The nerves of my dermis were working overtime when suddenly I had the
most frightening experience of my life Now I know what a horror these
people really are to our world

The medium had turned out all the lights He said there was a strong
psychic influence in the room somewhere That was me of course but I
was too busy with the redhead to notice

Anyway Mrs Somebody wanted to make contact with her paternal
grandmother Lucy from the beyond The medium went into his act He
concentrated and sweated and suddenly something began to take form in
the room The best way to describe it in notworld language is a white
shapeless cascade of light

Mrs Somebody reared to her feet and screeched Grandma Lucy Then I
really took notice

Grandma Lucy nothing This medium had actually brought Blgftury
partially across the vibration barrier He must have been vibrating in
the fringe area and got caught in the works Did he look mad His zyhku
was open and his btgrimms were down

Worst of all he saw me Looked right at me with an unbelievable
pattern of pain anger fear and amazement in his matrix Me and the
redhead

Then comes your letter today telling of the fate that befell you as a
result of drinking alcohol Our wrenchingly attuned faculties in these
notworld bodies need the loathsome drug to escape from the reality
of notreality Its true I cannot do without it now The day is only
half over and I have consumed a quart and a half And it is dulling all
my powers as it has practically obliterated yours I cant even become
invisible any more

I must find the formula that will wipe out the notworld men quickly

Quickly

Dear Joe

This telepathic control becomes more difficult every time I must pick
closer points of communication soon I have nothing to report but
failure I bought a ton of equipment and went to work on the formula
that is half complete in my instructions Six of my hotel rooms were
filled with tubes pipes and apparatus of all kinds

I had got my mechanism as close to perfect as possible when I
realized that in my befuddled condition I had set off a reaction
that inevitably would result in an explosion I had to leave there
immediately but I could not create suspicion The management was not
aware of the nature of my activities

I moved swiftly I could not afford time to bring my baggage I
stuffed as much money into my pockets as I could and then sauntered
into the hotel lobby Assuming my most casual air I told the manager
I was checking out Naturally he was stunned since I was his best
customer

But why sir he asked plaintively

I was baffled What could I tell him

Dont you like the rooms he persisted Isnt the service good

Its the rooms I told him Theyretheyre

Theyre what he wanted to know

Theyre not safe

Not safe But that is ridiculous This hotel is

At this point the blast came My nerves were a wreck from the alcohol

See I screamed Not safe I knew they were going to blow up

He stood paralyzed as I ran from the lobby Oh well never say die
Another day another hotel I swear Im even beginning to think like
the notmen curse them

Dear Joe

I have it It is done In spite of the alcohol in spite of Blgfturys
niggling criticism I have succeeded I now have developed a form
of mold somewhat similar to the antibiotics of this world that
transmitted to the human organism will cause a disease whose end will
be swift and fatal

First the brain will dissolve and then the body will fall apart
Nothing in this world can stop the spread of it once it is loose
Absolutely nothing

We must use care Stock in as much gin as you are able I will bring
with me all that I can Meanwhile I must return to my original place of
birth into this world of horrors There I will secure the gateway a
large mirror the vibrational point at which we shall meet and slowly
climb the frequency scale to emerge into our own beautiful now secure
world You and I together Joe conquerors liberators

You say you eat little and drink as much as you can The same with
me Even in this revolting world I am a sad sight My notworld senses
falter This is the last letter Tomorrow I come with the gateway When
the gin is gone we will plant the mold in the hotel where you live

In only a single gleeb it will begin to work The men of this queer
world will be no more But we cant say we didnt have some fun can
we Joe

And just let Blgftury make one crack Just one xyzprlt Ill have
hgutry before the ghjdksla
