It was at this period of her life that she was violently attacked by a
mania for the stage and writing and enacting dramas Her older sister
Anna had the same taste and assisted her in carrying out all her
plans

                           A FOREWORD BY MEG

In the good old times when Little Women worked and played together
the big garret was the scene of many dramatic revels After a long day
of teaching sewing and helping mother the greatest delight of the
girls was to transform themselves into queens knights and cavaliers of
high degree and ascend into a world of fancy and romance Cinderellas
godmother waved her wand and the dismal room became a fairyland
Flowers bloomed forests arose music sounded and lovers exchanged
their vows by moonlight Nothing was too ambitious to attempt armor
gondolas harps towers and palaces grew as if by magic and wonderful
scenes of valor and devotion were enacted before admiring audiences

Jo of course played the villains ghosts bandits and disdainful
queens for her tragedyloving soul delighted in the lurid parts and no
drama was perfect in her eyes without a touch of the demonic or
supernatural Meg loved the sentimental rles the tender maiden with
the airy robes and flowing locks who made impossible sacrifices for
ideal lovers or the cavalier singing soft serenades and performing
lofty acts of gallantry and prowess Amy was the fairy sprite while
Beth enacted the page or messenger when the scene required their aid

But the most surprising part of the performance was the length of the
cast and the size of the company for Jo and Meg usually acted the whole
play each often assuming five or six characters and with rapid change
of dress becoming in one scene a witch a soldier a beauteous lady
and a haughty noble This peculiar arrangement accounts for many queer
devices and the somewhat singular fact that each scene offers but two
actors who vanish and reappear at most inopportune moments and in a
great variety of costume Long speeches were introduced to allow a
ruffian to become a priest or a lovely damsel to disguise herself in
the garb of a sorceress while great skill was required to preserve the
illusion and astonish the audience by these wonderful transformations

The young amateur of today who can easily call to her aid all the arts
of the costumer and scenemaker will find it hard to understand the
difficulties of this little company for not only did they compose
their plays but they were also their own carpenters scenepainters
propertymen dressmakers and managers In place of a wellappointed
stage with the brilliant lights and inspiring accessories of a mimic
theatre the Little Women had a gloomy garret or empty barn and were
obliged to exercise all their ingenuity to present the scenes of their
ambitious dramas

But it is surprising what fine effects can be produced with old sheets
bright draperies and a judicious arrangement of lights garlands and
picturesque properties and Jos dramatic taste made her an admirable
stagemanager Meg was especially handy with saw and hammer and acted
as stagecarpenterbuilding balconies thrones boats and towers
after peculiar designs of her own Bureaus tables and chairs piled
aloft and arched with dark shawls made dungeon walls and witchs cave
or formed a background for haunted forest and lonely glen Screens of
white cloth furnished canvas on which little Amys skilful hand depicted
palace halls or romantic scene for lovers tryst and Beths deft
fingers were most apt in constructing properties for stage adornment
and transforming the frailest material into dazzling raiment For the
costumes were a serious consideration No money could be spared from the
slender purse to supply the wardrobes of these aspiring actors and many
were the devices to clothe the little company

Thus a robe in one scene became a cloak in the next and the drapery of
a couch in the third while a bit of lace served as mantle veil or
turban as best suited the turn of the play Hats covered with old
velvet and adorned with feathers plucked from the duster made most
effective headgear for gay cavalier or tragic villain From colored
cotton were manufactured fine Greek tunics and flowing trains and
remarkable court costumes were evolved from an old sofacovering which
had seen better days and boasted a little gold thread and embroidery

Stars of tin sewed upon dark cambric made a suit of shining armor
Sandals were cut from old boots Strips of wood and silver paper were
fashioned into daggers swords and spears while from cardboard were
created helmets harps guitars and antique lamps that were considered
masterpieces of stage art

Everything available was pressed into service colored paper odds and
ends of ribbon even tin cans and their bright wrappings were treasures
to the young actors and all reappeared as splendid properties

At first a store of red curtains some faded brocades and ancient
shawls comprised the stage wardrobe but as the fame of the performances
spread abroad contributions were made to the little stock and the
girls became the proud possessors of a velvet robe a plumed hat adorned
with silver long yellow boots and a quantity of mock pearls and tinsel
ornaments

Such wealth determined them to write a play which should surpass all
former efforts give Jo a chance to stalk haughtily upon the stage in
the magnificent boots and Meg to appear in gorgeous train and diadem of
jewels

The Witchs Curse was the result and it was produced with astounding
effect quite paralyzing the audience by its splendid gloom Jo called
it the lurid drama and always considered it her masterpiece But it
cost hours of thought and labor for to construct a dungeon a haunted
chamber a cavern and a lonely forest taxed to the uttermost the
ingenuity of the actors To introduce into one short scene a bandit two
cavaliers a witch and a fairy spiritall enacted by two
peoplerequired some skill and lightning change of costume To call
up the ghostly visions and mysterious voices which should appall the
guilty Count Rodolpho was a task of no small difficulty But inspired
by the desire to outshine themselves the children accomplished a play
full of revenge jealousy murder and sorcery of all which indeed they
knew nothing but the name

Hitherto their dramas had been of the most sentimental description
given to the portrayal of womans devotion filial affection heroism
and selfsacrifice Indeed these Comic Tragedies with their highflown
romance and fantastic ideas of love and honor are most characteristic
of the young girls whose lives were singularly free from the experiences
of many maidens of their age

Of the world they knew nothing lovers were ideal beings clothed with
all the beauty of their innocent imaginations Love was a blissful
dream constancy truth courage and virtue quite everyday affairs of
life Their few novels furnished the romantic element the favorite
fairytales gave them material for the supernatural and their strong
dramatic taste enabled them to infuse both fire and pathos into their
absurd situations

Jo revelled in catastrophe and the darker scenes were her delight but
she usually required Meg to do the lovepart which she considered
quite beneath her pen Thus their productions were a queer mixture of
sentiment and adventure with entire disregard of such matters as
grammar history and geographyall of which were deemed of no
importance by these aspiring dramatists

From the little stage library still extant the following plays have
been selected as fair examples of the work of these children of sixteen
and seventeen With some slight changes and omissions they remain as
written more than forty years ago by Meg and Jo so dear to the hearts
of many other Little Women

                                                        Theresa dies

Rod Tis done and I am rid of her forever but tis an ugly deed Poor

                                                       Exit Rodolpho

                The panel opens and Norna enters

Norna Heaven shield us What is this His cruel hand hath done the
deed and I am powerless to save Poor murdered lady I had hoped to
spare thee this and lead thee to a happier home Perchance tis better
so The dead find rest and thy sad heart can ache no more Rest to thy
soul sweet lady But for thee thou cruel villain I have in store a
deep revenge for all thy sinful deeds If there be power in spell or
charm Ill conjure fearful dreams upon thy head Ill follow thee
wherever thou mayst go and haunt thy sleep with evil visions Ill
whisper strange words that shall appall thee dark phantoms shall rise
up before thee and wild voices ringing in thine ear shall tell thee of
thy sins By all these will I make life like a hideous dream and death
more fearful still Like a vengeful ghost I will haunt thee to thy
grave and so revenge thy wrongs poor murdered lady Beware Rodolpho
Old Nornas curse is on thee

    She bears away Theresas body through the secret door and
        vanishes

                                CURTAIN


                         NOTE TO SCENE SECOND

The mysterious cave was formed of old furniture covered with dark
draperies an opening being left at the back wherein the spirits called
up by Norna might appear A kitchen kettle filled with steaming water
made an effective caldron over which the sorceress should murmur her
incantations flaming pineknots cast a lurid glare over the scene and
large boughs artfully arranged about the stage gave it the appearance
of a gloomy wood

When Louis retires within he at once arrays himself in the white
robes of the vision and awaits the witchs call to rise behind the
aperture in true dramatic style He vanishes quickly resumes his own
attire while Norna continues to weave her spells till she sees he is
ready to appear once more as the disguised Count Louis


                             SCENE SECOND

    A wood Nornas cave among the rocks Enter Louis
            masked

Louis Yes tis the spot How dark and still She is not here Ho
Norna mighty sorceress I seek thy aid

Norna rising from the cave I am here

Louis I seek thee Norna to learn tidings of one most dear to me Dost
thou know aught of Count Rodolphos wife A strange tale hath reached me
that not many nights ago she disappeared and none know whither she hath
gone Oh tell me is this true

Norna It is most true

Louis And canst thou tell me whither she hath gone I will reward thee
well

Norna I can She lies within her tomb in the chapel of the castle

Louis Deadit cannot be They told me she had fled away with some
young lord who had won her love Was it not true

Norna It is false as the villains heart who framed the tale I bore
the murdered lady to her tomb and laid her there

Louis Murdered How When By whom Oh tell me I beseech thee

Norna Her husbands cruel hand took the life he had made a burden I
heard him swear it ere he dealt the blow

Louis Wherefore did he kill her Oh answer quickly or I shall go mad
with grief and hate

Norna I can tell thee little From my hidingplace I heard her vow
never to confess whose dagger had been found in her apartment and her
jealous lord in his wild anger murdered her

Louis Twas mine Would it had been sheathed in mine own breast ere it
had caused so dark a deed Ah Theresa why did I leave thee to a fate
like this

Norna Young man grieve not it is too late to save but there is left
to thee a better thing than grief

Louis Oh what

Norna Revenge

Louis Thou art right Ill weep no more Give me thine aid O mighty
wizard and I will serve thee well

Norna Who art thou The poor ladys lover

Louis Ah no far nearer and far deeper was the love I bore her for I
am her brother

Norna Ha thats well Thou wilt join me for I have made a vow to rest
not till that proud sinful lord hath well atoned for this deep crime
Spirits shall haunt him and the darkest phantoms that my art can raise
shall scare his soul Wilt thou join me in my work

Louis I willbut stay thou hast spoken of spirits Dread sorceress
is it in thy power to call them up

Norna It is Wilt see my skill Stand back while I call up a phantom
which thou canst not doubt

    Louis retires within the cave Norna weaves a spell above
        her caldron

    Norna O spirit from thy quiet tomb
    I bid thee hither through the gloom
    In windingsheet with bloody brow
    Rise up and hear our solemn vow
    I bid thee with my magic power
    Tell the dark secret of that hour
    When cruel hands with blood and strife
    Closed the sad dream of thy young life
    Hitherappear before our eyes
    Pale spirit I command thee rise

                                           Spirit of Theresa rises

    Shadowy spirit I charge thee well
    By my mystic arts most potent spell
    To haunt throughout his sinful life
    The mortal who once called thee wife
    At midnight hour glide round his bed
    And lay thy pale hand on his head
    Whisper wild words in his sleeping ear
    And chill his heart with a deadly fear
    Rise at his side in his gayest hour
    And his guilty soul shall feel thy power
    Stand thou before him in day and night
    And cast oer his life a darksome blight
    For with all his power and sin and pride
    He shall neer forget his murdered bride
    Pale shadowy form wilt thou obey
                                            The spirit bows its head
    To thy ghostly work awayaway
                                                 The spirit vanishes
    The spell is oer the vow is won
    And sinful heart thy curse begun
                                                      Reenter Louis

Louis Tis enough I own thy power and by the spirit of my murdered
sister I have looked upon I swear to aid thee in thy dark work

Norna Tis well and I will use my power to guard thee from the danger
that surrounds thee And now farewell Rememberthou hast sworn


                                                          Exit Louis

                                CURTAIN


                              SCENE THIRD

evil deeds against me Stay some one comes Ill ask my way

                                                Enter Louis masked

Ho stand good sir Canst guide me to the cell of Norna the old
sorceress

Louis It were little use to tell thee thou wouldst only win a deeper
curse than that she hath already laid upon thee

Rod Hold who art thou that dare to speak thus to Count Rodolpho

Louis That thou canst never know but this I tell thee I am thy
deadliest foe and aided by the wizard Norna seek to work thee evil
and bring down upon thy head the fearful doom thy sin deserves Wouldst

Rod Fool thinkst thou I fear thee or thy enchantments Draw and
defend thyself Thou shalt pay dearly for thine insolence to me
                                                     Draws his sword

Louis I will not stain my weapon with a murderers blood I leave thee
to the fate that gathers round thee

                                                         Exit Louis

Rod Murderer said he I am betrayedyet no one saw the deed Yet

Rod I see no way save that Were young Count Louis dead she would
forget the love that had just begun and by sweet words and gifts I may

Ill not do the deed myselfI have had enough of blood Hugo the
bandit he is just the manbold sure of hand and secret I will
bribe him well and when the deed is done find means to rid me of him
lest he should play me false I saw him in the courtyard as I entered
Perchance he is not yet gone Ho without there Bid Hugo here if he be

                                                          Enter Hugo

                    Rodolpho rushes wildly out

                          NOTE TO SCENE FIFTH

The apparently impossible transformations of this scene when played by
two actors only may be thus explained

The costumes of Louis and Norna being merely loose garments afford
opportunities for rapid change and the indulgent audience overlooking
such minor matters as boots and wigs it became an easy matter for Jo to
transform herself into either of the four characters which she assumed
on this occasion

Beneath the flowing robes of the sorceress Jo was fully dressed as Count
Rodolpho Laid conveniently near were the black cloak hat and mask of
Louisalso the white draperies required for the ghostly Theresa

Thus Norna appears in long gray robe to which are attached the hood
and elflocks of the witch Seeing Hugo approach she conceals herself
among the trees thus gaining time to don the costume of Louis and
appear to Hugo who awaits him

Hugo stabs and drags him from the stage Louis then throws off his
disguise and becomes Rodolpho fully dressed for his entrance a moment
later

As Hugo does not again appear it is an easy matter to assume the
character of the spectre and produce the sights and sounds which terrify
the guilty Count then slipping on the witchs robe be ready to glide
forth and close the scene with dramatic effect

                              SCENE SIXTH

                 Chamber in the castle of Lady Leonore
                           Enter Leonore

Leonore Ah how wearily the days go by No tidings of Count Louis and
Count Rodolpho urges on his suit so earnestly I must accept his hand
today or refuse his love and think no more of Louis I know not how
to choose Rodolpho loves me I am an orphan and alone and in his
lovely home I may be happy I have heard it whispered that he is both
stern and cruel yet methinks it cannot behe is so tender when with
me Ah would I could forget Count Louis He hath never told his love
and doubtless thinks no more of her who treasures up his gentle words
and cannot banish them even when another offers a heart and home few
would refuse How shall I answer Count Rodolpho when he comes I do not
love him as I should and yet it were no hard task to learn with so fond
a teacher Shall I accept his love or shall I reject

                                              Norna suddenly appears

Norna Reject

Leonore Who art thou Leave me or I call for aid

Norna Nay lady fear not I come not here to harm thee but to save
thee from a fate far worse than death I am old Norna of the forest and
though they call me witch and sorceress I am a woman yet and with a
heart to pity and to love I would save thy youth and beauty from the
blight I fear will fall upon thee

Leonore Save me from what How knowest thou I am in danger and from
what wouldst thou save me Norna

Norna From Lord Rodolpho lady

Leonore Ah and why from him Tell on Ill listen to thee now He hath
offered me his heart and hand Why should I not accept them Norna

Norna That heart is filled with dark and evil passions and that hand
is stained with blood Ay lady well mayst thou start I will tell thee
more The splendid home he would lead thee to is darkened by a fearful
crime and his fair palace haunted by the spirit of a murdered wife

                                                   Leonore starts up

Leonore Wife sayest thou He told me he was never wed Mysterious
woman tell me more How dost thou know tis true and wherefore was it
done I have a right to know Oh speak and tell me all

Norna For that have I come hither He hath been wed to a lady young
and lovely as thyself He kept her prisoner in his splendid home and by
neglect and cruelty he broke as warm and true a heart as ever beat in
womans breast Her brother stole unseen to cheer and comfort her and
this aroused her lords suspicions and he bid her to confess who was
her unknown friend She would not yield her brother to his hate and he
in his wild anger murdered her I heard his cruel words her prayers for
mercy and I stood beside the lifeless form and marked the blow his evil
hand had given her And there I vowed I would avenge the deed and for
this have I come hither to warn thee of thy danger He loves thee only
for thy wealth and when thou art his will wrong thee as he hath the
meek Theresa

Leonore How shall I ever thank thee for this escape from sorrow and
despair I did not love him but I am alone and his kind words were
sweet and tender I thought with him I might be happy yet butAh how
little did I dream of sin like this Thank Heaven tis not too late

Norna How wilt thou answer Lord Rodolpho now

Leonore I will answer him with all the scorn and loathing that I feel
I fear him not and he shall learn how his false vows are despised and
his sins made known

Norna Tis well but staybe thou not too proud Speak fairly and
reject him courteously for he will stop at nought in his revenge if
thou but rouse his hatred And now farewell Ill watch above thee and
in thy hour of danger old Norna will be nigh Stay give me some token
by which thou wilt know the messenger I may find cause to send thee The
fierce Count will seek to win thee and repay thy scorn by all the evil
his cruel heart can bring

Leonore Take this ring and I will trust whoever thou mayst send with
it I owe thee much and believe me I am grateful for thy care and
will repay thee by my confidence and truth Farewell old Norna watch
thou above the helpless and thine old age shall be made happy by my
care

Norna Heaven bless thee gentle lady Good angels guard thee Norna
will not forget

                                                          Exit Norna

Leonore Tis like a dream so strange so terriblehe whom I thought
so gentle and so true is stained with fearful crimes Poor murdered
lady Have I escaped a fate like thine Ah I hear his step Now heart
be firm and he shall enter here no more

                                                      Enter Rodolpho

Rod Sweet lady I am here to learn my fate I have told my love and
thou hast listened I have asked thy hand and thou hast not refused it
I have offered all that I possessmy home my heart Again I lay them
at thy feet beloved Leonore Oh wilt thou but accept them poor tho
they be and in return let me but claim this fair hand as mine own

                                Takes her hand and kneels before her

Leonore withdrawing her hand My lord forgive me but I cannot
grant it When last we met thou didst bid me ask my heart if it could
love thee It hath answered Nay I grieve I cannot make a fit return
for all you offer but I have no love to give and without it this poor
hand were worthless There are others far more fit to grace thy home
than I Go win thyself a loving bride and so forget Leonore

Rod What hath changed thee thus since last we met Then wert thou kind
and listened gladly to my love Now there is a scornful smile upon thy
lips and a proud light in thine eye What means this Why dost thou
look so coldly on me Leonore Who has whispered false tales in thine
ear Believe them not I am as true as Heaven to thee then do not cast
away the heart so truly thine Smile on me dearest thou art my first
last only love

Leonore Tis false my lord Hast thou so soon forgot Theresa

Rod What Who told thee that accursed tale What dost thou mean
Leonore

Leonore I mean thy sinful deeds are known Thou hast asked me why I
will not wed thee and I answer I will not give my hand unto a
murderer

Rod Murderer No more of this Thy tale is false forget it and I will
forgive the idle words Now listen I came hither to receive thy answer
to my suit Think ere thou decide Thou art an orphan unprotected and
alone I am powerful and great Wilt thou take my love and with it
honor wealth happiness and ease or my hate which will surely follow
thee and bring down desolation on thee and all thou lovest Now choose
my hatred or my love

Leonore My lord I scorn thy love and I defy thy hate Work thy will
I fear thee not I am not so unprotected as thou thinkest There are
unseen friends around me who will save in every peril and who are sworn
to take revenge on thee for thy great sins This is my answer
henceforth we are strangers now leave me I would be alone

Rod Not yet proud lady If thou wilt not love Ill make thee learn to
fear the heart thou hast so scornfully cast away Let thy friends guard
thee well thou wilt need their care when I begin my work of vengeance
Thou mayst smile but thou shalt rue the day when Count Rodolpho asked
and was refused But I will yet win thee and then beware And when thou
dost pray for mercy on thy knees remember the haughty words thou hast
this day spoken

Leonore Do thy worst murderer spirits will watch above me and thou
canst not harm Adieu my lord

                                                        Exit Leonore

Rod Foiled again Some demon works against me Who could have told her
of Theresa A little longer and I should have won a rich young bride
and now this tale of murder mars it all But I will win her yet and
wring her proud heart till she shall bend her haughty head and sue for
mercy

How shall it be done Stay Ha I see a waythe letter Louis would
have sent her ere he died She knows not of his death and I will send
this paper bidding her to meet her lover in the forest She cannot doubt
the lines his own hand traced She will obeyand Ill be there to lead
her to my castle Ill wed her and she may scorn weep and pray in
vain Ha ha proud Leonore spite of thy guardian spirits thou shalt be
mine and then for my revenge

                                                       Exit Rodolpho

Rod Dangers seem thickening round me Some secret spy is watching me
unseenI fear tis Hugo spite the gold I gave him and the vows he
made A higher bribe may win the secret from him and then I am undone

the castle on the night when Leonore so strangely vanished a laugh
Hawhats thatmethought I heard that mocking laugh again I am
grown fearful as a child since that most awful night Well well let it
pass If Hugo comes tonight obedient to the message I have sent Ill
see he goes not hence alive This cup shalt be thy last good Hugo
Puts poison in the winecup He comesnow for my revenge
Enter Hugo Ah Hugo welcome How hath it fared with thee since
last we met Thou lookest wearyhere is wine sit and refresh thyself

Hugo I came not hither Count Rodolpho to seek wine but gold Hark
ye I am poor thou art rich but in my power for proud and noble
though thou art the lowborn Hugo can bring death and dishonor on thy
head by whispering one word to the king Hanow give me gold or I will
betray thee

Rod Thou bold villain what means this I paid thee well and thou
didst vow to keep my secret Threaten me not Thou art in my power and
shall never leave this room alive I fear thee not My menials are at

poor This castle only is mine own and I am seeking now a rich young
bride whose wealth will hide my poverty Be just good Hugo and forgive
the harsh words I have spoken Wait till I am wed and I will pay thee
well

Hugo That will I not Ill have no more of thee false lord The king
will well reward me and thou mayst keep thy gold Farewell Thou wilt
see me once again

Rod Stay Hugo stay Give me but time I may obtain the gold Wait a
little and it shall be thine Wilt thou not drink Tis the wine thou

head and fear within my heart Will the sun never set How slow the
hours pass In the first gloom of night concealed in yonder old monks
robe Ill silently glide forth and fly from Hugo and this haunted
house Courage Rodolpho thou shalt yet win a name and fortune for
thyself Now let me rest awhile I shall need strength for the perils of
the night lies down and sleeps

Adrian Dear lady can I do nought to while away the lonely hours Shall
I go forth and bring thee flowers or seek thy home and bear away thy

    forever cherish thee If thou canst grant this blessed boon
    fling from the casement the white rose I send thee but if thou
    canst not accept my love forgive me for avowing it and drop
    the cypress bough I have twined about the rose I will not pain
    thee to refuse in wordsthe mournful token is enough Ask

Oh how shall I reply to thishow blight a love so tender and so true
I have longed to show my gratitude to prove how I have revered this
noble friend The hour has come when I may make his happiness and prove
my trust And yet my heart belongs to Louis and I cannot love another
Adrian was his friend he loved him and confided me to him Nobly hath
he fulfilled that trust and where could I find a truer friend than he
who hath saved me from danger and from death and now gives me the power
to gladden and to bless his life Adrian if thou wilt accept a sisters
love and friendship they shall be thine Louis forgive me if I wrong
thee for though I yield my hand my heart is thine forever This rose
Adrian to thee this mournful cypress shall be mine in memory of my
blighted hopes goes to the window and looks out See he is
waiting yonder by the fountain for the token that shall bring him joy or
sorrow Thou noble friend thy brave true heart shall grieve no longer

Leonore At length the hour hath come when I shall look upon the face
of him whom I this day have sworn to love and honor as a wife I have
perchance been rash in wedding one I know not but will not cast a
doubt on him who hath proved the noble heart that beats within his
breast I am his and come what may the vows I have this day made shall
be unbroken Ah he comes and now shall I gaze upon my husbands face

Leonore Louis Louis Tis a blessed dream

Louis No dream my Leonore it is thy living Louis who hath watched
above thee and now claims thee for his own Ah dearest I have tried
thee too hardlypardon me

Leonore Oh Louis husband I have nought to pardon my life my
liberty my happinessall all I owe to thee How shall I repay thee
Weeps upon his bosom

Louis By banishing these tears dear love and smiling on me as you
used to do Here love sit beside me while I tell thee my most strange
tale and then no longer shalt thou wonder Art happy now thy Adrian
hath flung by his mask

Leonore Happy What deeper joy can I desire than that of seeing thy
dear face once more But tell me Louis how couldst thou dwell so long
beside me and not cheer my bitter sorrow when I grieved for thee

Louis Ah Leonore thou wouldst not reproach me didst thou know how
hard I struggled with my heart lest I should by some tender word some
fond caress betray myself when thou didst grieve for me

Leonore Why didst thou fear to tell thy Leonore She would have aided
and consoled thee Why didst thou let me pine in sorrow at thy side
when but a word had filled my heart with joy

Louis Dearest I dared not Thou knowest I was banished by the hate of
that fiend Rodolpho I had a fair and gentle sister whom he wed and
after cruelty and coldness that I dread to think of now he murdered
her I sought old Nornas aid She promised it and well hath kept her
word When Count Rodolphos ruffian left me dying in the forest she
saved and brought me back to life She bade me take a solemn vow not to
betray myself and to aid her in her vengeance on the murderer of
Theresa Nor could I own my name and rank lest it should reach the king
who had banished me The vow I took and have fulfilled

Leonore And is there no danger now Art thou safe dear Louis from the
Count

Louis Fear not my love He will never harm us more his crimes are
known The king hath pardoned me I have won thee back He is an
outcast and old Nornas spells have wellnigh driven him mad My
sister thou art well avenged Alas alas would I could have saved and
led thee hither to this happy home

Leonore Ah grieve not Louis she is happy now and thy Leonore will
strive to fill her place Hast thou told me all

Louis Nay love Thou knowest how I watched above thee but thou canst
never know the joy thy faithful love for one thou mourned as dead hath
brought me I longed to cast aside the dark disguise I had vowed to
wear but dared not while Rodolpho was at liberty Now all is safe I
have tried thy love and found it true Oh may I prove most worthy of
it dearest

Leonore Louis how can I love too faithfully the friend who mid his
own grief and danger loved and guarded me I trusted thee as Adrian as
Louis I shall love thee until death

Louis And I shall prize most tenderly the faithful heart that trusted
me through doubt and mystery Now life is bright and beautiful before
us and may you never sorrow that thou gavst thy heart to Louis and
thy hand to Adrian the Black Mask

Rod starting up Who is there Stand back Ill sell my life most
dearly Ah tis no dreamI am fettered Where is my sword

Hugo In my safe keeping Count Rodolpho lest in thy rage thou mayst
be tempted to add another murder to thy list of sins Rodolpho sinks
down in despair Didst think thou couldst escape Ah no although
most swift of foot and secret Hugo hath watched and followed thee I
swore to win both gold and vengeance The king hath offered high reward
for thy poor head and it is mine Methinks it may cheer your solitude
my lord so I came hither on my way to bear thy death warrant to the
captain of the guard What wilt thou give for this Hark ye were this
destroyed thou mightst escape ere another were prepared How dost thou
like the plot

Rod And wilt thou save me Hugo Give me not up to the king Ill be
thy slave All I possess is thine Ill give thee countless gold Ah
pity and save me Hugo

Hugo Ha ha I did but jest Thinkest thou I could forego the joy of
seeing thy proud head laid low Where was thy countless gold when I did
ask it of thee No no thou canst not tempt me to forget my vengeance
Tis Hugos turn to play the master now Mayst thou rest well and so
good even my lord

thou didst hate He did thy bidding and thy victim fell but Norna
saved and healed his wounds She told him of his murdered sisters
fate and he hath joined her in her work of vengeance and foiled thee
in thy sinful plots I saved Leonore and guarded her till I had won her
heart and hand and in her love find solace for the sorrow thou hast
caused Dost doubt the tale Look on thine unknown foe and find it true

and haunt thee to thy death I freed the Lady Leonore I mocked and
haunted thee in palace wood and cell I warned Hugo and betrayed
thee to his power and I brought down this awful doom upon thee As
thou didst refuse all mercy to thy victims so shall mercy be denied to

                     A thick wood Storm coming on
                            Enter Ernest

Ernest This summer sky darkened by storm is a fit emblem of my life
O happy England why did I leave thee why let dreams of fame and honor
win me from a home to wander now a lonely and bewildered fugitive But
why do I repine Life health and a brave heart yet are mine and mid
all my peril God may send some joy to cheer me on to happiness and
honor Hist a footstep Tis a light one but a Moorish foe steals
like a serpent on his prey Ill hide me here and if need be Ill sell
my life as a brave man should conceals himself among the trees

                                               Enter Zara weeping

Zara Heaven shield me Whither shall I turn Alone in this wild forest
where may I find a friend to help The dark storm gathers fast and I am
shelterless The fierce Spaniard may be wandering nigh and I dare not
call for aid Mistress of a hundred slaves here must I perish for one
to lead me Father the faint heart turns to thee when earthly help is
past hear and succor thy poor child now who puts her trust in thee

Ernest coming forward Lady thy prayer is heard God hath not sent
me here in vain How may I best serve thee

Zara Gentle stranger pity and protect a hapless maid who puts her
faith in thee Guide me from this wild wood and all the thanks a
grateful heart can give are thine

Ernest I ask no higher honor than to shield so fair a flower from the
storm or from rude hands that may harm it But how chanced it lady
that thou art wandering thus unattended Tis unsafe for youth and
beauty while the Spanish army is so near

Zara It was a foolish fancy led me hither and dearly am I punished
Journeying from a distant convent to my fathers home while my
attendants rested by a spring I wandered through the wood unthinking of
the danger till turning to retrace my steps I found myself lost and
alone I feared to call and but for thee kind stranger might have
never seen my home again Ask not my name but tell me thine that in my
prayers I may remember one who has so aided me

Ernest It were uncourteous to refuse thy bidding lady Ernest
LEstrange is the name now honored by the poor service I may do thee In
the Spanish army I came hither and fear I have seen the last of home
or friends The Moors now seek my life and ere I can rejoin my ranks I
may be a slave But the storm draws nearer Let me lead thee to some
shelter lady

Zara Methinks I see a glimmer yonder Let us seek it for with thee I
fear no longer I can only give thee thanks most noble stranger yet a
day may come when she for whom thou dost now risk thy life may find a
fit return worthy thy courtesy to one so helpless and forlorn

                                              Exit Ernest and Zara

                             SCENE SECOND

            Room in the castle of Bernardo Zara alone

Zara Tis strange how the thought haunts me still Long months have
passed since last I saw that noble face and yet those gentle eyes look
on me Ernesttis a sweet English name and twas a noble English
heart that felt such tender pity for a helpless maid Hark my fathers
step He comes to tell of victories gained of kingdoms won Oh would
he might bring some word of him I have so longed to see and thank once
more

                                      Enter Bernardo with a casket

Ber Joyful tidings Zara Grenada is free Here love are gems for
thee they have shone on many a fair ladys neck but none more fair
than thine And here are things more precious far to me than all their
gold and gemsa goodly list of prisoners taken in the fight and sent
to cool their Spanish blood in our deepest cells Ah many a proud name
is hereFerdinand Navarre Carlos of Arragon Lord LEstrange and
Baron Lisle But child what ails thee

Zara starting up LEstrange Is he a prisoner too Hast thou read
aright Father Father it was he who saved me from a bitter death in
yonder forest I never told his name lest it should anger thee For my
sake spare him and let the gratitude thou hast felt for that kind deed
soften thy heart to the brave stranger

Ber Nay Zara He is thy countrys foe and must be sacrificed to save
her honor Twas a simple deed thou hast spoken of What brave man but
would save a fair girl from storms or danger Tis a foolish thought
love let it pass

Zara Oh Father I who never bent the knee to man before implore thee
thus kneels Be merciful Leave not the English lord to the dark and
fearful doom that waits him I know too well the lifelong captivity
more terrible than death itself that is his fate Oh speak Say he is
forgiven Father

Ber Nay what wild dream is this Listen child I tell thee he must
suffer the captivity he merits as thy countrys foe He hath borne arms
against thy king slain thy kindred brought woe and desolation thro
the land our fathers gave us And thou wouldst plead for him Shame on
thee Thou art no true daughter of thy suffering country if thou canst
waste one tear on those who were well lodged in our most dreary
dungeons Call thy pride to aid thee Zara and be worthy of thy noble
name

Zara Father thou hast often told me womans lot was mid the quiet
scenes of home and that no thoughts of fame or glory should lie within
a heart where only gentleness and love should dwell but I have learned
to honor bravery and noble deeds and I would pledge my troth for the
noble stranger See the English knight and if he win thee not to
gratitude thou art not the tender father who through long years hath
so loved and cherished thy motherless child

Ber Nay Zara nay honor is a sterner master than a fathers love I
cannot free the captive till the king who hath sealed his doom shall
pardon also The prisoners are men of rank and for thy countrys sake
must die Forget thy foolish fancy child and set thy young heart on
some fairer toys than these false English lords Adieu love I must to
the council

                                                       Exit Bernardo

Zara Ah there was a time when Zaras lightest wish was gladly granted
This cruel war hath sadly changed my father he hath forgotten all his
generous pity for suffering and sorrow But my work is yet undone and
the stranger is a captive He shall be free and I will pay the debt
of gratitude I owe him I will brave my fathers anger but whom can I
trust to aid me Ha Selim He is old and faithful and will obey
claps her hands

                                                         Enter Selim

Selim Your bidding lady

Zara Selim thou hast known me from my birth and served me well I
have done thee many a kindness Wilt thou grant me one that shalt repay
all that I have ever shown to thee

Selim Lady thou hast made a slaves life happy by thy care and
through the long years I have served thee hast never bid me do aught
that was not right If my poor services can aid thee now they are most
gladly thine

Zara Listen Selim while I tell thee what I seek Thou knowest an
English soldier saved and led me from the forest yonder and thou
knowest how my father thanked and blessed the unknown friend who had so
aided me Yet now when it is in his power to show the gratitude he
felt he will not and has doomed the man he once longed to honor to a
lonely cell to pine away a brave hearts life in sorrow and captivity I
would show that gentle stranger that a woman never can forget I would
free him Thou hast the keys This is the service I now crave of thee

Selim Lady canst thou ask me to betray the trust my lord thy father
hath been pleased to place in me Ask anything but this and gladly will
I obey thee

Zara Ah must I ever ask and be refused Selim listen Thou hast a
daughter she is fair and young and thou hast often sighed that she
should be a slave If thou wilt aid me now the hour the chains fall
from the English captives limbs that hour shalt see thy daughter free
and never more a slave If thou wilt win this joy for her then grant my
prayer and she is free

Selim Oh lady lady tempt me not much as I love my child I love
mine honor more I cannot aid thee to deceive thy father

Zara Nay Selim I do not ask it of thee The proud name my father
bears shall neer be stained by one false deed of mine I ask thee but
to lead me to the prisoners cell that I may offer freedom and tell
him womans gratitude can never fail nor womans heart forget And if
my father ask thee aught of this thou shalt answer freely Tell him
all and trust his kindness to forgive and if evil come I will bear
it bravelythou shalt not suffer Thou shalt win thy fair childs
freedom and my fadeless thanks

Selim Thou hast conquered lady and for the blessed gift that is my
reward I will brave all but treachery and dishonor Thou shalt find thy
truest slaves in the old man and his daughter kneels and gives the
keys

Zara Thanks good Selim thanks thou shalt find a grateful friend in
her thou hast served so well I will disguise me as a female slave and
thou shalt lead me to the cell Now go I will join thee anon Exit
Selim Oh Ernest Ernest thy brave heart shall pine no longer
Another hour and thou art free Chains cannot bind nor dungeons hold
when womans love and gratitude are thine

Ernest So end my dreams of fame and honor A lifelong captive or a
sultans slave are all that fate has left me now Yet mid disgrace and
sorrow one thought can cheer me yet and one sweet vision brighten een
my dreary lot I have served my country well and won the thanks of
Spains most lovely daughter Sweet lady little does she dream amid her
happiness that memories of her are all now left to cheer a captives
heart But hista footstep on the stair Perchance they come to lead
me forth to new captivity or death Enter Zara disguised as a
slave Ah who comes here to cheer the cell of the poor captive

Zara Captive no longer if life and liberty be dear to thee Say but
the word and ere the sun sets thou shalt be free amid the hills of
Spain

Ernest Who art thou coming like a spirit to my lonely cell bringing
hopes of freedom Tell me what hath moved thee to such pity for an
unknown stranger

Zara Not unknown to her I serve She hath not forgot thee noble
stranger When thou didst lead her from the dim wood she said a day
might come when she so weak and helpless then might find some fit
reward for one who risked his life for her That hour hath come and she
hath sent her poor slave hither and with her thanks and blessing to
speed thee on thy way

Ernest And is she near and did she send thee to repay my simple deed
with one like this Ah tell her name Where doth she dwell and whence
the power to set me free

Zara I may not tell thee more than this Her father is Bernardo of
Castile She heard thy name among the captives doomed and seeks to save
thee for if thou dost not fly a most cruel death awaits thee Listen
to her prayer and cast these chains away

Ernest It cannot be Much as I love my freedom I love my honor more
and I am bound until my conqueror shall give back my plighted word to
seek no freedom till he shall bid me go Nay do not sigh kind friend
I am no longer sad From this day forth captivity is sweet Tell thy
fair mistress all my thanks are hers but I may not take the gift she
offers for with freedom comes dishonor and I cannot break my word to
her stern father Tell her she hath made my fetters light this cell a
happy home by the sweet thought that she is near and still remembers
one who looks upon the hour when first we met as the happiest he hath
known

Zara If there be power in womans gratitude thou shalt yet be free
and with thine honor yet unstained She will not rest till all the debt
she owes thee is repaid Farewell and think not Zara will forget
turns to go her veil falls

Ernest starting Ladyand is it thou Ah leave me not Let me
thank thee for the generous kindness which has made a lone heart happy
by the thought that even in this wild land there is still one to
remember the poor stranger

Zara Pardon what may seem to thee unmaidenly and bold but thou wert in
danger there were none whom I could trust Gratitude hath bid me come
and I am here Again I ask nay I implore thee let me have the joy of
giving freedom to one brave English heart England is thy home wouldst
thou not tread its green shores once again Are there no fond hearts
awaiting thy return Ah can I not tempt thee by all that man most
loves to fly

Ernest Lady my own heart pleads more earnestly than even thy sweet
voice but those kind eyes were better dimmed with tears for my sad
death than be turned coldly from me as one who had stained the high name
he bore And liberty were dearly purchased if I left mine honor here
behind Ask me no more for till thy father sets me free I am his
prisoner here Ah dearest lady thou hast made this lone cell bright
and other chains than these now hold me here

Zara Then it must be Much as I grieve for thy captivity I shall honor
thee the more for thy unfailing truth more prized than freedom home
or friends And though I cannot save thee now thou shalt find a Moorish
maiden true and fearless as thyself Farewell May happy thoughts of
home cheer this dark cell till I have won the power to set thee free

lords

Ber Ay Zaraall ere tomorrows sun shall set they will sleep

paltry lives can ill repay the sorrow they have wrought

Zara Let me see the fatal paper Takes the scroll aside Yes
his name is here Ah how strange that these few lines can doom brave
hearts to such a death Aloud Father tis a fearful thing to hold
such power over human life Ah bid me tear the scroll and win for thee
the thanks of those thy generous pity saves

Ber seizing the paper Not for thy life child Revenge is sweet

parting Weeps Nay nay it shall not be When this wild hate
hath passed my father will repent Alas t will be too late I will
save him from that sorrow when he shall find he hath wronged a noble
heart and slain the friend he should have saved But stay how shall I
best weave my plot That fatal paper once destroyed I will implore and
plead so tenderly my father will repent and ere another scroll can
reach his hands I will have won thy freedom Ernest This night
beneath his pillow it will be and I like a midnight thief must steal
to that couch and take it hence Yet it shall be done for it will

Ber Zara

Zara starts Why so stern my father Hath thy poor Zara angered
thee

Ber I have trusted thee as few would trust a child Thou art fair and
gentle and I had thought true Never Zara till now hast thou deceived
me and if thou wouldst keep thy fathers love and trust I bid thee
answer truly Didst thou in the dead of night steal to my pillow and
bear hence the paper I had told thee would be there Thy slave girl
Zillah missed thee from thy couch and saw thee enter there She
feared to follow but none other came within my chamber and this morn
the scroll is gone Now answer Zara Didst thou take the warrant and
where is it now

Zara Burnt to ashes and scattered to the winds I have never stained
my soul with falsehood and I will not now Oh Father I have loved and
honored thee through the long years thou hast watched above me How
could I love on when thou hadst stained with blood that hand that
blessed me when a child how honor when thou hadst repaid noble deeds
with death Forgive me that I plead for those thou hast doomed I alone
am guiltylet thine anger fall on me but Father I implore thee
leave this evil deed undone Kneels

Ber Thou canst plead well for thy fathers and thy countrys foe What
strange fancy hath possessed thee Zara Thou hast never wept tho many
a Christian knight hath pined and died within these walls and even
now methinks thou speakest more of gratitude than mercy and seem
strangely earnest for the English lord who did thee some small service
long ago Speak Zara wouldst thou save them all Were I to grant
thee all their lives save his wouldst thou be content to let him die

Zara Nay Father but for his tender care thou wouldst have no daughter
now to stand before thee pleading for the life he bravely risked in
saving mine Oh would I had died amid the forest leaves ere I had
brought such woe to him and lived to lose my fathers love Weeps

Ber Listen Zara Little as I know of womans heart I have learned to
read thine own and if I err not thou hast dared to love this stranger
Ha is it so Girl I command thee to forget that love and leave him to
his fate

Zara Never I will not forget the love that like a bright star hath
come to cheer my lonely heart I will not forget the noble friend
who mid his fiercest foes could brave all dangers to restore an
unknown maiden to her home And when I offered liberty for I have
disobeyed and dared to seek his cell he would not break the word he
had plighted Father unto thee He bade me tempt him not for death
were better than dishonor Ah canst thou doom him to a felons death
Then do it and the hour that sees that true heart cease to beat that
hour thou hast lost the child who would have loved and clung to thee
through life

Ber Child thou hast moved me strangely I would grant thy prayer but
thou shalt never wed one of that accursed race I bear no hate to the
young lord save that he is thy countrys foe and if he gains his
freedom he will win thee too By Allah it shall never be Yet listen
Zara If I grant his life wilt thou ask no more

Zara T is all I ask grant me but this and I will give thee all the
gratitude and love this poor heart can bestow

Ber Then tis done Yet hold the price that thou must pay for this
dear boon is large Thou must swear never to see him more must banish
love nay even memory of that fatal hour when first he saw and saved
thee If thou wilt vow to wed none but one of thine own race his life
and liberty are thine to give Speak Zara Wilt thou do all this

Zara Oh Father Father anything but this Pity gratitude and love
have bound me to him and the fetters thou hast cast around him are not
stronger than the deep affection he hath wakened in my heart Ah why
wilt thou not give life and liberty to him and joy to thy child I will
not take the vow

Ber Then his fate is sealed Thy girls heart is too selfish to forego
its own joy for his sake Thou dost not love enough to sacrifice thy
happiness to win his freedom I had thought more nobly of thee Zara

Zara I will be worthy all thou mayst have thought me but thou canst
little know the desolation thou hast brought me Thou shalt see how
deeply thou hast wronged me and my love I will bear all suffer all
if it will win the life and liberty of him I love so deeply and so well

Ber Would to Heaven thou hadst never seen this English stranger Again
and for the last time Zara I ask thee Wilt thou leave the captive to
his fate and seek another heart to love

Zara Never I could mourn his death with bitter tears but oh my love
is worthy a deeper sacrifice He shall never suffer one sad hour if I
may spare him and never know that liberty to him will bring such
lifelong sorrow unto me

Ber Then thou wilt take the vow I bid thee

Zara I will

Ber Then swear by all thou dost hold most dear and by thy mothers
spirit to wed one only of thy fathers race and through joy and
sorrow thro youth and age to keep thy vow unbroken until death

Zara I swear and may the spirit of that mother look in pity on the
child whose love hath made her life so dark a path to tread

Ber May thou find comfort Zara I would have spared thee this but now
it cannot be Yet thy reward shall well repay thee for thy sacrifice
The English knight is free and thou shalt restore him unto life and
liberty May Allah bless thee child

                                                       Exit Bernardo

Zara Tis over The bright dream is past Oh Ernest few will love
thee as I have done few suffer for thee all that I so gladly bear and
none can honor thy true noble heart more tenderly than she whose hard
lot it is to part from thee forever Still amid my blighted hopes one
thought can brighten my deep sorrowthis sacrifice but renders me
more worthy of thee Ernest Now farewell love my poor heart may
grieve for its lost joy and look for comfort but in Heaven

thou art here for a monarchs fairest home

Zara Thou wilt gladly leave it when I tell thee thy captivity is oer
and I am here to set thee free I have won thy liberty and thou mayst
fly with honor all unstained for here my father grants thy pardon and
now bids thee go

Ernest How can I thank thee for thy tenderness and pity how may I best
show the gratitude I owe thee for the priceless boon of freedom thou
hast this day given

tis but life for life Now haste for ere the sunset hour thou must be

his chains And now brave heart thou art free and Zaras task is

liberty comes love and thoughts of thee thy beauty tenderness and
all thou hast done for me Lady thou hast cast away my fetters but I
am captive still he kneels Ah listen Zara while I tell thee of
the love that like a sweet flower hath blossomed in this dreary cell
and made een liberty less precious than one word one smile from thee

Zara I may not listentis too late and tis a sin for me to hear
thee Ah ask me not why but hasten hence and leave me to the fate
thou canst not lighten

Ernest Never I will not leave thee till I have won the right to cheer
and comfort her who has watched so fearlessly oer me Tell me all and
let me share thy sorrow Zara

Zara Ah no It cannot be Thou canst not break my solemn vow Go
leave me Heaven bless thee and farewell

Ernest A solemn vow Hast thou bound thyself to win my freedom Then
never will I leave this cell till thou hast told me all I swear it and
I will keep the oath

Zara Ernest I implore thee fly or it may be too late Thou canst not
help me and I will not tell thee Ah leave me I cannot save thee if
thou tarry now

Ernest Never till thou hast told me by what noble sacrifice thou hast
saved this worthless life of mine Let me free thee from thy sorrow
Zara or help thee bear it Thou hast won my pardon and I will not go
till thou hast told me how

Zara And wilt thou promise to go hence when I have told thee all and
let me have the joy of knowing thou art safe

Ernest I will leave thee Zara if thou canst bid me go Now tell me
all thy sorrow love and let me share it with thee

Zara Ernest I sought to save thee for I had learned to love the noble
stranger who had done so kind a deed for me I sought to win my father
back to gratitude I wept and sued in vainhe would not grant thy
life the boon for which I prayed Alone I watched above thee and when
the warrant for thy death was sent I took it from his pillow and
destroyed it Thou wast safe My father charged me with the deed and
when I told him all he bid me love no more and leave thee to thy fate
He bid me show how strong my womans heart could be and told me if I
yet desired thy freedom I might win it if I took a solemn vow to wed
none but of my fathers race I took the vow and thou art free Ah no
moreand let us part while yet I have the strength to say farewell

Ernest And is it yet too late Canst thou not take back the vow and
yet be mine I cannot leave theerather be a captive here till thou
shalt set me free Come Zara fly with me and leave the father who
would blight thy life to satisfy a fierce revenge Ah come and let me
win thee back to love and happiness

Zara Ernest tempt me not By that sad vow I swore by all my future
hopes and by my dead mothers spirit I would never listen to thy words
of love And stern and cruel tho my father be I cannot leave him now
Deep and bitter though this sorrow be tis nobler far to bear the
burden than to cast it down and seek in idle joys to banish penitence
for thorns would lie amid the flowers Farewell Forget me and in happy
England find some other heart to gladden with thy love Oh may she
prove as fond and faithful as thy Moorish Zara

Ernest I will plead no more nor add to that sad heart another sorrow
I will be worthy such true love and though we meet no more on earth in
all my wanderings sweet tender thoughts of thee shall dwell within my
heart I will bear my sorrow as a brave man should The life thou hast
saved and brightened by thy love shall yet be worthy thee Farewell May
all the blessings a devoted heart can give rest on thee dearest Heaven
bless thee and grant that we shall meet again

fathers race Ernest came from sunny England and I am the daughter of
a Moorish lord Alas tis vain to hope The vow is given and must be
kept

stranger and thus won the hatred of her Moorish kindred who sought to
win her for their princes bride And when she fled away with him to

passed away she drooped and died Thy father perished bravely on the
field of battle and left his child to me I stood beside thy mothers
dying bed and vowed to guard her babe till thou wert safe among thy
Moorish kindred I have watched thee well and thou art worthy all the
happiness thy true heart hath won Bernardo of Castile is but thy
mothers friend thy father was an English lord and thou canst keep thy
vow and yet wed the brave young Englishman who hath won thy love

sent when such deep joy as this is given Ah Father how can I best
thank thee for the blessed comfort thou hast given

Her Thy joy dear child is my reward When thou art safe with him
thou lovest my task on earth is done and I shall pass away with happy
thoughts of the sweet flower that bloomed beside the old mans path
through life and cheered it with her love Bless thee my Zara and may
the spirit of thy mother watch above thee in the happy home thou hast
gained by thy noble sacrifice

own life as they have mine The blessings of a happy heart be on thee

                            THE GREEK SLAVE


                              SCENE FIRST

                  Apartment in the palace of Irene
                   Irene reclining upon a divan

Irene How strange a fate is mine Young fair and highborn I may not
choose on whom I will bestow my love Betrothed to a prince whom I have
never seen compelled to honor and obey one whom my heart perchance can
never love alas alas

And yet they tell me that Constantine is noble brave and good What
more can I desire Ah if he do but love me I shall be content noise
without she rises Hark tis his messenger approaching with letters
from the queen his mother I will question this ambassador and learn
yet more of this young prince my future husband seats herself with
dignity

                         Enter Rienzi Kneels presenting a letter

Rienzi The queen my mistress sends thee greeting lady and this
scroll May it please thee read I await your pleasure

Irene takes the letter and reads My lord with a womans curiosity
I fain would ask thee of thy prince whose fate the gods have linked
with mine Tell me is he tender true and noble Answer truly I do
command thee

Rienzi Lady he is tender as a woman gentle as thy heart could wish
just and brave as a king should ever be The proudest lady in all Greece
were well matched with our noble Constantine

Irene And is he fair to look upon Paint me his likeness if thou
canst

Rienzi I can but ill perform that office Thou must see if thou wouldst
rightly know him The gods have blessed him with a fair and stately
form a noble face dark locks and a kinglike brow that well befits
the crown that rests upon it This is he our brave young prince one to
honor lady one to trust andlove

Irene Tis a noble man thou hast painted One more question and thou
mayst retire Hath he ever spoken of her who is to be his wife Nay why
do I fear to ask thee Does he love her

Rienzi Lady I beg thee ask me not Who could fail to love when once he
had looked upon thee

Irene Thou canst not thus deceive me Answer truly What doth he think
of this betrothal and approaching marriage

Rienzi He hath not seen thee princess knows of thee nothing save that
thou art beautiful and one day to become his wife But he is young and
hath no wish to wed and even his mothers prayers have failed to win
his free consent to this most cherished plan that by uniting thy fair
kingdom unto his he can gain power over other lands and beautify our
own

Irene Perchance his heart is given to another Has no fair Grecian
maiden won the love he cannot offer me

Rienzi Nay lady He loves nought but his mother his subjects and his
native land But soon we trust when thou art by his side a deeper love
will wake within him and thou wilt be dearer than country home or
friends

Irene Tis well thou mayst retire I will send answer by thee to thy
queen and seek some gift that may be worthy her acceptance And now
adieu Rienzi bows and retires He does not love me then and I
must wed a cold and careless lord And yetso tender to all others he
could not be unkind to me alone

Oh that I could win his love unknown and then when truly mine to cast
away the mask and be myself again Stay let me think Ah yes I see a
way Surely the gods have sent the thought I will disguise me as a
slave and as a gift sent to his mother I can see and learn to know
him well I will return with the ambassador Rienzi I spake to him of a
gift He little thinks in the veiled slave he shall bear away the
princess is concealed Yes Constantine as a nameless girl will Irene
win thy heart and when as a wife she stands beside thee thou shalt
love her for herself alone

                                CURTAIN


                             SCENE SECOND

                 A room in the palace of The Queen
                          The Queen alone

Queen Why comes he not They told me that our ambassador to the
Princess Irene had returned and bore a gift for me Would that it were
a picture of herself They say she is wondrous fair and could my
wayward son but gaze upon her his heart might yet be won Enter
Irene disguised as the slave Ione Ah a stranger Who art thou

                                   Ione kneels and presents a letter

Queen reads the letter Ah welcome Thy mistress tells me she hath
chosen from among her train the fairest and most faithful of her slaves
as a gift for me With thanks do I accept thee Lift thy veil child
that I may see how our maidens do compare with thee Ione lifts her
veil The Queen gazes in surprise at her beauty Thou art too
beautiful to be a slave What is thy name

Ione Ione may it please thee lady

Queen Tis a fit name for one so fair and thy country maiden

Ione With the princess my kind mistress have I dwelt for many happy
years and honored by her choice now offer my poor services to thee

Queen What canst thou do Ione Thou art too fair and delicate to bear
the heavy waterurn or gather fruit

Ione I can weave garlands lady touch the harp and sing sweet songs
can bear thee wine and tend thy flowers I can be true and faithful
and no task will be too hard for thy grateful slave Ione

Queen Thou shalt find a happy home with me and never grieve for thy
kind mistress And now listen while I tell thee what thy hardest task
shall be I will confide in thee Ione for thou art no common slave
but a true and gentle woman whom I can trust and love Thou hath heard
thy lady is betrothed to my most noble son and yet I grieve to say he
loves her not Nay in the struggle gainst his heart hath lost all
gayety and strength and even the name Irene will chase the smile away
He loves no other yet will not offer her his hand when the heart that
should go with it feels no love for her who is to be his wife I honor
this most noble feeling yet could he know the beauty and the worth of
thy fair lady he yet might love Thou shalt tell him this all the kind
deeds she hath done the gentle words she hath spoken all her
loveliness and truth thou shalt repeat sing thou the songs she loved
weave round his cups the flowers she wears and strive most steadfastly
to gain a place within his heart for love and Lady Irene Canst thou
wilt thou do this Ione

Ione Dear lady all that my poor skill can do shall yet be tried I
will not rest till he shall love my mistress as she longs to be
beloved

Queen If thou canst win my son to health and happiness again thou
shalt be forever my most loved most trusted friend The gods bless
thee child and give thy work success Now rest thee here I will come
ere long to lead thee to the prince

                                                      Exit The Queen

Ione All goes well and what an easy task is mine To minister to him
whom I already love to sing to him weave garlands for his brow and
tell him of the thoughts stirring within my heart Yes I most truly
long to see him whom all love and honor The gods be with me and my
task will soon be done

                                CURTAIN


                              SCENE THIRD

                     Another room in the palace
                     Constantine sad and alone

Con Another day is wellnigh passed and nearer draws the fate I dread
Why must I give up all the bright dreams of my youth and wed a woman
whom I cannot love

They tell me she is young and fair but I seek more than that in her who
is to pass her life beside me Youth and beauty fade but a noble
womans love can never die Oh Irene if thou couldst know how hard a
thing it is to take thee princess though thou art Enter Ione Ah
lady thou hast mistaken thy way Let me lead thee to the queens
apartments

Ione Nay my lord I have come from her She bid me say it was her will
that I her slave should strive with my poor skill to while away the
time till she could join thee

Con Thou a slave By the gods methought it was some highborn
ladynay even the Princess Irene herself seeking the queen my
mother

Ione She was my mistress and bestowed me as a gift upon the queen
This scroll is from her hand May it please thee read it kneels and
presents letter

Con Rise fair maiden I would rather listen to thy voice May I ask
thee to touch yon harp I am weary and a gentle strain will sooth my
troubled spirit Stay let me place it for thee

    Prince moves the harp and gazes upon Ione as she sings and
        plays

    The wild birds sing in the orange groves
      And brightly bloom the flowers
    The fair earth smiles neath a summer sky
      Through the joyous fleeting hours
    But oh in the slave girls lonely heart
      Sad thoughts and memories dwell
    And tears fall fast as she mournfully sings
      Home dear home farewell

    Though the chains they bind be all of flowers
      Where no hidden thorn may be
    Still the free heart sighs neath its fragrant bonds
      And pines for its liberty
    And sweet sad thoughts of the joy now gone
      In the slave girls heart shall dwell
    As she mournfully sings to her sighing harp
      Native land native land farewell

Con Tis a plaintive song Is it thine own lot thou art mourning If
so thou art a slave no longer

Ione Nay my lord It was one my Lady Irene loved and thus I thought
would please thee

Con Then never sing it morespeak not her name Nay forgive me if I
pain thee She was thy mistress and thou didst love her Was she kind
to thee By what name shall I call thee

Ione Ione your Highness Ah yes she was too kind She never spake a
cruel word nor chid me for my many faults Never can I love another as
I loved my gentle mistress

Con And is she very fair Has she no pride no passion or disdain to
mar her loveliness She is a princess is she a true and tender woman
too

Ione Though a princess neath her royal robes there beats a warm true
heart faithful and fond longing to be beloved and seeking to be worthy
such great joy when it shall come Thou askst me of her beauty
Painters place her face among their fairest works and sculptors carve
her form in marble Yes she is beautiful but tis not that thou
wouldst most care for Couldst thou only know herpardon but I think
thou couldst not bear so cold a heart within thy breast as now

Con Ah do not cease say on There is that in the music of thy voice
that soothes and comforts me Come sit beside me fair Ione and I will
tell thee why I do not love thy princess

Ione You do forget my lord I am a slave I will kneel here

    Prince reclines upon a couch Ione kneels beside him

Con Listen From a boy I have been alone no loving sister had I no
gentle friendonly cold councillors or humble slaves My mother was a
queen and mid the cares of State tho fondly loving me her only son
could find no time to win me from my lonely life

Thus tho dwelling neath a palace roof with every wish supplied I
longed most fondly for a friend And now ere long a crown will rest
upon my head a nation bend before me as their king And now more
earnestly than ever do I seek one who can share with me the joys and
cares of my high lota woman true and noble to bless me with her
love

Ione And could not the Princess Irene be to thee all thou hast dreamed

Con I fear I cannot love her They told me she was beautiful and
highborn and when I sought to learn yet more twas but to find she
was a cold proud woman fit to be a queen but not a loving wife Thus
I learned to dread the hour when I must wed Yet tis my mothers will
my countrys welfare calls for the sacrifice and I must yield myself

Ione They who told thee she was proud and cold do all speak falsely
Proud she is to those who bow before her but to gain some honor for
themselves and cold to such as love her for her royalty alone But if a
fond and faithful heart and a soul that finds its happiness in noble
deeds can make a queen Irene is worthy of the crown she will wear And
now if it please thee I will seek the garden for thy mother bid me
gather flowers for the feast Adieu my lord She bows her veil
falls Constantine hands it to her Nay kings should not bend to
serve a slave my lord

Con I do forget myself most strangely There take thy veil and leave
me turns aside Nay forgive me if I seem unkind but I cannot
treat thee as a slave Come I will go with thee to the garden thou art
too fair to wander unprotected and alone Come Ione leads her out

                                CURTAIN


                             SCENE FOURTH

                      The gardens of the palace
                       Ione weaving a garland

Ione The rose is Loves own flower and I will place it in the wreath I
weave for thee O Constantine Would I could bring it to thy heart as
easily And yet methinks if all goes on as now the slave Ione will
ere long win a princes love He smiles when I approach and sighs when
I would leave him listens to my songs and saves the withered flowers I
gave him days ago How gentle and how kind Ah noble Constantine thou
little thinkest the slave thou art smiling on is the proud cold
Princess Irene who will one day show thee what a fond true wife she
will be to thee sings

                                       Enter Helon kneels to Ione

Ione Helon my fathers friend thou here Ah hush Betray me not I
am no princess now Rise I do beseech thee Kneel not to me

Helon Dear lady why this secrecy What dost thou here disguised in
the palace where thou art soon to reign a queen

Ione Hark is all still Yes none are nigh Speak low Ill tell thee
all Thou knowest the young prince loves me notnay do not sigh I
mean the princess not the slave Ione as I now call myself Well I
learned this and vowed to win the heart he could not give and so in
this slaves dress I journeyed hither with Rienzi the ambassador as a
gift unto the queen

Thus as a poor and nameless slave I seek to win the noble Constantine
to life and love Dost understand my plot and wilt thou aid me Father
Helon

Helon Tis a strange thought None but a woman would have planned it
Yes my child I will aid thee and thou yet shall gain the happiness
thy true heart well deserves We will talk of this yet more anon I
came hither to see the prince They told me he was pale and ill in
sorrow for his hated lot Say is this so

Ione Ah yes most true and I am cause of all this sorrow Father
tell me cannot I by some great deed give back his health and never
have the grief of knowing that he suffered because I was his bride How
can I avert this fate I will do all bear all if he may be saved

Helon Grieve not my child he will live and learn to love thee
fondly The cares of a kingdom are too much for one so young but he
would have happiness throughout his native land and toiling for the
good of others he hath hidden his sorrow in his own heart and pined for
tenderness and love Thou hast asked if thou couldst save him There is
one hope if thou canst find a brave friend that fears no danger when a
good work leads him on Listen my daughter In a deep and lonely glen
far beyond the palace gates there grows an herb whose magic power tis
said brings new life and strength to those who wreathe it round their
head in slumber Yet none dare seek the spot for spirits are said to
haunt the glen and not a slave in all the palace but grows pale at
mention of the place I am old and feeble or I had been there long ere
this And now my child who canst thou send

Ione I will send one who fears not spirit or demon one who will gladly
risk een life itself for the brave young prince

Helon Blessed be the hand that gathers thrice blessed be he who dares
the dangers of the way Bring hither him thou speakest of I would see
him

Ione She stands before thee Nay start not Father I will seek the
dreaded glen and gather there the magic flowers that may bring health to
Constantine and happiness to me I will away bless and let me go

Helon Thou a woman delicate and fair Nay nay it must not be my
child Better he should die than thou shouldst come to harm I cannot
let thee go

Ione Thou canst not keep me now Thou hast forgot I am a slave and
none may guess beneath this veil a princess is concealed I will take my
waterurn and with the other slaves pass to the spring beyond the city
gates then glide unseen into the haunted glen Now tell me how looks
the herb that I may know it

Helon Tis a small green plant that blossoms only by the broad dark
stream dashing among the rocks that fill the glen But let me once
again implore thee not to go Ah fatal hour when first I told thee
Tis sending thee to thy death Stay stay my child or let me go with
thee

Ione It cannot be do thou remain and if I come not back ere set of
sun do thou come forth to seek me Tell Constantine I loved him and so
farewell I return successful or I return no more

                                                     Ione rushes out

Helon Thou brave and noble one to dare so much for one who loves thee
not Ill go and pray the gods to watch above thee and bring thee
safely back

                                                          Exit Helon

                                CURTAIN


                              SCENE FIFTH

                     A terrace beside the palace
                          Enter Constantine

Con Why comes she not I watched her slender form when with the other
slaves she went forth to the fountain yonder I knew her by the rosy
veil and snowwhite arm that bore the waterurn The morning sun shone
brightly on the golden hair and seemed more beautiful for resting
there and now tis nearly set and yet she comes not Why should I
grieve because my mothers slave forgets me Shame on thee Constantine
How weak and childish have I grown This fever gives no rest when Ione
is not here to sing sweet songs and cheer the weary hours Ah she
comes Enter Ione with basket of flowers Where hast thou been
Ione The long day passed so slowly and I missed thee sadly from my
side But thou art pale thy locks are damp What has chanced to thee
Speak I beseech thee

Ione Tis nothing calm thyself my lord I am well and bring thee
from the haunted glen the magic flowers whose power I trust will win
thee health and happiness May it please thee to accept them kneels
and gives the flowers

Con Thou thou Ione Hast thou been to that fearful spot where mortal
foot hath feared to tread The gods be blessed thou art safe again How
can I thank thee Ah why didst thou risk so much for my poor life It
were not worth the saving if thine were lost

Ione My lord a loving nation looks to thee for safety and protection
I am but a feeble woman and none would grieve if I were gone none weep
for the friendless slave Ione

Con Oh say not thus Tears would be shed for thee and one heart
would grieve for her who risked so much for him Speak not of death or
separation for I cannot let thee go

Ione I will not leave thee yet till I have won thy lost health back
The old priest Helon bid me seek the herbs and bind them in a garland
for thy brow If thou wilt place it there and rest awhile I am repaid

Con If thy hand gave it were it deadly poison I would place it there
Now sing Ione thy low sweet voice will bring me pleasant dreams and
the healing sleep will be the deeper with thy music sounding in mine
ears

    The prince reclines upon the terrace Ione weaves a garland
        and sings

    Flowers sweet flowers I charge thee well
    Oer the brow where ye bloom cast a healing spell
    From the shadowy glen where spirits dwell
    I have borne thee here thy power to tell
    Flowers pale flowers oer the brow where ye lie
    Cast thy sweetest breath ere ye fade and die

    Ione places the garland on the head of the prince who falls
        asleep She sits beside him softly singing

                                CURTAIN


                              SCENE SIXTH

                       The Queens apartment
                          The Queen alone

Queen Tis strange what power this slave hath gained oer Constantine
She hath won him back to health again and never have I seen so gay a
smile upon his lips as when she stood beside him in the moonlight
singing to her harp And yet tho well and strong again he takes no
interest in his native land He comes no more to council hall or feast
but wanders mong his flowers with Ione How can I rouse him to the
danger that is near The Turkish sultan and his troops are on their way
to conquer Greece and he my Constantine who should be arming for the
fight sits weaving garlands with the lovely slave girl Ah a thought
hath seized me Why cannot she who hath such power oer him rouse up
with noble words the brave heart slumbering in his breast I hear her
light step in the hall Ione Ionecome hither I would speak with
thee

                                                          Enter Ione

Ione Your pleasure dearest lady

Queen Ione thou knowest how I love thee for the brave deeds thou hast
done Thou hast given health unto my son hath won him back to
happiness Thou hast conquered his aversion to the princess and he will
gladly wed her when the hour shall come Is it not so

Ione Dear lady that I cannot tell thee He never breathes her name
and if I speak of her as thou hast bid me he but sighs and grows more
sad and yet I trust nay I well know that when he sees her he will
gladly give his hand to one who loves him as the princess will Then do
not grieve but tell thy slave how she may serve thee

Queen Oh Ione if thou couldst wake him from the quiet dream that
seems to lie upon his heart His country is in danger and he should be
here to counsel and command Go tell him this in thine own gentle
words rouse him to his duty and thou shalt see how brave a heart is
there Thou hast a wondrous power to sadden or to cheer Oh use it
well and win me back my noble Constantine Canst thou do this Ione

Ione I will and strive most earnestly to do thy bidding But of what
danger didst thou speak No harm to him I trust

Queen The Turkish troops are now on their way to carry woe and
desolation into Greece and he the prince hath taken no part in the
councils His nobles mourn at his strange indifference and yet he heeds
them not

I know not why but some new happiness hath come to him and all else is
forgot But time is passing I will leave thee to thy work and if thou
art successful thou wilt have won a queens most fervent gratitude
Adieu my child

                                                      Exit The Queen

Ione Yes Constantine thy brave heart shall awake and when thy
country is once safe again Ill come to claim the love that now I feel
is mine

                                                           Exit Ione

                                CURTAIN


                            SCENE SEVENTH

                       Apartment in the palace
                 Enter Ione with sword and banner

Ione Now may the gods bless and watch above thee Constantine give
strength to thine arm courage to thy heart and victory to the cause
for which thou wilt venture all Ah could I but go with thee thy
shield would then be useless for with mine own breast would I shelter
thee and welcome there the arrows meant for thee

He comes now let me rouse him from this dream and try my power oer
his heart

                                                   Enter Constantine

Con What high thoughts stirring in thy heart hath brought the clear
light to thine eye Ione the bright glow to thy cheek What mean these
arms Wouldst thou go forth to meet the Turks Thy beauty would subdue
them sooner than the sword thou art gazing on so earnestly

Ione Thou hast bade me speak my lord and I obey but pardon thy slave
if in her wish to serve she seem too bold Thy mother and thy subjects
wonder at thy seeming indifference when enemies are nigh Thine army
waits for thee to lead them forth thy councillors sit silent for their
prince is gone While grief and terror reign around he is wandering
mong his flowers or listening to the music of his harp Ah why is
this What hath befallen thee Thou art no longer pale and feeble yet
there seems a spell set on thee Ah cast it off and show them that
thou hast no fear

Con I am no coward Ione but there is a spell upon me Tis a holy
one and the chain that holds me here I cannot breakfor it is love
I have lost the joy I once took in my subjects and my native land and
am content to sit beside thee and listen to the music of thy voice

Ione Then let that voice arouse thee Oh fling away the chain that
keeps thee from thy duty and be again the noble prince who thought but
of his people Oh let me plead for those who sorrow for thy care and
here let me implore thee to awaken from thy dream and be thyself again
she kneels

Con Oh not to me Rise I beseech thee rise Thou hast led me to my
duty I will obey thee

Ione I would have thee gird on thy sword and with shield upon thine
arm and banner in thy hand go forth and conquer like a king Show
those who doubt thee that their fears are falsethat thou art worthy
of their love Lead forth thy troops and save thy country from the woe
that now draws nigh Victory surely will be theirs when thou shalt lead
them on

Con Give me my sword unfurl my banner and say farewell I will return
victorious or no more Thy voice hath roused me from my idle but most
lovely dream and thy brave words shall cheer me on till I have won the
honor of my people back Pity and forgive my fault and ah remember in

                         On the battlements
                     Ione watching the battle

Ione The battle rages fiercely at the city gates and the messengers
are fearful of defeat I cannot rest while Constantine is in such peril
Let me watch here and pray for him Ah I can see his white plume waving
in the thickest of the fight where the blows fall heaviest and the
danger is most great The gods guard him in this fearful hour See how
small the brave band grows they falter and retreat One blow now
bravely struck may turn the tide of battle It shall be done I will arm
the slaves now in the palace and lead them on to victory or death We
may winand if not I shall die in saving thee Constantine

                                                    Ione rushes out

                         The castle terrace
                          Enter Constantine

Con The victory is ours and Greece again is free thanks to the gods
and to the brave unknown who led on my slaves and saved us when all
hope seemed gone Who could have been the fearless stranger Like an
avenging spirit came the mysterious leader carrying terror and
destruction to the Turkish ranks My brave troops rallied and we won the
day Yet when I sought him he was gone and none could tell me where
He hath won my deepest gratitude and the honor of all Greece for this
brave deed

But where is Ione Why comes she not to bid me welcome home Ah could
she know that thoughts of her gave courage to my heart and strength to
my weak arm and led me on that I might be more worthy her Ah yonder
comes the stranger he may not think to see me here I will step aside

           Constantine retires Enter Ione in armor bearing sword

Ione The gods be thanked the brave young prince hath conquered From
the flying Turk I won his banner back and now my task is done I must
fling by this strange disguise and be myself again I must bind up my
wound and seek to rest for I am faint and weary Ah what means this
sudden dimness of mine eyes this faintnesscan it be death T is
welcomeConstantine it is for thee

                                Ione faints Constantine rushes in

Con Ione Ione look up and listen to the blessings of my grateful
heart for all thou hast dared and done for me So pale so still Ah
must she die now I have learned to love so fervently and well Ione
awake

                                                         Ione rouses

Ione Pardon this weakness I will retire my lord

Con Ah do not leave me till I have poured out my gratitude My country
owes its liberty to thee then let me here before thee offer up my
countrys thanks and tell thee what my heart hath striven to hide Dear
Ione listen I do beseech thee Kneels

Ione My lord remember Lady Irene

Con starting up Why comes she thus between my happiness and me
Why did she send thee hither Thou hast made the chain that binds her to
me heavier to be borne the sorrow of my heart more bitter still Nay
do not weep I will be calm Thou art pale and faint Ionelean thus
on me

Ione Nay leave me I cannot listen to thee Go I pray thee go

Con Not till thou hast pardoned me I have made thee weep and every
tear that falls reproaches me for my rash words Forget them and
forgive me

Ione Ask not forgiveness of thy slave my lord Tis I who have
offended And think not thus of Lady Irene who in her distant home hath
cherished tender thoughts of one whom all so honored Think of her grief
when she shall find thee cold and careless and shall learn that he who
should most love and cherish deems her but a burden and hates the wife
whom he hath vowed to wed Ah think of this and smile no more upon the
slave who may not listen to her lord

Con Thou art right Ione I will obey thee and seek to hide my sorrow
within my lonely breast Teach me to love thy mistress as I ought and I
will sacrifice each selfish wish and be more worthy thy forgiveness
and a little place within thy heart Trust me I will speak no more of
my unhappy love and will seek thee only when thine own voice bids me
come

The sunlight of thy presence is my truest joy and banishment from thee
the punishment my wilful heart deserves Rest here Ione and weep for
me no more I am happy if thou wilt but smile again Farewell and may
the gods forever bless thee Kisses her robe and rushes out

                      A gallery in the palace
                     Enter Ione with flowers

Ione How desolate and dreary all hath grown The garden once so bright
hath lost its beauty now for Constantine no longer walks beside me The
palace rooms seem sad and lonely for his voice no longer echoes there
and the music of his harp is never heard His pale face haunts me
through all my waking hours and his mournful eyes look on me in my
dreams But soon his sorrow all shall cease for nearer draws the day
when Princess Irene comes to claim the heart so hardly won and will by
constancy and love so faithfully reward Hark I hear a step It is
Rienzi How shall I escapemy veil is in the garden He knows me and
will discover all Stay this curtain shall conceal me hides within
the drapery

                                       Enter Rienzi stealthily

Rienzi How not here I told the messenger to meet me in the gallery
that leads from the garden Curses on him he hath delayed and were I
discovered in this part of the palace all might be betrayed Ill wait
and if he comes not Ill bear the message to the friends myself and
tell the bold conspirators we meet tonight near the haunted glen to
lay yet farther plans We must rid the kingdom of the prince who will
be made ere long our king for his bridal with the Princess Irene draws
more near But ere the royal crown shall rest upon his brow that head
shall be laid low The queen will soon follow her young son and then
well seize the kingdom and rule it as we will Hark methought I heard
a sound I may be watched Ill stay no longer but seek the place
myself steals out and disappears in the garden

                                    Ione comes from her hidingplace

Ione Surely the gods have sent me to watch above thee Constantine and
save thee from the danger that surrounds thee I will haste to tell him
all I have discovered Yet no Rienzi may escape and I can charge none
other with the crime They meet near the haunted glen and not a slave
would follow even his brave prince to that dark spot How can I aid him
to discover those who seek to do him harm Stay I will go alone Once
have I dared the dangers of the way to save thy life Constantine again
Ill tread the fearful path and watch the traitors at their evil work
It shall be done I will dare all and fail not falter not till thou
who art dearer to me than life itself art safe again

                                                   Exit

                            SCENE ELEVENTH

            A wood near the haunted glen Ione shrouded
             in white glides in and conceals herself among
                       the trees Enter Rienzi

Rienzi looking fearfully about Tis a wild and lonely spot and
tis said strange spirits have been seen to wander here Why come they
not Tis past the hour and I who stand undaunted when the fiercest
battle rages round me now tremble with strange fear in this dim spot
Shame on thee Rienzi there is nought to fear opens a scroll and
reads Here are their names all pledged to see the deed accomplished
Tis a goodly list and Constantine must fall when foes like these are
round him Ione appears within the glen

Ha methought I heard a sound Nay twas my foolish fancy Spirits I
defy thee

Ione Beware Beware

Rienzi Ye gods whats that It was a voice Rushes wildly towards
the glen sees Ione drops scroll and dagger Tis a spirit The
gods preserve me I will not stay Exit in terror

                                                          Enter Ione

Ione Saved saved Here are the traitors names and here Rienzis
dagger to prove my story true Now hence with all my speed no time is
to be lost These to thee Constantine and joy unfailing to my own fond
heart

                                                           Exit Ione

                       Apartment in the palace
                          Enter Constantine

Con This little garland of pale withered flowers is all now left me of
Ione faded like my own bright hopes broken like my own sad heart Yet
still I cherish it for her dear hand wove the wreath and her soft eyes
smiled above the flowers as she twined them for my brow Those happy
days are passed she comes no more but leaves me sorrowing and alone
And yet tis better so The princess comes to claim my hand and then
twill be a sin to watch Ione to follow her unseen and listen to her
voice when least she thinks me near The gods give me strength to bear
my trial worthily and suffer silently the greatest sorrow life can
givethat of losing her leans sadly upon the harp

                                                          Enter Ione

Ione My lordHe does not hear me how bitter and how deep must be his
grief when the voice that most he loves falls thus unheeded on his ear
My lord

Con starting And thou art really here Ah Ione I have longed for
thee most earnestly Ah forgive me In my joy I have disobeyed and
told the happiness thy presence brings What wouldst thou with me

Ione My lord I have strange tidings for thine ear

Con Oh tell me not the Princess Irene hath arrived

Ione Nay tis not that I have learned the secret of a fearful plot
against thy life Rienzi and a band of other traitors seek to win thy
throne and take the life of their kind prince

Con It cannot be Ione They could not raise their hands gainst one
who hath striven for their good They cannot wish the life I would so
gladly have lain down to save them Who told thee this Ione I
cannotno I will not think they could prove so ungrateful unto their
prince

Ione I cannot doubt the truth of this my lord for one whose word I
trust learned it and followed to the haunted glen there saw Rienzi
whose guilty conscience drove him from the place leaving behind this
scroll whereon are all the traitors names And this daggertis his
own as thou mayst see shows dagger and scroll

Con I can no longer doubt but I had rather have felt the dagger in my
heart than such a wound as this The names are few I fear them not and
will ere long show them a king may pardon all save treachery like this
But tell the name of thy brave friend who hath discovered this deep
treason and let me offer some reward to one who hath watched above me
with such faithful care

Ione Nay my lord no gift no thanks are needed Tis a true and
loving subject who is well rewarded if his king be safe

Con Thou canst not thus deceive me It was thine own true heart that
dared so much to save my life Oh Ione why wilt thou make me love thee
more by deeds like thesewhy make the sorrow heavier to bear the
parting sadder still

Ione Thou dost forget my lord I have but done my duty May it please
thee listen to a message I bear thee from the queen

Con Say on I will gladly listen to thy voice while yet I may

Ione She bid me tell thee that tomorrow ere the sun shall set the
Princess Irene will be here Constantine starts and turns aside
Forgive me that I pain thee but I must obey Yet farther thy bride
hath sent her statue as a gift to thee and thou wilt find it in the
queens pavilion She bid me say she prayed thee to go look upon it and
remember there thy solemn vow

Con Oh Ione could she send none but thee to tell me this To hear it
from thy lips but makes the tidings heavier to bear Canst thou bid me
go and vow to love one whom I have learned to hate Canst thou bid me
leave thee for a fate like this

Ione My lord thou art soon to be a king then for thy countrys sake
remember thy hand is plighted to the princess and let no kindly
thoughts of a humble slave keep thy heart from its solemn duty

Con I am no kingtis I who am the slave and thou Ione are more to
me than country home or friends Nay do not turn awaythink only of
the love I bear thee and listen to my prayer

Ione I must not listen Hast thou so soon forgot the vow thou made that
no word of love should pass thy lips Remember tis a slave who stands
before thee

Con Once more thou shalt listen to me Ione and then I will be still
forever Thou shalt be my judge thy lips shall speak my fate I
cannot love the princess Wouldst thou bid me vow to cherish her while
my heart is wholly thine Wouldst thou ask me to pass through life
beside her with a false vow on my lips and with words of love I do not
feel conceal from her the grief of my divided heart Must I give up all
the bright dreams of a happier lot and feel that life is but a bitter
struggle a ceaseless longing but for thee Rather bid me to forget the
princess and bind with Loves sweet chains the slave unto my sidemy
bride forever

Ione The slave Ione can never be thy bride and thou art bound by
solemn vows to wed the Princess Irene My duty and thine honor are more
precious than a poor slaves love Banish all thoughts of her and prove
thyself a faithful lord unto the wife who comes now trustingly to thee
Ask thine own heart if life could be a bitter pilgrimage when a
sacrifice like this had been so nobly made A tender wife beside thee
a mothers blessing on thy headoh were not this a happier fate than
to enjoy a short bright dream of love but to awake and find thy
hearts peace gone thy happiness forever fled to see the eyes that
once looked reverently upon thee now turned aside and lips that spoke
but tender words now whisper scornfully of broken vows thou wert not
brave enough to keep Forgive me but I cannot see the prince so false
to his own noble heart Cast off this spell forget me and Irene shall
win thee back to happiness

Con Never All her loveliness can never banish the pure undying love I
bear to thee Oh Ione canst thou doubt its truth when I obey thee now
and prove how great thy power oer my heart hath grown Oh let the
sacrifice win from thee one gentle thought one kind remembrance of
him whose life thou hast made so beautiful for a short hour And in my
loneliness sweet memories of thee shall cheer and gladden and I will
bear all for thy dear sake And now farewell Forgive if I have grieved
thee and at parting grant me one token to the silent love that
henceforth must lie unseen within my heart Farewell Ione He kisses
her

Ione falling at his feet Ah forgive mehere let me seek thy
pardon for the grief I have brought thee May all the happiness that
earth can bring be ever thine But if all others should forsake thee
in thine hour of sorrow remember there is one true heart that cannot
change Oh may the gods bless thee Tis my last wish last prayer
weeps Farewell

Con Stay I would claim from thee one little word which hath the power
to brighten een my sorrow I have never asked thee for I thought my
heart had read it in thine eyes that looked so kindly on me in the lips
that spoke such gentle words of hope But ah tell me now at parting
dost thou love me dear Ione

Ione I do most fondly truly love thee

Con Ione thy voice hath been a holy spell to win me to my duty Thy
love shall keep me pure and faithful till we meet above Farewell

Ione Farewelland oh remember how I have loved thee and may the
memory of all I have borne for thee win thy pardon for any wrong I may
have done thee The princess will repay the grief the slave hath caused
thy noble heart Remember Ione and be true

                                                                Exit

Con Gone gone now lost to me forever Remember thee Ah how can I
ever banish thy dear image from this heart that now hath grown so
desolate I will be true None shall ever know how hard a struggle hath
been mine that I might still be worthy thee Yes Irene I will strive
to love thee and may the gods give me strength but Ione Ione how can
I give thee up Picks up a flower Ione has dropped and puts it in
his bosom and goes sadly out

                The Queens pavilion A dark curtain
              hangs before an alcove Enter Constantine

Con The hour hath come when I shall gaze upon the form of her who hath
cast so dark a shadow oer my life Beautiful and young and blessed
with all that makes her worthy to be loved and yet I fear I have not
taught my wilful heart the tenderness I ought

I fear to draw aside the veil that hides her from me for I cannot
banish the sweet image that forever floats before mine eyes Iones soft
gaze is on me and the lips are whispering I love thee But I have
promised to be trueno thoughts of her must lead me now astray My
fate is here approaches the curtain Let me gaze upon it and think
gently of the wife so soon to be mine own Why do I fear Courage my
heart He draws aside the curtain and Ione veiled appears as a
statue upon its pedestal Another veil to raise How hard the simple
deed hath grown One last sweet thought of thee Ione and then I will
no longer falter He turns away and bows his head

Ione Constantine He starts and gazes in wonder as the statue
casting aside the veil comes down and kneels Here at thy feet kneels
thy hated bridethe proud cold princess asking thee to pardon all
the sorrow she hath given thee Ah smile upon me and forget Ione who
as a slave hath won thy love but as the princess will repay
itforgive and love me still

Con Thou thou Ireneshe whom I so feared to look upon Ah nothou
art Ione the gentle slave Say am I dreaming Why art thou here to make
another parting the harder to be borne Fling by thy crown and be Ione
again

Irene rising Listen Constantine and I will tell thee all I am
Irene In my distant home I learned thou didst not love me and I vowed
to win thy heart before I claimed it Thus unknown the proud princess
served thee as a slave and learned to love thee with a womans fondest
faith I watched above thee that no harm should fall I cheered and
gladdened life for thee and won the heart I longed for I knew the
sorrow thou wouldst feel but tried thy faith by asking thee to
sacrifice thy love and keep thine honor stainless Here let me offer up
a womans fondest trust and most undying love Wilt thou believe and
pardon mine offence Kneels again before him

Con Not at my feet Irenetis I who should bend low before thee
asking thy forgiveness For all thou hast dared for me for every
fearless deed for every loving thought all I can lay before thee is a
fond and faithful heart whose reverence and love can never die but
through the pilgrimage of life shall be as true and tender as when I
gave it to the slave Ione embraces Irene

                    Room in the palace of Cleon
                        Iantha and Adrastus

Iantha How wearily the days wear on and the heavy hours so fraught
with doubt press like death upon my aching heart To the young the
fair the happy life is a blissful dream filled with bright joys for
hope like a star beams on their pathway But to the griefworn heart
worn with weary watching vexed with sad cares whose hours are filled
with fear and ever thronging sorrows whose star burns with a dim
uncertain lightoh weary weary is the pilgrimage joyless the
present dark the future and the sooner all is oer the better

Adrastus Daughter thou hast forgot The radiant star may pale and
fade but He who giveth it its light still liveth Turn unto Him thy
worn and bleeding heart and comfortless thou shalt not be

Iantha Father I cannot When I would pray for resignation words fail
me and my soul is filled with murmuring while round me throng visions
of battlefields and death Ever comes before me the form of Cleonno
longer bright and beautiful as when burning with hope and confidence in
his high calling he went forth to conquer or to die but fallen
bleeding perhaps dead or a captive in the dungeon of the pagan doomed
to waste in hopeless misery the long years of his manhood And my
boywhat will be his fate Father can I think on this and pray

Adrastus Tis hard Iantha but to His aid alone canst thou look up to
save thy husband from the horrors of a bloody war Call on Him and He
the merciful will in thy great need be near thee

                                                         Enter Medon

Medon A stranger craveth audience

Iantha rushing forward A stranger Cometh he from my lord

Medon I know not lady but as a messenger is he clad and with great
haste demandeth speech of thee saying he bore tidings of great import

Iantha Admit him instantly Exit Medon Father do thou follow and
speed him hither

Adrastus I hasten to obey thee Bear a brave heart my daughter I feel
that hope is near

                                                       Exit Adrastus

Iantha joyfully Hopethrice blessed wordwilt thou indeed visit
this doubting heart once more and sweeten the cup thou hast so long
forsaken Enter Hafiz Welcome comest thou from my lord Thy
tidings speedily

Hafiz To the wife of Cleon late commander of the rebel Greeks am I
sent to bear tidings of their defeat by Mohammed now master of all
Greece

Adrastus And my lordthe noble Cleon

Hafiz Betrayed defeated and now lying under sentence of immediate
death in the dungeon of the Sultan

Iantha Lost lost lost Falls fainting on a couch

                                                      Enter Adrastus

Adrastus Daughter look upthere is yet hope There is no time for
rest Up rouse thy brave till now unconquered heart and cast off this
spell And thou slave henceaway

                                                          Exit Hafiz

Iantha rousing Defeated imprisoned condemnedwords unto one
heart fraught with such dire despair Tell me Father oh tell me
truly do I dream

                                   Enter Ion who stands listening

Adrastus Tis no dream The rough soldier did but tell thee in rude
speech what I was hastening in more guarded words to bear thee Tis
true thy lord is in Mohammeds power a victim to the perfidy of
pagans and doomed unto a speedy death Nay Iantha shrink not but as
a soldiers wife glory in the death of thy brave knight dying for his
country and in his martyrdom take to thy soul sweet comfort

Iantha Comfort Oh man thou little knowest womans heart What to her
is glory when him she loveth is torn from her forever What to the
orphan is the crown of martyrdom the heros fame the praise of
nations the homage of the great Will they give back the noble dead
heal the broken heart tear bitter memories from the wounded soul to
whom earth is desolate Nay Father nay Oh Cleon would I could die
with thee

Adrastus This mighty sorrow oerpowers her reason and will destroy all
hope Iantha daughter rouse thyself let the love thou dost bear thy
lord now aid in his deliverance From the wealth of thy hearts true
affection devise thou some way to save him

Iantha Aid me Father I have no power of thought I will trust all to
thee

                                                      Ion approaches

Adrastus I know not what to counsel thee my life hath ill fitted me to
deal with soldiers and with kings But if some messenger

Iantha Nay it will not serve None will dare brave the anger of the
pagan and death were the doom of such as approach him other than as a
slave And yetperchance he might relent Oh were there some true
heart fearless and loving to aid me now in mine hour of distress
Where can I look for help

Ion coming forward Here MotherI will seek the camp of
Mohammed

Iantha Thoumy Ion my only one No no it may not bethy tender
youth thy gentle untried spirit Tis madness een to think on

Ion Mother am I not a soldiers son cradled mid warriors Runs not
the blood of heroes in these veins Are not my fathers deeds his
bright untarnished name my proud inheritance What though this tender
form is yet untried what though these arms have never borne the
knightly armor No victors laurels rest on this youthful brow and I
bear no honored name among the great and glorious of our land yet
Mother have I not a father for whose dear sake I may yet purchase that
knighthood for which this young heart glows Am I not the son of Cleon

Adrastus Verily doth a spirit move the boy Look on him now Iantha
and let no weak unworthy doubt of thine curb the proud spirit that
proves him worthy of his sire

Iantha My son my fair young Ion thou art all now left my widowed
heart How can I bid thee go The barbarous pagan will doom thee to a
cruel death How canst thou an unknown youth move the fierce heart
that hath slain thy sire

Ion Fear not Mother he who calls me to this glorious mission will
protect me Shall I stand weeping while my father still breathes the air
of pagan dungeons while the base fetters of the infidel rest on his
limbs and his brave followers lie unavenged in their cold bloody
graves while my countrys banner torn dishonored is trampled in the
dustand he the proud the brave till now unconquered defender of
that countrys honor lies doomed to an ignominious death Oh Mother
bid me go

Adrastus Iantha speak to the boy Let him not say his mother taught
him fear

Iantha My Ion gostrong in thine innocence and faith go forth upon
thy holy mission and surely He who looketh ever with a loving face on
those who put their trust in Him will in His mercy guard and guide thee
girds on his sword Farewell Gowith thy mothers blessing on
thee

Ion Now is my heart filled all anew with hope and courage and I go
forth trustingly Father thy blessing kneels before Adrastus

Adrastus Go thou selfanointed victim on the altar of thy love Bless
thy pure faithful heart

Ion rising Farewell Embrace me Mother

Iantha pressing Ion to her breast Farewell my Ion And if the
great Father wills it that I look not again on thee in life into His
care do I commit thee Farewell

Ion Mother farewell And if I fall mourn not but glory that I died
as best became the son of Cleon draws his sword And now leap forth
my swordhenceforth is there no rest nor honor till we have conquered
Father I come I come Ion rushes out Iantha rushes to the window
tears off her veil and waves it to Ion

                             SCENE SECOND

                 Tent of Mohammed maps and arms lying
                       about Mohammed and Hafiz

Mohd And spake they no word of ransom or of hostage

Hafiz None sire The lady lay as one struck dead and the priest foul
Christian dog bade me go hence and tarry not

Mohd And held you no speech with those about the princess Sure there
were some to listen to thy masters word

Hafiz Great master I sought in vain to set before them the royal will
At first it were as though a spell had fallen on them Nay some did
turn aside and weep rending their hair as though all hope were lost
Then when I strove to win them to some counsel they woke to such an
uproar cursing thy perfidy and vowing most dire and speedy vengeance
on thee clashing their weapons and crying Down with the pagan dogs
Then drawing forth their lances with fierce oaths they drove me from
the gates in such warlike manner I could but strive with haste to make
good mine escape and without rest have I journeyed hither to bring thee
tidings

Mohd By the prophet and is it thus they serve the royal messenger
But they shall rue it dearly Cleon shall die Tomorrows sun shall
never shine for him The proud Greeks shall learn to dread Mohammeds
ire and bend their haughty heads before him in the dust I offer
ransom and they will not harken I send them honorable terms and they
thrust my messenger rudely from their gates They have dared to brave
methey shall feel my power

Hafiz Mighty Mohammed if thy poor slave might offer counsel were it
not wise to tarry till the Greeks on cooler thought shall seek thee with
some treaty which may avail thee better than such hasty vengeance How
much more worthy were a heavy ransom than the life of a single miserable
prince

Mohd Peace slave I have said Cleon shall die and by Allah so I
have not word from these rebel dogs ere three days shall wear away his
body swung from the battlements shall bear them tidings of Mohammeds
power Enter Selim What hath befallen Selim that thou comest in
such haste

Selim Most mighty king there waits without a youth demanding speech
of thee

Mohd A youth Who may he be and what seeks he with us

Selim Most gracious sire I know not Our guard surprised him wandering
without the campalone unarmed save with a single sword young and
I think a Greek Abdallah seized him as a spy and led him hither to
await thy royal will He doth refuse all question demanding to be led
before thee where he will unfold his errand

Mohd A Greek Bring him before us an he prove a spy he shall hang
before the day waxeth older by an hour Hencebring him hither
Exit Selim By Allah my proud foes have deigned to send us
messengers and seek to win the favor so rudely scorned They know not
Mohammed and so they humble not themselves will sue in vain

                                         Enter Selim dragging Ion

Selim Your Mightiness doth behold the youth To Ion who stands
proudly Kneel slave

Ion I kneel not unto tyrants

Mohd How bold stripling Weigh with more care thy speech and forget
not before whom thou dost stand To Selim Go slave and stand
without see that none enter here unbidden Exit Selim Speak boy
Who art thou and why dost thou seek thus fearlessly the presence of thy
foeand beware thou speakest truly if it is as a friend to treat in
honorable fashion or as a spy thou now standest before us

Ion I am a Greek son to the noble Cleon now thy captive I seek his
rescue

Mohd Son to Cleon Now by the Prophet tis wondrous strange And
thou hast ventured alone into the camp amid thy deadly foes Speak
boythine errand

Ion To offer hostage to treat with Mohammed for a fathers life to
move to pity or to justice the heart that hath doomed a noble soldier
unto an unjust death

Mohd And where my bold prince are thy followers thy slaves thy
royal train

Ion On yonder plain cold in their graves

Mohd Hast thou brought ransom Where is thy gold

Ion In the coffers of the Turkish Mohammed plundered from his
slaughtered foes

Mohd Thou spakest of hostageI see it not

Ion Tis herethe son of Cleon

Mohd Thou and thinkest thou thy young worthless life were a fit
hostage for the leader of a rebel band the enemy of all true followers
whose capture hath cost blood and slaves and gold By Allah boy thou
must name a higher price to win the life thou doth seek

Ion I have nought else to offer Thy hand hath rent from me friends
followers gold a sire But if this young life hath any worth to thee
if these arms may toil for thee this form bear burdens to thy royalty
take themtake all O king but render unto me that life without which
Greece is lost

Mohd Peace Thy speech is vain thy life is nought to me

Ion I will serve thee as a slave in all things do thy
biddingfaithful unwearied unrepining Grant but my boon and
monarch shall never have a truer vassal than I will be to thee Great
Mohammed let me not plead in vain

Mohd Peace I say anger me not

Ion O king hast thou no heart Think of the ruined home the mourning
people the land made desolate by thee of her who now counts the weary
hours for tidings of those dear to hertidings fraught with life or
death as thou shalt decree of the son by thee doomed to see his honored
sire hero of a hundred battles dragged like a slave unto a shameful
death As thou wilt have mercy shown to thee that mercy show thou unto
me Oh say to me Thy father lives

Mohd Away I will not listen

Ion Nay I will kneel to thee I who never knelt to man before now
implore thee with earnest supplication Tis for a fathers life

Mohd Kneel not to meit is in vain Thy father is my captive my
deadliest foe whom I hate and curseay and will slay Boy dost
thou know to whom thou dost bow

Ion rising proudly To the pagan Mohammedhe who with murderous
hand hath bathed in blood the smiling plains of Greece profaned her
altars enslaved her people and filled the land with widows tears and
orphans cries he who by perfidy makes captives of his foes refusing
hostage and scorning honorable treaty turns from all supplicants
closes his heart to mercy and tramples under foot all pity and all
justicethe murderer and the tyrant Yes king I know to whom I
plead

Mohd in great anger Ho without there guardsSelim Enter
Selim and soldiers Away with the prisoner Bind him fast see he
escape not Mohammed stands not to be braved by a beardless boy Hence
Guards approach with chains

Ion Lay not hands upon meI am no slave One more appeal May a son
look once more upon his father ere death parts them forever May I but
for an hour speak with Cleon

Mohd Once more thou mayst look upon the rebel Greek When he hangs
from yonder battlement thou mayst gaze unbidden as thou will Away With
tomorrows sun he dies

Ion So soon O kingnay the son of Cleon kneels not to thee again
turns to go

Mohd Stayyield up thy sword Bend thy proud knee and surrender
unto me the arms thou art unworthy now to bear

Ion drawing his sword This my sword girded on by a mothers hand
pledged to the deliverance of a captive sire dedicated to the service
of my country unstained unconqueredthus do I surrender thee He
breaks the sword and flings it down

Mohd Again dost thou brave me Away with the rebel Bind him hand and
foot He shall learn what it is to be Mohammeds slave Hence I say

Ion I am thy captive but thy slavenever Thou mayst chain my limbs
thou canst not bind my freeborn soul Lead onI follow

                                               Exit Ion and guards

                              SCENE THIRD

              Tent of Zuleika guitar ottoman etc

Zuleika pacing up and down Night draweth on apace and ever nearer
comes the fatal hour With tomorrows dawn all hope is oer for
Mohammed hath sworn the Greek shall die and when was he ere known to
fail in his dread purpose In vain have I wept before him imploring him
to have some mercy in vain have I sought with golden promises to move
the stonyhearted Hafizall all hath failed and I am in despair And
that brave youth his true heart filled with loves pure devotion
seeking by the sacrifice of his own life to save a father And now each
moment bringeth nearer the deathhour of that father and he is mourning
in solitude that he may not say farewell Where can I turn for help Ah
Hassan my faithful slave He is true and loveth me like his own He
must aid me claps her hands enter Hassan Hassan thou lovest me
and would not see me grieve

Hassan Allah forbid Thou art dear to old Hassan as the breath of
life and while life lingers he will serve thee

Zuleika Then must thou aid me in a deed of mercy Who doth keep watch
tonight before the tent of the young Greek

Hassan Mine is the watch Wherefore dost thou seek to know

Zuleika Hassan thou hast sworn to serve me I have a boon to ask of
thee

Hassan Speak lady thy slave doth listen

Zuleika Thou knowest that with the morning sun Mohammed hath sworn
Cleon shall die Such is the fierce anger he doth bear his foe he hath
refused all mercy and scorned to listen to the prayers of the young
prince who hath journeyed hither at peril of his own life to place
himself in the power of the king as hostage for his father

Hassan It is indeed most true Poor youth

Zuleika Tis of him I would speak to thee Mohammed angered at his
boldness hath as thou knowest guarded him in yonder tent denying him
his last sad prayer to speak once more in life with his father Oh
Hassan what must be the agony of that young heart to see the hours
swift speeding by and know no hope

Hassan What wouldst thou have me do

Zuleika Lead him to his father give him the consolation of folding to
his breast the beloved one to save whose life he hath sacrificed his
own

Hassan Dear mistress thou art dreaming and cannot know the danger of
so rash a deed Bethink thee of Mohammeds anger the almost certain
doom of such as dare to brave his mighty will I pray thee let not thy
noble heart lead thee astray Thou canst not save him and will but harm
thyself

Zuleika Hassan thy love and true devotion I well know doth prompt
thee to thus counsel and in thy fear for me thou dost forget to think
of mercy or of pity I thank thee but thou canst not move me from my
firm resolve Again I ask thee Wilt thou aid me

Hassan falling at her feet Pardon but I cannot Heed I implore
thee the counsel of thy faithful servant and trust to the wisdom these
gray hairs have brought Thou art young and brave but believe me
maiden dangers of which thou dost not dream beset the path and I were
no true friend did I not warn thee to beware Do not tempt me I cannot
aid thee to thy ruin

Zuleika Then will I go alone I will brave the peril and carry comfort
to a suffering soul turns to go Hassan catches her robe

Hassan Maiden once more let thy slave entreat Thy father places faith
in me I am the captives guard

Zuleika Peace Hassan peace if life be then so dear to thee and thy
duty to thy king greater than that thou dost owe to thy fellowman
Allah forbid that I should tempt thee to forget it But did death look
me in the face I would not tarry now

Hassan And thou wouldst seek the captives cell

Zuleika This very hour Soon it will be too late

Hassan Thou knowest not the waysoldiers guard every turn Oh tarry
till the dawn I do implore thee

Zuleika The darkness shall be my guide Allah my guard shrouded in yon
dark mantle none will deem me other than a slave Again I ask thee Wilt
thou go

Hassan I go I were no true man to tremble when a woman fears not I
will guide thee and may Allah in his mercy shield us both Say thy
prayers Hassan for thy head no longer rests in safety

Zuleika Come let us on The moments speed The darkening gloom
befriends us First to the tent of the young prince and while I in
brief speech do acquaint him with mine errand thou shalt keep guard
without Then will we guide him to his father and unto Allah leave the
rest shrouds herself in dark mantle and veil Lead on good Hassan
Let us away

Hassan Fold thy veil closer that none may know the daughter of
Mohammed walks thus late abroad Come and Allah grant we sleep not in
paradise tomorrow

                                               Exit leading Zuleika

                                CURTAIN


                             SCENE FOURTH

                             Ions tent
           Ion chained in an attitude of deep despair upon
            a miserable couch He does not see the entrance
                       of Zuleika and Hassan

Zuleika Stand thou without as watch good Hassan and warn me if any
shall approach Exit Hassan Young Greek despair not hope is nigh

Ion starting up Bright vision whence comest thou Art thou the
phantom of a dream or some blest visitant from that better land come
to bear me hence What art thou

Zuleika I am no vision but a mortal maiden come to bring thee
consolation

Ion Consolation ah then indeed thou art no mortal for unto grief
like mine there is no consolation save that which cometh from above

Zuleika Nay believe it not Human hearts are at this moment hoping
and human hands are striving earnestly to spare thee the agony thou dost
dread

Ion Are there then hearts to feel for the poor Greek I had thought I
was alonealone mid mine enemies Sure those fetters are no dream
this dark cell the words Thy father dies No no it is a dread
reality The words are burned into my brain

Zuleika Is death then so dread a thing unto a warrior I had thought
it brought him fame and glory

Ion Death Oh maiden To the soldier on the battlefield fighting for
his fatherland mid the clash of arms the fierce blows of foemen the
shouts of victory neath the banner of his country the gratitude of a
nation the glory of a hero round his browdeath were a happy ay a
welcome friend But alone mid foes disgraced by fetters dragged to a
dishonored grave with none to whisper of hope or comfort death is a
cruel a most bitter foe

Zuleika Mine errand is to take from that death the bitterness thou dost
mourn to give a parting joy to the life now passing

Ion Oh hast thou the power to save my fathers life Oh use it now
and Greece shall bless thee for thy mercy

Zuleika Oh that the power were mine how gladly would I use it in a
cause so glorious I am but a woman and tho the heart is strong the
arm is very weak I cannot save thy father but trust I may still cheer
the parting hours with a brief happiness

Ion Lady thy words of kindly sympathy fall like sweet music on my
troubled heart and at thy magic call hope springeth up anew Thou art
unknown and yet there is that within that doth whisper I may trust
thee

Zuleika Thou mayst indeed Heaven were not more true than I will be
unto my word Hassan pauses before the door

Hassan Lady the hours are fleeting It were best to make good speed

Zuleika Hassan thou dost counsel aright morn must not find me here
To Ion Young Greek thou knowest with the coming dawn thy father
dies

Ion Ay ere another moon doth rise that life so dear to Greece shall
be no more the heart that beat so nobly at his countrys call be still
foreverI know it well

Zuleika And hast thou no last word for him no parting wish

Ion O maiden my life were a glad sacrifice so that I might for a
single hour look on himfor the last time say My father bless thy
Ion

Zuleika That hour shall be thine Fold thyself in yonder cloak and
follow me

Ion Follow theeand whither

Zuleika To thy fathers presence Thou shalt spend with him the last
hours of his earthly life Stay not this friendly gloom will ere long
pass away

Ion falling on his knees and catching her robe Art thou my guardian
angel Oh may the consolation thou hath poured into a suffering soul
fall like heavens dew upon thine own and if the prayers of a grateful
heart bring hope and joy and peace thy life shall bloom with choicest
blessings O maiden how do I bless thee Kisses her robe

Zuleika Speak not of thatkneel not to me a mortal maiden Thy
gratitude is my best reward Hassan lead on

Hassan Lady I do thy bidding First let me lead thee to a place of
safety

Zuleika Nay Hassan I tarry herethou canst return I will await
thee Now make all speedaway

Ion Let us hence my heart can ill contain its joy Oh my father
shall I see thee hear thy voice feel thine arms once more about me
and die with thy blessing on my head Heaven hath blessed my mission

Zuleika Shall we depart The hour wanes

Ion I will follow whither thou shalt lead But stay is there no
danger unto thee Will thy deed of mercy bring suffering to thee my
kind deliverer

Zuleika Fear not for me Yet one pledge must I ask of thee on which my
safety doth depend Tis this Swear that from the moment thou dost
leave me until thou art again a prisoner here though the path lie plain
before thee thou wilt not fly

Ion I swear Thou mayst trust me

Zuleika Yet once again Breathe not to mortal ear the means by which
thou soughtst thy sire and let the memory of this hour fade from thy
heart forever Ion bows assent What pledge have I of thy secrecy
and of thy truth

Ion The word of a Greek is sacred and were not my gratitude my surest
pledge to thee

Zuleika Pardon I do trust Now haste thee

Ion pointing to his fetters Thou dost forget I am a prisoner still

Zuleika Hassan unloose these fetters and give the Greek his freedom
Hassan takes off the chains Ion springs joyfully forward

Ion Now am I free again and with the Turks base fetters have I cast
off my fears and my despair Hope smiles upon me and my father calls
Oh let us tarry not

Zuleika folding a dark mantle round him Thus shrouded in safety
thou mayst reach his cell this ring will spare thee question Hassan
will guide thee and Iwill pray for thy success Farewell May Allah
aid thee

Ion Lady though I may never know thee never look on thee again the
memory of this brief hour will never fade The blessed gift of mercy
thou dost bestow will I ever treasure with the deepest gratitude and my
fervent prayer that all Heavens blessings may rest upon thee cease but
with my life falls on his knee and kisses her hand Pardontis my
only thanks Spirit of mercy farewell farewell Follows Hassan
Zuleika gazes after him then sinks down weeping


                                CURTAIN


                              SCENE FIFTH

                     Tent of Cleon the Greek
                 Cleon chained pacing to and fro

Cleon A few short hours and all is oerCleon sleeps with his
fathers I could have wished to die like a hero in my harness and have
known my grave were watered by my loved ones tears to take my wife
once more unto my bosom once more bless my noble Ion and pass hence
with the blest consciousness of victory won Tis bitter thus to die
ingloriously and alone Proudly raising his head But the name of
Cleon is too dear unto his people eer to be forgotten The memory that
he strove ever for his countrys welfare shall strew with tearful
blessings his unhonored grave Steps approach voices are heard Ah
they come They shall find me ready Enter Ion Has mine hour come
I am here

           Ion casts off his cloak and springs forward

Ion Father O my father

Cleon starting back wildly Thou Here

Ion Yes thy Ion bless me Father kneels

Cleon raising and clasping Ion to his breast Here on my heart
dear one I turn to meet my executioners and see thee my boy Great
Heaven I bless thee They embrace tenderly and weep Thou camest
thitherhow

Ion Alone with my good sword

Cleon Thy guide through the perils of the way my child

Ion The good Father who doth guide all who trust in him

Cleon And thine errand

Ion To behold thee my father and with my life to strive for thy
release

Cleon My noble boy thou hast come unto thy death Oh who could bid
thee thus brave the doom that must await thee

Ion My mother bid me forth and as she girded on my sword she bid me
seek my father with her blessing on my mission

Cleon My brave Iantha thus for thy countrys sake to doom thine own
heart to so deep a sorrow looks sadly upon Ion Tell me my son did
thy mother bear bravely up against the fatal tidings I had feared her
tender heart might but ill meet a blow so fearful Speak to me of her

Ion When the rude Turk did in rough speech acquaint her with thy fell
defeat she sank as one oerpowered by her grief praying the friendly
hand of death might take her hence but soon the spirit of the Greek
rose high within her and banishing her fears with brave and trusting
heart she sent me forth to seek and if it might be save thee Ah my
father that I might die for thee

Cleon And thou hath come to see me die Dost thou not know that with
the night thy father passeth hence and when the stars again look forth
it will be upon his grave

Ion Father tis because thou art doomed that I am here And if my
heart speak truly those same bright stars shall serve to guide thee
back to freedom

Cleon Thou doth speak wildly What wilt thou do Wilt thou brave the
king

Ion proudly Nay I have knelt for the last time unto Mohammed I
have offered him my liberty my service ay my life itself and he hath
scorned me I have deigned to bow before him as a suppliant and he hath
spurned me I have sought by all the power love and despair could teach
to move him and his ear was closed to me I seek him not again

Cleon Child what hath led thee to the presence of the king How didst
thou brave the frown of him before whom even armed men do tremble Didst
thou dream thy feeble voice could reach a heart so cruel that thy
prayers could soften one who knoweth not the name of mercy

Ion Love can brave all dangers It giveth wisdom to the untaught
strength to the weak hope to the despairing comfort to the mourner
Love hath been my guide my guard

Cleon My boy my Ion Truly doth God place in the pure heart of such as
thou his truest wisdom his deepest faith embraces him with deep
emotion Butart not thou in danger Did not thy bold speech anger
the proud king Art thou still free

Ion Let not thy heart be vexed with fears for meI am unharmed

Cleon Ion deceive me not but as thou hopest for thy fathers love
speak truly Art thou in danger from the Turk and in thy devotion to
thy father dost thou seek to be thyself the sacrifice Answer me Ion

Ion Father I sought to spare thy too oerburdened heart another grief
I am a prisoner in Mohammeds power and know not if my fate be life
or death

Cleon Tis as I feared and thou the last hope of thy country must
fallall all for me Oh mine own disgrace were bitter but to see
thee die Oh woe is me

Ion Father were it not better thus to die than in disgraceful peace
to pass away with no thought for our fatherland no proud consciousness
of having at the call of duty sacrificed all we held most dear and
leave a name held sacred as one who yielded life and liberty on the
altar of his country

Cleon But that thou in thine innocence and bloom should meet death at
the hands of heartless foemen and for my sake Tis this that tears
my heart

Ion The purer the victim the more acceptable the sacrifice But fear
not dear father The Turk is yet a man tis gainst thee he wars and
he will not wreak his vengeance on a child He may relent and for my
loves sake pardon mine offence

Cleon Child thou knowest not Mohammed He pardons none all fall
before him with relentless handall strew his pathway unto victory
Will he then spare and pity thee Nay sire and son must fall Stands
sorrowfully Ion suddenly sees Zuleikas ring upon his hand and
springs forward

Ion Father thou shalt yet breathe the air of freedom shall clasp my
mother to thy heart once more shall lead thy gallant band onward to
victory

Cleon Raise not bright hopes to crush them at their birth wake not to
dreams of triumph the heart that hath striven to drive hence all save
the solemn thoughts meet for one so soon to pass away

Ion pointing to the door See the gray morning gins to glimmer in
the east Tis no time for despair Haste Father freedom is near

Cleon What doth thus move thee Ion Dost thou forget these chains
the guards the perils at each step Thou art dreaming

Ion I tell thee tis no dream Thou shalt be free This mantle will
disguise thee this ring open a pathway through the guards these stars
shall be thy silent guide Wilt thou go

Cleon Tis strange Whence then that ring How dost thou a captive
wander thus freely and offer liberty with such a bounteous hand

Ion A solemn oath doth forbid me to reveal to living man the secret of
this hour but if ever angels do leave their homes to minister to
suffering souls twas one most bright and beautiful who hath this night
led me unto thee and placed in mine hand the power to set thee free

Cleon Truth speaketh in thine earnest eye and pleading voice and yet I
dare not listen to thy tale

Ion Oh Father heed not thy fears thy doubts Take thy liberty
believing it heavensent No oath binds thee to Mohammed thou art no
rightful prisoner of warneither duty nor honor doth demand thy stay
Thy country calls and Heaven doth point the way

Cleon Tis true no oath doth bind me to the Turk and yet to flyMy
soldiers spirit doth ill brook such retreat

Ion Then stay not my father but whilst thou may depart

Cleon Bright hopes call me hence Life love fame beckon me away

                                                    Hassan looks in

Hassan The promised hour hath wellnigh gone Prepare young Greek we
must away

Ion A moment more Exit Hassan Father time wanes Once more I do
entreat theego

Cleon Heaven grant I choose aright Come Ion we will forth together
Ion folds the cloak about Cleon gives him the ring Come let us
go

Ion Nay but one can pass forth Thou goest I await the morning here

Cleon Then do I tarry also Nay Ion I will not go hence without thee

Ion Then all is lost Father thy stay can nought avail me It cannot
save and thou wilt but sacrifice thine own priceless life

Cleon Then fly with me let me bear thee to thy mother Alone I will
not go

Ion I cannot go a vow doth bid me staya vow that nought shall tempt
me from the camp tonight and when did a Greek eer break his plighted
word

Cleon If thine honor bid thee stay thy father will not tempt thee
hence but he may stay and suffer with thee the fate of the faithful
throws off the mantle

Ion Oh my father do not cast from thee the priceless boon of liberty
Think of thy brokenhearted wife thy faithful followers thy
unconquered foes think Father of thy country calling on thee for
deliverance What were my worthless life weighed gainst her freedom
And what happier fate for a heros son than for a heros sake to fall

Cleon Thou true son of Greece Mayst thou yet live to wield a sword for
thine oppressed land and gird with laurels that brow so worthy them

                                                       Hassan enters

Hassan No longer may I stay thine hour is past

Ion I comeyet one moment more good Hassan it is my last Exit
Hassan Once more my father do I entreat theego Thou dost forget
a guardian spirit watcheth over me and the power that led me hither may
yet accomplish my deliverance If nought else can move thee for my sake
go and win for me that freedom mine honor doth now forbid me to seek
Break not my heart nor let me plead in vain

Cleon My boy for thy dear sake do I consent I will earn thy
deliverance bravely as a soldier should and thy dear image shall be
to me the star that leads me on to victory

Ion joyfully Away Hassan will guide thee past the guards Then
flyand Heaven guide thee O my father Ion again shrouds Cleon in
the mantle concealing his chains in the thick folds Thus muffle thy
telltale fetters that no sound may whisper to the Turks there walks a
Greek under the free heavens forth to freedom

Cleon My Ion one last embrace God grant tis not our last on earth
Bless thee thou true young heart Heaven guard thee

                                              Hassan enters in haste

Hassan Art ready We must depart Cleon bows his head and follows
Ion rushes after looking from the tent

Ion Saved saved The morning sun that was to shine upon his grave
will smile upon him far far from foemens power And Mohammed thinking
to look upon a dying slave shall waken to the sound of his victorious
wartrump Ion thy mission is accomplished Thou hast given a saviour
to thy fatherland and mayst fall thyself without a murmur looks up
thankfully a loud noise without

                                         Enter Abdallah and Murad

Abd Where is the prisoner Come forth

Ion I am here comes forward

Abd Hahere is treason Without therethe prisoner hath escaped

Murad Who flieth yonder past the camp

Abd Tis he Forth call for aid Search without delay Here is foul
work abroad First seize yon boy fetter the base spy bear him before

The peculiarity of this opera was that while the words were committed to

In spite of its absurdity this play was a great favorite for Jo was
truly superb as the hapless Bianca while her trills and tragic agonies
were considered worthy of the famous Grisi herself

                 Room in the palace of Count Adrian
                             Enter Nina

Nina Tis a fair and lovely home and well befits a gay young bride but
ah not if she bear a sad and weary heart like mine beneath her bridal
robes All smile on me and call me happy blessed with such a home and
husband and yet mid all my splendor I could envy the poor cottage
maiden at her spinningwheel For ah mid all her poverty one sweet
thought comes ever like a sunny sky to brighten een her darkest hours
for she is loved while I yet sigh in vain for one kind word one
tender glance from him I love so fondly Ah he comes no sad tears
now sorrow is for my lonely hours and I will smile on him een though
my heart is breaking

                                                  Enter Count Adrian

Adrian coldly Goodeven madam I trust all things are placed
befitting a fair ladys bower and thou hast found thy home a pleasant
one

Nina Adrian husband speak not thus to me I could find more joy in
some poor cell with thee than all the wealth that kings could give if
thou wert gone Look kindly on me and I ask no more One smile from thee
can brighten all the world to these fond eyes Oh turn not away but
tell me how have I angered thee and grant thy pardon for thy young
wifes first offence

Adrian The pardon I could give were worthless for the time is past
Tis too late to ask forgiveness now It matters not then say no more
turns away

Nina My lord I charge thee tell me of what dark crime thou dost think
me guilty Fear not to tell me innocence is strong to bear and happy to
forgive Ah leave me not I cannot rest till I know all and if the
deep devotion of a womans heart can still repair the wrong it shall be
thinebut answer me

Adrian Canst thou unsay the solemn words that bound us at the altar
three short days ago Canst thou give back the freedom thou hast taken
break the vows thou hast plighted cast away that ring and tell me I am
free Do it and my full forgiveness shall be thine

Nina Give thee back thy freedom am I a chain to bind thee to what thou
dost not love Take back the vows I made to honor thee what dost thou
mean I am thy wife and dost thou hate me

Adrian I do

Nina God help me now Tell me Adrian I implore thee tell me what
have I done to tempt such cruel words from thee I loved thee and left
all to be thy wife and now when my poor heart is longing for one tender
word to cheer its sorrow thou the husband who hath vowed to love and
cherish me hath said thou dost hate me Ah am I sleeping Wake me or
the dream will drive me mad

Adrian Tis a dream I cannot banish We must part

Nina Partgo on the blow hath fallen I can feel no more Go on

Adrian Thou knowest I wooed thee Thou wert fair and wondrous rich I
sought thy gold not thee for with thy wealth I would carve out a
path through life that all should honor Well we were wed and when I
sought to take thy fortune it was gone and not to me but to thy
fathers friend Don Felix It was all left to him and thou wert
penniless and thus I won a wife I loved not and lost the gold I would
have died to gain Thinkest thou not I am well angered But for thee I
might yet win a noble bride whose golden fetters I would gladly wear

Nina And this is he to whom I gave my heart so filled with boundless
love and trust Oh Adrian art thou so false What is gold to a womans
deathless love Can it buy thee peace and all the holy feelings human
hearts can give Can it cheer and comfort thee in sorrow or weep fond
happy tears when thou hast won the joy and honor thou dost seek No
none of these the golden chains will bind thee fast till no sweet
thought no tender hope can come to thee I plead not now for my poor
self but for thine own heart thou doth wrong so cruelly by such vain
dreams

Adrian Enough Thou hast a noble name and men will honor thee thou
wilt suffer neither pain nor want I will leave thee and wander forth to
seek mine own sad lot Farewell and when they ask thee for thy husband
tell them thou hast none and so be happy turns to go

Nina Oh Adrian I implore thee stay I will bear all thy coldness ay
even thy contempt I will toil for thee and seek to win the gold for
which thou dost sigh I will serve thee well and truly for with all my
heart I love thee still Leave me not now or I shall die Kneels and
clasps his hand

Adrian I am a slave till death shall set me free We shall not meet
again Nay kneel not to me I do forgive thee but I cannot love thee
rushes out

home and still the sorrow of this broken heart

Hagar What brings thee hither gentle lady and how can the wanderer
serve the highborn and the fair

Nina sadly There is often deeper sorrow in the palace than the cot
good Hagar and I seek thee for some counsel that will cure the pain of
a lonely heart I have tried all others skill in vain and come to thee
so learned in mystic lore to give me help I am rich and can repay thee
well

Hagar I can read a sad tale in thy pale and gentle face dear lady
Thou art young and loving but the hope of youth is gone and thou art
sorrowing with no fond heart whereon to lean no tender voice to comfort
and to cheer Ah have I read aright Then the only charm to still thy
pain is death

Nina Tis death I long for That still dreamless sleep would bring me
peace But tis a fearful thing to take the life God gave and I dare
not Canst thou not give me help

Hagar Within this tiny casket there is that which brings a quiet sleep
filled with happy dreams and they who drink the draught lie down and
slumber and if not awakened it will end in death But thou sweet lady
wouldst not leave this fair world yet Tell me more for this old heart
is warm and tender still and perchance I can help thee

Nina Tis strange that I can feel such faith in thee kind friend but
I am young and lonely and I seek some heart for counsel Thou art from
my own fair land and I will tell thee of my sorrow Tis a short sad
tale I loved was wed and thenoh darksome dayI learned my husband
felt no love and sought me only for my gold I was penniless and thus
he cast me off and now for long long weeks I have not seen him for he
would not dwell with her who loved him more than life itself Now give
me some sweet charm to win that lost heart back Ah Hagar help me

Hagar I can give thee no truer charm than that fair face and noble
soul dear lady Be thou but firm and faithful in thy love and it will
win thy husband back God bless and grant all happiness to one who doth
so truly need it

Nina Give me the casket and when life hath grown too bitter to be
borne then will I gladly lay the burden down and blessing him I love so
well sleep that calm slumber that knows no awaking Farewell Hagar
thou hast given me comfort and I thank thee

                             disguised

Adrian Here last I saw her one long year ago How the wild sweet voice
still rings in my ear imploring me to stay I can find no rest save
here and thus do I seek my home worn out by my long wandering and
trusting to learn tidings of poor Nina If she be true and love me still
I will cast away my pride my coldness and all vain hopes of wealth
and let the sunlight of that pure young life brighten my life
henceforth I hear a step and will hide here perchance I may thus see
her hides behind curtain

                                                          Enter Nina

Nina No rest for thee poor heart ever whispering that dear name ever
sorrowing for those hard words that gave so deep a wound All is dark
and lonely for he is gone Only these withered flowers dearer by far
than my most costly gems for his hand hath touched them and he smiled
on me when they were given Oh Adrian wilt thou never give one tender
thought to her who still loves and prays for thee Death will soon free
thee from thy hated wife

                                                           Exit Nina

Adrian stealing forth And this is she whose pure young love I have
cast away the fond trusting bride I left alone and friendless She
still loves on and offers up her prayers for one who sought to break
that tender heart so cruelly I will watch well and guard thee Nina

patient love hath won

Nina with Adrians picture Ah these cold eyes smile kindly on me
here and the lips seem speaking tender words Other faces are
perchance more fair but none so dear to me Oh husband thou hast cast
me off and yet though lonely and forsaken I still can cherish loving
thoughts of thee and round thy image gather all the tender feelings
that a womans heart can know Thy cruel words I can forgive and the
trusting love I gave thee glows as warmly now as when thou didst cast it
by and left me brokenhearted weeps enter Don Felix My lord
what seekest thou with me Thou dost smile Ah hast thou tidings of my
husband Tell me quickly I beseech thee

Don Felix Nay dear ladyBut sit thee down and let me tell thee why I
came He leads her to a sofa Thou knowest I have been with thee
from a child I stood beside thee at the altar and was the first to
cheer and comfort thee when thou wast left deserted and alone Let me
now ask thee Wouldst thou not gladly change thy sad lot here for a gay
and joyous life with one who loves thee fondly

Nina It were indeed a happy lot to be so loved and cherished but
where alas is he who could thus feel for one so lonely and forsaken

Don Felix kneeling Here at thy feet dear Nina Nay do not turn
away but let me tell thee of the love that hath grown within my heart
Nina starts up Thy wedded lord hath cast thee off The law can free
thee Ah then be mine and let me win and wear the lovely flower which
he hath cast away

Nina Lord Felix as the wife of him thou dost so wrong I answer thee
Dost thou not know the more a womans heart is crushed and wounded the
more tenderly it clings where first it loved and though deserted ay
though hated I had rather be the slighted wife of him than the honored
bride of the false Costella Now leave meI would be alone

Don Felix A time will come proud woman when thou shalt bend the knee
to him whom now thou dost so scorn Beware for I will have a fierce
revenge for the proud words thou hast spoken

Nina I am strong in mine own heart and fear thee not Work thy will and
thou shalt find the wife of Adrian de Mortemar needs no protector save
her own fearless hand

                                                           Exit Nina

Don Felix Now by my faith thou shalt bow that haughty head and sue
to me for mercy and I will deny it Ill win her yet she shall not
idly brave my anger Now to my workrevenge

                                                      Exit Don Felix

                             SCENE FOURTH

                    Apartment in palace of Nina
                             Nina alone

Nina Ever thus alone mourning for him who loves me not was ever heart
so sad as mine Oh Adrian couldst thou but return even for one short
hour to thy poor Nina Enter Adrian disguised Ha who art thou
that dares to enter here in such mysterious guise Thine errand
quicklyspeak

Adrian Forgive me lady if I cause thee fear I would have thee know
me as a friend one who will watch above thee and seek to spare thee
every sorrow Dear lady think me not too bold for I have known thee
long and have a right to all thy confidence Thy husband was my nearest
friend and when he left thee friendless and alone I vowed to guard
and save thee in all peril Wilt thou trust me See I bear his
ringthou knowest it

Nina Tis indeed his ring Whence came it Ah hast thou seen him Tell
me and I will give thee all my confidence and thanks takes the ring
and gazes beseechingly upon Adrian who turns aside

Adrian He is well lady and happy as one can be who bears a cold
proud heart within his breast He has cast away an angel who could have
cheered and blessed his life and sought to find in gold the happiness
thy love alone could bring He has suffered as he well deserves to do
Spend not thy pity upon him

Nina proudly And who art thou to speak thus of him Thou canst not
judge till thou also hast been tried and like him deceived He sought
for wealth to bring him fame and honor and when he found it not what
wonder that he cast aside the love that could not bring him happiness
Thou art no true friend to speak thus of one so worthy to be loved And
think not I reproach him for my lonely lot Ah no I still love on and
if he wins the wealth he covets I can give my hearts best blessing and
so pass away that he shall never know whose hand hath crushed the flower
that would have clung about his life and shed its perfume there turns
away weeping

Adrian aside She loves me still Ill try her further aloud
Lady idle tongues have whispered that when thy lord deserted thee thou
didst find a solace for thy grief in a new lovers smiles Perchance yon
picture may be some gay lord who hath cheered thy solitude and won thy
heart I fain would ask thee

Nina Sir stranger little dost thou know a womans heart I have found
a comfort for my lonely hours in weeping oer the face whose smiles
could brighten life for me or dim it by disdain and coldness The face
is there my first last only love is given to him who thinks it
worthless and hath cast it by

Adrian taking the picture Tis the Count thy husband Lady he is
unworthy such true love leave him to his fate and let not thy life be
darkened by his cruelty and hate

memories of him and till life shall cease be true unto my husband Now

                              SCENE FIFTH

                     Hall in the palace of Nina
                     Enter Nina and Don Felix

Nina I tell thee my lord I will not listen naught thou canst say
will change my firm resolve I cannot wed thee

Don Felix Nay then listen Thy cruel husband left thee and for one
long year thou hast sorrowed in thy lonely home and would not be
comforted He hath returned

Nina AhRushes forward

Don Felix Thou mayst well start but think not he will come to thee
chains hold him fast andmark yetwas I who bound those chains

Nina Do I dream my husband here and in captivity nay I believe thee
not Tis a false tale to anger me I heed thee not turns away
haughtily

Don Felix Thou wilt heed me ere I am done What thinkest thou of this
thy husbands dagger See here his name Twas taken from his hands ere
the cold chains bound them Ah thou dost believe me now

Nina Oh tell on I will listen now Why hast thou done this cruel
deed Why make this his welcome home Thou hast fettered and imprisoned
him and now art here to tell me of it Ah dost thou hate him Then give
all thy hate to me but oh I pray thee comfort him

Don Felix When thou didst reject my suit I told thee I would be
revenged I said a day would come when thou so cold and haughty then
would kneel to me imploring mercy and I would deny thee That time hath
come and I am deaf to all thy prayers

Nina For his sake will I kneel to thee beseeching liberty for him I
had no love to give thee Ah pardon if I spake with scorn and pity me
What can I do to win thee back to mercy Ah listen and be generous

Don Felix Tis now too late He is in my power and a dagger can soon
rid thee of a cruel husband me of a hated rival

Nina God have pity on me now Don Felix let me plead once more Set
Adrian free and I will take his place in yon dark cell and welcome
there the dagger that shall set me free

Don Felix And wilt thou wear the chains Wilt enter that lone cell
and perish there Canst thou do this

Nina Ay gladly will I suffer pain captivity and death for thee
Adrian for thee

Don Felix Then womans love is stronger than mans hate and I envy him
you would die for Nina

Nina Ah love alone can make home blest and here it dwells not I can
free him from his fetters and his hated wife Tell him I loved him to
the last and blessed him ere I died Lead on my lord I am ready

Don Felix aside I thought I had steeled my heart with hatred and
revenge but oh they pass away before such holy love as this Would I
could win her to myself for she would lead me on to virtue and to
happiness Yet one more trial and she may be mine at last

                                                            Tableaux

                   Street near Adrians palace
                            Enter Adrian

Adrian Tis all discovered my mysterious captivity and my release Don
Felix whom I trusted wove the dark plot and sought by false words to
win Nina from me He has dared to love her and he shall dearly pay for
his presumption He knows not that I watched above her in disguise and
now while I was in captivity he hath taken her from her home Let him
beware If aught of harm hath come to her woe betide him who hath
caused one tear to fall or one sad fear to trouble her I must seek and
save her No peril will be too great to win her back to this heart that
longs so fondly for her now

                                                        Exit Adrian

                             SCENE SEVENTH

                 A cell in the palace of Don Felix
                            Nina chained

Nina T is strange here in this dark cell tho fettered and alone I
feel a deeper joy than when a proud and envied bride I dwelt in my
deserted home For here his foot hath trod these walls have echoed to
the voice I love these chains so cold and heavy I more gladly wear than
een the costly gems once clasped upon these arms for they were his
Here his sad tears fell perchance for his captivity but I can smile and
bless the hour when I could win thy freedom Adrian with my poor
liberty Harkthey come Is it to claim the vow I made to yield my
bosom to the dagger meant for his I am ready Enter Don Felix
Alone my lord methought it were too sad a task for thee to take my
life Well be it so you claim my vow I can die still blessing thee
my Adrian kneels before Don Felix

Don Felix Rise Nina ah kneel not to me nor think this hand could
take the life it prizes more than happiness or honor I came not here to
harm thee Heaven forbid I came once more to offer thee my heart my
home and all the boundless love you have so scorned Thy husband hath
deserted thee no ties too fast to sever bind thee to him Thou art
alone a captive and I alone can free thee Think of the love I bear
thee Nina and be mine takes her hand

Nina Where is thy boasted honor now Where the solemn vow thou didst
make me that my lonely cell should be as sacred to thee as my palace
halls Where is thy pity for the helpless wife of him whom thou didst
call thy friend I never loved thee now I scorn thee A true and pure
affection never binds such chains as these nor causes bitter tears like
mine to flow Rather suffer death than cherish in my heart one tender
thought of thee Thou hast my answer now leave me

Don Felix Not yet proud captive I have sought to win thee gently but
now beware Think not to escape me thou shalt feel how deep a
vengeance I can bring on thee and him thou lovest Thou shalt suffer all
the sorrow I can inflictshalt know thy proud lord forsaken and in
danger when a word from me can save and that word I will not speak
All the grief and pain and hatred that my jealous heart can give will I
heap upon his head and thus through him I will revenge myself on thee

Nina Thou canst not harm him he is safe and free Do thy worst I care
not what fate thou hast for me a fearless hand soon finds a way to free
a soul from sorrow and captivity This heart thou canst not reach It
fears thee not

Don Felix Can I not make thee tremble haughty woman I love thee
still and I will win thee I go to work thee sorrow and when next we
meet I will bring thee token of thy husbands death or what may touch
thee nearer his hate of thee

                                                      Exit Don Felix

Nina Tis a dark and fearful dreamAdrian in danger and I cannot
save him Oh that I were free again naught should stay me and I would
win him back by the power of womans love and faith Lord Felix will
return he hath vowed revenge where then can I look for a true heart to
comfort and protect me sinks down in despair

                                   Enter Adrian still in disguise

Adrian Here is a friend to aid thee

Nina starting up Whowho art thou

Adrian Thy guardian Lady thou hast said thou wouldst trust me and I
am here to save

Nina Forgive me that I doubt thee yet I do fear to trust for I am
wellnigh crazed with sorrow Art thou my husbands friend

Adrian I am true as Heaven to thee poor lady I have watched above
thee and can save Here here is the ring thou knowest ah do not doubt
me

Nina I know thee now and put all my faith in thee Take me hence Ah
save me Lead me to my home and the thanks of a broken heart are thine
Lead on kind friend I will follow thee

Adrian aside Oh this is a bitter punishment for me It breaks my
heart Aloud This way dear lady a secret door doth let us forth
step thou lightly Thus let me shroud thee

    He wraps Nina in a dark robe and they disappear thro the
        secret door

                             SCENE EIGHTH

                           Ninas chamber
                       Enter Nina and Hagar

Nina Welcome to thee Hagar sit thee down and tell me why hast thou
come to seek me in my lonely home

Hagar Sweet lady fear not no evil tidings do I bring but a wondrous
tale of happiness in store for thee When thy father died few doubted
but his wealth would come to thee and it would indeed have all been
thine had not that false Don Felix stolen the will away He took the
paper that left all to thee and thus he won the orphans gold But
three short days ago a dreadful crime which he had done was brought to
light and he hath fled He told me all and bid me give thee this thy
fathers will Hagar gives paper to Nina

Nina Tis strange most strange But tell me Hagar how didst thou
come to know that evil man

Hagar I knew him when he came from Italy with thee and thy father years
ago And as I watched thy path through life so I watched his and thus
he learned to trust me Tis thus I gained for thee that wealth so long
withheld and now my work is done Thou wilt win thy husbands love and
so be happy God bless thee gentle lady and farewell

Nina Ah stay and tell me how can I best show the gratitude I deeply
feel Thou hast brought me wealth and happiness how can I repay thee

Hagar I ask no other joy than that I see in thy fair face I go now to
my own dear land and we shall not meet again but old Hagar will
remember thee and pray that life may be one long bright dream of love
with the husband thou hast won Farewell

                                                          Exit Hagar

Nina The clouds have passed away and I am happy now and the wealth
he longed for it is mine to give Oh Adrian come back to her thou
hast cast aside An arrow bearing a letter is thrown in at the window
and falls at her feet What means this letter Stay let me see what
it may tell me Tis from Adrian Ah does an angel watch above me that
such joy is mine Opens the letter and reads

    Think not to win me back with thy new wealth I cannot love
    thee Be happy with thy gold it cannot buy the heart of the
    unhappy
                                                         Adrian

Nina This from him No no it cannot be he would not speak such words
to me his wife Yet t is his handI must believeand a deeper
darkness gathers round me No joy no hope is left to bind me unto
life If I were gone he might be happy with another I can never win his
love then why live on to dim his pathway I will leave my gold to him
for it is worthless now and when with her he loves in some fair home
he sends perchance one thought of her who died to free him I shall be
repaid for this last sacrifice Ah Hagar little didst thou think the
joy foretold would end so soon and this thy gift would win for me the
rest I long for now takes from her bosom the phial and drinks It
will soon be past Now till sleep steals oer me I will send one last
word Adrian to thee She writes then sinks upon the couch My
heart grows faint and my eyes are heavy with the last slumber they
shall ever know The poison does its work too soon but I am done with
life and the soft sweet sleep of death is holding me Oh my husband
may this last deed of mine give thee all the joy it could not bring to
her who could only die for thee Farewell life farewell love my latest
prayer is for thee Adrian She lies down and falls gently asleep


                                CURTAIN


                              SCENE NINTH

                      Terrace in Ninas garden
                      Enter Adrian with letter

Adrian What means this letter from her hand Twas given me by her
servant while she slept Does she call me home again Ah little can she
know how fondly now her cold proud husband longs to fold her in his
arms and bless the hour when he lost wealth and won her noble love
Opens the letter and reads

    I send thee back the cruel words that have banished all the
    hopes of happiness with thee I cannot win thy heart and this
    sad truth hath broken mine And now upon my dying bed I leave
    thee all the wealth that could not win one tender smile for her
    who pined for it in vain Thou hast scorned my love take thou
    the gold which is worthless to me now Farewell my husband I
    am faithful to the last and my lips blessed thee ere they
    drank the draught that soon will free me from my sorrow and
    thee from thy unloved but loving
                                                               Nina

Adrian My cruel words What means this Stay there is another paper
and it may tell me more Reads Felixs forged letter and dashes it
down Tis false false as the villains heart who forged the lie and
brought agony like this to that pure loving heart Oh Nina Nina now
when I so fondly love thee thou hast been deceived and died still
blessing him thou deemed so cruel and so cold Oh that I could but win
thee back for one short hour that I might tell my penitence and my deep
sorrow for the grief I have brought thee Yet blessed thought it may
not be too late She slept but one short hour ago when this was taken
from her hand She may yet linger at the gates of death and I may call
her back to happiness and life once more Oh if I may but win this
blessing to my heart my life shall be one prayer of thankfulness for
the great boon rushes out


                                CURTAIN


                              SCENE TENTH

                           Ninas chamber
              Nina lies in a deep trance upon her couch
                          Adrian rushes in

Adrian Nina Nina wake love it is I thy husband who doth call thee
Oh can I not win thee back to life now when I have learned to love with
all my hearts faith and fondness He kisses her hands and weeps
Calm and still she lies all my tender words cannot awake her and these
bitter tears but fall unheeded and in vain Was it for this I won that
warm young heartfor this short sorrowing life this lonely death Ah
couldst thou see this proud heart humbled now and these repentant tears
that wet thy quiet brow Nina wife oh wake and tell me I am forgiven
Kneels beside her

Nina rousing Adrian

Adrian starting up She breathes she lives my prayer is heard
Tis not too late

Nina still dreaming Methought I was in heaven for Adrian bent oer
me the face I loved smiled lovingly upon me sweet tender words were
spoken and the joy of that short moment well repaid the sorrow I had
borne ere that last sleep came I am happy now for Adrian hath said he
loves me

Adrian Thy deathlike sleep still hangs about thee thou art still on
earth and I am here to bring thee joy Ah waken and learn thy dream is
true Thy husband loves thee

Nina So the sweet vision said but it hath passed and this will vanish
too Ah why hast thou called me back Life is but a chain that binds me
unto sorrow then let me sleep again and dream that Adrian is true

Adrian Nina Nina rouse thyself it is no dream he hath bent above
thee weeping bitter tears and pouring forth his whole hearts love
remorse and sorrow His voice hath called thee back to life and he is
here Nina rises and looks wildly about her Here love at thy feet
seeking thy pardon for the deep wrong he hath done thee praying thy
forgiveness Throws himself at her feet Nina stretches forth her
arms and they embrace with tears of joy

Nina Adrian husband I have naught to pardon Thou hast won me from
the sleep of death I am thine thy heart is my home and I am only
happy there

Adrian I am unworthy such great happiness Oh Nina thou art the true
angel of my life and thou hast led me on to win a deeper joy than all
the wealth of earth could give I cast thy pure affection by and sought
in selfish sorrow to forget thee but I could not Thy dear face shone
in all my dreams and thy voice still lingered in mine ear imploring me
to love thee Then I returned to find thee drooping like a blighted
flower All loved and honored thee and I vowed to watch and if I
found thee true and loving still to tell thee all and give my heart to
thee forever I have now won thee and I love thee dearest

Nina Oh I am too blest Life is a flowerstrewn path henceforth where
I will gladly journey if thou wilt be my guide and here upon thy
breast dear love now smiles the happy wifeno longer the lonely and
unloved one
