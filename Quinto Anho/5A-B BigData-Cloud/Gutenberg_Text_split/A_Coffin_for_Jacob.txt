               With never a moment to rest the pursuit
               through space felt like a game of hounds
              and hares  or was it follow the leader


Ben Curtis eased his pale gaunt body through the open doorway of the
Blast Inn the dead man following silently behind him

His fearborne gaze traveled into the dimly illumined Venusian gin
mill The place was like an evil caldron steaming with a brew whose
ingredients had been culled from the back corners of three planets

Most of the big room lay obscured behind a shimmering veil of tobacco
smoke and the sweet heavy fumes of Martian Devils Egg Here and
there Ben saw moving figures He could not tell if they were Earthmen
Martians or Venusians

Someone tugged at his greasy coat He jumped thinking absurdly that it
was the dead mans hand

Coma esta senor a small voice piped Speken die Deutsch
Desirezvous damour Da Nyet

Ben looked down

The speaker was an eagereyed Martian boy of about ten He was like
a redskinned marionette with pipestem arms and legs clad in a torn
skivvy shirt and faded blue dungarees

Im American Ben muttered

Ah buena I speak English tres fine senor I have Martian
friend she tres pretty and tres fat She weigh almost eighty
pounds monsieur I take you to her si

Ben shook his head

                                   

He thought I dont want your Martian wench I dont want your opium
or your Devils Egg or your Venusian kali But if you had a drug thatd
bring a dead man to life Id buy and pay with my soul

It is deal monsieur Five dollars or twenty keelis for visit
Martian friend Maybe you like House of Dreams For House of Dreams

Im not buying

The dirtyfaced kid shrugged Then I show you to good tabletres
bien I do not charge you senor

The boy grabbed his hand Because Ben could think of no reason for
resisting he followed They plunged into shifting layers of smoke and
through the drone of alcoholcracked voices

They passed the bar with its line of leanfeatured sliteyed
Earthmenmerchant spacemen

They wormed down a narrow aisle flanked by booths carved from Venusian
marble that jutted up into the semidarkness like fogblanketed
tombstones

Several times Ben glimpsed the bulky figures of CObreathing
Venusians the first hed ever seen

They were smoky gray scaly naked giants toads in human shape
They stood solitary and motionless aloof their greenlidded eyes
unblinking They certainly didnt look like telepaths as Ben had heard
they were but the thought sent a fresh rivulet of fear down his spine

Once he spied a whiteuniformed officer of Hoover Citys Security
Police The man was striding down an aisle idly tapping his neuroclub
against the stone booths

Keep walking Ben told himself You look the same as anyone else
here Keep walking Look straight ahead

The officer passed Ben breathed easier

Here we are monsieur piped the Martian boy A tres fine table
Close in the shadows

Ben winced How did this kid know he wanted to sit in the shadows
Frowning he sat downhe and the dead man

He listened to the lonely rhythms of the fourpiece Martian orchestra

The Martians were fragile dolllike creatures with heads too large for
their spindly bodies Their long fingers played upon the strings of
their cirillas or crawled over the holes of their flutes like spider
legs Their tune was sad Even when they played an Earth tune it still
seemed a song of old Mars charged with echoes of lost voices and
forgotten grandeur

For an instant Bens mind rose above the haunting vision of the dead
man He thought What are they doing here these Martians Here in
a smokefilled room under a metalite dome on a dustcovered world
Couldnt they have played their music on Mars Or had they like me
felt the challenge of new worlds

He sobered It didnt matter He ordered a whiskey from a Chinese
waiter He wet his lips but did not drink His gaze wandered over the
faces of the Inns other occupants

Youve got to find him he thought Youve got to find the man with
the red beard Its the only way you can escape the dead man

                                   

The dead man was real His name was Cobb He was stout and flabby and
about forty and he hated spacemen

His body was buried nowprobably in the silent gray wastes outside
Luna City But hed become a kind of invisible Siamese twin as much a
part of Ben as sight in his eyes

Sometimes the image would be shuffling drunkenly beside him its lips
spitting whiskeyslurred curses

Again its face would be a popeyed mask of surprise as Bens fist
thudded into its jaw More often the face would be frozen in the
whiteness of death The large eyes would stare Blood would trickle
from a corner of the gaping mouth

You can forget a living man You can defeat him or submit to him or
ignore him and the matter is over and done You cant escape from a
memory that has burned into your mind

It had begun a week ago in Luna City The flight from White Sands had
been successful Ben quietly and moderately wanted to celebrate
He stopped alone in a rocketfront bar for a beer The man named Cobb
plopped his portly and unsteady posterior on the stool next to him

Spacemen he muttered are getting like flies Everywhere all you
sees spacemen

He was a neatly dressed civilian

Ben smiled If it werent for spacemen you wouldnt be here

The names Cobb The man hiccoughed Spacemen in their white monkey
suits They think theyre little tin gods Betcha you think youre a
little tin god He downed a shot of whiskey

Ben stiffened He was twentyfour and dressed in the white
crimsonbraided uniform of the Odysseys junior astrogation officer
He was three months out of the Academy at White Sands and the shining
uniform was like a key to all the mysteries of the Universe

Hed sought long for that key

                                   

At the age of fiveperhaps in order to dull the memory of his parents
death in a recent stratojet crashhed spent hours watching the night
sky for streaking flametails of Moon rockets At ten hed ground
his first telescope At fourteen hed converted an abandoned shed on
the government boardingschool grounds to a retreat which housed his
collection of astronomy and rocketry books

At sixteen hed spent every weekend holiday hitchhiking from Boys
Town No  in the Catskills to Long Island Spaceport There among
the grizzled veterans of the old Moon Patrol hed found friends who
understood his dream and who later recommended his appointment to the
U S Academy for the Conquest of Space

And a month ago hed signed aboard the Odysseythe first ship it
was rumored equipped to venture as far as the asteroids and perhaps
beyond

Cobb was persistent Damn fools shoulda known enough to stay on Earth
What the hell good is it jumpin from planet to planet

The guys drunk Ben thought He took his drink and moved three
stools down the bar

Cobb followed You dont like the truth eh kid You dont like
people to call you a sucker

Ben rose and started to leave the bar but Cobb grabbed his arm and
held him there

Thas what you area sucker Youre young now Wait ten years Youll
be dyin of radiation rot or a meteorll get you Wait and see sucker

Until this instant Ben had suppressed his anger Now suddenly and
without warning it welled up into savage fury

His fist struck the man on the chin Cobbs eyes gaped in shocked
horror He spun backward His head cracked sickeningly on the edge of
the bar The sound was like a punctuation mark signaling the end of
life

He sank to the floor eyes glassy blood tricking down his jaw

Ben knew that he was dead

Then for a single absurd second Ben was seized with terrorjust as
a moment before hed been overwhelmed with anger

He ran

                                   

For some twenty minutes he raced through a dizzying nightmare world
of dark rocketfront alleys and shouting voices and pursuing feet

At last abruptly he realized that he was alone and in silence He saw
that he was still on the rocketfront but in the Tychoward side of the
city

He huddled in a dark corner of a loading platform and lit a cigarette
A thousand starsa thousand motionless balls of silver fireshone
above him through Luna Citys transparent dome

He was sorry hed hit Cobb of course He was not sorry hed run
Escaping at least gave him a power of choice of decision

You can do two things he thought

You can give yourself up and thats what a good officer would do
That would eliminate the escape charge Youd get off with voluntary
manslaughter Under interplanetary law that would mean ten years in
prison and a dishonorable discharge And then youd be free

But youd be through with rockets and space They dont want new
men over thirtyfour for officers on rockets or even for thirdclass
jetmen on beatup freightersthey dont want convicted killers Youd
get the rest of the thrill of conquering space through video and by
peeking through electric fences of spaceports

Or

There were old wives tales of a group of renegade spacemen who
operated from the Solar Systems frontiers The spacemen werent
outlaws They were misfits rejectees from the clearing houses on Earth

And whereas no legally recognized ship had ventured past Mars the
soupedup renegade rigs had supposedly hit the asteroids Their
headquarters was Venus Their leadera subject of popular and
fantastic conjecture in the mens audiozineswas rumored to be a
redbearded giant

So Ben reflected you can take a beerandpretzels tale seriously
You can hide for a couple of days get rid of your uniform change your
name You can wait for a chance to get to Venus To hell with your
duty You can try to stay in space even if you exile yourself from
Earth

After all was it right for a single second a single insignificant
second to destroy a mans life and his dream

                                   

He was lucky He found a tramp freighter whose skipper was on his last
flight before retirement Discipline was lax investigation of new
personnel even more so

Ben Curtis made it to Venus

There was just one flaw in his decision He hadnt realized that the
memory of the dead mans face would haunt him torment him follow him
as constantly as breath flowed into his lungs

But might not the rumble of atomic engines drown the murmuring dead
voice Might not the vision of alien worlds and infinite spaceways
obscure the dead face

So now he sat searching for a perhaps nonexistent redbearded giant
and hoping and doubting and fearing all at once

You look for someone senor

He jumped Oh You still here

Oui The Martian kid grinned his mouth full of purple teeth I
keep you company on your first night in Hoover City nestcepas

This isnt my first night here Ben lied Ive been around a while

You are spacemen

Ben threw a fiftycent credit piece on the table Here Take off will
you

Spiderlike fingers swept down upon the coin Ich danke senor You
know why city is called Hoover City

Ben didnt answer

They say it is because after women come they want first thing a
thousand vacuum cleaners for dust What is vacuum cleaner monsieur

Ben raised his hand as if to strike the boy

Aiyee I go You keep listen to good Martian music

The toothpick of a body melted into the semidarkness

Minutes passed There were two more whiskeys A ceaseless parade of
faces broke through the smoky veil that enclosed himreddish balloon
faces scaly reptilian faces whiteskinned sliteyed faces and
occasionally a white rouged powdered face But nowhere was there a
face with a red beard

A sense of hopelessness gripped Ben Curtis Hoover City was but one of
a dozen cities of Venus Each had twenty dives such as this

He needed help

But his picture must have been scoped to Venusian visiscreens A
reward must have been offered for his capture Whom could he trust The
Martian kid perhaps

Far down the darkened aisle nearest him his eyes caught a flash of
white He tensed

Like the uniform of a Security Policeman he thought

His gaze shifted to another aisle and another hint of whiteness

And then he saw another and another and another

Each whiteness became brighter and closer like shrinking spokes of a
wheel with Ben as their focal point

You idiot The damned Martian kid You should have known

                                   

Light showered the room in a dazzling explosion Ben half blinded
realized that a broad circle of unshaded globes in the ceiling had been
turned on

The light washed away the rooms strangeness and its air of brooding
wickedness revealing drab concrete walls and a debrisstrewn floor

Eyes blinked and squinted There were swift frightened movements and
a chorus of angry murmurs The patrons of the Blast Inn were like
tatterclad occupants of a house whose walls have been ripped away

Ben Curtis twisted his lean body erect His chair tumbled backward
falling

The whiteclad men charged neuroclubs upraised

A woman screamed The music ceased The Martian orchestra slunk with
feline stealth to a rear exit Only the giant Venusians remained
undisturbed They stood unmoving their staring eyes shifting lazily in
Bens direction

Curtis one of the policemen yelled Youre covered Hold it

Ben whirled away from the advancing police made for the exit into
which the musicians had disappeared

A hissing sound traveled past his left ear a sound like compressed air
escaping from a container A dimesized section of the concrete wall
ahead of him crumbled

He stumbled forward They were using deadly neuropistols now not the
mildly stunning neuroclubs

Another hiss passed his cheek He was about twelve feet from the exit
Another second his brain screamed Just another second

Or would the exits be guarded

He heard the hiss

It hit directly in the small of his back There was no pain just a
slight pricking sensation like the shallow jab of a needle

                                   

He froze as if yanked to a stop by a noose His body seemed to be
growing swelling into balloon proportions He knew that the tiny
needle had imbedded itself deep in his flesh knew that the paralyzing
mortocain was spreading like icy fire into every fiber and muscle of
his body

He staggered like a man of stone moving in slow motion Hed have
fifteenmaybe twentyseconds before complete lethargy of mind and
body overpowered him

In the dark world beyond his fading consciousness he heard a voice
yell Turn on the damn lights

Then a pressure and a coldness were on his left hand He realized that
someone had seized it

A soft feminine voice spoke to him Youre wounded They hit you

Yes His thick lips wouldnt let go of the word

You want to escapeeven now

Yes

You may die if you dont give yourself up

No no

He tried to stumble toward the exit

All right then Not that way Here this way

Heavy footsteps thudded toward them A few yards away a flashlight
flicked on

Hands were guiding him He was aware of being pushed and pulled A
door closed behind him The glare of the flashlight faded from his
visionif he still had vision

Youre sure the voice persisted

Im sure Ben managed to say

I have no antidote You may die

His mind fought to comprehend With the antiparalysis injection
massage and rest a man could recover from the effects of mortocain
within half a day Without treatment the paralysis could spread to
heart and lungs It could become a paralysis of death An effective
weapon the slightest wound compelled the average criminal to surrender
at once

Anti  anti  The words were as heavy as blobs of mercury forced
from his throat No  Im sure  sure

He didnt hear the answer or anything else

                                   

Ben Curtis had no precise sensation of awakening Return to
consciousness was an intangible evolution from a world of black
nothingness to a dreamlike state of awareness

He felt the pressure of hands on his naked arms and shoulders
hands that massaged manipulated fought to restore circulation and
sensitivity He knew they were strong hands Their strength seemed to
transfer itself to his own body

For a long time he tried to open his eyes His lids felt welded
shut But after a while they opened His world of darkness gave way
to a translucent cloak of mist A round featureless shape hovered
constantly above hima face he supposed

He tried to talk Although his lips moved slightly the only sound was
a deep staccato grunting

But he heard someone say Dont try to talk It was the same gentle
voice hed heard in the Blast Inn Dont talk Just lie still and
rest Everythingll be all right

Everything all right he thought dimly

There were long periods of lethargy when he was aware of nothing There
were periods of light and of darkness Gradually he grew aware of
things He realized that the soft rubber mouth of a spacemans oxygen
mask was clamped over his nose He felt the heat of electric blankets
swathed about his body Occasionally a tube would be in his mouth and
he would taste liquid food and feel a pleasant warmth in his stomach

Always it seemed the face was above him floating in the obscuring
mist Always it seemed the soft voice was echoing in his ears

Swallow this now Thats it You must have food Or Close your
eyes Dont strain It wont be long Youre getting better

Better hed think Getting better

At last after one of the periods of lethargy his eyes opened The
mist brightened then dissolved

He beheld the cracked unpainted ceiling of a small room its colorless
walls broken with a single round window He saw the footboard of his
aluminite bed and the outlines of his feet beneath a faded blanket

Finally he saw the face and figure that stood at his side

You are better the kind voice asked

                                   

The face was that of a girl probably somewhere between twentyfive
and thirty Her features devoid of makeup had an unhealthylooking
pallor as if she hadnt used a sunlamp for many weeks Yet at the
same time her firm slim body suggested a solidity and a strength Her
straight brown hair was combed backward tight upon her scalp and
drawn together in a knot at the nape of her neck

II am better he murmured His words were still slow and thick I
am going to live

You will live

He thought for a moment How long have I been here

Nine days

You took care of me He noted the deep dark circles beneath her
sleeprobbed eyes

She nodded

Youre the one who carried me when I was shot

Yes

Why

Suddenly he began to cough Breath came hard She held the oxygen mask
in readiness He shook his head not wanting it

Why he asked again

It would be a long story Perhaps Ill tell you tomorrow

A new thought cloaked in sudden fear entered his murky consciousness
Tell me willwill I be well again Will I be able to walk

He lay back then panting exhausted

You have nothing to worry about the girl said softly Her cool hand
touched his hot forehead Rest Well talk later

His eyes closed and breath came easier He slept

When he next awoke his gaze turned first to the window There was
light outside but he had no way of knowing if this was morning noon
or afternoonor on what planet

He saw no whitedomed buildings of Hoover City no formal lines of
greentreed parks no streams of buzzing gyrocars There was only a
translucent and infinite whiteness It was as if the window were set on
the edge of the Universe overlooking a solemn silent and matterless
void

The girl entered the room

Hi she said smiling The dark halfmoons under her eyes were less
prominent Her face was relaxed

She increased the pressure in his rubberex pillows and helped him rise
to a sitting position

Where are we he asked

Venus

Were not in Hoover City

No

He looked at her wondering You wont tell me

Not yet Later perhaps

Then how did you get me here How did we escape from the Inn

                                   

She shrugged We have friends who can be bribed A hiding place in the
city the use of a small deserttaxi a pass to leave the citythese
can be had for a price

Youll tell me your name

Maggie

Why did you save me

Her eyes twinkled mischievously Because youre a good astrogator

His own eyes widened How did you know that

She sat on a plain chair beside his bed I know everything about you
Lieutenant Curtis

How did you learn my name I destroyed all my papers

I know that youre twentyfour Born July   Orphaned at four
you attended Boys Town in the Catskills till you were  You graduated
from the Academy at White Sands last June with a major in Astrogation
Your rating for the fiveyear period was the second highest in a
class of fiftyseven Your only low mark in the five years was a  in
History of Martian Civilization Want me to go on

Fascinated Ben nodded

You were accepted as junior astrogation officer aboard the Odyssey
You did well on your flight from Roswell to Luna City In a barroom
fight in Luna City you struck and killed a man named Arthur Cobb a
prefab salesman Youve been charged with second degree murder and
escape A reward of  credits has been offered for your capture
You came to Hoover City in the hope of finding a renegade group of
spacemen who operate beyond Mars You were looking for them in the
Blast Inn

He gaped incredulously struggling to rise from his pillows Idont
get it

There are ways of finding out what we want to know As I told you we
have many friends

He fell back into his pillows breathing hard She rose quickly

Im sorry she said I shouldnt have told you yet I felt so happy
because youre alive Rest now Well talk again soon

Maggie youyou said Id live You didnt say Id be able to walk
again

She lowered her gaze I hope youll be able to

But you dont think I will do you

I dont know Well try walking tomorrow Dont think about it now
Rest

He tried to relax but his mind was a vortex of conjecture

Just one more question he almost whispered

Yes

The man I killeddid he have a wife

She hesitated He thought Damn it of all the questions why did I
ask that

Finally she said He had a wife

Children

Two I dont know their ages

She left the room

                                   

He sank into the softness of his bed As he turned over on his side
his gaze fell upon an object on a bureau in a far corner of the room

He sat straight up his chest heaving

The object was a tridimensional photo of a rockfaced man in a
merchant spacemans uniform He was a giant of a man with a neatly
trimmed red beard

Ben stared at the photo for a long time At length he slipped into
restless sleep Images of faces and echoes of words spun through his
brain

The dead man returned to him Bloodied lips cursed at him Glassy eyes
accused him Somewhere were two lost children crying in the night

And towering above him was a redbearded man whose great hands reached
down and beckoned to him Ben crawled through the night on hands and
knees his legs numb and useless The crying of the children was a
chilling wail in his ears

His head rose and turned to the redbearded man His pleading voice
screamed out to him in a thick harsh cackle Yet even as he screamed
the giant disappeared to be replaced by whitebooted feet stomping
relentlessly toward him

He awoke still screaming

A night without darkness passed Ben lay waiting for Maggies return a
question already formed in his mind

She came and at once he asked Who is the man with the red beard

She smiled I was right then when I gave you that thumbnail biog You
were looking for him werent you

Who is he

She sat on the chair beside him

My husband she said softly

He began to understand And your husband needs an astrogator Thats
why you saved me

We need all the good men we can get

Where is he

She cocked her head in mock suspicion Somewhere between Mercury and
Pluto Hes building a new base for usand a home for me When his
ship returns Ill be going to him

Why arent you with him now

He said unexplored space is no place for a woman So Ive been
studying criminal reports and photos from the Interplanetary Bureau of
Investigation and trying to find recruits like yourself You know how
we operate

He told her the tales hed heard

                                   

She nodded There are quite a few of us nowabout a thousandand a
dozen ships Our base used to be here on Venus down toward the Pole
The dome were in now was designed and built by us a few years ago
after we got pushed off Mars We lost a few men in the construction
but with almost every advance in space someone dies

Venus is getting too civilized Were moving out and this dome is only
a temporary base when we have cases like yours The new baseI might
as well tell you its going to be an asteroid I wont say which one

Dont get the idea that were outlaws Sure about half our group is
wanted by the Bureau but we make honest livings Were just people
like yourself and Jacob

Jacob Your husband

She laughed Makes you think of a Biblical character doesnt it
Jacobs anything but that And just plain Jake reminds one of a
grizzled old uranium prospector and he isnt like that either

She lit a cigarette Anyway the wanted ones stay out beyond the
frontiers Jacob and those like him can never return to Earthnot even
to Hoover Cityexcept dead The others are physical or psycho rejects
who couldnt get clearance if they went back to Earth They know
nothing but rocketing and wont give up They bring in our ships to
frontier ports like Hoover City to unload cargo and take on supplies

Dont the authorities object

Not very strongly The I B I has too many problems right here to
search the whole System for a few twobit crooks Besides we carry
cargoes of almost pure uranium and tungsten and all the stuff thats
scarce on Earth and Mars and Venus Nobody really cares whether it
comes from the asteroids or Hades If we want to risk our lives mining
it thats our business

She pursed her lips But if they guessed how strong we are or that we
have friends planted in the I B Iwell things might be different
There probably would be a crackdown

Ben scowled What happens if there is a crackdown And what will you
do when Space Corps ships officially reach the asteroids They cant
ignore you then

Then we move on We dream up new gimmicks for our crates and take them
to Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto In time maybe well be
pushed out of the System itself Maybe it wont be the whitesuited
boys wholl make that first hop to the stars It could be us you
knowif we live long enough But that Asteroid Belt is murder You
cant follow the textbook rules of astrogation out there You make up
your own

                                   

Ben stiffened And thats why you want me for an astrogator

Maggie rose her eyes wistful If you want to comeand if you get
well She looked at him strangely

Suppose He fought to find the right words Suppose I got well and
decided not to join Jacob What would happen to me Would you let me
go

Her thin face was crisscrossed by emotionalarm then bewilderment
then fear I dont know That would be up to Jacob

He lay biting his lip staring at the photo of Jacob She touched his
hand and it seemed that sadness now dominated the flurry of emotion
that had coursed through her

The only thing that matters really she murmured is your walking
again Well try this afternoon Okay

Okay he said

When she left his eyes were still turned toward Jacobs photo

He was like two people he thought

Half of him was an officer of the Space Corps Perhaps one single
starryeyed boy out of ten thousand was lucky enough to reach that goal

He remembered a little picture book his mother had given him when she
was alive Under the bright pictures of spacemen were the captions

A Space Officer Is Honest A Space Officer Is Loyal A Space
Officer Is Dutiful

Honesty loyalty duty Trite words but without those concepts
mankind would never have broken away from the planet that held it
prisoner for half a million years

Without them Everson after three failures and a hundred men dead
would never have landed on the Moon twentyseven years ago

                                   

Ben sighed He had a debt to pay A good officer would pay that debt
Hed surrender and take his punishment Hed rip the crimson braid from
his uniform Hed prevent the Academy for the Conquest of Space from
being labeled the school of a murderer and a coward

And by doing these things the haunting image of a dead man would
disappear from his vision

But the other half of Ben Curtis was the boy whod stood trembling
beneath a night sky of beckoning stars

The eyes in Jacobs photo seemed to be staring at the boy in him not
at the officer They appeared both pleading and hopeful They were
like echoes of cold barren worlds and limitless space of lurking
and savage death They held the terror of loneliness and of exile of
constant flight and hiding

But too they represented a strength that could fulfill a boys dream
that could carry a man to new frontiers They rather than the neat
white uniform now offered the key to shining miracles That key was
what Ben wanted

But he asked himself as he had a thousand times If I follow Jacob
can I leave the dead man behind

He tried to stretch his legs and he cursed their numbness He smiled
grimly For a moment hed forgotten How futile now to think of stars

What if he were to be like this always Jacob would not want a man
with dead legs Jacob would either send him back to Earth orBen
shudderedsee that he was otherwise disposed of And disposal would be
the easier course

                                   

This was the crisis He sat on the side of the bed Maggie before him
her strong arm about his waist

Afraid she asked

Afraid he repeated shaking

It was as if all time had been funneled into this instant as if this
moment lay at the very vortex of all a mans living and desiring There
was no room in Bens mind for thoughts of Jacob now

You can walk Maggie said confidently I know you can

He moved his toes ankles legs He began to rise slowly falteringly
The firm pressure around his waist increased

He stood erect His legs felt like tree stumps but here and there were
a tingling and a warmth a sensitivity

Can you make it to the window Maggie asked

No no not that far

Try Please try

She guided him forward

His feet shuffled Stomp stomp The pressure left his waist Maggie
stepped away walked to the window turned back toward him

He halted swaying Not alone he mouthed fearfully I cant get
there by myself

Of course you can Maggies voice contained unexpected impatience

Ashamed he forced his feet to move At times he thought he was going
to crash to the floor He lumbered on hesitating fighting to retain
his balance Maggie waited tensely as if ready to leap to his side

Then his eyes turned straight ahead to the window This was the first
time hed actually seen the arid dustcloaked plains of the second
planet He straightened face aglow as though a smallboy enthusiasm
had been reborn in him

His treestump legs carried him to the window He raised shaking hands
against the thick glassite pane

Outside the swirling white dust was omnipresent and unchallenged It
cut smooth the surfaces of dustveiled rocks It clung to the squat
desert shrubbery to the tall skeletal shapes of Venusian needleplants
and to the swishtailed lizards that skittered beneath them

The shrill of wind audible through the glassite was like the
anguished complaint of the planet itself like the wail of an entity
imprisoned in a dark tomb of dust Venus was a planet of fury
eternally howling its wrath at being isolated from sunlight and
greenery from the clean blackness of space and the warm glow of
sisterplanet and star

The dust covered all absorbed all eradicated all The dust was
master The dome Ben felt was as transitory as a teardrop of fragile
glass falling down down to crash upon stone

Is it always like this he asked Doesnt the wind ever stop

Sometimes the wind dies Sometimes at night you can see the lights
from the city

                                   

He kept staring The dome he thought was a symbol of Mans littleness
in a hostile universe

But too it was a symbol of his courage and defiance And perhaps
Mans greatest strength lay in the very audacity that drove him to
build such domes

You like it dont you Maggie asked Its lonely and ugly and wild
but you like it

He nodded breathless

She murmured Jacob used to say it isnt the strange sights that
thrill spacemenits the thoughts that the sights inspire

He nodded again still staring

She began to laugh Softly at first then more loudly It was the kind
of laughter that is close to crying

Youve been standing there for ten minutes Youre going to walk
again Youre going to be well

He turned to her smiling with the joyous realization that he had
actually stood that long without being aware of it

Then his smile died

Standing behind Maggie in an open doorway was a gray scaly toadlike
monstera sixandahalffoot Venusian He was motionless as a statue
his greenlidded eyes staring curiously at Ben His scaly hand was
tight about the butt of an oldfashioned heat pistol holstered to his
hip

Maggie suppressed a smile Dont be frightened Ben This is
SimonSimple Simon we call him His I Q isnt too high but he
makes a good helper and guard for me Hes been so anxious to see you
but I thought itd be better if he waited until you were well

Ben nodded fascinated by the apparent muscular solidity of the
creature It hadnt occurred to his numbed mind that he and Maggie were
not the sole occupants of the dome

But Maggie had acted wisely he thought His nightmares had been
terrifying enough without bringing Simple Simon into them

Shake hands with Ben she told the Venusian

Simple Simon lumbered forward then paused His eyes blinked No he
grated

Maggie gasped Why Simple Simon whats the matter

The gray creature rasped Benhe not one of us He thinksdifferent
In thoughtsthinks escape Earth

                                   

Maggie paled He is one of us Simon She stepped forward and
seized the Venusians arm You go to your room Stand guard You guard
Ben just like you guard me Understand

Simple Simon grunted I guard If Ben goI stop him I stop him
good He raised his huge hands suggestively

No Simon Remember what Jacob told you We hurt no one Ben is our
friend You help him

The Venusian thought for a long moment Then he nodded I help Ben
But if gostop

She led the creature out of the room and closed the door

Whew Ben sighed Id heard those fellows were telepaths Now I
know

Maggies trembling hands reached for a cigarette II guess I didnt
think Ben Venusians cant really read your mind but they see your
feelings your emotions Its a logical evolutionary development
I suppose Auditory and visual communication are difficult here so
evolution turned to empathy And thats why Jacob keeps a few Venusians
in our group They can detect any feeling of disloyalty before it
becomes serious

Ben remembered Simple Simons icy gaze and the way his rough hand had
gripped his heat pistol They could be dangerous

Not really Theyre as loyal as Earth dogs to their masters I mean
they wouldnt be dangerous to anyone whos loyal to us

Silently she helped him back to his bed

Im sorry Maggiesorry I havent decided yet

She neither answered nor looked at him

Grimly he realized that his status had changed He was no longer a
patient he was a prisoner

A Venusian day passed and a Venusian night The dust swirled and wind
blew as constant as the whirl of indecision in Bens mind

Maggie was patient Once when she caught him gazing at Jacobs photo
she asked Not yet

He looked away Not yet

                                   

He learned that the little dome consisted of three rooms each shaped
like pieces of a fluffy pie with narrow concrete hallways between

His room served as a bedroom and he discovered that Maggie slept on a
pneumatic cot in the kitchen The third room opening into the airlock
housed a small hydroponics garden sunlamp shortwave visiradio and
such emergency equipment as oxygen tanks windsuits and vitarations
It was here that Simple Simon remained most of the time tending the
garden or peering into the viewscreen that revealed the terrain outside
the dome

Maggie prepared Bens meals bringing them to him on a tray until he
was able to sit at a table As his paralysis diminished he helped
her with cookingwith Simple Simon standing by as a mute motionless
observer

Occasionally Maggie would talk of her girlhood in a small town in
Missouri and how shed dreamed of journeying to the stars

Stars are for boys theyd tell me but I was a queer one While
other gals were dressing for their junior proms Id be in sloppy
slacks down at the spaceport with Jacob

She laughed oftenperhaps in a deliberate attempt to disguise the
omnipresent tension And her laughter was like laughter on Earth
floating through comfortable houses and over green fields and through
clear blue sky When she laughed she possessed a beauty

Despite her pale face and lack of makeup Ben realized that she was no
older than he

If Id only known her back on Earth he thought If IAnd then he
told himself Youve got enough problems Dont create another one

Finally except for a stiffness in his leg joints hed fully recovered

How much time do I have he asked

Before you decide

Yes

Very little Jacobs ship is on its way Itll be herewell you
cant tell about these things Two or three Earth days maybe even
tomorrow Itll stay in Hoover City long enough to discharge and load
cargo Then itll stop here for us and return toto our new base

What do you think Jacob would do if I didnt want to go with him

                                   

She shook her head You asked me that before I said I didnt know

Ben thought I know a lot about you Jacob I know youre based on an
asteroid I know how many men you have how many ships I know where
this dome is I know you have men planted in the I B I Would you
let me go knowing these things How great is your immunity from the
law Do you love freedom so much that youd kill to help preserve it

Fear crawled through his mind on icy legs

Maggie he said what would Jacob do if he were me

She looked amused Jacob wouldnt have gotten into your situation He
wouldnt have struck Cobb Jacob is

A man And Im still a boy Is that what you mean

Not exactly I think youll be a man after you make your decision

He frowned not liking her answer

You think the dream of going into space is a boys dream that it
cant belong to a man too

Oh no Jacob still has the dream Most of our men do And in a
man its even more wonderful than in a boy Then her face became
more serious Ben youve got to decide soon And its got to be a
complete decision You can have no doubt in your mind

He nodded On account of Simon you mean

She motioned for him to come to the window in his room He gazed
outward following the line of her finger as she pointed

He saw a mansized mound of stones dimly visible beneath the
windwhipped dust

A grave

He was a man like you Maggie said softly God knows Simon didnt
try to kill him But he was escaping Hehe made the decision not to
join us Simon sensed it There was a struggle Simons handswell he
doesnt realize

She didnt have to explain further Ben knew what those mighty scaly
paws could do

                                   

The moments were now like bits of eternity cloaked in frozen fear
Somewhere in the blackness of interplanetary space Jacobs rocket was
streaking closer and closer to Venus How far away was it A million
miles Fifty thousand Or was it nowright nowripping through the
murky Venusian atmosphere above the dome

A complete decision Maggie had said

Jacob didnt want a potential deserter in his group And you couldnt
pretend that you were loyal to Jacobnot with monstrosities like
Simple Simon about

Soon Jacob not Ben might have to make a decisiona decision that
could result in a second cairn of stones on the windswept desert

Ben shivered

Before retiring he wandered nervously into the supply room Maggie
was poised over the visiradio Simple Simon was intently scanning the
nightshrouded terrain in the viewscreen

Any news Ben asked Maggie

The girl grunted negatively without looking up

Bens gaze fell upon the array of oxygen masks windsuits
vitarations Then on a littered shelf he spied a small Venusian
compass

Almost automatically his hand closed over it His brain stirred with
a single thought A compass could keep a man traveling in a straight
line

Simple Simon restlessly shifted He turned to Ben blinking in the
frighteningly alien equivalent of a suspicious scowl

Bens hand tightened about the compass He tried to relax to force all
thought of it from his mind He stared at the viewscreen concentrating
on the ceaseless drift of dust

The Venusians eyes studied him curiously as if searching his mind for
the illusive echo of a feeling that had given him alarm

I think Ill turn in yawned Ben Night Maggie

Simon frowned apparently frustrated in his mental search Bennot
one of us Iwatch

                                   

Without answering Ben returned to his room the compass hot and moist
from the perspiration in his hand

He took a deep breath

Why had he taken the compass He wasnt sure Perhaps he reflected
his decision had already been made deep beneath the surface of
consciousness

He stood before the window peering into the night He knew that to
attempt to sleep was futile Sleep for the past few days an everready
friend had become a hostile stranger

God his brain cried what shall I do

Slowly the dust outside the window settled The scream of wind was no
longer audible His startled eyes beheld dim faraway lightsthose of
Hoover City he guessed

It was as if for the space of a few seconds some cosmic power had
silenced the Venusian fury had guided him toward making his decision

He whipped up his compass He barely had time to complete the
measurement

Sixtyeight degrees he read Northeast by east

Fresh wind descended onto the plain Dancing dust erased the vision of
the lights

Sixtyeight sixtyeight he kept muttering

But now there was nothing to doexcept try to sleep and be ready

Strong hands shook him out of restless sleep He opened his eyes and
saw complete darkness He thought at first that his eyesight had failed

Ben Wake up Maggies voice came to him crisp commanding The
rockets coming Ive decoded the message We only have a few minutes

The girl snapped on a small bulkhead light She left him alone to dress

He slid out of bed a drowsiness still in him He reached for his
clothing Abruptly the full implication of what she had said struck
him

Jacobs rocket was coming This was the time for decision yet within
his taut body there was only a jungle of conflicting impulses

                                   

Maggie returned her face hard her eyes asking the silent question

Ben stood frozen The slow seconds beat against his brain like waves of
ice

At last she said Ready Ben She spoke evenly but her searching
gaze belied the allimportant significance of her words

In the dim light the photograph of Jacob was indistinguishable but
Ben could still see the image of the dead man

He thought I cant run away with Jacob like a selfish cowardly kid
No matter how bright the stars would be that brightness couldnt
destroy the image of a dead man with staring eyes No matter what Jacob
and Simon do to me Ive got to try to get back to Earth

He suddenly felt clean inside He was no longer ashamed to hold his
head high

Maggie he said

Yes

Ive made my decision

Outside the window a waterfall of flame cascaded onto the desert
pushing aside the dust and the darkness The deepthroated sound of
rocket engines grumbled above the whining wind The floor of the dome
vibrated

The rockets here Maggie cried

The flaming exhaust from the ship dissolved into the night The rocket
thunder faded into the wind

The alarm on the domes inner airlock bulkhead rang Maggie ran like a
happy child through the concrete corridor Ben following She bounded
into the supply room pushed Simple Simon aside stopped before a
control panel Her fingers flew over switches and levers

The airlock door slid open A short stubblebearded man clad in
windsuit and transparalite helmet stomped in He unscrewed the face
plate of his helmet His ears were too big and he looked like a fat
doll

Were ready for you Mrs Pierce he said

Maggie nodded eagerly She whirled back to Ben Hurry Get your
helmet and suit on

She spun back to the bigeared little man Cargo unloaded All set for
the flight home

Home Ben thought She calls a place shes never seen home

Cargos unloaded

No trouble with the I B I No investigation

Not yet Were good for a few more hauls I guess

                                   

Ben slipped on his windsuit He glanced at the control panel for the
airlock Yes he could manipulate it easily He contemplated the heat
pistol at Simple Simons hip A tempting ideabut no he wanted no
more of violence

Then he bit his lip He cleared his mind of all thought

Simple Simon evidently had not noted the impulse that flicked his
adrenals into pumping

The bigeared man stared strangely at Maggie Mrs Pierce before we
go Id better tell you something

You can do that on the rocket

Maggie stepped forward to seize her helmet The man blocked her
movement

Mrs Pierce your husbandJacobwas on the rocket

What The girl released a broken unbelieving little laugh Why he
wouldnt dare That idiot taking a chance like Alarm twisted her
features Hehe wasnt captured

No he wasnt captured And he took no chance Mrs Pierce

A moment of silence Then she sucked in her breath

Ben understood Words echoed in his mind Jacob and those like him can
never return to Earth not even to Hoover Cityexcept dead

Maggie swayed Ben and the bigeared little man jumped to her side
guided her back into the compartment used as a kitchen They helped her
to a chair Ben turned on the fire beneath a coffee pot Simple Simon
watched silently

Her eyes empty and staring Maggie asked How did it happen

We were heading into a clump of baby asteroids the size of peas The
radar warning was too slow We couldnt pull away we had to stop The
deceleration got himcrushed him He lived for five minutes afterward

The little man produced a folded paper from a pocket of his suit
Jacob said he had some ideas he had to get down on paper God knows
why but during those five minutes he drew up this plan for improving
our deceleration compensator

Plans for she gasped

He was a spaceman Mrs Pierce The man handed her the paper Ben
caught a glimpse of scribbled circuits relays cathodes

When he finished the man continued he said to tell you that he
loved you

She started to hand the paper back

The spaceman shook his head No the original is yours Ive made
copies for our own ships and for the brass in Hoover City

                                   

Maggie kept talking to the little man lost in the world he was
creating for her Ben was excluded from that world a stranger

Then Ben saw his opportunity

Simple Simons face was expressionless but tears were zigzagging down
his gray reptilian features Ben stared for several seconds wondering
if his vision had deceived him Till this instant hed somehow assumed
that the big Venusian was devoid of emotion

But Simple Simon was crying

It was unlikely that the creature would peer into his mind at a moment
like this

Step by step Ben backed toward the open door in the rear of the
compartment Silently he slipped through it He attempted to move
automatically without feeling

He darted into the supply room The continued drone of voices told him
his action had not been observed

He didnt like it at all Escaping this way was like crumpling Maggies
grief into an acid ball and hurling it into her face But he had no
other choice

A few seconds later he was dressed in windsuit and oxygen helmet A
can of vitarations was strapped to his back and his compass was in his
hand

Heart refusing to stop pounding he threw the levers and switches to
open the airlock He cringed under the grinding scraping noise as
loud to him as the ringing clash of swords

But the murmur of voices continued

He stepped outside The airlock door clanged shut He was caught by the
biting dust and the shrill banshee wind He fell then scrambled erect

To his right he saw the silver sheen of Jacobs rocket shining behind
a row of golden eyelike portholes Beneath it were black outlines of
moving helmeted figures

He bent low to study the luminous dial of his compass

Behind him was a grating and a sliding of metal A movement in the
darkness

He turned

Dimly illuminated by the glow from the rocket ports was the grim stony
face of Simple Simon

                                   

The Venusian was like a piece of the night itself compressed and
solidified to form a living creature The impression was contradicted
only by the glowing whiteness of his eyes

The reptilian body shuffled forward The scales on his great face
and chest reflected the lights from the rocket like Christmas tree
ornaments dusted with gold

His hands reached out

Words thundered in Bens memory God knows Simon didnt try to kill
him Simons handswell he doesnt realize

Ben hopped away from the groping hands slipped the compass into his
pocket balled his fists The wind caught at his body He stumbled
then recovered his balance

Despite the wind and his suits bulkiness he was surprised at his own
agility He recalled that the gravitational pull of Venus was only
fourfifths of Earths That was an advantage

Crouching against the wind he stepped to his left away from the
rocket He was reluctant to enter an area of greater darkness but
neither did he want to risk observation by the men hed seen near
Jacobs ship

Simple Simon followed He moved like an automaton functioning with
awkward methodical slowness His hands speckled with reflected light
rose up out of the darkness

Ben stepped back wiped the dust from his clouded faceplate One swoop
of those hands he knew could shatter his helmet destroy his oxygen
supply leave him choking on deadly methane and carbon dioxide

But so far Simon seemed bent on capture not destruction That fact
gave Ben a second advantage

Scaly fingers moving now with greater swiftness closed over the
shoulder of his suit Ben felt himself being pulled forward a child
in the grasp of a giant His brief surge of confidence vanished Cold
terror swept upon him

He lashed out wildly His right fist found his target found it so well
that the skin split on his gloved knuckles

Simons head snapped back The grasping fingers slipped from Bens suit

But still the Venusian lumbered ahead an irresistible juggernaut the
hands continually groping Ben ducked and slipped aside The can of
vitarations was ripped from his back

He crouched low fighting the wind maneuvering for another blow
His lungs ached but he had no opportunity to increase his helmets
oxygen flow His weak leg muscles were beginning to pain as though with
needles of fire

                                   

The hands crashed down upon his shoulders This time his fist found
Simons stomach The creature released a grunt audible above the
howling of wind His body doubled up

Ben struck again and again His lungs throbbed as if theyd break
through his chest A fresh layer of dust coated his faceplate nearly
blinding him He fought instinctively gauntleted fists battering

Simple Simon fell

Ben brushed away the dust from his faceplate turned up his helmets
oxygen valve Then he knelt by the fallen creature

A new fear came to Ben Curtisa fear almost as great as that of being
caught in Simons crushing grip It was the fear that he had killed
again

But even in the neardarkness he could distinguish the labored rise
and fall of the massive chest

Thank God he thought

From the direction of Jacobs ship a flash of light caught his eye
The black shapes of helmeted men were becoming larger nearer

Ben tensed The spacemen couldnt have heard sounds of the struggle
but they might have noticed movement

Puffing Ben plunged into the darkness to his left slowing only long
enough to consult the dial of his compass

Sixtyeight degrees he breathed

The compass dial was now his only companion and his only hope It was
the one bit of reality in a world of black screaming nightmare

                                   

At first Ben Curtis fought the wind and the dust and the night His
fists were clenched as they had been while struggling with Simon Each
step forward was a challenge a struggle andso far at any ratea
victory

But how far was the city Five miles Ten How could you judge distance
through a haze of alien sand

And were Simple Simon or Jacobs men following How good was a
Venusians vision at night Would the scaly hands find him even now
descending on him from out of the blackness

He kept walking walking Sixtyeight degrees

Gradually his senses grew numb to the fear of recapture He became
oblivious to the wailing wind and the beat of dust against his
faceplate He moved like a robot His mind wandered back through time
and space a pinwheel spinning with unforgettable impressions faces
voices

He saw the white features of a dead man their vividness fading now and
no longer terrifying

A Space Officer Is Honest A Space Officer Is Loyal A Space Officer
Is Dutiful The words were like clear satisfying music

He cursed at the image of a popeyed Martian boy A tres fine table
monsieur Close in the shadows

And yet he told himself the boy really didnt do anything wrong He
was only helping to capture a murderer Maybe he was lonesome for Mars
and needed money to go home

Ben thought of Maggie While other gals were dressing for their junior
proms Id be in sloppy slacks down at the spaceport with Jacob If
Id only known her back on Earth

Maggie sitting alone now with a wrinkled paper and its mass of
scrawled circuits Alone and hollow with grief and needing help Bens
throat tightened Damn it he didnt want to think about that

What was it the little bigeared man had said Ive made copies for
our own ships and for the brass in Hoover City

Why had he said that Why would renegades give their secrets to the
Space Corps The Corps would incorporate the discoveries in their
ships With them theyd reach the asteroids Jacobs group would be
pushed even further outward

Ben stopped the wind whipping at his suit and buffeting his
helmetbut not as hard as the answer he had found

                                   

Jacob and his men had an existence to justify a debt to pay They
justified that existence and paid that debt by helping humanity in its
starward advance

Maggie had said We carry cargoes of almost pure uranium and tungsten
and all the stuff thats getting scarce on Earth and Mars and Venus If
we want to risk our lives getting it thats our business The dome
were in now was designed and built by us a few years ago We lost a
few men in the construction but with almost every advance in space
someone dies

The wind pressed Ben back The coldness of the Venusian night was
seeping into his suit It was as if his body were bathed at once in
flame and ice

He slipped fell his face turned toward the sandy ground He did not
try to rise

Yet his mind seemed to soar above the pain to carry him into a
wondrous valley of new awareness

Man would never be content to stay on nine insignificant globesnot
when his eyes had the power to stare into a night sky and when his
brain had the ability to imagine There would have to be pioneers to
seek out the unknown horror to face it and defeat it There would have
to be signposts lining the great road and helping others to follow
without fear

For all the brilliancy of their dreams those men would be the lonely
ones the men of no return For all the glory of their brief adventure
they would give not only their cloaks but ultimately their lives

Ben lay trembling in the darkness

His brain cried You couldnt rig up a radar system or a deceleration
compensator but you could chart those asteroids You cant bring a man
named Cobb back to life but you could help a thousand men and women to
stay alive five or ten or twenty years from now

Ben knew at last what decision Jacob would have made

The reverse of sixtyeight on a compass is twofortyeight

                                   

Like flashing knitting needles strong hands moved about his
faceplate his windsuit his helmet Then they were wiping
perspiration from his white face and placing a wet cloth on the back of
his neck

You were coming back a voice kept saying You were coming back

His mouth was full of hot coffee He became aware of a gentle face
hovering above him just as it had a seeming eternity ago

He sat up on the bed conscious now of his surroundings

Simon says you were coming back Ben Why

He fought to grasp the meaning of Maggies words Simon Simon found
me He brought me back

Only a short way He said you were almost here

Ben closed his eyes reliving the whirlwind of thought that had whipped
through his brain He mumbled something about pioneers and a scrawled
paper and a debt and a decision

Then he blinked and saw that he and Maggie were not alone Simple Simon
stood at the foot of his bedand was that a trace of a smile on his
reptilian mouth And three windsuited spacemen stood behind Maggie
helmets in their hands One was a leanboned reddishskinned Martian

Simple Simon said Benchanged Thinkslike us Good now
LikeJacob

The little bigeared man stepped up and shook hands with Ben If Simon
says so thats good enough for me

A blondhaired Earthman helped Ben from the bed Legs okay fellow
Think youre ready

Ben stood erect unassisted Legs okay And Im ready

He thought for a moment But suppose I wasnt ready Suppose I didnt
want to go with you I know a lot about your organization What would
you do

The blond man shrugged untroubledly We wouldnt kill you if thats
what you mean Wed probably vote on whether to take you with us anyway
or let you go His smile was frank Im glad we dont have to vote

Ben nodded and turned to Maggie Youre still coming with us

She shook her head a mist shining in her sad eyes Not on this trip
Not without Jacob Ill get one of our desert taxis back to Hoover
City Then Ill be going to Earth for a while Ive got some thinking
to do and thinking is done best on Earth Out here is the place for
feeling Her eyes lost a little of their pain But Ill be back
Jacob wouldnt stay on Earth Neither will I Ill be seeing you

The bigeared man put his hand on Bens shoulder

Think you can get us back to Juno he asked

Ben looked at Maggie and then at the bigeared man Youre as good as
there he said confidently
