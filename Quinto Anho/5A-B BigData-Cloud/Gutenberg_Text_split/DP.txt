    Once upon a time life was perfection Government made sure its
    citizens were supplied with every comfort and pleasure But

BY ARTHUR DEKKER SAVAGE


Allen Kinderwood slowed his pace so his forelock would quit bobbing The
damn thing wasnt supposed to bob it was supposed to be a sort of
peaked crest above rugged handsome featuresa dark lock brushed
carelessly aside by a man who had more important things to do than fuss
with personal grooming But no matter how carefully he combed it and
applied lustoset it always bobbed if he walked too fast

But then why should it matter now He wasnt looking for a woman
tonight Not when his appointment with the Social Adjustment counsellors
was tomorrow morning and he would get a Departure Permit Should get
one he corrected himself But he had never heard of a petition for a DP
being refused

He wanted to spend his last night in the city over here in the main park
of C Sector walking in the restless crowds trying to settle his
thoughts He moved through slow aimless eddies of brightly appareled
citizens avoiding other pedestrians skaters and the heavy
fourwheeled autoscooters Everything was dully uncompromisingly the
same as in his own sector even to the size and spacing of the huge
spreading trees He had hoped without conviction that there might be
some tiny refreshing differenceanything but the mindsapping
sameness that had driven him to the petition

Illustration

Allen was careful not to brush against any girl with an escort Since he
wasnt on the make what would be the use of fighting Kind of an odd
feeling though to know youd never date or fight again or  Or
what What else was there to do if you hadnt the luck to be a jobman
or a tech You ate and slept and preened and exercised and found
what pleasure you could and fought mostly because it was momentarily
stimulating and eventually after a hundred and fifty years or so you
died

Unless you were a tech If you were a tech Government gave you stuff to
keep you alive longer A jobman got a somewhat different dealhe got
nothing to keep him alive abnormally because ninety percent of Earths
population was waiting for his job anyway

Allen skirted a huge fountain throwing colored scintillant spray high
into the dark summer sky stealing a glance backward over his shoulder
That girl was still behind him Following him It wouldnt be anything
new in his caseespecially in his own sectorbut maybe she just
happened to be going his way

It would be easy to find out He circled the fountain twice With her
looks she should have been picked up before shed left her compartment
building blockexcept that whoever got her might have to fight more
than once during the evening to hold her Definitely a young mans
darling

And the way it began to look definitely Allens darling On the second
trip around she had backtracked to meet him face to faceher purpose
obvious

He tried to dodge but there was no way it could be done without insult
Damn

Hi brute Nedda Marsh Alone She ran soft hands along the hard
biceps under his short jacket sleeves The motion threw open her
shriekingly bright orange cloak displaying saucy breasts creamy
abdomen and beneath her brief jeweled skirt long smooth thighs And
the perfume assailed his nostrils with almost physical force

Hi Nedda Allen Kinderwood Alone natch Natch hell But what could
any male do to combat Government perfume He smiled his pulse suddenly
quickening Date darling She was a beautiful thing

Her large sparkling eyes showed pleasure Take me Al She touched
vivid red lips lightly against his And the formula was complete
Private citizens Allen Kinderwood and Nedda Marsh were dated at least
until dawnor a better man did them part

He squeezed her arm where shed snuggled it against his side starting
with her away from the fountain How come the most gorgeous thing in
Kansas City wasnt dated earlier

She looked up at him and the passion in her gaze made his heart skip
like a teeners Could be Im very particular darling but her look
was suddenly beseeching the truth is Im protected

A slow tiny fire of distaste fanned itself alive in Allens brain Why
in the name of World Government did every other girl who made first play
with him have to be protected But there was his out By unwritten
social code he could declare the date off Except that he had grown to
increasingly hate the spiteful practice of protection It meant Nedda
had peeved some local lothario who along with other males in his
clique was going to damn well see she wasnt intimate with anyone else
until she begged another date with the original one If you had a
sadistic turn of mind it meant you could keep a delectable bit in
freeze until her natural inclinations forced her into your arms But
youd have to fight any man who tried to date her in the meantime

Fighting was legal of course as long as the loser was surgically
repairable and it was considered a normal catharsis for strained
relationships between males

Not Allen thought glumly that he had any stake in the future of
frantically weary society but he had reached the conclusion long ago
that a man without the courage to back up his personal convictions
wasnt worth the energy it took to down him

He stopped and held Nedda against him protectively I still want the
date sprite he said I have to leave early tomorrow but Ill try
to get you out of protectionokay

Her lips trembled Oh yes If you knew how its been these last few
days

He shook her again but more tenderly Deal Well try to reach your
compartment Living quarters were a sanctuary no one but a medic could
legally enter without invitation He removed his stainless
identification plaque and slipped its chain about her throat If you
see any of the guys whore watching for you tell me but dont look at
them He took her arm again and alertly began to work through the
throng Describe your protector

Jeff NealHayne Hes big Al Bigger than you Heavier but youve got
muscles like he never saw You look faster too

Allen didnt know him but the name was revealing Not that anything but
your Earth society number was official but use of a double surname
meant your father had elected to stay with your mother for at least a
while after you were born Most babies of course were immediately
turned over to a Government creche but it had always seemed to Allen
that kids raised by one or more parents had other advantages too
although he had never been able to figure out just what they were Maybe
it was only his imagination

                                   

At the edge of the park they chose the nearest double scooter which
showed full battery charge

Allen leaned against the forward rail Herd it will you Nedda Every
time I think of the hundreds of hours Ive spent plowing air with one of
these gutweighted things I want to break one Hell I can run faster
Anyway you know where were going

The girl smiled pushed the power lever into forward range and steered
into slowmoving traffic I saw a man lift a single once but thats
all he was able to do with it

The lighted street seemed intensely bright after the dimmer reaches of
the park Ever think of running one into the river

She looked at him in amazement Fright no Whyyoud have to drive
along a pedestrian path for at least a block to reach the bank Nedda
spun the steering wheel to avoid a long string of solemn teeners playing
follow the leader on singles You have funny thoughts Al

Im laughing He flexed his muscles impatient as usual with another
citizens sluggish mentation I suppose the damn music never gets on
your nerves either

Music Ohthe music She listened as though for the first time to the
muted strains which played continuously throughout the citycalming
soothing lulling Of course not Why should it

Theyve got it synchronized said Allen Governments got it
synchronized so you hear it just the same volume no matter where you are
outside You have to listen to it

Darling your boredoms showing

He squeezed her hand reassuringly Dont let me spin you lovely Ive
got the answer

Oh

Yeah I applied for a DP this morning

Alno

Why not He put it like the needle thrust of a fighting knife daring
her to find a reason half hoping she could

I She glanced at him once quickly then away Then she drew a deep
breath and let it sigh out How about Mars Al There arent many
service machines and they even let women do lots of little detailed
things I almost went once

He was watching her shrewdly Why didnt you He had fought this one
out with himself before

OhI dont know Just never did

Ill tell you why you really didnt Itd be too different When the
Government provides every convenience every comfort you can think of
here you cant stand having to work in a mine with an oxygen helmet
stuffed into heavy clothes You cant stand the danger and the fearand
somehow inside you must know it Im pretty strong and I never met a
man I was afraid of but I know I couldnt stand Mars He gripped the
rail and stared out over the wide swarming street But Earth is a
trap Nedda A big comfortable trap where you walk around endlessly
without being any use at all

She trod the brake and barely missed bumping a couple who had stopped to
embrace Im some use hon Waitll we get home Her eyes held a
promise she could barely restrain

Automatically he caressed her with a practiced handand grabbed the
wheel when she suddenly strained against him trembling pressing eager
lips against his neck

Christ how long had she been protected He felt a mounting anger
against the social ennui which drove mens minds to such inhuman
activity Departure was the only escape from this kind of thing and
from the cityfrom any city

But the Departees had always been only a tiny minority Did that mean
theyand hewere wrong He brooded about it for seemingly the googolth
time guiding the scooter without conscious thought turning as Nedda
directed

A trap hed told her Well he could see no reason to change that The
blazingly glorious sensotheaters cafes gymnasiums dancing salons
amusement rides and hypnodream houses crowding every main thoroughfare
with their fantastically ornate architecture werewhen you thought
about itdesigned to trap peoples minds keep them from thinking of
anything but a gossamer useless pursuit of personal pleasure And
wasnt the design faulty when everyone was bored when some chose
Departure and others sank to the unnatural practice of protection to
whet their sated appetites

Nor was there any apparent hope for the future Theatre productions
dream tapes even the elaborate home teleview shows were all historical
Why Was Government admitting there was nothing but staleness in the
present Why the concern with backtime

Because of Government entertainment diet Allen could probably with a
bit of practice fish skillfully from an outrigger make and use a
longbow expertly run a store profitably in the Money Ages weave cloth
correctly build complete wooden housesoh any number of ancient
things

But he couldnt even talk the same language as the relative handful of
trained men who built and operated the unbelievably intricate
robomachinery which activated and maintained the complex cities of
Earth

                                   

Neddas soft voice broke into his thoughts AlDan Halgersens coming
up behind us on a single Hes one of Jeffs

Hold on Allen swung the scooter hard right and adroitly darted across
traffic toward an emblazoned theatre entrance Here now was a
situation he knew how to deal with He said rapidly out of the side of
his mouth Jump off when I stop at the entry and kiss me like goodby
Register your plaque in the ID slot and head for the doorthen look
back If Im down go on in and lose yourself If hes down come back

He made a wrenching stop at the very edge of the crowd swung Nedda
through the opening between front and side rails and gave her a hard
sterile kiss

She clung to him a moment Without letting her eyes stray she said
Slowing down right behind you Luck lover Then she turned and
started to pick her way across the walk

Allen swung the scooter in a fast tight circle to the left Assuming
his opponent to be righthanded this would help avoid a knife slash
from the rear if the other rammed his scooterfurther assuming the man
had not been tricked into thinking his presence was unnoticed

He hadnt When Allen whipped his head around to look at him there was
barely time to brake the heavier double to avoid a shrewdly planned
collision Halgersen Nedda had said He was thickset with heavy brows
and large jaw The type Allen had learned to associate with power and
endurance but not too much speed

Halgersen was holding a knife in his right hand Allen quickly slipped
his own blade from the sheath conveniently held at the front of his
belt They cut intricate patterns of feint attack and withdraw using
passing vehicles as buffers But not for long

A voice from the crowd called Fight and space grew miraculously
about the combatants leaving a huge clearing in the street rimmed
solidly with scooters and pedestrians A few shouts of encouragement
began to be heard as individuals selected one or the other of the men as
a likely winner

Allen dodged a sudden attempt at a sideswipe collision and the
attendant vicious swipe of Halgersens bladeand then drew first blood
by a lightning riposte to the arm Legal knife target was arm leg
abdomen and a forehead cut without thrustwhich would obscure vision
with blood without doing organic damage

The bright yellow luminescence of a police copter dropped and hovered as
Allen tried to follow up his momentary advantage The scene he knew
would now be simultaneously filmed for possible legal record and
broadcast on all teleview news programs Entertainment for adults
education for the teeners

A feminine voice in the front ranks called Two stunts to one on green
jacket and was immediately taken up by another girl near by

He had little time to think with satisfaction that no female had ever
been forced to pay off a bet of some ingeniously embarrassing public
behavior on his account Halgersen was now trying to maneuver him for a
straight ram which would bring them definitely together He wasnt being
weakened by the slow drip of blood from his arm and he didnt seem to be
bothered by pain

And then they were close to the circle rim Allen swung his scooter so
the cooling downdraft from the coptercoming from above the center of
the cleared areawas directly against his back a method he had devised
for knowing his position without having to take his eyes from a close
opponent He let his shoulders droop suddenly as though he was tired
and at the murmur of disappointment from many onlookers he began to back
slowly away from Halgersen

The bluejacketed figure rolled into the trap scowling He tried again
for a headon ram Allen let him come and at the last possible instant
when Halgersen would be unable to reverse stop or even swerve he
flipped the bar to full power ahead And braced himself accordingly

The scooters met with a bonejarring thud of perimeter rubber Halgersen
was hurled neatly over his own guard rail to land gaspingly across
Allens

Allen grasped the back of the others belt in a grip that had dismayed
many a combatant hauled him into position and hamstrung both legs with
two dextrous thrustandcut movements It took but a moment longer to
leap above a desperate slash at his own legs drag the heavier man to
the thick floor of the scooter and render him unconscious with a
stamping kick of one sandaled heel It left an easy repair job for the
medics but would keep one Dan Halgersen from fighting again for more
than a weekand maybe make him think twice about joining in another
protection pact

Allen leaped up and balanced on two guard rails while the police copter
settled down to pick up Halgersen He signaled Nedda to move on along
the walkway

While the onlookers were clapping approval of the show he removed
Halgersens plaque leaped down and dodged an attempted kiss from the
girl who had given odds on himglancing back warily in case her escort
felt insultedthen pushed through the mob to join Nedda

She hugged his arm ecstatically Darling every woman should have a guy
like you

Yeah He felt no sense of triumph It had happened too many times
before Everything had happened too many times beforerepetitive
palling and purposeless He tucked the won plaque into her decorative
belt It was Neddas proof that protection was ended and Halgersen
would have to call for it accompanied by a witness

Where the hell is your place he asked For a moment he wondered why
he didnt just turn abruptly and leave her social mores
notwithstanding Then Neddas perfume began its chemical magic again
and he carefully straightened his jacket and set his forelock in its
proper place

                                   

Nedda he accused lazily youre a nymph Ever tried
psychoconditioning

She gave him a tender lingering kiss and burrowed more comfortably in
his arms Not yet darling Would you prefer me lessresponsive

Allen patted her as carefully as possible to show approval without
arousing her again No man would But it must be rough between dates
isnt it And just why should he be worrying about anyone else at this
stage of the game Maybe he wasnt Maybe he was just curious now that
it no longer mattered

She avoided his eyes in the cool semigloom of the compartment
Iusually manage to have enough dates Until some moron like
NealHayne puts me under protection

He disengaged himself gently rolled off the pliant couch and increased
the rooms light with the wall knob You should register a complaint
Nedda After three hell be forcibly psyched you know He dialed the
servoconsole and focused a morning meal menu on the viewscreen Ready
for breakfast pip

Mmmif you are Nedda came over and lifted the phone from its panel
recess That number six algal protein is supposed to be a new taste
sensation Like

He shrugged Lets try it Itll be my last go at this robot feed

When the meals had been deposited in the service chute she looked at him
pleadingly Hon why dont you try being psyched They could make you
satisfied withthings as they are

Allen lifted a thin transparent food cover while he shook his head
Maybe they could Nedda But it would have to be almost total erasure
to change my slant on everything and being forced to accept what I hate
is worse than anything else I can think of It wouldnt be me when they
got through Whatever causes me to think like I do is the me and
thatd be gone

Some of the resentful animosity surged up in him and he had to talk
about it Look at your compartment The same as every other single in
the cityor any city The walls are the shade of green thats best for
the eyes Furniture and fixtures are always the same colors Every
compartment has a servoconsole to condition the air control the
temperature and humidity bring you food or any other standard service
provide teleview shows music or requests You could live your life
inside this square hole Everybody has everything and nothing means
anythingcant you see that

She came around the table and sat on his lap with her head against his
neck No presh but if youll change your mind about a DP you can date
me any time always Id like to share a double with you forever

He traced soothing circles on her smooth back with his fingertips
Thats the closest Ive ever come to owning anything he mused

But hon Government owns everything and takes care of everything When
you can always use a thing how could it be better if you owned it

Allen held her against him tightly fighting the old fight to find
words How could you explain how you felt things to be right or wrong
without really knowing the reasons

Maybe he said slowly its as though I wanted to keep you for myself
alone But Nedda if another man made the right approach could you
refuse him After a minute he repeated Could you

Eventually she made two answers

They were warm and wet and dropped onto his chest

                                   

The Adjustment Building was a soaring chastely white structure of
silicoid plastic dazzling in the hot morning sun It crossed Allens
mind fleetingly that everything built nowadays would long outlast the
builders That seemed right but he didnt know why

He took his ID plaque from Nedda and kissed her He had tried to
dissuade her from coming with him but she had merely smiled and held
his arm and urged him toward a double scooter

This is it beautiful he said shortly at the entrance And with an
attempt at levity Dont take any more protection Actually what
could you say He went inside quickly without looking back

At the door marked Kansas City Department of Social Adjustment he
slipped his plaque into the correct slot for a moment and was admitted
directly to the waiting room for those who had appointments for the day

There was only one other waitinga handsome blond youth whose knife was
new Allen sat down in a lounge chair across the room

And Nedda came in and sat down beside him

He could have understood almost anything but that How in the name of
fear

Do you think she said mischievously taking his hand the B Sector
champ is the only one who can get an appointment

Before it could more than flash through Allens mind that hed not told
her that the blond youth was standing before them his eyes hotly on
Nedda Then obviously confused that she was already holding hands he
addressed himself to Allen as though it was what he had intended doing

Marty Bowen sir UhIm going to see if theyll let me have a double
compartment with some gym apparatus in it He shifted his weight to the
other foot and hung a thumb nervously in his belt unable to keep from
darting glances at Nedda

Allen noted with rising anger and some other unpleasant emotion he
couldnt define that she hadnt dropped her eyes He said curtly
Fine kidhope you make it The youth mumbled something else and went
back to his chair

He had barely seated himself when a voder speaker crooned a number
melodiously With a quick backward glance at Nedda the blond lad went
on into the counsel room

Allens mind remained in confusion shot through with anger at himself
that he should waste thoughts now on anything but the coming interview
The room was beginning to fill quietly with others

His number was called a few minutes later

And Neddas was called along with it

Wellthe place to get the answer was the counsel chamber He got up
slowly barely noticing that Nedda continued to hold his hand as they
went in

The brilliant room was two stories high with fluted walls and no
windows Obviously the size was to impress interviewees But why should
they have to be impressed Wasnt the wisdom of the five tech doctors
sufficient by itself Wasnt it

He sat in a chair indicated by the darkskinned one and listened while
the very old one in the center talked to Nedda

Had dating the B Sector park champion solved her difficulty with the man
she had reported Fine It was the second such report about him in a
yearthe other also coming from a girl who was highly sexed Did Nedda
not consider herself to have a problem which required psychoconditioning
No Well perhaps in later years when her beauty and her mind were
somewhat changed No there would seem to be no justification for
giving her a compartment in another sector unless she had persuaded the
champion or another to share a double with her Would that be all Much
happiness to her

Abruptly Allen realized Nedda had left and that the frail old man was
talking to him

 unusual to have joint interviews without a more definite emotional
tie but we felt you would like to know how you had rendered civic aid

So pitting him without choice against any of several men was their idea
of civic aid No wonder hed met so many protected girls in the past
This time theyd harnessed Neddas restless passion to the task of
dissuading him from a DP Very neat

It made him feel better to know theyd failed where he was concerned
and his resentment abated somewhat He said Glad I could help
careful to keep his voice emotionless Then determined to have no
further subtleties If I can have my departure permit I wont trouble
you further

Maybe his approach wasnt right but all they could do would be to
refuse him In which case there were other waysand the hell with
legality

We hope smiled the old doctor benignly there may be another way
Perhaps if we discuss your problem we can find a solution which wont
cost the city a handsome young citizen

Allen made it a direct attack Why should the city miss any citizen In
fact what good is the city itselfwhat good is any city

And almost the techs seemed startled But a younger one said easily A
city Mr Kinderwood permits a maximum of efficient service and
pleasure with a minimum of waste and discomfort

Allen leaned back and stubbornly folded his arms Ive had enough of
pleasures and comforts without meaning and Ive nothing to do and it
doesnt look like anyones making any progress anywhere Even on the
planets theyre just repeating backtime stuff with modern equipment

The old man waved a hand at the others and looked at Allen intently His
voice was softly insistent The one continuous thread in human history
has been the seeking of more pleasure and greater comfort for all
members of the race Our technology gives us a maximum of both No one
labors and the few who work prefer to do so No one is diseased no one
stays in pain longer than the time necessary to reach a medic Everyone
can have everything he needs without striving and without debt And as
technology advances there will be even greater benefits for all What
more can be done to make the citizens of Earth happy

For the first time Allen felt confused I dont know he said slowly
The way you put it it sounds right But where does it all lead What
reason have I got for living What reason does the human race have for
surviving

The sociologist looked even older In all seriousness sir can you
answer the questions you have just asked His eyes were expectantbut
there didnt seem to be much hope reflected in their depths

Allen noted a tenseness around the table Why were they asking him for
answers they were supposed to know Or was it another of their
subtleties

No he said curtly I dont know the answer to any of them Has it
got a bearing on my getting a DP

The central figure sighed None at all He pressed several tiny
buttons on the polished table and an inscribed card rose halfway out of
a slot We merely hope that some day a man will come along who can tell
usbefore someone who may not be a man comes along and makes the
answers futile He handed Allen the card Here is your permit You may
take it to the third office south on the corridor through that door We
dont feel it is the answer to your problem but we admit we dont

Pardon me sir interrupted Allen He wet his lips Did you say
someone who may not be a man

Yes It is an aspect you have not considered Mr Kinderwood The
sociologists face seemed haggard Even a few generations ago Earth as
it is today would have seemed like a concept of heaven We know now it
is not enough but we dont know why Perhaps if we can reach the stars
the problem will cease to be critical By the same token life from the
stars may come here first

We have no remotest idea what such an eventuality would entail It may
provide a solution It may quite conceivably send man back to the
forests and jungles

You have experienced our only answer to the latter possibility While
providing man with everything to which he has aspired for milleniums we
instill in him through the media of entertainment knowledge of all the
survival practices known to the backtimers who painfully nurtured
civilization from an embryonic idea to its present pinnacle We can do
no more

Allen flexed his arms involuntarily at the sheer enormity of the idea
It was one thing to let a useless race expire quite another to think of
its being forced back to Butcant anyone think of anything else to
do

Whoever is capable of devising anything else the old doctor said
resignedly will undoubtedly be able to carry it out with or without
our assistance He pressed more buttons and there was a muted sound of
the voder calling a number The exit over there Mr Kinderwood
Andmuch happiness

Allens thoughts swirled in tumultuous confusion Dimly he realized
that man had outstripped himself and saw with intense bitterness that
there was no answer on Earth for any ordinary citizen Or was there And
if there was was it worth trying to find He flung open the door to the
corridor violently as though the force could quiet his mind Maybe if
he didnt use the permit he could stay and figure out an answer Nedda
would be sympathetic and patient while And then he stopped Across the
wide hallway Nedda stood beneath a window looking at him And the
blond youth held her with flushed understanding impatiently waiting
caressing her arm with his hand binding her to him with the one bond
she could not break

She watched Allen start slowly down the corridor Once when he
stumbled she gave a stifled sob and tears brimmed and spilled silently
when he passed through the door marked Kansas City Department of
Euthanasia
