INTRODUCTION


The word Burlesque came to us through the French from the Italian
burlesco burla being mockery or raillery and implying always an
object Burlesque must burlarsi di uno mock at somebody or something
and when intended to give pleasure it is nothing if not goodnatured
One etymologist associates the word with the old English bourd a
jest the Gaelic burd he says means mockery and buirleadh is
language of ridicule Yes and burrail is the loud romping of children
and burrall is weeping and wailing in a deeptoned howl Another
etymologist takes the Italian burla waggery or banter as diminutive
from the Latin burra which means a rough hair but is used by Ausonius
in the sense of a jest That etymology no doubt fits burlesque to a hair
but like Launces sweetheart it may have more hair than wit

The first burlesque in this volumeChaucers Rime of Sir Thopas
written towards the close of the fourteenth centuryis a jest upon
longwinded storytellers who expatiate on insignificant detail for
in his day there were many metrical romances written by the ancestors
of Mrs Nickleby Riding to Canterbury with the other pilgrims Chaucer
goodhumouredly takes to himself the part of the companion who jogs along
with even flow of words luxuriating in all trivial detail until he
brings Sir Thopas face to face with an adventure for he meets a giant
with three heads But even then there is the adventure to be waited for
The storyteller finds that he must trot his knight back home to fetch
his armour and when he is comen again to toune it takes so many
words to get him his supper get his armour on and trot him out again
that the inevitable end comes with rude intrusion of some fainthearted
lording who has not courage to listen until the point of the story can
be descried from afar So the best of the old storytellers in a book
full of examples of tales told as they should be burlesqued misuse of
his art and the Rime of Sir Thopas became a warning buoy over the
shallows I cannot said Sir Thomas Wyatt in Henry VIIIs reign

                        say that Pan
    Passeth Apollo in music manyfold
      Prais Sir Thopas for a noble tale
    And scorn the story that the Knight told

The second burlesque in this volume Beaumont and Fletchers Knight of
the Burning Pestle written in eight days appeared in  six years
after the publication of the First Part and four years earlier than
the Second Part of Don Quixote The first English translation of Don
Quixote Sheltons appeared in  The Knight of the Burning Pestle
is like Don Quixote a burlesque upon the tasteless affectations of the
tales of chivalry Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher worked together as
playwrights in the reign of James I All their plays were produced during
that reign Beaumont died in the same year as Shakespeare having written
thirteen plays in fellowship with Fletcher Forty more were written by
Fletcher alone but the name of Beaumont is by tradition of a loving
fellowship associated with them all The Knight of the Burning Pestle
is all the merrier for being the work of men who were themselves true
poets It should be remembered that this play was written for a theatre
without scenery in which gentlemen were allowed to hire stools on the
stage itself for a nearer view of the actors and it is among this select
part of the audience that the citizen intrudes and the citizens wife
is lifted up when she cries Husband shall I come up husband Ay
cony Ralph help your mistress up this way pray gentlemen make her a
little room I pray you sir lend me your hand to help up my wife
Boy let my wife and I have a couple of stools and then begin

The next burlesque in our collection is The Rehearsal which was
produced in  to ridicule the extravagance of the heroic plays of
the Restoration The founder of this school in England was Sir William
Davenant who was living and was Poet Laureateand wearer of the bays
therefore was Bayeswhen the jest was begun by George Villiers Duke
of Buckingham and other wits of the day The jest was so long in hand
that in  when Davenant died and Dryden succeeded him as Laureate
the character of Bayes passed on to him The plaster on the nose pointed
at Davenant who had lost great part of his nose The manner of speaking
and the hum and buzz pointed at Dryden who was also in  the
great master of what was called heroic drama Bold rhodomontade was
on the stage preferred to good sense at a time when the new French
criticism was enforcing above all things good sense upon poets as a
reaction against the strained ingenuities that had come in under Italian
influence Let us leave to Italy her paste brilliants said Boileau in
his Art Potique produced at the same time as The Rehearsal all
should tend to good sense But Dryden in his plays not in his other
poems boldly translated Horaces serbit humi tutus into

    He who servilely creeps after sense
    Is safe but neer will reach an excellence

The particular excellence attained by flying out of sight of sense is
burlesqued in the Duke of Buckinghams Rehearsal

John Philips the delicate and gentle son of a vicar of Bampton read
Milton with delight from his boyhood and knew Virgil almost by heart At
college he wrote for the edification of a comrade who did not know how
to keep a shilling in his pocket The Splendid Shilling a poem first
published in which set forth in Miltonic style applied to humblest
images the comfort of possessing such a coin The Miltonic grandeur of
tone John Philips happily caught from a long and loving study of the
English poet whom he reverenced above others and The Splendid Shilling
has a special charm as a burlesque in which nobody is ridiculed

The burlesque poem called Namby Pamby of which the title has been
added to the English vocabulary was written by Henry Carey in ridicule
of the little rhymes inscribed to certain babies of distinguished
persons by Ambrose Philips or as he is translated into nursery
language Namby Pamby Pillipis Ambrose Philips was a friend and
companion of Addisons and a gentleman who prospered fairly in Whig
government circles Popes annoyance at the praise given to Ambrose
Philipss pastorals which appeared in the same Miscellany with his own
and Addisons praise in the Spectator of his friends translation of
Racines Andromache as The Distrest Mother have caused Ambrose Philips
to be better remembered in the history of literature than might otherwise
have been necessary When he wrote no longer of

              Mammy
    Andromache and her lammy
    Hanging panging at the breast
    Of a matron most distrest

and took to nursery lyrics he gave Henry Carey an opportunity of putting
a last touch to his monument for the instruction of posterity The two
specimens here given of the original poems that suggested Namby Pamby
are addressed severally to two babes in the nursery of Daniel Pulteney
Esq Another of the babies who inspired him was an infant Carteret
whose name Carey translated into Tartaretta Tartaree Some lines here
and there seven in all which are not the wittier for being coarse
have been left out of Namby Pamby This burlesque was first published
in  or  my copy is of the fifth edition dated  and was
appended to A Learned Dissertation on Dumpling its Dignity Antiquity
and Excellence with a Word upon Pudding and many other Useful
Discoveries of great Benefit to the Publick To which is added Namby
Pamby A Panegyric on the new Versification addressd to A P
Esq

Henry Fielding produced his Tom Thumb in  and added the notes of
Scriblerus Secundus in  following the example set by the Dunciad as
published in April  with the Prolegomena of Scriblerus and Notes
Variorum Paul Whitehead added notes of a Scriblerus Tertius to his
Gymnasiad in  Fielding was twentyfour years old when he added
to his Tom Thumb the notes that transmit to us lively examples of the
stilted language of the stage by which as a gentlemans son left to his
own resources he was then endeavouring to live This was four years
before his marriage and ten years before he revealed his transcendent
powers as a novelist

Henry Careys Chrononhotonthologos three years later in  carried
on the war against pretentious dulness on the stage The manner of
the great actors was like the plays of their generation pompous and
rhetorical full of measured sound and fury signifying nothing Garrick
who made his first appearance as an actor in  put an end to this
If the young fellow is right said Quin We are all in the wrong
little suspecting that they really were all in the wrong Henry Carey
a musician by profession played in the orchestra and also supplied the
stage with ballad and burlesque farces and operas But also he wrote
Namby Pamby It was said of him that he led a life free from reproach
and hanged himself October th 

The Rovers or the Double Arrangement was a contribution to The
AntiJacobin by George Canning and his friends George Ellis and John
Hookham Frere Canning had established The AntiJacobin of which the
first number was published on the th of November  Its poetry
generally levelled through witty burlesque at the false sentiment of the
day was collected in  into a handsome quarto This includes The
Rovers which is a lively caricature of the sentimental German drama
Goethes Stella as read in the translation used by the caricaturists
is not less comical than the caricature I have a copy of the Poetry
of the AntiJacobin in which one of the original writers has for the
friend to whom he gave the book marked with his pen and ink details of
authorship From this it appears that the description of the dramatis
person in The Rovers was by Frere the Prologue by Canning and Ellis
the opening scene by Frere as far as Rogeros famous song which was by
Canning and Ellis All that follows to the beginning of the fourth act
was by Canning except that Frere wrote the scene in the second act on
the delivery of a newspaper to Beefington and Puddingfield The fourth
act and the final stage directions were by Frere except the Recitative
and Chorus of Conspirators These were by George Ellis

Bombastes Furioso first produced in  was by William Barnes
Rhodes who had published a translation of Juvenal in  and Epigrams
in  He formed a considerable dramatic library of which there was a
catalogue printed in 

Next comes in this collection the series of burlesques of the styles of
poets famous and popular in  published in that year as Rejected
Addresses by Horace and James Smith Of these brothers sons of
an attorney one was an attorney the other a stockbroker one aged
thirtyseven the other thirtythree when the book appeared which made
them famous and of which the first edition is reprinted in this volume
The book went through twentyfour editions James Smith wrote no more
but Horace to the last amused himself with literature Is it not odd
Leigh Hunt wrote of him to Shelley that the only truly generous person
I ever knew who had money to be generous with was a stockbroker And
he writes poetry too he writes poetry and pastoral dramas and yet
knows how to make money and does make it and is still generous The
Fitzgerald who is subject of the first burlesque used to recite his
laudatory poems at the annual dinners of the Literary Fund and is the
same who was referred to in the opening lines of Byrons English Bards
and Scotch Reviewers

    Still must I hearshall hoarse Fitzgerald bawl
    His creaking couplets in a tavern hall
    And I not sing

This Miscellany closes with some of the Odes and Addresses to Great
People with which Thomas Hood at the age of twentysix first made his
mark as a wit The little book from which these pieces are taken was the
joint work of himself and John Hamilton Reynolds whose sister he had
married It marks the rise of the pun in burlesque writing through Thomas
Hood who when dying of consumption suggested for his epitaph Here
lies one who spat more blood and made more puns than any other man

THE RIME OF SIR THOPAS

PROLOGUE TO SIR THOPAS


    When said was this mircle every man
    As sober was that wonder was to see
    Till that our host to japen he began
    And then at erst he lookd upon me
    And said thus What man art thou quod he
    Thou lookest as thou wouldest find an hare
    For ever upon the ground I see thee stare

      Approch near and look up merrily
    Now ware you sirs and let this man have place
    He in the waist is shapen as well as I
    This were a popet in an arm to embrace
    For any woman small and fair of face
    He seemeth elvish by his countenance
    For unto no wight doth he dalliance

      Say now somewhat sin other folk han said
    Tell us a tale of mirth and that anon
    Host quod I ne be not evil apaid
    For other tal certes can I none
    But of a Rime I learnd yore agone
    Yea that is good quod he we shullen hear
    Some dainty thing me thinketh by thy cheere




THE RIME OF SIR THOPAS


    Listeneth lordings in good entent
    And I wol tell you verament
      Of mirth and of sols
    All of a knight was fair and gent
    In battle and in tournamnt
      His name was Sir Thops

    Yborn he was in far countree
    In Flanders all beyond the sea
      At Popering in the place
    His father was a man full free
    And lord he was of that countree
      As it was Godds grace

    Sir Thopas was a doughty swain
    White was his face as paindemaine
      His lipps red as rose
    His rudde is like scarlt in grain
    And I you tell in good certain
      He had a seemly nose

    His hair his beard was like saffroun
    That to his girdle raught adown
      His shoon of cordewaine
    Of Bruges were his hosen brown
    His rob was of ciclatoun
      That cost many a jane

    He could hunt at the wild dere
    And ride on hawking for the rivere
      With grey goshawk on hand
    Thereto he was a good archere
    Of wrestling was there none his peer
      Where any ram should stand

    Full many a maiden bright in bower
    They mournd for him par amour
      When them were bet to slepe
    But he was chaste and no lechur
    And sweet as is the bramble flower
      That beareth the red hepe

    And so it fell upon a day
    Forsooth as I you tellen may
      Sir Thopas would out ride
    He worth upon his sted gray
    And in his hand a launcegay
      A long sword by his side

    He pricketh through a fair forst
    Therein is many a wild beast
      Yea both buck and hare
    And as he prickd North and Est
    I tell it you him had almest
      Betid a sorry care

    There springen herbs great and smale
    The liquorice and the setewale
      And many a clove gilofre
    And nutmeg to put in ale
    Whether it be moist or stale
      Or for to lain in cofre

    The birds singen it is no nay
    The sparhawk and the popingay
      That joy it was to hear
    The throstel cock made eke his lay
    The wod dove upon the spray
      He sang full loud and clear

    Sir Thopas fell in lovelongng
    All when he heard the throstel sing
      And pricked as he were wood
    His fair steed in his prcking
    So swatt that men might him wring
      His sids were all blood

    Sir Thopas eke so weary was
    For pricking on the soft gras
      So fierce was his courge
    That down he laid him in that place
    To maken his sted som solace
      And gave him good forge

    Ah Seinte Mary benedicite
    What aileth this love at me
      To bind me so sore
    Me dreamd all this night pard
    An elfqueen shal my leman be
      And sleep under my gore

    An elfqueen will I love ywis
    For in this world no wman is
      Worthy to be my make
           In town
    All other women I forsake
    And to an elfqueen I me take
      By dale and eke by down

    Into his saddle he clomb anon
    And prickd over stile and stone
      An elfqueen for to espie
    Till he so long had ridden and gone
    That he found in a privee wone
      The contree of Faeri

    Wherein he sought North and South
    And oft he spid with his mouth
      In many a forest wild
    For in that contree nas ther non
    That to him durst ride or gon
      Neither wife ne child

    Till that there came a great geaunt
    His nam was Sir Oliphaunt
      A perilous man of deed
    He said Childe by Termagaunt
    But if thou prick out of mine haunt
      Anon I slay thy stede
            With mace
    Here is the Queen of Faerie
    With harp and pipe and symphonie
      Dwelling in this place

    The Childe said All so mote I thee
    To morrow wol I meten thee
      When I have min armur
    And yet I hop par ma fay
    That thou shalt with this launcegay
      Abien it full soure
            Thy mawe
    Shal I perce if I may
    Or it be fully prime of the day
      For here thou shalt be slawe

    Sir Thopas drew aback full fast
    This geaunt at him stons cast
      Out of a fell staff sling
    But faire escapd Childe Thops
    And all it was through Goddes grace
      And through his fair bearng

    Yet listeneth lordings to my tale
    Merrier than the nightingale
      For now I will you roune
    How Sir Thops with sids smale
    Pricking over hill and dale
      Is comen again to toune

    His merry men commandeth he
    To maken him bothe game and glee
      For needs must he fight
    With a geaunt with heades three
    For paramour and jolitee
      Of one that shone full bright

    Do come he said my minestrales
    And gestours for to tellen tales
      Anon in mine armng
    Of romauncs that ben reles
    Of pops and of cardinles
      And eke of lovelongng

    They fet him first the swet wine
    And mead eke in a maseline
      And regal spicerie
    Of gingerbread that was full fine
    And liquorice and eke cummine
      With sugar that is trie

    He didd next his whit lere
    Of cloth of lak fine and clere
      A breche and eke a sherte
    And next his shert an haketon
    And over that an habergeon
      For piercing of his herte

    And over that a fine hauberk
    Was all ywrought of Jewes werk
      Full strong it was of plate
    And over that his cotearmoure
    As white as is the lily floure
      In which he would debate

    His shield was all of gold so red
    And therein was a boars hed
      A carbuncle beside
    And there he swore on ale and bread
    How that the geaunt shuld be dead
      Betide what so betide

    His jambeux were of cuirbouly
    His swords sheth of ivory
      His helm of latoun bright
    His saddle was of rewel bone
    His bridle as the sonn shone
      Or as the mon light

    His sper was of fin cyprss
    That bodeth war and nothing peace
      The head full sharp yground
    His sted was all dapple gray
    It goeth an amble in the way
      Full softly and round
            In londe
    Lo Lordes mine here is a fytte
    If ye wol ony more of it
      To tell it wol I fond

    Now hold your mouth pour charit
    Both knight and lady free
      And herkeneth to my spell
    Of bataille and of chivalrie
    Of ladies love and druerie
      Anon I wol you tell

    Men speken of romauncs of pris
    Of Hornchild and of Ipotis
      Of Bevis and Sir Guy
    Of Sir Libeux and Pleindamour
    But Sir Thops he bears the flour
      Of rel chivalrie

    His good steed he all bestrode
    And forth upon his way he glode
      As sparkle out of brond
    Upon his crest he bare a tower
    And therein sticked a lily flower
      God shield his corps fro shond

    And for he was a knight auntrous
    He nolde slepen in none house
      But liggen in his hood
    His bright helm was his wangr
    And by him baited his destrr
      Of herbs fine and good

    Himself drank water of the well
    As did the knight Sir Percivell
      So worthy under weede
    Till on a day  

    No more of this for Godds dignitee
    Quod our host for thou makest me
    So weary of thy veray lewdnesse
    That all so wisly God my soul blesse
    Min ers aken of thy drafty speche
    Now swiche a rime the devil I beteche
    This may wel be rime dogrel quod he
      Why so quod I why wolt thou letten me
    More of my tal than an other man
    Sin that it is the best rime I can
    Thou dost nought ells but dispendest time
    Sir at one word thou shalt no longer rime

Enter RALPH like a grocer in his shop with two prentices reading
Palmerin of England

Cit Peace fool let Ralph alone hark you Ralph do not strain
yourself too much at the first Peace begin Ralph

Ralph Then Palmerin and Trineus snatching their lances from their
dwarfs and clasping their helmets galloped amain after the giant and
Palmerin having gotten a sight of him came posting amain saying Stay
traitorous thief for thou mayst not so carry away her that is worth the
greatest lord in the world and with these words gave him a blow on
the shoulder that he struck him beside his elephant and Trineus coming
to the knight that had Agricola behind him set him soon beside his
horse with his neck broken in the fall so that the princess getting
out of the throng between joy and grief said All happy knight the
mirror of all such as follow arms now may I be well assured of the
love thou bearest me I wonder why the kings do not raise an army of
fourteen or fifteen hundred thousand men as big as the army that the
Prince of Portigo brought against Rosicler and destroy these giants
they do much hurt to wandering damsels that go in quest of their knights

Wife Faith husband and Ralph says true for they say the King of
Portugal cannot sit at his meat but the giants and the ettins will come
and snatch it from him

Cit Hold thy tongue on Ralph

Ralph And certainly those knights are much to be commended who
neglecting their possessions wander with a squire and a dwarf through
the deserts to relieve poor ladies

Wife Ay by my faith are they Ralph let em say what they will they
are indeed our knights neglect their possessions well enough but they
do not the rest

Ralph There are no such courteous and fair wellspoken knights in this
age they will call one the son of a seacook that Palmerin of England
would have called fair sir and one that Rosicler would have called right
beautiful damsel they will call old witch

Wife Ill be sworn will they Ralph they have called me so an hundred
times about a scurvy pipe of tobacco

Ralph But what brave spirit could be content to sit in his shop
with a flapet of wood and a blue apron before him selling Methridatam
and Dragons Water to visited houses that might pursue feats of arms
and through his noble achievements procure such a famous history to be
written of his heroic prowess

Cit Well said Ralph some more of those words Ralph

Wife They go finely by my troth

Ralph Why should I not then pursue this course both for the credit of
myself and our company for amongst all the worthy books of achievements
I do not call to mind that I yet read of a grocer errant I will be the
said knight Have you heard of any that hath wandered unfurnished of his
squire and dwarf My elder prentice Tim shall be my trusty squire and
little George my dwarf Hence my blue apron Yet in remembrance of my
former trade upon my shield shall be portrayed a burning pestle and I
will be called the Knight of the Burning Pestle

Wife Nay I dare swear thou wilt not forget thy old trade thou wert
ever meek Ralph Tim

Tim Anon

Ralph My beloved squire and George my dwarf I charge you that from
henceforth you never call me by any other name but the Right courteous
and valiant Knight of the Burning Pestle and that you never call any
female by the name of a woman or wench but fair lady if she have her
desires if not distressed damsel that you call all forests and heaths
deserts and all horses palfreys

Wife This is very fine faith do the gentlemen like Ralph think you

Cit Ay I warrant thee the players would give all the shoes in their
shop for him

Ralph My beloved Squire Tim stand out Admit this were a desert and
over it a knight errant pricking and I should bid you inquire of his
intents what would you say

Tim Sir my master sent me to know whither you are riding

Ralph No thus Fair sir the Right courteous and valiant Knight of
the Burning Pestle commanded me to inquire upon what adventure you are
bound whether to relieve some distressed damsel or otherwise

Cit Dunder blockhead cannot remember

    That works such damage to all errant knights

    Host Not far from hence near to a craggy cliff
    At the north end of this distressd town
    There doth stand a lowly house
    Ruggedly builded and in it a cave
    In which an ugly giant now doth dwell
    Yclepd Barbaroso in his hand
    He shakes a naked lance of purest steel
    With sleeves turned up and he before him wears
    A motley garment to preserve his clothes
    From blood of those knights which he massacres
    And ladies gent without his door doth hang
    A copper bason on a prickant spear
    At which no sooner gentle knights can knock
    But the shrill sound fierce Barbaroso hears
    And rushing forth brings in the errant knight
    And sets him down in an enchanted chair
    Then with an engine which he hath prepard
    With forty teeth he claws his courtly crown
    Next makes him wink and underneath his chin
    He plants a brazen piece of mighty bore
    And knocks his bullets round about his cheeks
    Whilst with his fingers and an instrument
    With which he snaps his hair off he doth fill
    The wretchs ears with a most hideous noise
    Thus every knight adventurer he doth trim
    And now no creature dares encounter him

    Ralph In Gods name I will fight with him kind sir
    Go but before me to this dismal cave
    Where this huge giant Barbaroso dwells
    And by that virtue that brave Rosiclere
    That wicked brood of ugly giants slew
    And Palmerin Frannarco overthrew

    And to the devil send his guilty soul

    Ralph London to thee I do present the merry month of May
    Let each true subject be content to hear me what I say
    For from the top of conduit head as plainly may appear
    I will both tell my name to you and wherefore I came here
    My name is Ralph by due descent though not ignoble I
    Yet far inferior to the flock of gracious grocery
    And by the common counsel of my fellows in the Strand
    With gilded staff and crossed scarf the May lord here I stand
    Rejoice O English hearts rejoice rejoice O lovers dear
    Rejoice O city town and country rejoice eke every shire
    For now the fragrant flowers do spring and sprout in seemly sort
    The little birds do sit and sing the lambs do make fine sport
    And now the birchin tree doth bud that makes the schoolboy cry
    The morrice rings while hobbyhorse doth foot it featuously
    The lords and ladies now abroad for their disport and play
    Do kiss sometimes upon the grass and sometimes in the hay
    Now butter with a leaf of sage is good to purge the blood
    Fly Venus and Phlebotomy for they are neither good
    Now little fish on tender stone begin to cast their bellies
    And sluggish snail that erst were mewd do creep out of their
      shellies
    The rumbling rivers now do warm for little boys to paddle
    The sturdy steed now goes to grass and up they hang his saddle
    The heavy hart the blowing buck the rascal and the pricket
    Are now among the yeomans pease and leave the fearful thicket
    And be like them O you I say of this same noble town
    And lift aloft your velvet heads and slipping of your gown
    With bells on legs and napkins clean unto your shoulders tyd
    With scarfs and garters as you please and Hey for our town cryd
    March out and show your willing minds by twenty and by twenty
    To Hogsdon or to Newington where ale and cakes are plenty
    And let it neer be said for shame that we the youths of London
    Lay thrumming of our caps at home and left our custom undone
    Up then I say both young and old both man and maid amaying
    With drums and guns that bounce aloud and merry tabor playing
    Which to prolong God save our king and send his country peace
    And root out treason from the land and so my friends I cease

Enter RALPH with a forked arrow through his head

    Ralph When I was mortal this my costive corps
    Did lap up figs and raisins in the Strand
    Where sitting I espyd a lovely dame
    Whose master wrought with lingel and with awl
    And underground he vampd many a boot
    Straight did her love prick forth me tender sprig
    To follow feats of arms in warlike wise
    Through Waltham Desert where I did perform
    Many achievements and did lay on ground
    Huge Barbaroso that insulting giant
    And all his captives soon set at liberty
    Then honour prickd me from my native soil
    Into Moldavia where I gaind the love
    Of Pompiana his beloved daughter
    But yet provd constant to the blackthumbed maid
    Susan and scornd Pompianas love
    Yet liberal I was and gave her pins
    And money for her fathers officers
    I then returnd home and thrust myself
    In action and by all men chosen was
    The Lord of May where I did flourish it
    With scarfs and rings and posie in my hand
    After this action I preferrd was
    And chosen City Captain at Mile End
    With hat and feather and with leading staff
    And traind my men and brought them all off clean
    Save one man that berayed him with the noise
    But all these things I Ralph did undertake
    Only for my belovd Susans sake
    Then coming home and sitting in my shop
    With apron blue Death came unto my stall
    To cheapen aquavit but ere I
    Could take the bottle down and fill a taste
    Death caught a pound of pepper in his hand
    And sprinkled all my face and body oer
    And in an instant vanishd away

    Cit Tis a pretty fiction ifaith

    Ralph Then took I up my bow and shaft in hand
    And walkd in Moorfields to cool myself
    But there grim cruel Death met me again
    And shot his forkd arrow through my head
    And now I faint therefore be warnd by me
    My fellows every one of forkd heads
    Farewell all you good boys in merry London
    Neer shall we more upon Shrove Tuesday meet
    And pluck down houses of iniquity
    My pain increaseth I shall never more
    When clubs are cried be brisk upon my legs
    Nor daub a satin gown with rotten eggs
    Set up a stake oh never more I shall
    I die Fly fly my soul to Grocers Hall Oh oh oh c

Wife Well said Ralph do your obeisance to the gentlemen and go your
ways Well said Ralph

                                                 Exit RALPH

Old Mer Methinks all we thus kindly and unexpectedly reconciled
should not part without a song

Merch A good motion

Old Mer Strike up then

SONG

    Better music neer was known
    Than a quire of hearts in one
    Let each other that hath been
    Troubled with the gall or spleen
    Learn of us to keep his brow
    Smooth and plain as yours are now
    Sing though before the hour of dying
    He shall rise and then be crying
    Heyho tis nought but mirth
    That keeps the body from the earth        Exeunt omnes


EPILOGUS

Cit Come Nell shall we go The plays done

Wife Nay by my faith George I have more manners than so Ill speak
to these gentlemen first I thank you all gentlemen for your patience
and countenance to Ralph a poor fatherless child and if I may see you
at my house it should go hard but I would have a pottle of wine and a
pipe of tobacco for you for truly I hope you like the youth but I would
be glad to know the truth I refer it to your own discretions whether
you will applaud him or no for I will wink and whilst you shall do
what you willI thank you with all my heart God give you good night
Come George

PROLOGUE

    We might well call this short mockplay of ours
    A posy made of weeds instead of flowers
    Yet such have been presented to your noses
    And there are such I fear who thought em roses
    Would some of em were here to see this night
    What stuff it is in which they took delight
    Here brisk insipid rogues for wit let fall
    Sometimes dull sense but oftner none at all
    There strutting heroes with a grimfacd train
    Shall brave the gods in King Cambyses vein
    For changing rules of late as if man writ
    In spite of reason nature art and wit
    Our poets make us laugh at tragedy
    And with their comedies they make us cry
    Now critics do your worst that here are met
    For like a rook I have hedgd in my bet
    If you approve I shall assume the state
    Of those highflyers whom I imitate
    And justly too for I will teach you more
    Than ever they would let you know before
    I will not only show the feats they do
    But give you all their reasons for em too
    Some honour may to me from hence arise
    But if by my endeavours you grow wise
    And what you once so praisd shall now despise
    Then Ill cry out swelld with poetic rage
    Tis I John Lacy have reformd your stage

                                   


ACT ISCENE I

JOHNSON and SMITH

Johns Honest Frank I am glad to see thee with all my heart how long
hast thou been in town

Smith Faith not above an hour and if I had not met you here I
had gone to look you out for I long to talk with you freely of all the
strange new things we have heard in the country

Johns And by my troth I have longd as much to laugh with you at all
the impertinent dull fantastical things we are tired out with here

Smith Dull and fantastical thats an excellent composition Pray
what are our men of business doing

Johns I neer inquire after em Thou knowest my humour lies another
way I love to please myself as much and to trouble others as little as
I can and therefore do naturally avoid the company of those solemn fops
who being incapable of reason and insensible of wit and pleasure are
always looking grave and troubling one another in hopes to be thought
men of business

Smith Indeed I have ever observed that your grave lookers are the
dullest of men

Johns Ay and of birds and beasts too your gravest bird is an owl
and your gravest beast is an ass

Smith Well but how dost thou pass thy time

Johns Why as I used to do eat drink as well as I can have a friend
to chat with in the afternoon and sometimes see a play where there are
such things Frank such hideous monstrous things that it has almost
made me forswear the stage and resolve to apply myself to the solid
nonsense of your men of business as the more ingenious pastime

Smith I have heard indeed you have had lately many new plays and
our country wits commend em

Johns Ay so do some of our city wits too but they are of the new
kind of wits

Smith New kind what kind is that

Johns Why your virtuousi your civil persons your drolls fellows
that scorn to imitate nature but are given altogether to elevate and
surprise

Smith Elevate and surprise prithee make me understand the meaning of
that

Johns Nay by my troth thats a hard matter I dont understand
that myself Tis a phrase they have got among them to express their
nomeaning by Ill tell you as near as I can what it is Let me see
tis fighting loving sleeping rhyming dying dancing singing
crying and everything but thinking and sense

MR BAYES passes over the stage

Bayes Your most obsequious and most observant very servant sir

Johns Odso this is an author Ill go fetch him to you

Smith No prithee let him alone

Johns Nay by the Lord Ill have him Goes after him Here he is
I have caught him Pray sir now for my sake will you do a favour to
this friend of mine

Bayes Sir it is not within my small capacity to do favours but
receive em especially from a person that does wear the honourable title
you are pleased to impose sir upon thissweet sir your servant

Smith Your humble servant sir

Johns But wilt thou do me a favour now

Bayes Ay sir what ist

Johns Why to tell him the meaning of thy last play

Bayes How sir the meaning Do you mean the plot

Johns Ay ay anything

Bayes Faith sir the intrigos now quite out of my head but I have
a new one in my pocket that I may say is a virgin it has never yet been
blown upon I must tell you one thing tis all new wit and though I
say it a better than my last and you know well enough how that took
In fine it shall read and write and act and plot and show ay and
pit box and gallery egad with any play in Europe This morning is
its last rehearsal in their habits and all that as it is to be acted
and if you and your friend will do it but the honour to see it in its
virgin attire though perhaps it may blush I shall not be ashamed to
discover its nakedness unto you I think it is in this pocket Puts his
hand in his pocket

Johns Sir I confess I am not able to answer you in this new way
but if you please to lead I shall be glad to follow you and I hope my
friend will do so too

Smith Sir I have no business so considerable as should keep me from
your company

Bayes Yes here it is No cry you mercy this is my book of Drama
Commonplaces the mother of many other plays

Johns Drama Commonplaces pray whats that

Bayes Why sir some certain helps that we men of art have found it
convenient to make use of

Smith How sir helps for wit

Bayes Ay sir thats my position And I do here aver that no man yet
the sun eer shone upon has parts sufficient to furnish out a stage
except it were by the help of these my rules

Johns What are those rules I pray

Bayes Why sir my first rule is the rule of transversion or Regula
Duplex changing verse into prose or prose into verse alternativ as
you please

Smith Well but how is this done by a rule sir

Bayes Why thus sir nothing so easy when understood I take a book in
my hand either at home or elsewhere for thats all one if there be any
wit int as there is no book but has some I transverse it that is if
it be prose put it into verse but that takes up some time and if it
be verse put it into prose

Johns Methinks Mr Bayes that putting verse into prose should be
called transprosing

Bayes By my troth sir tis a very good notion and hereafter it
shall be so

Smith Well sir and what dye do with it then

Bayes Make it my own Tis so changed that no man can know it My next
rule is the rule of record by way of tablebook Pray observe

Johns We hear you sir go on

Bayes As thus I come into a coffeehouse or some other place where
witty men resort I make as if I minded nothing do you mark but as soon
as any one speaks pop I slap it down and make that too my own

Johns But Mr Bayes are you not sometimes in danger of their making
you restore by force what you have gotten thus by art

Bayes No sir the worlds unmindful they never take notice of these
things

Smith But pray Mr Bayes among all your other rules have you no one
rule for invention

Bayes Yes sir thats my third rule that I have here in my pocket

Smith What rule can that be I wonder

Bayes Why sir when I have anything to invent I never trouble my
head about it as other men do but presently turn over this book
and there I have at one view all that Persius Montaigne Senecas
Tragedies Horace Juvenal Claudian Pliny Plutarchs Lives and the
rest have ever thought upon this subject and so in a trice by leaving
out a few words or putting in others of my own the business is done

Johns Indeed Mr Bayes this is as sure and compendious a way of wit
as ever I heard of

Bayes Sir if you make the least scruples of the efficacy of these my
rules do but come to the playhouse and you shall judge of em by the
effects

Smith Well follow you sir Exeunt

Enter three PLAYERS on the stage

st Play Have you your part perfect

nd Play Yes I have it without book but I dont understand how it is
to be spoken

rd Play And mine is such a one as I cant guess for my life what
humour Im to be in whether angry melancholy merry or in love I
dont know what to make ont

st Play Phoo the author will be here presently and hell tell us
all You must know this is the new way of writing and these hard things
please forty times better than the old plain way For look you sir
the grand design upon the stage is to keep the auditors in suspense for
to guess presently at the plot and the sense tires them before the end
of the first act now here every line surprises you and brings in new
matter And then for scenes clothes and dances we put quite down all
that ever went before us and those are the things you know that are
essential to a play

nd Play Well I am not of thy mind but so it gets us money tis no
great matter

Enter BAYES JOHNSON and SMITH

Bayes Come come in gentlemen Youre very welcome Mra Ha you
your part ready

st Play Yes sir

Bayes But do you understand the true humour of it

st Play Ay sir pretty well

Bayes And Amaryllis how does she do does not her armour become her

rd Play Oh admirably

Bayes Ill tell you now a pretty conceit What do you think Ill make
em call her anon in this play

Smith What I pray

Bayes Why I make em call her Armaryllis because of her armour ha
ha ha

Johns That will be very well indeed

Bayes Ay tis a pretty little rogue butacome lets sit down
Look you sirs the chief hinge of this play upon which the whole
plot moves and turns and that causes the variety of all the several
accidents which you know are the things in nature that make up the
grand refinement of a play is that I suppose two kings of the same
place as for example at Brentford for I love to write familiarly Now
the people having the same relations to em both the same affections
the same duty the same obedience and all that are divided among
themselves in point of devoir and interest how to behave themselves
equally between em these kings differing sometimes in particular
though in the main they agree I know not whether I make myself well
understood

Johns I did not observe you sir pray say that again

Bayes Why look you sir nay I beseech you be a little curious in
taking notice of this or else youll never understand my notion of
the thing the people being embarrassd by their equal ties to both
and the sovereigns concernd in a reciprocal regard as well to their
own interest as the good of the people make a certain kind of ayou
understand meupon which there do arise several disputes turmoils
heartburnings and all thatin fine youll apprehend it better when
you see it

                                  Exit to call the Players

Smith I find the author will be very much obliged to the players if
they can make any sense out of this

Enter BAYES

Bayes Now gentlemen I would fain ask your opinion of one thing
I have made a prologue and an epilogue which may both serve for
either that is the prologue for the epilogue or the epilogue for the
prologue do you mark nay they may both serve too egad for any
other play as well as this

Smith Very well thats indeed artificial

Bayes And I would fain ask your judgments now which of them would
do best for the prologue for you must know there is in nature but
two ways of making very good prologues the one is by civility by
insinuation good language and all that toain a manner steal your
plaudit from the courtesy of the auditors the other by making use of
some certain personal things which may keep a hank upon such censuring
persons as cannot otherways egad in nature be hindered from being
too free with their tongues To which end my first prologue is that I
come out in a long black veil and a great huge hangman behind me with a
furrd cap and his sword drawn and there tell em plainly that if out
of goodnature they will not like my play egad Ill een kneel down
and he shall cut my head off Whereupon they all clappinga

Smith Ay but suppose they dont

Bayes Suppose sir you may suppose what you please I have nothing
to do with your suppose sir nor am at all mortified at it not at all
sir egad not one jot sir Suppose quothaha ha ha Walks away

Johns Phoo prithee Bayes dont mind what he says he is a fellow
newly come out of the country he knows nothing of whats the relish
here of the town

Bayes If I writ sir to please the country I should have followd
the old plain way but I write for some persons of quality and peculiar
friends of mine that understand what flame and power in writing is and
they do me the right sir to approve of what I do

Johns Ay ay they will clap I warrant you never fear it

Bayes Im sure the designs good that cannot be denied And then
for language egad I defy em all in nature to mend it Besides sir
I have printed above a hundred sheets of paper to insinuate the plot
into the boxes and withal have appointed two or three dozen of my
friends to be ready in the pit who Im sure will clap and so the
rest you know must follow and then pray sir what becomes of your
suppose Ha ha ha

Johns Nay if the business be so well laid it cannot miss

Bayes I think so sir and therefore would choose this to be the
prologue For if I could engage em to clap before they see the play
you know it would be so much the better because then they were engagd
for let a man write ever so well there are nowadays a sort of
persons they call critics that egad have no more wit in them than so
many hobbyhorses but theyll laugh at you sir and find fault and
censure things that egad Im sure they are not able to do themselves
A sort of envious persons that emulate the glories of persons of parts
and think to build their fame by calumniating of persons that egad
to my knowledge of all persons in the world are in nature the persons
that do as much despise all that asa In fine Ill say no more of em

Johns Nay you have said enough of em in all conscience Im sure
more than theyll eer be able to answer

Bayes Why Ill tell you sir sincerely and bon fide were it not
for the sake of some ingenious persons and choice female spirits that
have a value for me I would see em all hangd egad before I would
eer more set pen to paper but let em live in ignorance like ingrates

Johns Ay marry that were a way to be revengd of em indeed and if
I were in your place now I would do so

Bayes No sir there are certain ties upon me that I cannot be
disengagd from otherwise I would But pray sir how do you like my
hangman

Smith By my troth sir I should like him very well

Bayes By how do you like it sir for I see you can judge would
you have it for a prologue or the epilogue

Johns Faith sir tis so good let it een serve for both

Bayes No no that wont do Besides I have made another

Johns What other sir

Bayes Why sir my other is Thunder and Lightning

Johns Thats greater Id rather stick to that

Bayes Do you think so Ill tell you then tho there have been many
witty prologues written of late yet I think youll say this is a non
pareillo Im sure nobody has hit upon it yet For here sir I make
my prologue to be a dialogue and as in my first you see I strive to
oblige the auditors by civility by good nature good language and all
that so in this by the other way in terrorem I choose for the
persons Thunder and Lightning Do you apprehend the conceit

Johns Phoo phoo then you have it cocksure Theyll be hangd before
theyll dare affront an author that has em at that lock

Bayes I have made too one of the most delicate dainty similes in the
whole world egad if I knew but how to apply it

Smith Lets hear it I pray you

    Bayes Tis an allusion to love
             So boar and sow when any storm is nigh
              Snuff up and smell it gathring in the sky
              Boar beckons sow to trot in chestnutgroves
              And there consummate their unfinishd loves
              Pensive in mud they wallow all alone
              And snore and gruntle to each others moan

    How do you like it now ha

Johns Faith tis extraordinary fine and very applicable to Thunder
and Lightning methinks because it speaks of a storm

Bayes Egad and so it does now I think ont Mr Johnson I thank
you and Ill put it in profecto Come out Thunder and Lightning

Enter THUNDER and LIGHTNING

Thun I am the bold Thunder

Bayes Mr Cartwright prithee speak that a little louder and with a
hoarse voice I am the bold Thunder pshaw speak it me in a voice that
thunders it out indeed I am the bold Thunder

    Thun I am the bold Thunder

    Light The brisk Lightning I

    Bayes Nay you must be quick and nimble
    The brisk Lightning I Thats my meaning

    Thun I am the bravest Hector of the sky

    Light And I fair Helen that made Hector die

    Thun I strike men down

    Light I fire the town

    Thun Let critics take heed how they grumble
    For then begin I for to rumble

    Light Let the ladies allow us their graces
    Or Ill blast all the paint on their faces
    And dry up their petre to soot

    Thun Let the critics look tot

    Light Let the ladies look tot

    Thun For Thunder will dot

    Light For Lightning will shoot

    Thun Ill give you dash for dash

    Light Ill give you flash for flash
    Gallants Ill singe your feather

    Thun Ill thunder you together

Both Look tot look tot well dot well dot Look tot well
dot

                                   Twice or thrice repeated
                                                Exeunt ambo

Bayes Theres no more Tis but a flash of a prologue a droll

Smith Yes tis short indeed but very terrible

Bayes Ay when the similes in it will do to a miracle egad Come
come begin the play

Enter FIRST PLAYER

st Play Sir Mr Ivory is not come yet but hell be here presently
hes but two doors off

Bayes Come then gentlemen lets go out and take a pipe of tobacco

                                                     Exeunt

                                   


ACT IISCENE I

BAYES JOHNSON and SMITH

Bayes Now sir because Ill do nothing here that ever was done
before instead of beginning with a scene that discovers something of the
plot I begin this play with a whisper

Smith Umph very new indeed

Bayes Come take your seats Begin sirs

Enter GENTLEMANUSHER and PHYSICIAN

Phys Sir by your habit I should guess you to be the Gentlemanusher
of this sumptuous place

Ush And by your gait and fashion I should almost suspect you rule
the healths of both our noble kings under the notion of Physician

Phys You hit my function right

Ush And you mine

Phys Then lets embrace

Ush Come

Phys Come

Johns Pray sir who are those so very civil persons

Bayes Why sir the gentlemanusher and physician of the two kings of
Brentford

Johns But pray then how comes it to pass that they know one another
no better

Bayes Phoo thats for the better carrying on of the plot

Johns Very well

Phys Sir to conclude

Smith What before he begins

Bayes No sir you must know they had been talking of this a pretty
while without

Smith Where in the tyringroom

Bayes Why ay sir Hes so dull come speak again

Phys Sir to conclude the place you fill has more than amply exacted
the talents of a wary pilot and all these threatning storms which
like impregnate clouds hover oer our heads will when they once are
grasped but by the eye of reason melt into fruitful showers of blessings
on the people

Bayes Pray mark that allegory Is not that good

Johns Yes that grasping of a storm with the eye is admirable

    Phys But yet some rumours great are stirring and if Lorenzo
    should prove false which none but the great gods can tell you
    then perhaps would find that               Whispers

    Bayes Now he whispers

    Ush Alone do you say

    Phys No attended with the noble        Whispers

    Bayes Again

    Ush Who he in grey

    Phys Yes and at the head of            Whispers

    Bayes Pray mark

    Ush Then sir most certain twill in time appear
    These are the reasons that have movd him tot
    First he                                  Whispers

    Bayes Now the other whispers

    Ush Secondly they                      Whispers

    Bayes At it still

    Ush Thirdly and lastly both he and they Whispers

Bayes Now they both whisper Exeunt whispering Now gentlemen
pray tell me true and without flattery is not this a very odd beginning
of a play

Johns In troth I think it is sir But why two kings of the same
place

Bayes Why because its new and thats it I aim at I despise your
Jonson and Beaumont that borrowed all they writ from nature I am for
fetching it purely out of my own fancy I

Smith But what think you of Sir John Suckling

Bayes By gad I am a better poet than he

Smith Well sir but pray why all this whispering

Bayes Why sir besides that it is new as I told you before because
they are supposed to be politicians and matters of state ought not to be
divulgd

Smith But then sir why

Bayes Sir if youll but respite your curiosity till the end of the
fifth act youll find it a piece of patience not ill recompensed

Goes to the door

Johns How dost thou like this Frank Is it not just as I told thee

Smith Why I never did before this see anything in nature and all
that as Mr Bayes says so foolish but I could give some guess at what
moved the fop to do it but this I confess does go beyond my reach

Johns It is all alike Mr Wintershull has informed me of this
play already And Ill tell thee Frank thou shalt not see one scene
here worth one farthing or like anything thou canst imagine has ever
been the practice of the world And then when he comes to what he calls
good language it is as I told thee very fantastical most abominably
dull and not one word to the purpose

Smith It does surprise me Im sure very much

Johns Ay but it wont do so long by that time thou hast seen a play
or two that Ill show thee thou wilt be pretty well acquainted with
this new kind of foppery

Smith Plague ont but theres no pleasure in him hes too gross a
fool to be laughd at

Enter BAYES

Johns Ill swear Mr Bayes you have done this scene most admirably
tho I must tell you sir it is a very difficult matter to pen a whisper
well

Bayes Ay gentlemen when you come to write yourselves on my word
youll find it so

Johns Have a care of what you say Mr Bayes for Mr Smith there I
assure you has written a great many fine things already

Bayes Has he ifackins why then pray sir how do you do when you
write

Smith Faith sir for the most part I am in pretty good health

Bayes Ay but I mean what do you do when you write

Smith I take pen ink and paper and sit down

Bayes Now I write standing thats one thing and then another thing
is with what do you prepare yourself

Smith Prepare myself what the devil does the fool mean

Bayes Why Ill tell you now what I do If I am to write familiar
things as sonnets to Armida and the like I make use of stewd prunes
only but when I have a grand design in hand I ever take physic and
let blood for when you would have pure swiftness of thought and fiery
flights of fancy you must have a care of the pensive part In fine you
must purge the stomach

Smith By my troth sir this is a most admirable receipt for writing

Bayes Ay tis my secret and in good earnest I think one of the
best I have

Smith In good faith sir and that may very well be

Bayes May be sir Egad Im sure ont Experto crede Roberto But I
must give you this caution by the way be sure you never take snuff
when you write

Smith Why so sir

Bayes Why it spoild me once egad one of the sparkishest plays in
all England But a friend of mine at Gresham College has promised to
help me to some spirit of brains and egad that shall do my business


SCENE II

Enter the two KINGS hand in hand

Bayes Oh these are now the two kings of Brentford take notice of
their style twas never yet upon the stage but if you like it I could
make a shift perhaps to show you a whole play writ all just so

st King Did you observe their whispers brother king

    nd King I did and heard besides a grave bird sing
    That they intend sweetheart to play us pranks

Bayes This is now familiar because they are both persons of the same
quality

Smith Sdeath this would make a man sick

    st King If that design appears
              Ill lug them by the ears
              Until I make em crack

nd King And so will I ifack

st King You must begin Ma foy

nd King Sweet sir Pardonnez moy

Bayes Mark that I make em both speak French to show their breeding

Johns Oh tis extraordinary fine

    nd King Then spite of fate well thus combined stand
                     And like two brothers walk still hand in hand
                                               Exeunt Reges

Johns This is a majestic scene indeed

Bayes Ay tis a crust a lasting crust for your roguecritics egad
I would fain see the proudest of em all but dare to nibble at this
egad if they do this shall rub their gums for em I promise you It
was I you must know that have written a whole play just in this very
same style it was never acted yet

Johns How so

Bayes Egad I can hardly tell you for laughing ha ha ha it is so
pleasant a story ha ha ha

Smith What ist

Bayes Egad the players refuse to act it Ha ha ha

Smith Thats impossible

Bayes Egad they did it sir pointblank refusd it egad ha ha ha

Johns Fie that was rude

Bayes Rude ay egad they are the rudest uncivillest persons and
all that in the whole world egad Egad theres no living with em
I have written Mr Johnson I do verily believe a whole cartload of
things every whit as good as this and yet I vow to gad these insolent
rascals have turnd em all back upon my hands again

Johns Strange fellows indeed

Smith But pray Mr Bayes how came these two kings to know of this
whisper for as I remember they were not present at it

Bayes No but thats the actors fault and not mine for the two
kings should a plague take em have poppd both their heads in at the
door just as the other went off

Smith That indeed would have done it

Bayes Done it ay egad these fellows are able to spoil the best
things in Christendom Ill tell you Mr Johnson I vow to gad I have
been so highly disobligd by the peremptoriness of these fellows that
Im resolved hereafter to bend my thoughts wholly for the service of the
nursery and mump your proud players egad So now Prince Prettyman
comes in and falls asleep making love to his mistress which you know
was a grand intrigue in a late play written by a very honest gentleman
a knight


SCENE III

Enter PRINCE PRETTYMAN

    Pret How strange a captive am I grown of late
    Shall I accuse my love or blame my fate
    My love I cannot that is too divine
    And against fate what mortal dares repine

Enter CHLORIS

    But here she comes
    Sure tis some blazing comet is it not      Lies down

    Bayes Blazing comet mark that egad very fine

    Pret But I am so surprisd with sleep I cannot speak the
    rest                                            Sleeps

Bayes Does not that now surprise you to fall asleep in the nick
his spirits exhale with the heat of his passion and all that and swop
he falls asleep as you see Now here she must make a simile

Smith Wheres the necessity of that Mr Bayes

Bayes Because shes surprisd Thats a general rule you must ever
make a simile when you are surprisd tis the new way of writing

    Cloris As some tall pine which we on tna find
    T have stood the rage of many a boistrous wind
    Feeling without that flames within do play
    Which would consume his root and sap away
    He spreads his worsted arms unto the skies
    Silently grieves all pale repines and dies
    So shrouded up your bright eye disappears
    Break forth bright scorching sun and dry my tears
                                                       Exit

Johns Mr Bayes methinks this simile wants a little application too

Bayes No faith for it alludes to passion to consuming to dying
and all that which you know are the natural effects of an amour But
Im afraid this scene has made you sad for I must confess when I writ
it I wept myself

Smith No truly sir my spirits are almost exhald too and I am
likelier to fall asleep

PRINCE PRETTYMAN starts up and says

    Pret It is resolved                            Exit

Bayes Thats all

Smith Mr Bayes may one be so bold as to ask you one question now
and you not be angry

Bayes O Lord sir you may ask me anything what you please I vow to
gad you do me a great deal of honour you do not know me if you say
that sir

Smith Then pray sir what is it that this prince here has resolved in
his sleep

Bayes Why I must confess that question is well enough asked for one
that is not acquainted with this new way of writing But you must know
sir that to outdo all my fellowwriters whereas they keep their intrigo
secret till the very last scene before the dance I now sir do you
mark mea

Smith Begin the play and end it without ever opening the plot at all

Bayes I do so thats the very plain truth ont ha ha ha I do
egad If they cannot find it out themselves een let em alone for
Bayes I warrant you But here now is a scene of business pray observe
it for I dare say youll think it no unwise discourse this nor ill
argued To tell you true tis a discourse I overheard once betwixt two
grand sober governing persons


SCENE IV

Enter GENTLEMANUSHER and PHYSICIAN

Ush Come sir lets state the matter of fact and lay our heads
together

Phys Right lay our heads together I love to be merry sometimes but
when a knotty point comes I lay my head close to it with a snuffbox in
my hand and then I fegue it away ifaith

Bayes I do just so egad always

Ush The grand question is whether they heard us whisper which I
divide thus

Phys Yes it must be divided so indeed

Smith Thats very complaisant I swear Mr Bayes to be of another
mans opinion before he knows what it is

Bayes Nay I bring in none here but wellbred persons I assure you

Ush I divide the question into when they heard what they heard and
whether they heard or no

Johns Most admirably divided I swear

Ush As to the when you say just now so that is answerd Then as
for what why that answers itself for what could they hear but what
we talkd of so that naturally and of necessity we come to the last
question videlicet whether they heard or no

Smith This is a very wise scene Mr Bayes

Bayes Ay you have it right they are both politicians

Ush Pray then to proceed in method let me ask you that question

Phys No youll answer better pray let me ask it you

Ush Your will must be a law

Phys Come then what ist I must ask

Smith This politician I perceive Mr Bayes has somewhat a short
memory

Bayes Why sir you must know that tother is the main politician
and this is but his pupil

Ush You must ask me whether they heard us whisper

Phys Well I do so

Ush Say it then

Smith Heyday heres the bravest work that ever I saw

Johns This is mighty methodical

Bayes Ay sir thats the way tis the way of art there is no other
way egad in business

Phys Did they hear us whisper

Ush Why truly I cant tell theres much to be said upon the word
whisper to whisper in Latin is susurrare which is as much as to
say to speak softly now if they heard us speak softly they heard us
whisper but then comes in the quomodo the how how did they hear
us whisper why as to that there are two ways the one by chance or
accident the other on purpose that is with design to hear us whisper

Phys Nay if they heard us that way Ill never give them physic more

Ush Nor I eer more will walk abroad before em

Bayes Pray mark this for a great deal depends upon it towards the
latter end of the play

Smith I suppose thats the reason why you brought in this scene Mr
Bayes

Bayes Partly it was sir but I confess I was not unwilling besides
to show the world a pattern here how men should talk of business

Johns You have done it exceeding well indeed

Bayes Yes I think this will do

Phys Well if they heard us whisper they will turn us out and nobody
else will take us

Smith Not for politicians I dare answer for it

    Phys Lets then no more ourselves in vain bemoan
    We are not safe until we them unthrone

    Ush Tis right
    And since occasion now seems debonair
    Ill seize on this and you shall take that chair

They draw their swords and sit in the two great chairs upon the stage

Bayes Theres now an odd surprise the whole states turned quite
topsyturvy without any pother or stir in the whole world egad

Johns A very silent change of government truly as ever I heard of

Bayes It is so And yet you shall see me bring em in again
byandby in as odd a way every jot

The Usurpers march out flourishing their swords

Enter SHIRLY

    Shir Heyho heyho what a change is here heyday heyday
    I know not what to do nor what to say        Exit

Johns Mr Bayes in my opinion now that gentleman might have said
a little more upon this occasion

Bayes No sir not at all for I underwrit his part on purpose to set
off the rest

Johns Cry you mercy sir

Smith But pray sir how came they to depose the kings so easily

Bayes Why sir you must know they long had a design to do it before
but never could put it in practice till now and to tell you true thats
one reason why I made em whisper so at first

Smith Oh very well now Im fully satisfied

Bayes And then to show you sir it was not done so very easily
neither in the next scene you shall see some fighting

Smith Oh oh so then you make the struggle to be after the business
is done

Bayes Ay

Smith Oh I conceive you that I swear is very natural


SCENE V

Enter four Men at one door and four at another with their swords
drawn

st Sold Stand Who goes there

nd Sold A friend

st Sold What friend

nd Sold A friend to the house

    st Sold Fall on          They all kill one another
                                              Music strikes

    Bayes Hold hold            To the music It ceases
    Now heres an odd surprise all these dead men you shall see
    rise up presently at a certain note that I have in effaut flat
    and fall adancing Do you hear dead men remember your
    note in effaut flat
    Play on                                   To the music
    Now now now    The music plays his note and the dead men
                                rise but cannot get in order
    O Lord O Lord Out out out did ever men spoil a good
    thing so no figure no ear no time nothing Udzookers you
    dance worse than the angels in Harry the Eighth or the fat
    spirits in the Tempest egad

st Sold Why sir tis impossible to do anything in time to this
tune

Bayes O Lord O Lord impossible Why gentlemen if there be any
faith in a person thats a Christian I sat up two whole nights in
composing this air and apting it for the business for if you observe
there are two several designs in this tune it begins swift and ends
slow You talk of time and time you shall see me do it Look you now
here I am dead

                               Lies down flat upon his face

    Now mark my note effaut flat Strike up music
    Now        As he rises up hastily he falls down again
    Ah gadzookers I have broke my nose

Johns By my troth Mr Bayes this is a very unfortunate note of
yours in effaut

Bayes A plague on this old stage with your nails and your
tenterhooks that a gentleman cant come to teach you to act but he
must break his nose and his face and the devil and all Pray sir can
you help me to a wet piece of brown paper

Smith No indeed sir I dont usually carry any about me

nd Sold Sir Ill go get you some within presently

Bayes Go go then I follow you Pray dance out the dance and Ill
be with you in a moment Remember you dance like horsemen

                                                 Exit BAYES

    Smith Like horsemen what a plague can that be

    They dance the dance but can make nothing of it

    st Sold A devil lets try this no longer Play my dance
    that Mr Bayes found fault with so   Dance and Exeunt

    Smith What can this fool be doing all this while about his
    nose

    Johns Prithee lets go see                   Exeunt


                                   


ACT IIISCENE I

BAYES with a paper on his nose and the two Gentlemen

Bayes Now sirs this I do because my fancy in this play is to end
every act with a dance

Smith Faith that fancy is very good but I should hardly have broke
my nose for it tho

Johns That fancy I suppose is new too

Bayes Sir all my fancies are so I tread upon no mans heels but
make my flight upon my own wings I assure you Now here comes in a
scene of sheer wit without any mixture in the whole world egad between
Prince Prettyman and his tailor it might properly enough be calld a
prize of wit for you shall see them come in one upon another snipsnap
hit for hit as fast as can be First one speaks then presently
tothers upon him slap with a repartee then he at him again dash
with a new conceit and so eternally eternally egad till they go quite
off the stage Goes to call the Players

Smith What a plague does this fop mean by his snip snap hit for hit
and dash

Johns Mean why he never meant anything ins life what dost talk of
meaning for

Enter BAYES

Bayes Why dont you come in

Enter PRINCE PRETTYMAN and TOM THIMBLE

This scene will make you die with laughing if it be well acted for tis
as full of drollery as ever it can hold Tis like an orange stuffd with
cloves as for conceit

Pret But prithee Tom Thimble why wilt thou needs marry if nine
tailors make but one man what work art thou cutting out here for
thyself trow

Bayes Good

Thim Why ant please your highness if I cant make up all the work
I cut out I shant want journeymen enow to help me I warrant you

Bayes Good again

Pret I am afraid thy journeymen tho Tom wont work by the day

Bayes Good still

Thim However if my wife sits but as I do there will be no
great danger not half so much as when I trusted you sir for your
coronationsuit

Bayes Very good ifaith

Pret Why the times then livd upon trust it was the fashion You
would not be out of time at such a time as that sure a tailor you
know must never be out of fashion

Bayes Right

Thim Im sure sir I made your clothes in the courtfashion for you
never paid me yet

Bayes Theres a bob for the court

Pret Why Tom thou art a sharp rogue when thou art angry I see thou
payst me now methinks

Bayes Theres pay upon pay as good as ever was written egad

Thim Ay sir in your own coin you give me nothing but words

Bayes Admirable

Pret Well Tom I hope shortly I shall have another coin for thee for
now the wars are coming on I shall grow to be a man of metal

Bayes Oh you did not do that half enough

Johns Methinks he does it admirably

Bayes Ay pretty well but he does not hit me int he does not top
his part

Thim Thats the way to be stampd yourself sir I shall see you come
home like an angel for the kings evil with a hole bord thro you

                                                     Exeunt

Bayes Ha there he has hit it up to the hilts egad How do you like
it now gentlemen is not this pure wit

Smith Tis snipsnap sir as you say but methinks not pleasant nor
to the purpose for the play does not go on

Bayes Play does not go on I dont know what you mean why is not
this part of the play

Smith Yes but the plot stands still

Bayes Plot stand still why what a devil is the plot good for but to
bring in fine things

Smith Oh I did not know that before

Bayes No I think you did not nor many things more that I am master
of Now sir egad this is the bane of all us writers let us soar
but never so little above the common pitch egad alls spoild for
the vulgar never understand it they can never conceive you sir the
excellency of these things

Johns Tis a sad fate I must confess but you write on still for all
that

Bayes Write on Ay egad I warrant you Tis not their talk shall
stop me if they catch me at that lock Ill give them leave to hang me
As long as I know my things are good what care I what they say What
are they gone without singing my last new song sbud would it were in
their bellies Ill tell you Mr Johnson if I have any skill in these
matters I vow to gad this song is peremptorily the very best that ever
yet was written you must know it was made by Tom Thimbles first wife
after she was dead

Smith How sir after she was dead

Bayes Ay sir after she was dead Why what have you to say to that

Johns Say why nothing He were a devil that had anything to say to
that

Bayes Right

Smith How did she come to die pray sir

Bayes Phoo thats no matter by a fall but heres the conceit that
upon his knowing she was killd by an accident he supposes with a sigh
that she died for love of him

Johns Ay ay thats well enough lets hear it Mr Bayes

Bayes Tis to the tune of Farewell fair Armida on seas and in
battles in bullets and all that


SONG

    In swords pikes and bullets tis safer to be
    Than in a strong castle remoted from thee
    My deaths bruise pray think you gave me tho a fall
    Did give it me more from the top of a wall
    For then if the moat on her mud would first lay
    And after before you my body convey
    The blue on my breast when you happen to see
    Youll say with a sigh theres a true blue for me

Ha rogues when I am merry I write these things as fast as hops egad
for you must know I am as pleasant a cavalier as ever you saw I am
ifaith

Smith But Mr Bayes how comes this song in here for methinks there
is no great occasion for it

Bayes Alack sir you know nothing you must ever interlard your plays
with songs ghosts and dances if you mean toa

Johns Pit box and gallery Mr Bayes

Bayes Egad and you have nickd it Hark you Mr Johnson you know
I dont flatter egad you have a great deal of wit

Johns O Lord sir you do me too much honour

Bayes Nay nay come come Mr Johnson ifaith this must not be said
amongst us that have it I know you have wit by the judgment you make
of this play for thats the measure we go by my play is my touchstone
When a man tells me such a one is a person of parts is he so say I
what do I do but bring him presently to see this play if he likes it
I know what to think of him if not your most humble servant sir Ill
no more of him upon my word I thank you I am Clara voyant egad Now
here we go on to our business


SCENE II

Enter the two USURPERS hand in hand

    Ush But whats become of Volscius the Great

question you ask

Smith Cry you mercy sir

    Cor His highness sirs commanded me to tell you
    That the fair person whom you both do know
    Despairing of forgiveness for her fault
    In a deep sorrow twice she did attempt
    Upon her precious life but by the care
    Of standersby prevented was

    Smith Why what stuffs here

    Cor At last
    Volscius the Great this dire resolve embracd
    His servants he into the country sent
    And he himself to Piccadilly went

    Ush Dead is that possible dead

    Phys O ye gods                               Exeunt

Bayes Theres a smart expression of a passion O ye gods thats one
of my bold strokes egad

Smith Yes but whos the fair person thats dead

Bayes That you shall know anon sir

Smith Nay if we know at all tis well enough

Bayes Perhaps you may find too byandby for all this that shes

Ama Thanks to the powers above for this deliverance I hope

    Its slow beginning will portend
    A forward exit to all future end

Bayes Pish there you are out to all future end no no to all
future END You must lay the accent upon end or else you lose the
conceit

Smith I see you are very perfect in these matters

Bayes Ay sir I have been long enough at it one would think to know
something

Enter SOLDIERS dragging in an old FISHERMAN

    Ama Villain what monster did corrupt thy mind

    Ama So drag him hence
    Till torture of the rack produce his sense      Exeunt

Bayes Mark how I make the horror of his guilt confound his intellects
for hes out at one and tother and thats the design of this scene

Smith I see sir you have a several design for every scene

Bayes Ay thats my way of writing and so sir I can dispatch you a
whole play before another man egad can make an end of his plot


SCENE IV

So now enter Prince Prettyman in a rage Where the devil is he why
Prettyman why where I say O fie fie fie fie alls marrd I vow to
gad quite marrd

Enter PRETTYMAN

Phoo phoo you are come too late sir now you may go out again if you
please I vow to gad MraI would not give a button for my play now
you have done this

Pret What sir

Bayes What sir why sir you should have come out in choler rouse
upon the stage just as the other went off Must a man be eternally
telling you of these things

Johns Sure this must be some very notable matter that hes so angry at

Smith I am not of your opinion

Bayes Pish come lets hear your part sir

    PretBring in my father why dye keep him from me
    Altho a fisherman he is my father
    Was ever son yet brought to this distress
    To be for being a son made fatherless
    Ah you just gods rob me not of a father
    The being of a son take from me rather            Exit

Smith Well Ned what think you now

Johns A devil this is worst of all Mr Bayes pray whats the
meaning of this scene

Bayes O cry you mercy sir I protest I had forgot to tell you Why
sir you must know that long before the beginning of this play this
prince was taken by a fisherman

Smith How sir taken prisoner

Bayes Taken prisoner O Lord what a questions there did ever any
man ask such a questions Plague on him he has put the plot quite out of
my head with thisthisquestion what was I going to say

Johns Nay Heaven knows I cannot imagine

Bayes Stay let me see taken O tis true Why sir as I was going
to say his highness here the prince was taken in a cradle by a
fisherman and brought up as his child

Smith Indeed

Bayes Nay prithee hold thy peace And so sir this murder being
committed by the riverside the fisherman upon suspicion was seizd
and thereupon the prince grew angry

Smith So so now tis very plain

Johns But Mr Bayes is not this some disparagement to a prince to
pass for a fishermans son Have a care of that I pray

Bayes No no not at all for tis but for a while I shall fetch him
off again presently you shall see

Enter PRETTYMAN and THIMBLE

    Pret By all the gods Ill set the world on fire
    Rather than let em ravish hence my sire

    Thim Brave Prettyman it is at length reveald
    That he is not thy sire who thee conceald

Bayes Lo you now there hes off again

Johns Admirably done ifaith

Bayes Ay now the plot thickens very much upon us

    Pret What oracle this darkness can evince
    Sometimes a fishers son sometimes a prince
    It is a secret great as is the world
    In which I like the soul am tossd and hurld
    The blackest ink of Fate sure was my lot
    And when she writ my name she made a blot        Exit

Bayes Theres a blustering verse for you now

Smith Yes sir but why is he so mightily troubled to find he is not
a fishermans son

Bayes Phoo that is not because he has a mind to be his son but for
fear he should be thought to be nobodys son at all

Smith Nay that would trouble a man indeed

Bayes So let me see


SCENE V

Enter PRINCE VOLSCIUS going out of town

Smith I thought he had been gone to Piccadilly

Bayes Yes he gave it out so but that was only to cover his design

Johns What design

Bayes Why to head the army that lies conceald for him at
Knightsbridge

Johns I see heres a great deal of plot Mr Bayes

Bayes Yes now it begins to break but we shall have a world of more
business anon

Enter PRINCE VOLSCIUS CLORIS AMARYLLIS and HARRY with a
ridingcloak and boots

    Ama Sir you are cruel thus to leave the town
    And to retire to country solitude

    Clo We hopd this summer that we should at least
    Have held the honour of your company

Bayes Held the honour of your company prettily expressd held the
honour of your company gadzookers these fellows will never take notice
of anything

Johns I assure you sir I admire it extremely I dont know what he
does

Bayes Ay ay hes a little envious but tis no great matter Come

    Ama Pray let us two this single boon obtain
    That you will here with poor us still remain
    Before your horses come pronounce our fate
    For then alas I fear twill be too late

    Bayes Sad
    Harry my boots for Ill go range among

Vols My blades encampd and quit this urban throng

Smith But pray Mr Bayes is not this a little difficult that you
were saying een now to keep an army thus conceald in Knightsbridge

Bayes In Knightsbridge stay

Johns No not if the innkeepers be his friends

Bayes His friends ay sir his intimate acquaintance or else indeed
I grant it could not be

Smith Yes faith so it might be very easy

Bayes Nay if I do not make all things easy egad Ill give you leave
to hang me Now you would think that hes going out of town but you
shall see how prettily I have contrivd to stop him presently

Smith By my troth sir you have so amazd me that I know not what to
think

Enter PARTHENOPE

    Vols Bless me how frail are all my best resolves
    How in a moment is my purpose changd
    Too soon I thought myself secure from love
    Fair madam give me leave to ask her name
    Who does so gently rob me of my fame
    For I should meet the army out of town
    And if I fail must hazard my renown

    Par My mother sir sells ale by the townwalls
    And me her dear Parthenope she calls

Bayes Now thats the Parthenope I told you of

Johns Ay ay egad you are very right

    Vols Can vulgar vestments highborn beauty shroud
    Thou bringst the morning picturd in a cloud

Bayes The morning picturd in a cloud ah gadzookers what a conceit
is there

Par Give you good even sir Exit

Vols O inauspicious stars that I was born To sudden love and to more
sudden scorn

Ama  How Prince Volscius in love ha ha ha Clo  Exeunt
laughing

Smith Sure Mr Bayes we have lost some jest here that they laugh at
so

Bayes Why did you not observe he first resolves to go out of town
and then as hes pulling on his boots falls in love with her ha ha ha

Smith Well and where lies the jest of that

Bayes Ha Turns to JOHNS

Johns Why in the boots where should the jest lie

    Bayes Egad you are in the right it does lie in the boots
     Turns to SMITH
    Your friend and I know where a good jest lies though you dont sir

Smith Much good dot you sir

Bayes Here now Mr Johnson you shall see a combat betwixt love and
honour An ancient author has made a whole play ont but I have
dispatchd it all in this scene

VOLSCIUS sits down to pull on his boots BAYES stands by and
overacts the part as he speaks it

    Vols How has my passion made me Cupids scoff
    This hasty boot is on the other off
    And sullen lies with amorous design
    To quit loud fame and make that beauty mine

Smith Prithee mark what pains Mr Bayes takes to act this speech
himself

Johns Yes the fool I see is mightily transported with it

    Vols My legs the emblem of my various thought
    Show to what sad distraction I am brought
    Sometimes with stubborn honour like this boot
    My mind is guarded and resolvd to dot
    Sometimes again that very mind by love
    Disarmd like this other leg does prove
    Shall I to honour or to love give way
    Go on cries honour tender love says nay
    Honour aloud commands pluck both boots on
    But softer love does whisper put on none
    What shall I do what conduct shall I find
    To lead me thro this twilight of my mind
    For as bright day with black approach of night
    Contending makes a doubtful puzzling light
    So does my honour and my love together
    Puzzle me so I can resolve for neither
        Goes out hopping with one boot on and tother off

Johns By my troth sir this is as difficult a combat as ever I saw
and as equal for tis determind on neither side

Bayes Ay ist not now egad ha for to go off hiphop hiphop upon
this occasion is a thousand times better than any conclusion in the
world egad

Johns Indeed Mr Bayes that hiphop in this place as you say does
a very great deal

Bayes Oh all in all sir they are these little things that mar
or set you off a play as I remember once in a play of mine I set
off a scene egad beyond expectation only with a petticoat and the
gripes

Smith Pray how was that sir

Bayes Why sir I contrivd a petticoat to be brought in upon a chair
nobody knew how into a princes chamber whose father was not to see
it that came in by chance

Johns Bymylife that was a notable contrivance indeed

Smith Ay but Mr Bayes how could you contrive the stomachache

Bayes The easiest i th world egad Ill tell you how I made the
prince sit down upon the petticoat no more than so and pretended to his
father that he had just then got the gripes whereupon his father went
out to call a physician and his man ran away with the petticoat

Smith Well and what followd upon that

Bayes Nothing no earthly thing I vow to gad

Johns On my word Mr Bayes there you hit it

Bayes Yes it gave a world of content And then I paid em away
besides for it made them all talk beastly ha ha ha beastly
downright beastly upon the stage egad ha ha ha but with an infinite
deal of wit that I must say

Johns That ay that we know well enough can never fail you

Bayes No egad cant it Come bring in the dance

                                   Exit to call the Players

Smith Now the plague take thee for a silly confident unnatural
fulsome rogue

Enter BAYES and PLAYERS

Bayes Pray dance well before these gentlemen you are commonly so
lazy but you should be light and easy tah tah tah

              All the while they dance BAYES puts them out
                with teaching them

Well gentlemen youll see this dance if I am not deceivd take very
well upon the stage when they are perfect in their motions and all that

Smith I dont know how twill take sir but I am sure you sweat hard
fort

Bayes Ay sir it costs me more pains and trouble to do these things
than almost the things are worth

Smith By my troth I think so sir

Bayes Not for the things themselves for I could write you sir forty
of em in a day but egad these players are such dull persons that if
a man be not by em upon every point and at every turn egad theyll
mistake you sir and spoil all

Enter a PLAYER

What is the funeral ready

Play Yes sir

Bayes And is the lance filld with wine

Play Sir tis just now adoing

Bayes Stay then Ill do it myself

Smith Come lets go with him

Bayes A match But Mr Johnson egad I am not like other persons
they care not what becomes of their things so they can but get money
for em now egad when I write if it be not just as it should be in
every circumstance to every particular egad I am no more able to
endure it I am not myself Im out of my wits and all that Im the
strangest person in the whole world for what care I for money I write
for reputation

                                                     Exeunt

                                   


ACT IVSCENE I

BAYES and the two Gentlemen

Bayes Gentlemen because I would not have any two things alike in this
play the last act beginning with a witty scene of mirth I make this to
begin with a funeral

Smith And is that all your reason for it Mr Bayes

Bayes No sir I have a precedent for it besides A person of honour
and a scholar brought in his funeral just so and he was one let
me tell you that knew as well what belongd to a funeral as any man in
England egad

Johns Nay if that be so you are safe

Bayes Egad but I have another device a frolic which I think yet
better than all this not for the plot or characters for in my heroic
plays I make no difference as to those matters but for another
contrivance

Smith What is that I pray

Bayes Why I have designd a conquest that cannot possibly egad be
acted in less than a whole week and Ill speak a bold word it shall
drum trumpet shout and battle egad with any the most warlike tragedy
we have either ancient or modern

Johns Ay marry sir there you say something

Smith And pray sir how have you orderd this same frolic of yours

Bayes Faith sir by the rule of romance for example they divide
their things into three four five six seven eight or as many tomes
as they please Now I would very fain know what should hinder me from
doing the same with my things if I please

Johns Nay if you should not be master of your own works tis very
hard

Bayes That is my sense And then sir this contrivance of mine has
something of the reason of a play in it too for as every one makes you
five acts to one play what do I but make five plays to one plot by
which means the auditors have every day a new thing

Johns Most admirably good ifaith and must certainly take because
it is not tedious

Bayes Ay sir I know that theres the main point And then upon
Saturday to make a close of all for I ever begin upon a Monday I make
you sir a sixth play that sums up the whole matter to em and all
that for fear they should have forgot it

Johns That consideration Mr Bayes indeed I think will be very
necessary

Smith And when comes in your share pray sir

Bayes The third week

Johns I vow youll get a world of money

Bayes Why faith a man must live and if you dont thus pitch upon
some new device egad youll never dot for this age take it o my
word is somewhat hard to please But there is one pretty odd passage in
the last of these plays which may be executed two several ways wherein
Id have your opinion gentlemen

Johns What ist sir

Bayes Why sir I make a male person to be in love with a female

Smith Do you mean that Mr Bayes for a new thing

Bayes Yes sir as I have orderd it You shall hear he having
passionately lovd her through my five whole plays finding at last that
she consents to his love just after that his mother had appeard to him
like a ghost he kills himself thats one way The other is that she
coming at last to love him with as violent a passion as he lovd her
she kills herself Now my question is which of these two persons should
suffer upon this occasion

Johns By my troth it is a very hard case to decide

Bayes The hardest in the world egad and has puzzled this pate very
much What say you Mr Smith

Smith Why truly Mr Bayes if it might stand with your justice now
I would spare em both

Bayes Egad and I thinkhawhy then Ill make him hinder her from
killing herself Ay it shall be so Come come bring in the funeral

Enter a Funeral with the two USURPERS and Attendants

Lay it down there no no here sir So now speak

    K Ush    Set down the funeral pile and let our grief
    Receive from its embraces some relief

    K Phys Wast not unjust to ravish hence her breath
    And in lifes stead to leave us nought but death
    The world discovers now its emptiness
    And by her loss demonstrates we have less

Bayes Is not this good language now is not that elevate tis my
non ultra egad you must know they were both in love with her

Smith With her with whom

Bayes Why this is Lardellas funeral

Smith Lardella ay who is she

Bayes Why sir the sister of Drawcansir a lady that was drownd at
sea and had a wave for her windingsheet

    K Ush Lardella O Lardella from above
    Behold the tragic issues of our love
    Pity us sinking under grief and pain
    For thy being cast away upon the main

Bayes Look you now you see I told you true

Smith Ay sir and I thank you for it very kindly

Bayes Ay egad but you will not have patience honest Mrayou
will not have patience

Johns Pray Mr Bayes who is that Drawcansir

Bayes Why sir a fierce hero that frights his mistress snubs up
kings baffles armies and does what he will without regard to numbers
good manners or justice

Johns A very pretty character

Smith But Mr Bayes I thought your heroes had ever been men of great
humanity and justice

Bayes Yes they have been so but for my part I prefer that one
quality of singly beating of whole armies above all your moral virtues
put together egad You shall see him come in presently Zookers why
dont you read the paper

                                             To the Players

    K Phys O cry you mercy     Goes to take the paper

Bayes Pish nay you are such a fumbler Come Ill read it myself
Takes the paper from off the coffin Stay its an ill hand I must
use my spectacles This now is a copy of verses which I make Lardella
compose just as she is dying with design to have it pinnd upon her
coffin and so read by one of the usurpers who is her cousin

Smith A very shrewd design that upon my word Mr Bayes

Bayes And what do you think now I fancy her to make love like here
in this paper

Smith Like a woman what should she make love like

Bayes O my word you are out tho sir egad you are

Smith What then like a man

Bayes No sir like a humblebee

Smith I confess that I should not have fancyd

Bayes It may be so sir but it is tho in order to the opinion of
some of our ancient philosophers who held the transmigration of the soul

Smith Very fine

Bayes Ill read the title To my dear Couz King Physician

Smith Thats a little too familiar with a king tho sir by your
favour for a humblebee

Bayes Mr Smith in other things I grant your knowledge may be above
me but as for poetry give me leave to say I understand that better it
has been longer my practice it has indeed sir

    Smith Your servant sir

    Bayes Pray mark it                            Reads

        Since death my earthly part will thus remove
        Ill come a humblebee to your chaste love
        With silent wings Ill follow you dear couz
        Or else before you in the sunbeams buz
        And when to melancholy groves you come
        An airy ghost youll know me by my hum
        For sound being air a ghost does well become

    Smith after a pause Admirable

    Bayes At night into your bosom I will creep
    And buz but softly if you chance to sleep
    Yet in your dreams I will pass sweeping by
    And then both hum and buz before your eye

Johns By my troth thats a very great promise

Smith Yes and a most extraordinary comfort to boot

    Bayes Your bed of love from dangers I will free
    But most from love of any future bee
    And when with pity your heartstrings shall crack
    With empty arms Ill bear you on my back

Smith A pickapack a pickapack

Bayes Ay egad but is not that tuant now ha is it not tuant
Heres the end

    Then at your birth of immortality
    Like any wingd archer hence Ill fly
    And teach you your first fluttering in the sky

Johns Oh rare this is the most natural refined fancy that ever I
heard Ill swear

Bayes Yes I think for a dead person it is a good way enough of
making love for being divested of her terrestrial part and all that
she is only capable of these little pretty amorous designs that are
innocent and yet passionate Come draw your swords

    K Phys Come sword come sheath thyself within this breast
    Which only in Lardellas tomb can rest

    K Ush Come dagger come and penetrate this heart
    Which cannot from Lardellas love depart

Enter PALLAS

    Pal Hold stop your murdring hands
    At Pallass commands
    For the supposd dead O kings
    Forbear to act such deadly things
    Lardella lives I did but try
    If princes for their loves could die
    Such celestial constancy
    Shall by the gods rewarded be
    And from these funeral obsequies
    A nuptial banquet shall arise
              The coffin opens and a banquet is discovered

Bayes So take away the coffin Now tis out This is the very funeral
of the fair person which Volscius sent word was dead and Pallas you
see has turned it into a banquet

Smith Well but where is this banquet

Bayes Nay look you sir we must first have a dance for joy that
Lardella is not dead Pray sir give me leave to bring in my things
properly at least

Smith That indeed I had forgot I ask your pardon

Bayes Oh dye so sir I am glad you will confess yourself once in an
error Mr Smith

                          Dance

    K Ush Resplendent Pallas we in thee do find
    The fiercest beauty and a fiercer mind
    And since to thee Lardellas life we owe
    Well supple statues in thy temple grow

    K Phys Well since alive Lardellas found
    Let in full bowls her health go round
                           The two Usurpers take each of them
                                          a bowl in their hands

    K Ush But wheres the wine

    Pal That shall be mine
    Lo from this conquering lance
    Does flow the purest wine of France
                           Fills the bowls out of her lance
    And to appease your hunger I
    Have in my helmet brought a pie
    Lastly to bear a part with these
    Behold a buckler made of cheese      Vanish PALLAS

Bayes Thats the banquet Are you satisfied now sir

Johns By my troth now that is new and more than I expected

Bayes Yes I knew this would please you for the chief art in poetry
is to elevate your expectation and then bring you off some extraordinary
way

Enter DRAWCANSIR

K Phys What man is this that dares disturb our feast

    Draw He that dares drink and for that drink dares die
    And knowing this dares yet drink on am I

Johns That is Mr Bayes as much as to say that though he would
rather die than not drink yet he would fain drink for all that too

Bayes Right thats the conceit ont

Johns Tis a marvellous good one I swear

Bayes Now there are some critics that have advisd me to put out the
second dare and print must in the place ont but egad I think
tis better thus a great deal

Johns Whoo a thousand times

Bayes Go on then

    K Ush Sir if you please we should be glad to know
    How long you here will stay how soon youll go

Bayes Is not that now like a wellbred person egad so modest so
gent

Smith O very like

    Draw You shall not know how long I here will stay
    But you shall know Ill take your bowls away

    Snatches the bowls out of the kings hands and drinks them off

    Smith But Mr Bayes is that too modest and gent

    Bayes No egad sir but tis great

    K Ush Tho brother this grum stranger be a clown
    Hell leave us sure a little to gulp down

    Draw Whoeer to gulp one drop of this dare think
    Ill stare away his very power to drink

                       The two Kings sneak off the stage with
                         their attendants

    I drink I huff I strut look big and stare
    And all this I can do because I dare          Exit

Smith I suppose Mr Bayes this is the fierce hero you spoke of

Bayes Yes but this is nothing You shall see him in the last act
win above a dozen battles one after another egad as fast as they can
possibly come upon the stage

Johns That will be a fight worth the seeing indeed

Smith But pray Mr Bayes why do you make the kings let him use them
so scurvily

Bayes Phoo thats to raise the character of Drawcansir

Johns O my word that was well thought on

Bayes Now sirs Ill show you a scene indeed or rather indeed the
scene of scenes Tis an heroic scene

Smith And pray whats your design in this scene

Bayes Why sir my design is gilded truncheons forcd conceit smooth
verse and a rant in fine if this scene dont take egad Ill write no
more Come come in Mranay come in as many as you can Gentlemen
I must desire you to remove a little for I must fill the stage

Smith Why fill the stage

Bayes Oh sir because your heroic verse never sounds well but when
the stage is full


SCENE II

Enter PRINCE PRETTYMAN and PRINCE VOLSCIUS

Nay hold hold pray by your leave a little Look you sir the drift of
this scene is somewhat more than ordinary for I make em both fall out
because they are not in love with the same woman

Smith Not in love You mean I suppose because they are in love Mr
Bayes

Bayes No sir I say not in love theres a new conceit for you Now
speak

    Pret Since fate Prince Volscius now has found the way
    For our so longdfor meeting here this day
    Lend thy attention to my grand concern

    Vols I gladly would that story from thee learn
    But thou to love dost Prettyman incline
    Yet love in thy breast is not love in mine

    Bayes Antithesis thine and mine

    Pret Since love itselfs the same why should it be
    Diffring in you from what it is in me

    Bayes Reasoning egad I love reasoning in verse

    Vols Love takes camleonlike a various dye
    From every plant on which itself doth lie

    Bayes Simile

    Pret Let not thy love the course of nature fright
    Nature does most in harmony delight

    Vols How weak a deity would nature prove
    Contending with the powerful god of love

    Bayes Theres a great verse

    Vols If incense thou wilt offer at the shrine
    Of mighty Love burn it to none but mine
    Her rosy lips eternal sweets exhale
    And her bright flames make all flames else look pale

    Bayes Egad that is right

    Pret Perhaps dull incense may thy love suffice
    But mine must be adord with sacrifice
    All hearts turn ashes which her eyes control
    The body they consume as well as soul

    Vols My love has yet a power more divine
    Victims her altars burn not but refine
    Amidst the flames they neer give up the ghost
    But with her looks revive still as they roast
    In spite of pain and death theyre kept alive
    Her fiery eyes make em in fire survive

    Bayes That is as well egad as I can do

    Vols Let my Parthenope at length prevail

    Bayes Civil egad

    Pret Ill sooner have a passion for a whale
    In whose vast bulk tho store of oil doth lie
    We find more shape more beauty in a fly

Smith Thats uncivil egad

Bayes Yes but as farfetched a fancy tho egad as eer you saw

    Vols Soft Prettyman let not thy vain pretence
    Of perfect love defame loves excellence
    Parthenope is sure as far above
    All other loves as above all is Love

    Bayes Ah egad that strikes me

    Pret To blame my Cloris gods would not pretend

    Bayes Now mark

    Vols Were all gods joind they could not hope to mend
    My better choice for fair Parthenope
    Gods would themselves ungod themselves to see

    Bayes Now the rants acoming

    Pret Durst any of the gods be so uncivil
    Id make that god subscribe himself a devil

    Bayes Ay gadzookers thats well writ
                  Scratching his head his peruke falls off

    Vols Couldst thou that god from heaven to earth translate
    He could not fear to want a heavnly state
    Parthenope on earth can heavn create

    Pret Cloris does heavn itself so far excel
    She can transcend the joys of heavn in hell

Bayes Theres a bold flight for you now sdeath I have lost my
peruke Well gentlemen this is what I never yet saw any one could
write but myself Heres true spirit and flame all through egad So
so pray clear the stage

                                  He puts em off the stage

Johns I wonder how the coxcomb has got the knack of writing smooth
verse thus

Smith Why theres no need of brain for this tis but scanning the
labours on the finger but wheres the sense of it

Johns Oh for that he desires to be excusd he is too proud a man to
creep servilely after sense I assure you But pray Mr Bayes why
is this scene all in verse Bayes Oh sir the subject is too great
for prose

Smith Well said ifaith Ill give thee a pot of ale for that answer
tis well worth it

    Bayes Come with all my heart
    Ill make that god subscribe himself a devil
    That single line egad is worth all that my brother poets ever writ
    Let down the curtain                            Exeunt

                                   


ACT VSCENE I

BAYES and the two Gentlemen

Bayes Now gentlemen I will be bold to say Ill show you the
greatest scene that ever England saw I mean not for words for those I
dont value but for state show and magnificence In fine Ill justify
it to be as grand to the eye every whit egad as that great scene in
Harry the Eighth and grander too egad for instead of two bishops I
bring in here four cardinals

     The curtain is drawn up the two usurping Kings appear in
     state with the four Cardinals PRINCE PRETTYMAN PRINCE VOLSCIUS
     AMARYLLIS CLORIS PARTHENOPE c before them Heralds and
     Sergeantsatarms with maces

Smith Mr Bayes pray what is the reason that two of the cardinals are
in hats and the other in caps

Bayes Why sir because By gad I wont tell you Your country
friend sir grows so troublesome

K Ush Now sir to the business of the day

K Phys Speak Volscius

Vols Dread sovereign lords my zeal to you must not invade my duty
to your son let me entreat that great Prince Prettyman first to speak
whose high preeminence in all things that do bear the name of good may
justly claim that privilege

Bayes Here it begins to unfold you may perceive now that he is his
son

Johns Yes sir and we are very much beholden to you for that
discovery

    Pret Royal father upon my knees I beg
    That the illustrious Volscius first be heard

Vols That preference is only due to Amaryllis sir

Bayes Ill make her speak very well byandby you shall see

    Ama Invincible sovereigns             Soft music

    K Ush But stay what sound is this invades our ears

    K Phys Sure tis the music of the moving spheres

    Pret Behold with wonder yonder comes from far
    A godlike cloud and a triumphant car
    In which our two right kings sit one by one
    With virgins vests and laurel garlands on

    K Ush Then brother Phys tis time we should be gone
        The two Usurpers steal out of the throne and go away

Bayes Look you now did not I tell you that this would be as easy a
change as the other

Smith Yes faith you did so tho I confess I could not believe you
but you have brought it about I see

     The two right kings of Brentford descend in the clouds singing
     in white garments and three fiddlers sitting before them in
     green

    Bayes Now because the two right kings descend from above
    I make em sing to the tune and style of our modern spirits

    st King Haste brother king we are sent from above

    nd King Let us move let us move
    Move to remove the fate
    Of Brentfords long united state

    st King Tarra ran tarra full east and by south

    nd King We sail with thunder in our mouth
    In scorching noonday whilst the traveller stays
    Busy busy busy busy we bustle along
    Mounted upon warm Phoebuss rays
    Through the heavenly throng
         Hasting to those
    Who will feast us at night with a pigs pettytoes

    st King And well fall with our plate
    In an ollio of hate

    nd King But now suppers done the servitors try
    Like soldiers to storm a whole halfmoon pie

    st King They gather they gather hot custards in spoons
                     But alas I must leave these halfmoons
                     And repair to my trusty dragoons

    nd King Oh stay for you need not as yet go astray
    The tide like a friend has brought ships in our way
    And on their high ropes we will play
    Like maggots in filberts well snug in our shell
         Well frisk in our shell
         Well frisk in our shell
           And farewell

    st King But the ladies have all inclination to dance
    And the green frogs croak out a coranto of France

Bayes Is not that pretty now The fiddlers are all in green

Smith Ay but they play no coranto

Johns No but they play a tune thats a great deal better

Bayes No coranto quotha thats a good one with all my heart Come
sing on

    nd King Now mortals that hear
                     How we tilt and career
                     With wonder will fear
    The event of such things as shall never appear

    st King Stay you to fulfil what the gods have decreed

    nd King Then call me to help you if there shall be need

    st King So firmly resolvd is a true Brentford king
                     To save the distressd and help to em to bring
                     That ere a full pot of good ale you can swallow
                     Hes here with a whoop and gone with a holla
             BAYES fillips his finger and sings after them

Bayes Hes here with a whoop and gone with a holla This sir you
must know I thought once to have brought in with a conjuror

Johns Ay that would have been better

Bayes No faith not when you consider it for thus it is more
compendious and does the thing every whit as well

Smith Thing what thing

Bayes Why bring em down again into the throne sir What thing would
you have

Smith Well but methinks the sense of this song is not very plain

Bayes Plain why did you ever hear any people in clouds speak plain
They must be all for flight of fancy at its full range without the least
check or control upon it When once you tie up spirits and people in
clouds to speak plain you spoil all

Smith Bless me what a monsters this

                   The two Kings light out of the clouds and
                                          step into the throne

st King Come now to serious counsel well advance

nd King I do agree but first lets have a dance

Bayes Right You did that very well Mr Cartwright But first lets
have a dance Pray remember that be sure you do it always just so for
it must be done as if it were the effect of thought and premeditation
But first lets have a dance pray remember that

Smith Well I can hold no longer I must gag this rogue theres no
enduring of him

Johns No prithee make use of thy patience a little longer lets see
the end of him now Dance a grand dance

Bayes This now is an ancient dance of right belonging to the Kings
of Brentford but since derived with a little alteration to the Inns of
Court

An Alarm Enter two Heralds

    st King What saucy groom molests our privacies

    st Her The armys at the door and in disguise
    Desires a word with both your majesties


nd King Bid em attend awhile and drink our health

Smith How Mr Bayes the army in disguise

Bayes Ay sir for fear the usurpers might discover them that went
out but just now

Smith Why what if they had discoverd them

Bayes Why then they had broke the design

st King Here take five guineas for those warlike men

nd King And heres five more that makes the sum just ten

    st Her We have not seen so much the Lord knows when

                                             Exeunt Heralds

    st King Speak on brave Amaryllis

    Ama Invincible sovereigns blame not my modesty if at this
    grand conjuncture      Drum beats behind the stage

st King What dreadful noise is this that comes and goes

Enter a Soldier with his sword drawn

    Sold Haste hence great sirs your royal persons save
    For the event of war no mortal knows
    The army wrangling for the gold you gave
    First fell to words and then to handyblows      Exit

Bayes Is not that now a pretty kind of a stanza and a handsome
comeoff

    nd King O dangerous estate of sovereign power
    Obnoxious to the change of every hour

    st King Let us for shelter in our cabinet stay
    Perhaps these threatning storms may pass away   Exeunt

Johns But Mr Bayes did not you promise us just now to make
Amaryllis speak very well

Bayes Ay and so she would have done but that they hinderd her

Smith How sir whether you would or no

Bayes Ay sir the plot lay so that I vow to gad it was not to be
avoided

Smith Marry that was hard

Johns But pray who hinderd her

Bayes Why the battle sir thats just coming in at the door and
Ill tell you now a strange thing tho I dont pretend to do more than
other men egad Ill give you both a whole week to guess how Ill
represent this battle

Smith I had rather be bound to fight your battle I assure you sir

Bayes Whoo theres it now fight a battle theres the common error
I knew presently where I should have you Why pray sir do but tell
me this one thing can you think it a decent thing in a battle before
ladies to have men run their swords thro one another and all that

Johns No faith tis not civil

Bayes Right on the other side to have a long relation of squadrons
here and squadrons there what is it but dull prolixity

Johns Excellently reasond by my troth

Bayes Wherefore sir to avoid both those indecorums I sum up the
whole battle in the representation of two persons only no more and yet
so lively that I vow to gad you would swear ten thousand men were at
it really engagd Do you mark me

Smith Yes sir but I think I should hardly swear tho for all that

Bayes By my troth sir but you would tho when you see it for
I make em both come out in armour capapie with their swords
drawn and hung with a scarlet ribbon at their wrist which you know
represents fighting enough

Johns Ay ay so much that if I were in your place I would make em
go out again without ever speaking one word

Bayes No there you are out for I make each of em hold a lute in his
hand

Smith How sir instead of a buckler

Bayes O Lord O Lord instead of a buckler pray sir do you ask
no more questions I make em sirs play the battle in recitativo
And heres the conceit just at the very same instant that one sings
the other sir recovers you his sword and puts himself into a warlike
posture so that you have at once your ear entertaind with music and
good language and your eye satisfied with the garb and accoutrements of
war

Smith I confess sir you stupefy me

Bayes You shall see

Johns But Mr Bayes might not we have a little fighting for I love
those plays where they cut and slash one another upon the stage for a
whole hour together

Bayes Why then to tell you true I have contrivd it both ways but
you shall have my recitativo first

Johns Ay now you are right there is nothing that can be objected
against it

Bayes True and so egad Ill make it too a tragedy in a trice

Enter at several doors the GENERAL and LIEUTENANTGENERAL armd
capapie with each of them a lute in his hand and a sword drawn
and hung with a scarlet ribbon at his wrist

    LieutGen Villain thou liest

    Gen Arm arm Gonsalvo arm what ho
    The lie no flesh can brook I trow

    LieutGen Advance from Acton with the musqueteers

    Gen Draw down the Chelsea cuirassiers

    LieutGen The band you boast of Chelsea cuirassiers
    Shall in my Putney pikes now meet their peers

    Gen Chiswickians aged and renownd in fight
    Join with the Hammersmith brigade

    LieutGen Youll find my Mortlake boys will do them right
    Unless by Fulham numbers overlaid

    Gen Let the left wing of Twicknam foot advance
    And line that eastern hedge

    LieutGen The horse I raisd in PettyFrance
    Shall try their chance
    And scour the meadows overgrown with sedge

    Gen Stand give the word

    LieutGen Bright sword

    Gen That may be thine
    But tis not mine

    LieutGen Give fire give fire at once give fire
    And let those recreant troops perceive mine ire

    Gen Pursue pursue they fly
    That first did give the lie                     Exeunt

Bayes This now is not improper I think because the spectators know
all these towns and may easily conceive them to be within the dominions
of the two Kings of Brentford

Johns Most exceeding well designd

Bayes How do you think I have contrivd to give a stop to this battle

Smith How

Bayes By an eclipse which let me tell you is a kind of fancy that
was yet never so much as thought of but by myself and one person more
that shall be nameless

Enter LIEUTENANTGENERAL

    LieutGen What midnight darkness does invade the day
    And snatch the victor from his conquerd prey
    Is the sun weary of this bloody fight
    And winks upon us with the eye of light
    Tis an eclipse this was unkind O moon
    To clap between me and the sun so soon
    Foolish eclipse thou this in vain hast done
    My brighter honour had eclipsd the sun
    But now behold eclipses two in one                Exit

Johns This is an admirable representation of a battle as ever I saw

Bayes Ay sir but how would you fancy now to represent an eclipse

Smith Why thats to be supposd

Bayes Supposd ay you are ever at your suppose ha ha ha why you
may as well suppose the whole play No it must come in upon the stage
thats certain but in some odd way that may delight amuse and all
that I have a conceit fort that I am sure is new and I believe to the
purpose

Johns Hows that

Bayes Why the truth is I took the first hint of this out of a
dialogue between Phoebus and Aurora in the Slighted Maid which by
my troth was very pretty but I think youd confess this is a little
better

Johns No doubt ont Mr Bayes a great deal better

                  BAYES hugs JOHNSON then turns to SMITH

Bayes Ah dear rogue Butasir you have heard I suppose that
your eclipse of the moon is nothing else but an interposition of the
earth between the sun and moon as likewise your eclipse of the sun is
causd by an interlocation of the moon betwixt the earth and the sun

Smith I have heard some such thing indeed

Bayes Well sir then what do I but make the earth sun and moon come
out upon the stage and dance the hey Hum and of necessity by the very
nature of this dance the earth must be sometimes between the sun and the
moon and the moon between the earth and sun and there you have both
eclipses by demonstration

Johns That must needs be very fine truly

Bayes Yes it has fancy int And then sir that there may be
something int too of a joke I bring em in all singing and make the
moon sell the earth a bargain Come come out eclipse to the tune of
Tom Tyler

Enter LUNA

    Luna Orbis O Orbis
    Come to me thou little rogue Orbis

Enter the EARTH

    Orb     Who calls Terrafirma pray

    Luna    Luna that neer shines by day

    Orb     What means Luna in a veil

    Luna    Luna means to show her tail

    Bayes Theres the bargain

Enter SOL to the tune of Robin Hood

    Sol Fie sister fie thou makest me muse
           Derry down derry down
    To see thee Orb abuse

    Luna I hope his anger twill not move
    Since I showd it out of love
                        Hey down derry down

    Orb Where shall I thy true love know
    Thou pretty pretty moon

    Luna Tomorrow soon ere it be noon
    On Mount Vesuvio

    Sol Then I will shine To the tune of Trenchmore Bis

    Orb And I will be fine

    Luna And I will drink nothing but Lippara wine

    Omnes And we c As they dance the hey BAYES speaks

Bayes Now the earths before the moon now the moons before the sun
theres the eclipse again

Smith Hes mightily taken with this I see

Johns Ay tis so extraordinary how can he choose

Bayes So now vanish eclipse and enter tother battle and fight
Here now if I am not mistaken you will see fighting enough

A battle is fought between foot and great hobbyhorses At last
DRAWCANSIR comes in and kills them all on both sides All the while the
battle is fighting BAYES is telling them when to shout and shouts
with em

    Draw Others may boast a single man to kill
    But I the blood of thousands daily spill
    Let petty kings the names of parties know
    Whereer I come I slay both friend and foe
    The swiftest horsemen my swift rage controls
    And from their bodies drives their trembling souls
    If they had wings and to the gods could fly
    I would pursue and beat em through the sky
    And make proud Jove with all his thunder see
    This single arm more dreadful is than he          Exit

Bayes Theres a brave fellow for you now sirs You may talk of
your Hectors and Achilless and I know not who but I defy all your
histories and your romances too to show me one such conqueror as this
Drawcansir

Johns I swear I think you may

Smith But Mr Bayes how shall all these dead men go off for I see
none alive to help em

Bayes Go off why as they came on upon their legs how should they
go off Why do you think the people here dont know they are not dead
he is mighty ignorant poor man your friend here is very silly Mr
Johnson egad he is Ha ha ha Come sir Ill show you how they shall
go off Rise rise sirs and go about your business Theres go off
for you now ha ha ha Mr Ivory a word Gentlemen Ill be with you

                                                       Exit

    Johns Will you so Then well be gone

EPILOGUE

    The play is at an end but wheres the plot
    That circumstance our poet Bayes forgot
    And we can boast tho tis a plotting age
    No place is freer from it than the stage
    The ancients plotted tho and strove to please
    With sense that might be understood with ease
    They every scene with so much wit did store
    That who brought any in went out with more
    But this new way of wit does so surprise
    Men lose their wits in wondring where it lies
    If it be true that monstrous births presage
    The following mischiefs that afflict the age
    And sad disasters to the state proclaim
    Plays without head or tail may do the same
    Wherefore for ours and for the kingdoms peace
    May this prodigious way of writing cease
    Lets have at least once in our lives a time
    When we may hear some reason not all rhyme
    We have this ten years felt its influence
    Pray let this prove a year of prose and sense

Footnote  Such easy turns of state are frequent in our modern plays
where we see princes dethroned and governments changed by very feeble
means and on slight occasions particularly in Marriage Alamode
a play writ since the first publication of this farce Where to pass
by the dulness of the statepart the obscurity of the comic the near
resemblance Leonidas bears to our Prince Prettyman being sometimes a
kings son sometimes a shepherds and not to question how Amalthea
comes to be a princess her brother the kings great favourite being
but a lord it is worth our while to observe how easily the fierce and
jealous usurper is deposed and the right heir placed on the throne and
it is thus related by the said imaginary princess

    Amalth Oh gentlemen if you have loyalty
              Or courage show it now Leonidas
              Broke on a sudden from his guards and snatching
              A sword from one his back against the scaffold
              Bravely defends himself and owns aloud
              He is our long lost king found for this moment
              But if your valours help not lost for ever

of York in his thoughts It was acted at the Cockpit in Drury Lane
soon after the Restoration but miscarrying on the stage the author had
the modesty not to print it and therefore the reader cannot reasonably
expect any particular passages of it Others say that they are Boabdelin

    Both And hiss in the water and drown

    Naker But their men lie securely intrenchd in a cloud
    And a trumpeterhornet to battle sounds loud

    Dam Now mortals that spy
    How we tilt in the sky
    With wonder will gaze
    And fear such events as will neer come to pass

    Naker Stay you to perform what the man will have done

    Dam Then call me again when the battle is won

    To pity the lover and succour the fair

    Is here with a wish and is gone with a nod

THE SPLENDID SHILLING

                         Sing heavenly Muse
    Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme
    A shilling breeches and chimeras dire


    Happy the man who void of cares and strife
    In silken or in leathern purse retains
    A Splendid Shilling He nor hears with pain
    New oysters cryd nor sighs for cheerful ale
    But with his friends when nightly mists arise
    To Junipers Magpye or Town Hall repairs
    Where mindful of the nymph whose wanton eye
    Transfixd his soul and kindled amorous flames
    Cloe or Philips he each circling glass
    Wisheth her health and joy and equal love
    Meanwhile he smokes and laughs at merry tale
    Or pun ambiguous or conundrum quaint
    But I whom griping penury surrounds
    And hunger sure attendant upon want
    With scanty offals and small acid tiff
    Wretched repast my meagre corps sustain
    Then solitary walk or doze at home
    In garret vile and with a warming puff
    Regale chilld fingers or from tube as black
    As winterchimney or well polishd jet
    Exhale Mundungus ill perfuming scent
    Not blacker tube nor of a shorter size
    Smokes CambroBriton versd in pedigree
    Sprung from Cadwalador and Arthur kings
    Full famous in romantic tale when he
    Oer many a craggy hill and barren cliff
    Upon a cargo of famd Cestrian cheese
    High overshadowing rides with a design
    To vend his wares or at th Arvonian mart
    Or Maridunum or the ancient town
    Ycleped Brechinia or where Vagas stream
    Encircles Ariconium fruitful soil
    Whence flows nectareous wine that well may vie
    With Massic Setin or renownd Falern
      Thus while my joyless minutes tedious flow
    With looks demure and silent pace a Dun
    Horrible monster hated by gods and men
    To my arial citadel ascends
    With vocal heel thrice thundring at my gate
    With hideous accent thrice he calls I know
    The voice illboding and the solemn sound
    What should I do or whither turn Amazd
    Confounded to the dark recess I fly
    Of woodhole straight my bristling hairs erect
    Thro sudden fear a chilly sweat bedews
    My shuddring limbs and wonderful to tell
    My tongue forgets her faculty of speech
    So horrible he seems his faded brow
    Entrenchd with many a frown and conic beard
    And spreading band admird by modern saints
    Disastrous acts forebode In his right hand
    Long scrolls of paper solemnly he waves
    With characters and figures dire inscribd
    Grievous to mortal eyes ye gods avert
    Such plagues from righteous men Behind him stalks
    Another monster not unlike himself
    Sullen of aspect by the vulgar calld
    A Catchpole whose polluted hands the gods
    With force incredible and magic charms
    First have endud if he his ample palm
    Should haply on illfated shoulder lay
    Of debtor straight his body to the touch
    Obsequious as whilom knights were wont
    To some enchanted castle is conveyd
    Where gates impregnable and coercive chains
    In durance strict detain him till in form
    Of money Pallas sets the captive free
      Beware ye debtors when ye walk beware
    Be circumspect oft with insidious ken
    This caitiff eyes your steps aloof and oft
    Lies perdue in a nook or gloomy cave
    Prompt to enchant some inadvertent wretch
    With his unhallowd touch So poets sing
    Grimalkin to domestic vermin sworn
    An everlasting foe with watchful eye
    Lies nightly brooding oer a chinky gap
    Protending her fell claws to thoughtless mice
    Sure ruin So her disembowelld web
    Arachne in a hall or kitchen spreads
    Obvious to vagrant flies she secret stands
    Within her woven cell the humming prey
    Regardless of their fate rush on the toils
    Inextricable nor will aught avail
    Their arts or arms or shapes of lovely hue
    The wasp insidious and the buzzing drone
    And butterfly proud of expanded wings
    Distinct with gold entangled in her snares
    Useless resistance make with eager strides
    She towring flies to her expected spoils
    Then with envenomd jaws the vital blood
    Drinks of reluctant foes and to her cave
    Their bulky carcasses triumphant drags
      So pass my days But when nocturnal shades
    This world envelop and th inclement air
    Persuades men to repel benumbing frosts
    With pleasant wines and crackling blaze of wood
    Me lonely sitting nor the glimmering light
    Of makeweight candle nor the joyous talk
    Of loving friend delights distressd forlorn
    Amidst the horrors of the tedious night
    Darkling I sigh and feed with dismal thoughts
    My anxious mind or sometimes mournful verse
    Indite and sing of groves and myrtle shades
    Or desprate lady near a purling stream
    Or lover pendant on a willowtree
    Meanwhile I labour with eternal drought
    And restless wish and rave my parchd throat
    Finds no relief nor heavy eyes repose
    But if a slumber haply does invade
    My weary limbs my fancys still awake
    Thoughtful of drink and eager in a dream
    Tipples imaginary pots of ale
    In vain awake I find the settled thirst
    Still gnawing and the pleasant phantom curse
      Thus do I live from pleasure quite debarrd
    Nor taste the fruits that the suns genial rays
    Mature John Apple nor the downy Peach
    Nor Walnut in roughfurrowd coat secure
    Nor Medlar fruit delicious in decay
    Afflictions great yet greater still remains
    My Galligaskins that have long withstood
    The winters fury and encroaching frosts
    By time subdud what will not time subdue
    An horrid chasm disclosd with orifice
    Wide discontinuous at which the winds
    Eurus and Auster and the dreadful force
    Of Boreas that congeals the Cronian waves
    Tumultuous enter with dire chilling blasts
    Portending agues Thus a wellfraught ship
    Long saild secure or thro th gean deep
    Or the Ionian till cruising near
    The Lilybean shore with hideous crush
    On Scylla or Charybdis dangrous rocks
    She strikes rebounding whence the shatterd oak
    So fierce a shock unable to withstand
    Admits the sea in at the gaping side
    The crowding waves gush with impetuous rage
    Resistless overwhelming horrors seize
    The mariners death in their eyes appears
    They stare they lave they pump they swear they pray
    Vain efforts still the battring waves rush in
    Implacable till delugd by the foam
    The ship sinks foundring in the vast abyss

    Singing many a tuneless song
    Lavish of a heedless tongue
    Simple maiden void of art
    Babbling out the very heart
    Yet abandond to thy will

    Like the linlet in the bush
    To the motherlinnets note
    Moduling her slender throat
    Chirping forth thy petty joys
    Wanton in the change of toys
    Like the linnet green in May
    Flitting to each bloomy spray
    Wearied then and glad of rest
    Like the linlet in the nest
    This thy present happy lot
    This in time will be forgot
    Other pleasures other cares
    Everbusy time prepares
    And thou shalt in thy daughter see

A WORD UPON PUDDING

     From A LEARNED DISSERTATION UPON DUMPLING to which the
     preceding Poem was appended


What is a tart a pie or a pasty but meat or fruit enclosd in a
wall or covering of pudding What is a cake but a bakd pudding or a
Christmas pie but a mincdmeat pudding As for cheesecakes custards
tansies c they are manifest puddings and all of Sir Johns own
contrivance custard being as old if not older than Magna Charta In
short pudding is of the greatest dignity and antiquity bread itself
which is the very staff of life being properly speaking a bakd wheat
pudding

To the satchel which is the puddingbag of ingenuity we are indebted
for the greatest men in church and state All arts and sciences owe
their original to pudding or dumpling What is a bagpipe the mother of
all music but a pudding of harmony Or what is music itself but a
palatable cookery of sounds To little puddings or bladders of colours we
owe all the choice originals of the greatest painters And indeed what
is painting but a wellspread pudding or cookery of colours

The head of man is like a pudding And whence have all rhymes poems
plots and inventions sprang but from that same pudding What is
poetry but a pudding of words The physicians tho they cry out so
much against cooks and cookery yet are but cooks themselves with this
difference only the cooks pudding lengthens life the physicians
shortens it So that we live and die by pudding For what is a clyster
but a bagpudding a pill but a dumpling or a bolus but a tansy tho
not altogether so toothsome In a word physic is only a puddingizing or
cookery of drugs

                                              The law is but a
    cookery of quibbles and contentions               
                                                     
                       is but a pudding of             
                                                     
                    Some swallow everything whole and unmixd

so that it may rather be calld a heap than a pudding Others are so
squeamish the greatest mastership in cookery is requird to make the
pudding palatable The suet which others gape and swallow by gobs must
for these puny stomachs be minced to atoms the plums must be pickd
with the utmost care and every ingredient proportiond to the greatest
nicety or it will never go down

The universe itself is but a pudding of elements Empires kingdoms
states and republics are but puddings of people differently made up The
celestial and terrestrial orbs are decipherd to us by a pair of globes
or mathematical puddings

The success of war and fate of monarchies are entirely dependent on
puddings and dumplings For what else are cannonballs but military
puddings or bullets but dumplings with this difference only they do
not sit so well on the stomach as a good marrow pudding or bread pudding

In short there is nothing valuable in art or nature but what more
or less has an allusion to pudding or dumpling Why then should
they be held in disesteem Why should dumplingeating be ridiculed
or dumplingeaters derided Is it not pleasant and profitable Is it
not ancient and honourable Kings princes and potentates have in all
ages been lovers of pudding Is it not therefore of royal authority
Popes cardinals bishops priests and deacons have time out of mind
been great puddingeaters Is it not therefore a holy and religious
institution Philosophers poets and learned men in all faculties
judges privy councillors and members of both houses have by their
great regard to pudding given a sanction to it that nothing can efface
Is it not therefore ancient honourable and commendable

    Quare itaque fremuerunt Auctores

Why do therefore the enemies of good eating the starveling
authors of Grub Street employ their impotent pens against pudding
and puddingheaded alias honest men Why do they inveigh against
dumplingeating which is the life and soul of goodfellowship and
dumplingeaters who are the ornaments of civil society

But alas their malice is their own punishment The hireling author
of a late scandalous libel intituled The DumplingEaters Downfall
may if he has any eyes now see his error in attacking so numerous so
august a body of people His books remain unsold unread unregarded
while this treatise of mine shall be bought by all who love pudding or
dumpling to my booksellers great joy and my no small consolation How
shall I triumph and how will that mercenary scribbler be mortified
when I have sold more editions of my books than he has copies of his
I therefore exhort all people gentle and simple men women and
children to buy to read to extol these labours of mine for the honour
of dumplingeating Let them not fear to defend every article for I will
bear them harmless I have arguments good store and can easily confute
either logically theologically or metaphysically all those who dare
oppose me

Let not Englishmen therefore be ashamed of the name of Puddingeaters
but on the contrary let it be their glory For let foreigners cry out
neer so much against good eating they come easily into it when they
have been a little while in our land of Canaan and there are very few
foreigners among us who have not learnd to make as great a hole in a
good pudding or sirloin of beef as the best Englishman of us all

Why should we then be laughed out of pudding and dumpling or why
ridiculd out of good living Plots and politics may hurt us but pudding
cannot Let us therefore adhere to pudding and keep ourselves out
of harms way according to the golden rule laid down by a celebrated
dumplingeater now defunct

    Be of your patrons mind whateer he says
    Sleep very much think little and talk less
    Mind neither good nor bad nor right nor wrong
    But eat your pudding fool and hold your tonguePRIOR

THE TRAGEDY OF TRAGEDIES OR THE LIFE AND DEATH OF

TOM THUMB THE GREAT

WITH THE ANNOTATIONS OF H SCRIBLERUS SECUNDUS

FIRST ACTED IN  AND ALTERED IN 


H SCRIBLERUS SECUNDUS HIS PREFACE

The town hath seldom been more divided in its opinion than concerning the
merit of the following scenes Whilst some publicly affirm that no author
could produce so fine a piece but Mr P others have with as much
vehemence insisted that no one could write anything so bad but Mr F

Nor can we wonder at this dissension about its merit when the learned
world have not unanimously decided even the very nature of this tragedy
For though most of the universities in Europe have honoured it with the
name of Egregium et maximi pretii opus tragoediis tam antiquis qum
novis long anteponendum nay Dr B hath pronounced Citis Mvii
neadem qum Scribleri istius tragoediam hanc crediderim cujus autorem
Senecam ipsum tradidisse haud dubitrim and the great Professor Burman
hath styled Tom Thumb Heroum omnium tragicorum facil principem nay
though it hath among other languages been translated into Dutch and
celebrated with great applause at Amsterdam where burlesque never came
by the title of Mynheer Vander Thumb the burgomasters received it with
that reverent and silent attention which becometh an audience at a deep
tragedy Notwithstanding all this there have not been wanting some who
have represented these scenes in a ludicrous light and Mr D hath
been heard to say with some concern that he wondered a tragical and
Christian nation would permit a representation on its theatre so visibly
designed to ridicule and extirpate everything that is great and solemn
among us

This learned critic and his followers were led into so great an error
by that surreptitious and piratical copy which stole last year into
the world with what injustice and prejudice to our author will be
acknowledged I hope by every one who shall happily peruse this genuine
and original copy Nor can I help remarking to the great praise of
our author that however imperfect the former was even that faint
resemblance of the true Tom Thumb contained sufficient beauties to
give it a run of upwards of forty nights to the politest audiences
But notwithstanding that applause which it received from all the best
judges it was as severely censured by some few bad ones and I believe
rather maliciously than ignorantly reported to have been intended a
burlesque on the loftiest parts of tragedy and designed to banish what
we generally call fine things from the stage

Now if I can set my country right in an affair of this importance I
shall lightly esteem any labour which it may cost And this I the rather
undertake first as it is indeed in some measure incumbent on me to
vindicate myself from that surreptitious copy before mentioned published
by some illmeaning people under my name secondly as knowing myself
more capable of doing justice to our author than any other man as I
have given myself more pains to arrive at a thorough understanding of
this little piece having for ten years together read nothing else in
which time I think I may modestly presume with the help of my English
dictionary to comprehend all the meanings of every word in it

But should any error of my pen awaken Clariss Bentleium to enlighten
the world with his annotations on our author I shall not think that the
least reward or happiness arising to me from these my endeavours

I shall waive at present what hath caused such feuds in the learned
world whether this piece was originally written by Shakespeare though
certainly that were it true must add a considerable share to its merit
especially with such who are so generous as to buy and commend what they
never read from an implicit faith in the author only a faith which our
age abounds in as much as it can be called deficient in any other

Let it suffice that The Tragedy of Tragedies or The Life and Death
of Tom Thumb was written in the reign of Queen Elizabeth Nor can
the objection made by Mr D that the tragedy must then have been
antecedent to the history have any weight when we consider that
though The History of Tom Thumb printed by and for Edward Mr at the
Lookingglass on London Bridge be of a later date still must we suppose
this history to have been transcribed from some other unless we suppose
the writer thereof to be inspired a gift very faintly contended for by
the writers of our age As to this historys not bearing the stamp of
second third or fourth edition I see but little in that objection
editions being very uncertain lights to judge of books by and perhaps
Mr Mr may have joined twenty editions in one as Mr Cl hath ere now
divided one into twenty

Nor doth the other argument drawn from the little care our author hath
taken to keep up to the letter of this history carry any greater force
Are there not instances of plays wherein the history is so perverted
that we can know the heroes whom they celebrate by no other marks than
their names nay do we not find the same character placed by different
poets in such different lights that we can discover not the least
sameness or even likeness in the features The Sophonisba of Mairet and
of Lee is a tender passionate amorous mistress of Massinissa Corneille
and Mr Thomson give her no other passion but the love of her country
and make her as cool in her affection to Massinissa as to Syphax In the
two latter she resembles the character of Queen Elizabeth in the two
former she is the picture of Mary Queen of Scotland In short the one
Sophonisba is as different from the other as the Brutus of Voltaire is
from the Marius jun of Otway or as the Minerva is from the Venus of
the ancients

Let us now proceed to a regular examination of the tragedy before us in
which I shall treat separately of the Fable the Moral the Characters
the Sentiments and the Diction And first of the Fable which I take
to be the most simple imaginable and to use the words of an eminent
author one regular and uniform not charged with a multiplicity of
incidents and yet affording several revolutions of fortune by which
the passions may be excited varied and driven to their full tumult of
emotion Nor is the action of this tragedy less great than uniform The
spring of all is the love of Tom Thumb for Huncamunca which caused the
quarrel between their majesties in the first act the passion of Lord
Grizzle in the second the rebellion fall of Lord Grizzle and Glumdalca
devouring of Tom Thumb by the cow and that bloody catastrophe in the
third

Nor is the Moral of this excellent tragedy less noble than the Fable
it teaches these two instructive lessons viz that human happiness is
exceeding transient and that death is the certain end of all men the
former whereof is inculcated by the fatal end of Tom Thumb the latter
by that of all the other personages

The Characters are I think sufficiently described in the dramatis
person and I believe we shall find few plays where greater care is
taken to maintain them throughout and to preserve in every speech that
characteristical mark which distinguishes them from each other But
says Mr D how well doth the character of Tom Thumb whom we
must call the hero of this tragedy if it hath any hero agree with
the precepts of Aristotle who defineth tragedy to be the imitation
of a short but perfect action containing a just greatness in itself
c What greatness can be in a fellow whom history related to have been
no higher than a span This gentleman seemeth to think with Serjeant
Kite that the greatness of a mans soul is in proportion to that of his
body the contrary of which is affirmed by our English physiognominical
writers Besides if I understand Aristotle right he speaketh only of
the greatness of the action and not of the person

As for the Sentiments and the Diction which now only remain to be
spoken to I thought I could afford them no stronger justification than
by producing parallel passages out of the best of our English writers
Whether this sameness of thought and expression which I have quoted from
them proceeded from an agreement in their way of thinking or whether
they have borrowed from our author I leave the reader to determine I
shall adventure to affirm this of the Sentiments of our author that
they are generally the most familiar which I have ever met with and
at the same time delivered with the highest dignity of phrase which
brings me to speak of his diction Here I shall only beg one postulatum
viz that the greatest perfection of the language of a tragedy is that
it is not to be understood which granted as I think it must be it
will necessarily follow that the only way to avoid this is by being too
high or too low for the understanding which will comprehend everything
within its reach Those two extremities of style Mr Dryden illustrates
by the familiar image of two inns which I shall term the arial and the
subterrestrial

Horace goes further and showeth when it is proper to call at one of
these inns and when at the other

    Telephus et Peleus cm pauper et exul uterque
    Projicit ampullas et sesquipedalia verba

That he approveth of the sesquipedalia verba is plain for had not
Telephus and Peleus used this sort of diction in prosperity they could
not have dropped it in adversity The arial inn therefore says
Horace is proper only to be frequented by princes and other great men
in the highest affluence of fortune the subterrestrial is appointed for
the entertainment of the poorer sort of people only whom Horace advises

    dolere sermone pedestri

The true meaning of both which citations is that bombast is the proper
language for joy and doggrel for grief the latter of which is literally
implied in the sermo pedestris as the former is in the sesquipedalia
verba

Cicero recommendeth the former of these Quid est tam furiosum vel
tragicum qum verborum sonitus inanis null subject sententi neque
scienti What can be so proper for tragedy as a set of big sounding
words so contrived together as to convey no meaning which I shall
one day or other prove to be the sublime of Longinus Ovid declareth
absolutely for the latter inn

    Omne genus scripti gravitate tragoedia vincit

Tragedy hath of all writings the greatest share in the bathos which is
the profound of Scriblerus

I shall not presume to determine which of these two styles be properer
for tragedy It sufficeth that our author excelleth in both He is
very rarely within sight through the whole play either rising higher
than the eye of your understanding can soar or sinking lower than it
careth to stoop But here it may perhaps be observed that I have given
more frequent instances of authors who have imitated him in the sublime
than in the contrary To which I answer first bombast being properly
a redundancy of genius instances of this nature occur in poets whose
names do more honour to our author than the writers in the doggrel
which proceeds from a cool calm weighty way of thinking Instances
whereof are most frequently to be found in authors of a lower class
Secondly that the works of such authors are difficultly found at all
Thirdly that it is a very hard task to read them in order to extract
these flowers from them And lastly it is very difficult to transplant
them at all they being like some flowers of a very nice nature which
will flourish in no soil but their own for it is easy to transcribe a
thought but not the want of one The Earl of Essex for instance is
a little garden of choice rarities whence you can scarce transplant one
line so as to preserve its original beauty This must account to the
reader for his missing the names of several of his acquaintance which
he had certainly found here had I ever read their works for which
if I have not a just esteem I can at least say with Cicero Qu non
contemno quipp qu nunquam legerim However that the reader may meet
with due satisfaction in this point I have a young commentator from
the university who is reading over all the modern tragedies at five
shillings a dozen and collecting all that they have stole from our
author which shall be shortly added as an appendix to this work

ACT I

SCENE IThe Palace

DOODLE NOODLE

    Doodle Sure such a day as this was never seen
    The sun himself on this auspicious day
    Shines like a beau in a new birthday suit
    This down the seams embroidered that the beams
    All nature wears one universal grin

    Nood This day O Mr Doodle is a day
    Indeeda day we never saw before
    The mighty Thomas Thumb victorious comes
    Millions of giants crowd his chariot wheels
    Giants to whom the giants in Guildhall
    Are infant dwarfs They frown and foam and roar
    While Thumb regardless of their noise rides on
    So some cocksparrow in a farmers yard
    Hops at the head of an huge flock of turkeys

    Dood When Goody Thumb first brought this Thomas forth
    The Genius of our land triumphant reignd
    Then then O Arthur did thy Genius reign

    Nood They tell me it is whisperd in the books
    Of all our sages that this mighty hero
    By Merlins art begot hath not a bone
    Within his skin but is a lump of gristle

    Dood Then tis a gristle of no mortal kind
    Some god my Noodle stept into the place
    Of Gaffer Thumb and more than half begot
    This mighty Tom

    Nood Sure he was sent express
    From Heaven to be the pillar of our state
    Though small his body be so very small
    A chairmans leg is more than twice as large
    Yet is his soul like any mountain big
    And as a mountain once brought forth a mouse
    So doth this mouse contain a mighty mountain

    Dood Mountain indeed So terrible his name
    The giant nurses frighten children with it
    And cry Tom Thumb is come and if you are
    Naughty will surely take the child away

    Nood But hark these trumpets speak the kings approach

    Dood He comes most luckily for my petition
                                                   Flourish


SCENE II

    The man who frowns this day shall lose his head
    That he may have no face to frown withal
    Smile DollallollaHa what wrinkled sorrow
    Hangs sits lies frowns upon thy knitted brow
    Whence flow those tears fast down thy blubberd cheeks
    Like a swoln gutter gushing through the streets

    Queen Excess of joy my lord Ive heard folks say
    Gives tears as certain as excess of grief

    King If it be so let all men cry for joy
    Till my whole court be drowned with their tears
    Nay till they overflow my utmost land
    And leave me nothing but the sea to rule

    Dood My liege I a petition have here got

    King Petition me no petitions sir today
    Let other hours be set apart for business
    Today it is our pleasure to be drunk
    And this our queen shall be as drunk as we

    Queen Though I already halfseas over am
    If the capacious goblet overflow
    With arrack punchfore George Ill see it out
    Of rum and brandy Ill not taste a drop

    And rum and brandy be no more than six
    Rather than quarrel you shall have your will  Trumpets
    But ha the warrior comesthe great Tom Thumb

    The castle gates too low for their admittance

    King What look they like

    Thumb Like nothing but themselves

    Queen And sure thou art like nothing but thyself
                                                      Aside

    King Enough the vast idea fills my soul
    I see themyes I see them now before me
    The monstrous ugly barbrous sons of clods
    But ha what form majestic strikes our eyes
    So perfect that it seems to have been drawn
    By all the gods in council so fair she is
    That surely at her birth the council paused
    And then at length cryd out This is a woman

    Thumb Then were the gods mistakenshe is not
    A woman but a giantesswhom we
    With much ado have made a shift to haul
    Within the town for she is by a foot
    Shorter than all her subject giants were

    Glum We yesterday were both a queen and wife
    One hundred thousand giants ownd our sway
    Twenty whereof were married to ourself

    Queen Oh happy state of giantism where husbands
    Like mushrooms grow whilst hapless we are forced
    To be content nay happy thought with one

    That the same sun which rising saw me wife
    To twenty giants setting should behold
    Me widowd of them allMy wornout heart
    That ship leaks fast and the great heavy lading
    My soul will quickly sink

    Queen                    Madam believe
    I view your sorrows with a womans eye
    But learn to bear them with what strength you may
    Tomorrow we will have our grenadiers
    Drawn out before you and you then shall choose
    What husbands you think fit

    Glum                      Madam I am
    Your most obedient and most humble servant

    King Think mighty princess think this court your own
    Nor think the landlord me this house my inn
    Call for whateer you will youll nothing pay
    I feel a sudden pain within my breast
    Nor know I whether it arise from love
    Or only the windcholic Time must show
    O Thumb what do we to thy valour owe
    Ask some reward great as we can bestow

    Thumb I ask not kingdoms I can conquer those
    I ask not money money Ive enough
    For what Ive done and what I mean to do
    For giants slain and giants yet unborn
    Which I will slayif this be calld a debt

    Thumb My heart is at the threshold of your mouth
    And waits its answer thereOh do not frown

    King It is resolvdthe princess is your own

    Thumb Oh happy happy happy happy Thumb

    Then tremble all who did this match persuade
    For riding on a cat from high Ill fall
    And squirt down royal vengeance on you all

    Food Her majesty the queen is in a passion

    King Be she or be she not Ill to the girl
    And pave thy way O Thumb Now by ourself
    We were indeed a pretty king of clouts
    To truckle to her willfor when by force
    Or art the wife her husband overreaches
    Give him the petticoat and her the breeches

    Thumb Whisper ye winds that Huncamuncas mine
    Echoes repeat that Huncamuncas mine
    The dreadful busness of the war is oer
    And beauty heavnly beauty crowns my toils
    Ive thrown the bloody garment now aside
    And hymeneal sweets invite my bride
      So when some chimneysweeper all the day
    Hath through dark paths pursued the sooty way
    At night to wash his hands and face he flies
    And in his tother shirt with his Brickdusta lies


SCENE IV

    Grizzle solus Where art thou Grizzle where are now thy
      glories
    Where are the drums that waken thee to honour
    Greatness is a laced coat from Monmouth Street
    Which fortune lends us for a day to wear
    Tomorrow puts it on anothers back
    The spiteful sun but yesterday surveyd
    His rival high as Saint Pauls cupola
    Now may he see me as Fleet Ditch laid low


SCENE V

QUEEN GRIZZLE

    Queen Teach me to scold prodigiousminded Grizzle
    Mountain of treason ugly as the devil
    Teach this confounded hateful mouth of mine
    To spout forth words malicious as thyself
    Words which might shame all Billingsgate to speak

    Griz Far be it from my pride to think my tongue
    Your royal lips can in that art instruct
    Wherein you so excel But may I ask
    Without offence wherefore my queen would scold

    Queen Wherefore Oh blood and thunder hant you heard
    What evry corner of the court resounds
    That little Thumb will be a great man made

    Griz I heard it I confessfor who alas
    Can always stop his earsBut would my teeth
    By grinding knives had first been set on edge

    Queen Would I had heard at the still noon of night
    The hallalloo of fire in every street
    Odsbobs I have a mind to hang myself
    To think I should a grandmother be made
    By such a rascalSure the king forgets
    When in a pudding by his mother put
    The bastard by a tinker on a stile
    Was droppdOh good lord Grizzle can I bear
    To see him from a pudding mount the throne
    Or can oh can my Huncamunca bear
    To take a puddings offspring to her arms

    Griz Oh horror horror horror cease my queen
    Thy voice like twenty screechowls wracks my brain

    Queen Then rouse thy spiritwe may yet prevent
    This hated match

    Griz      We will nor fate itself
    Should it conspire with Thomas Thumb should cause it
    Ill swim through seas Ill ride upon the clouds
    Ill dig the earth Ill blow out every fire
    Ill rave Ill rant Ill rise Ill rush Ill roar
    Fierce as the man whom smiling dolphins bore
    From the prosaic to poetic shore
    Ill tear the scoundrel into twenty pieces

    Queen Oh no prevent the match but hurt him not
    For though I would not have him have my daughter
    Yet can we kill the man that killed the giants

    Griz I tell you madam it was all a trick
    He made the giants first and then he killed them
    As foxhunters bring foxes to the wood
    And then with hounds they drive them out again

    Queen How have you seen no giants Are there not
    Now in the yard ten thousand proper giants

    Griz Indeed I cannot positively tell
    But firmly do believe there is not one

    Queen Hence from my sight thou traitor hie away
    By all my stars thou enviest Tom Thumb
    Go sirrah go hie away hiethou art
    A settingdog begone

    Griz                 Madam I go
    Tom Thumb shall feel the vengeance you have raised
    So when two dogs are fighting in the streets
    With a third dog one of the two dogs meets
    With angry teeth he bites him to the bone
    And this dog smarts for what that dog has done


SCENE VI

    Queen sola And whither shall I goAlack a day
    I love Tom Thumbbut must not tell him so
    For whats a woman when her virtues gone
    A coat without its lace wig out of buckle
    A stocking with a hole intI cant live
    Without my virtue or without Tom Thumb
    Then let me weigh them in two equal scales
    In this scale put my virtue that Tom Thumb
    Alas Tom Thumb is heavier than my virtue
    But holdperhaps I may be left a widow
    This match prevented then Tom Thumb is mine
    In that dear hope I will forget my pain
      So when some wench to Tothill Bridewells sent
    With beating hemp and flogging shes content
    She hopes in time to ease her present pain
    At length is free and walks the streets again

    Nood                             Sir I blush
    To think a warrior great in arms as you
    Should be affrighted by his grandmamma
    Can an old womans empty dreams deter
    The blooming hero from the virgins arms
    Think of the joy that will your soul alarm
    When in her fond embraces claspd you lie
    While on her panting breast dissolved in bliss
    You pour out all Tom Thumb in every kiss

    Thumb Oh Noodle thou hast fired my eager soul

SCENE IIIThe Princess HUNCAMUNCAS Apartment

HUNCAMUNCA CLEORA MUSTACHA

    Hunc Give me some musicsee that it be sad

CLEORA sings

    Cupid ease a lovesick maid
    Bring thy quiver to her aid
    With equal ardour wound the swain
    Beauty should never sigh in vain

    Let him feel the pleasing smart
    Drive the arrow through his heart
    When one you wound you then destroy
    When both you kill you kill with joy

    Hunc O Tom Thumb Tom Thumb wherefore art thou Tom Thumb
    Why hadst thou not been born of royal race
    Why had not mighty Bantam been thy father
    Or else the King of Brentford old or new

Must I am surprised that your highness can give yourself a moments
uneasiness about that little insignificant fellow Tom Thumb the
Greatone properer for a plaything than a husband Were he my
husband his horns should be as long as his body If you had fallen in
love with a grenadier I should not have wondered at it If you had
fallen in love with something but to fall in love with nothing

    Hunc Cease my Mustacha on thy duty cease
    The zephyr when in flowery vales it plays
    Is not so soft so sweet as Thummys breath
    The dove is not so gentle to its mate

Must The dove is every bit as proper for a husbandAlas madam
theres not a beau about the court looks so little like a man He is a
perfect butterfly a thing without substance and almost without shadow
too

    Hunc This rudeness is unseasonable desist
    Or I shall think this railing comes from love
    Tom Thumbs a creature of that charming form
    That no one can abuse unless they love him

Must Madam the king


SCENE IV

KING HUNCAMUNCA

    King Let all but Huncamunca leave the room
         Exeunt CLEORA and MUSTACHA
    Daughter I have observed of late some grief
    Unusual in your countenance your eyes
    That like two open windows used to show
    The lovely beauty of the rooms within
    Have now two blinds before them What is the cause
    Say have you not enough of meat and drink
    Weve given strict orders not to have you stinted

    Hunc Alas my lord I value not myself
    That once I ate two fowls and half a pig
    Small is that praise but oh a maid may want
    What she can neither eat nor drink

    King                                 Whats that

    Hunc O spare my blushes but I mean a husband

    King If that be all I have provided one
    A husband great in arms whose warlike sword
    Streams with the yellow blood of slaughterd giants
    Whose name in Terr Incognit is known
    Whose valour wisdom virtue make a noise
    Great as the kettledrums of twenty armies

    Hunc Whom does my royal father mean

    King                                 Tom Thumb

    Hunc Is it possible

    King                 Ha the windowblinds are gone
    A countrydance of joy is in your face
    Your eyes spit fire your cheeks grow red as beef

    Hunc Oh theres a magicmusic in that sound
    Enough to turn me into beef indeed
    Yes I will own since licensed by your word
    Ill own Tom Thumb the cause of all my grief
    For him Ive sighd Ive wept Ive gnawd my sheets

    King Oh thou shalt gnaw thy tender sheets no more
    A husband thou shalt have to mumble now

    Hunc Oh happy sound henceforth let no one tell
    That Huncamunca shall lead apes in hell
    Oh I am overjoyd

    King             I see thou art
    Joy lightens in thy eyes and thunders from thy brows
    Transports like lightning dart along thy soul
    As smallshot through a hedge

    Hunc                        Oh say not small

    King This happy news shall on our tongue ride post
    Ourself we bear the happy news to Thumb
    Yet think not daughter that your powerful charms
    Must still detain the hero from his arms
    Various his duty various his delight
    Now in his turn to kiss and now to fight
    And now to kiss again So mighty Jove
    When with excessive thundring tired above
    Comes down to earth and takes a bitand then
    Flies to his trade of thundring back again


SCENE V

GRIZZLE HUNCAMUNCA

    Griz Oh Huncamunca Huncamunca oh
    Thy pouting breasts like kettledrums of brass
    Beat everlasting loud alarms of joy
    As bright as brass they are and oh as hard
    Oh Huncamunca Huncamunca oh

    Hunc Ha dost thou know me princess as I am
    That thus of me you dare to make your game

    Griz Oh Huncamunca well I know that you
    A princess are and a kings daughter too
    But love no meanness scorns no grandeur fears
    Love often lords into the cellar bears
    And bids the sturdy porter come up stairs
    For whats too high for love or whats too low
    Oh Huncamunca Huncamunca oh

    Hunc But granting all you say of love were true
    My love alas is to another due
    In vain to me a suitoring you come
    For Im already promised to Tom Thumb

    Griz And can my princess such a durgen wed
    One fitter for your pocket than your bed
    Advised by me the worthless baby shun
    Or you will neer be brought to bed of one
    Oh take me to thy arms and neverflinch
    Who am a man by Jupiter every inch
    Then while in joys together lost we lie
    Ill press thy soul while gods stand wishing by

    Hunc If sir what you insinuate you prove
    All obstacles of promise you remove
    For all engagements to a man must fall
    Wheneer that man is proved no man at all

    Griz Oh let him seek some dwarf some fairy miss
    Where no jointstool must lift him to the kiss
    But by the stars and glory you appear
    Much fitter for a Prussian grenadier
    One globe alone on Atlas shoulders rests
    Two globes are less than Huncamuncas breasts
    The milky way is not so white thats flat
    And sure thy breasts are full as large as that

    Hunc Oh sir so strong your eloquence I find
    It is impossible to be unkind

    Griz Ah speak that oer again and let the sound
    From one pole to another pole rebound
    The earth and sky each be a battledore
    And keep the sound that shuttlecock up an hour
    To Doctors Commons for a licence I
    Swift as an arrow from a bow will fly

    Hunc Oh no lest some disaster we should meet
    Twere better to be married at the Fleet

    Griz Forbid it all ye powers a princess should
    By that vile place contaminate her blood
    My quick return shall to my charmer prove
    I travel on the posthorses of love

    Hunc Those posthorses to me will seem too slow
    Though they should fly swift as the gods when they
    Ride on behind that postboy Opportunity


SCENE VI

TOM THUMB HUNCAMUNCA

    Thumb Where is my princess wheres my Huncamunca
    Where are those eyes those cardmatches of love
    That light up all with love my waxen soul
    Where is that face which artful nature made
    In the same moulds where Venus self was cast

    Hunc Oh what is music to the ear thats deaf
    Or a goosepie to him that has no taste
    What are these praises now to me since I
    Am promised to another

    Thumb            Ha promised

    Hunc Too sure tis written in the book of fate

    Thumb Then I will tear away the leaf
    Wherein its writ or if fate wont allow
    So large a gap within its journalbook
    Ill blot it out at least


SCENE VII

GLUMDALCA TOM THUMB HUNCAMUNCA

    Glum I need not ask if you are Huncamunca
    Your brandynose proclaims

    Hunc                        I am a princess
    Nor need I ask who you are

    Glum                    A giantess
    The queen of those who made and unmade queens

    Hunc The man whose chief ambition is to be
    My sweetheart hath destroyd these mighty giants

    Glum Your sweetheart Dost thou think the man who once
    Hath worn my easy chains will eer wear thine

    Hunc Well may your chains be easy since if fame
    Says true they have been tried on twenty husbands
    The glove or boot so many times pulld on
    May well sit easy on the hand or foot

    Glum I glory in the number and when I
    Sit poorly down like thee content with one
    Heaven change this face for one as bad as thine

    Hunc Let me see nearer what this beauty is
    That captivates the heart of men by scores
                                 Holds a candle to her face
    Oh Heaven thou art as ugly as the devil

    Glum Youd give the best of shoes within your shop
    To be but half so handsome

    Hunc                    Since you come
    To that Ill put my beauty to the test
    Tom Thumb Im yours if you with me will go

    Glum Oh stay Tom Thumb and you alone shall fill
    That bed where twenty giants used to lie

    Thumb In the balcny that oerhangs the stage
    Ive seen a puss two prentices engage
    One halfacrown does in his fingers hold
    The other shows a little piece of gold
    She the halfguinea wisely does purloin
    And leaves the larger and the baser coin

    Glum Left scornd and loathd for such a chit as this
    I feel the storm thats rising in my mind
    Tempests and whirlwinds rise and roll and roar
    Im all within a hurricane as if
    The worlds four winds were pent within my carcase
    Confusion horror murder gripes and death


SCENE VIII

KING GLUMDALCA

    King Sure never was so sad a king as I
    My life is worn as ragged as a coat
    A beggar wears a prince should put it off
    To love a captive and a giantess
    Oh love oh love how great a king art thou
    My tongues thy trumpet and thou trumpetest
    Unknown to me within me Oh Glumdalca
    Heaven thee designd a giantess to make
    But an angelic soul was shuffled in
    I am a multitude of walking griefs
    And only on her lips the balm is found
    To spread a plaster that might cure them all

    Glum What do I hear

    King                 What do I see

    Glum                                Oh

    King                                    Ah

    Glum Ah wretched queen

    King                     Oh wretched king

    Glum                                        Ah

    King                                            Oh


SCENE IX

TOM THUMB HUNCAMUNCA PARSON

    Par Happys the wooing thats not long adoing
    For if I guess right Tom Thumb this night
    Shall give a being to a new Tom Thumb

    Thumb It shall be my endeavour so to do

    Hunc Oh fie upon you sir you make me blush

    Thumb It is the virgins sign and suits you well
    I know not where nor how nor what I am
    Im so transported I have lost myself

    Hunc Forbid it all ye stars for youre so small
    That were you lost youd find yourself no more
    So the unhappy sempstress once they say
    Her needle in a pottle lost of hay
    In vain she lookd and lookd and made her moan
    For ah the needle was for ever gone

    Par Long may they live and love and propagate
    Till the whole land be peopled with Tom Thumbs
    So when the Cheshire cheese a maggot breeds
    Another and another still succeeds
    By thousands and ten thousands they increase
    Till one continued maggot fills the rotten cheese


SCENE X

NOODLE and then GRIZZLE

    Nood Sure Nature means to break her solid chain
    Or else unfix the world and in a rage
    To hurl it from its axletree and hinges
    All things are so confused the kings in love
    The queen is drunk the princess married is

    Griz Oh Noodle Hast thou Huncamunca seen

    Nood Ive seen a thousand sights this day where none
    Are by the Wonderful Pig himself outdone
    The king the queen and all the court are sights

    Griz Dn your delay you trifler are you drunk ha
    I will not hear one word but Huncamunca

    Nood By this time she is married to Tom Thumb

    Griz My Huncamunca

    Nood Your Huncamunca
    Tom Thumbs Huncamunca every mans Huncamunca

    Griz If this be true all womankind are curst

    Nood If it be not may I be so myself

    Griz See where she comes Ill not believe a word
    Against that face upon whose ample brow
    Sits innocence with majesty enthroned


GRIZZLE HUNCAMUNCA

    Griz Where has my Huncamunca been See here
    The licence in my hand

    Hunc           Alas Tom Thumb

    Griz Why dost thou mention him

    Hunc                          Ah me Tom Thumb

    Griz What means my lovely Huncamunca

    Hunc                                     Hum

    Griz Oh speak

    Hunc           Hum

    Griz                 Ha your every word is hum
    You force me still to answer you Tom Thumb
    Tom ThumbIm on the rackIm in a flame
    Tom Thumb Tom Thumb Tom Thumbyou love the name
    So pleasing is that sound that were you dumb
    You still would find a voice to cry Tom Thumb

    Hunc Oh be not hasty to proclaim my doom
    My ample heart for more than one has room
    A maid like me Heaven formd at least for two
    I married him and now Ill marry you

    Griz Ha dost thou own thy falsehood to my face
    Thinkst thou that I will share thy husbands place
    Since to that office one cannot suffice
    And since you scorn to dine one single dish on
    Go get your husband put into commission
    Commissioners to discharge ye gods it fine is
    The duty of a husband to your highness
    Yet think not long I will my rival bear
    Or unrevenged the slighted willow wear
    The gloomy brooding tempest now confined
    Within the hollow caverns of my mind
    In dreadful whirl shall roll along the coasts
    Shall thin the land of all the men it boasts
    And cram up evry chink of hell with ghosts
    So have I seen in some dark winters day
    A sudden storm rush down the skys highway
    Sweep through the streets with terrible dingdong
    Gush through the spouts and wash whole clouds along
    The crowded shops the thronging vermin screen
    Together cram the dirty and the clean
    And not one shoeboy in the street is seen

    Hunc Oh fatal rashness should his fury slay
    My hapless bridegroom on his weddingday
    I who this morn of two chose which to wed
    May go again this night alone to bed
    So have I seen some wild unsettled fool
    Who had her choice of this and that jointstool
    To give the preference to either loth
    And fondly coveting to sit on both
    While the two stools her sittingpart confound
    Between em both fall squat upon the ground

    I thought what was the courage of a ghost
    Yet dare not on thy lifeWhy say I that
    Since life thou hast notDare not walk again
    Within these walls on pain of the Red Sea
    For if henceforth I ever find thee here

    Ghost Were the Red Sea a sea of Hollands gin
    The liquor when alive whose very smell
    I did detest did loatheyet for the sake
    Of Thomas Thumb I would be laid therein

    King Ha said you

    The dearest friend when dead we all forget

    King Tis heit is the honest Gaffer Thumb
    Oh let me press thee in my eager arms
    Thou best of ghosts thou something more than ghost

    Ghost Would I were something more that we again
    Might feel each other in the warm embrace

    King But say thou dearest air oh say what dread
    Important business sends thee back to earth

    Ghost Oh then prepare to hearwhich but to hear

    Thy subjects up in arms by Grizzle led
    Will ere the rosyfingerd morn shall ope
    The shutters of the sky before the gate
    Of this thy royal palace swarming spread
    So have I seen the bees in clusters swarm
    So have I seen the stars in frosty nights
    So have I seen the sand in windy days
    So have I seen the ghosts on Plutos shore
    So have I seen the flowers in spring arise
    So have I seen the leaves in autumn fall
    So have I seen the fruits in summer smile
    So have I seen the snow in winter frown

    King Dn all thou hast seendost thou beneath the shape
    Of Gaffer Thumb come hither to abuse me
    With similes to keep me on the rack

SCENE III

KING solus

    King Oh stay and leave me not uncertain thus
    And whilst thou tellest me whats like my fate
    Oh teach me how I may avert it too
    Cursd be the man who first a simile made
    Cursd evry bard who writesSo have I seen
    Those whose comparisons are just and true
    And those who liken things not like at all
    The devil is happy that the whole creation
    Can furnish out no simile to his fortune


SCENE IV

KING QUEEN

    Queen What is the cause my Arthur that you steal
    Thus silently from Dollallollas breast
    Why dost thou leave me in the dark alone
    When well thou knowst I am afraid of sprites

    King Oh Dollallolla do not blame my love
    I hoped the fumes of last nights punch had laid
    Thy lovely eyelids fast but oh I find
    There is no power in drams to quiet wives
    Each morn as the returning sun they wake
    And shine upon their husbands

    Queen                          Think oh think
    What a surprise it must be to the sun
    Rising to find the vanishd world away
    What less can be the wretched wifes surprise
    When stretching out her arms to fold thee fast
    She found her useless bolster in her arms
    Think think on thatOh think think well on that
    I do remember also to have read
    In Drydens Ovids Metamorphoses
    That Jove in form inanimate did lie
    With beauteous Dana and trust me love
    I feard the bolster might have been a Jove

    King Come to my arms most virtuous of thy sex
    Oh Dollallolla were all wives like thee
    So many husbands never had worn horns
    Should Huncamunca of thy worth partake
    Tom Thumb indeed were blestOh fatal name
    For didst thou know one quarter what I know
    Then wouldst thou knowalas what thou wouldst know

    Queen What can I gather hence Why dost thou speak
    Like men who carry rareeshows about
    Now you shall see gentlemen what you shall see
    O tell me more or thou hast told too much


SCENE V

KING QUEEN NOODLE

    Nood Long life attend your majesties serene
    Great Arthur king and Dollallolla queen
    Lord Grizzle with a bold rebellious crowd
    Advances to the palace threatning loud
    Unless the princess be deliverd straight
    And the victorious Thumb without his pate
    They are resolvd to batter down the gate


SCENE VI

KING QUEEN HUNCAMUNCA NOODLE

    King See where the princess comes Where is Tom Thumb

    Hunc Oh sir about an hour and half ago
    He sallied out t encounter with the foe
    And swore unless his fate had him misled
    From Grizzles shoulders to cut off his head
    And servet up with your chocolate in bed

    King Tis well I found one devil told us both
    Come Dollallolla Huncamunca come
    Within well wait for the victorious Thumb
    In peace and safety we secure may stay
    While to his arm we trust the bloody fray
    Though men and giants should conspire with gods
    He is alone equal to all these odds

    Queen He is indeed a helmet to us all
    While he supports we need not fear to fall
    His arm despatches all things to our wish
    And serves up evry foes head in a dish
    Void is the mistress of the house of care
    While the good cook presents the bill of fare
    Whether the cod that northern king of fish
    Or duck or goose or pig adorn the dish
    No fears the number of her guests afford
    But at her hour she sees the dinner on the board

    No enemy to fight withal

    Methinks would willingly avoid this day
    This first of April to engage our foes

    Griz This day of all the days of the year Id choose
    For on this day my grandmother was born
    Gods I will make Tom Thumb an Aprilfool
    Will teach his wit an errand it neer knew
    And send it post to the Elysian shades

    Food Im glad to find our army is so stout
    Nor does it move my wonder less than joy

TOM THUMB GLUMDALCA cum suis

    Thumb Oh Noodle hast thou seen a day like this
    The unborn thunder rumbles oer our heads
    As if the gods meant to unhinge the world
    And heaven and earth in wild confusion hurl
    Yet will I boldly tread the tottring ball

    Merl Tom Thumb

    Thumb          What voice is this I hear

    Merl                                     Tom Thumb

    Merlin by name a conjuror by trade
    And to my art thou dost thy being owe

    Thumb How

    Merl Hear then the mystic getting of Tom Thumb

    His father was a ploughman plain
      His mother milkd the cow
    And yet the way to get a son
      This couple knew not how
    Until such time the good old man
      To learned Merlin goes
    And there to him in great distress
      In secret manner shows
    How in his heart he wishd to have
      A child in time to come
    To be his heir though it may be
      No bigger than his thumb
    Of which old Merlin was foretold
      That he his wish should have
    And so a son of stature small
      The charmer to him gave

    Thoust heard the pastlook up and see the future

    Thumb Lost in amazements gulf my senses sink
    See there Glumdalca see another me

    Glum O sight of horror see you are devourd
    By the expanded jaws of a red cow

    Merl Let not these sights deter thy noble mind
    For lo a sight more glorious courts thy eyes
    See from afar a theatre arise
    There ages yet unborn shall tribute pay
    To the heroic actions of this day
    Then buskin tragedy at length shall choose
    Thy name the best supporter of her muse

    Thumb Enough let every warlike music sound
    We fall contented if we fall renownd

    Griz Triumph not Thumb nor think thou shalt enjoy
    Thy Huncamunca undisturbd Ill send
    My ghost to fetch her to the other world
    It shall but bait at heaven and then return
    But ha I feel death rumbling in my brains
    Some kinder sprite knocks softly at my soul
    And gently whispers it to haste away
    I come I come most willingly I come
    So when some city wife for country air
    To Hampstead or to Highgate does repair
    Her to make haste her husband does implore
    And cries My dear the coach is at the door
    With equal wish desirous to be gone
    She gets into the coach and then she criesDrive on

    Thumb With those last words he vomited his soul
    Which like whipt cream the devil will swallow down
    Bear off the body and cut off the head
    Which I will to the king in triumph lug
    Rebellions dead and now Ill go to breakfast

FOOTNOTES

Footnote  Corneille recommends some very remarkable day wherein to
fix the action of a tragedy This the best of our tragical writers have
understood to mean a day remarkable for the serenity of the sky or what
we generally call a fine summers day so that according to this their
exposition the same months are proper for tragedy which are proper for
pastoral Most of our celebrated English tragedies as Cato Mariamne
Tamerlane c begin with their observations on the morning Lee seems
to have come the nearest to this beautiful description of our authors

    The morning dawns with an unwonted crimson
    The flowers all odorous seem the garden birds
    Sing louder and the laughing sun ascends
    The gaudy earth with an unusual brightness
    All nature smilesCs Borg

Massinissa in the new Sophonisba is also a favourite of the sun

                        The sun too seems
    As conscious of my joy with broader eye
    To look abroad the world and all things smile
    Like Sophonisba

Memnon in the Persian Princess makes the sun decline rising that he
may not peep on objects which would profane his brightness

              The morning rises slow
    And all those ruddy streaks that used to paint
    The days approach are lost in clouds as if
    The horrors of the night had sent em back
    To warn the sun he should not leave the sea
    To peep c

criticism on our author takes great pains to explode this passage It
is says he difficult to guess what giants are here meant unless the
giant Despair in the Pilgrims Progress or the giant Greatness in the
Royal Villain for I have heard of no other sort of giants in the reign
of king Arthur Petrus Burmannus makes three Tom Thumbs one whereof
he supposes to have been the same person whom the Greeks call Hercules
and that by these giants are to be understood the Centaurs slain by that
hero Another Tom Thumb he contends to have been no other than the Hermes
Trismegistus of the ancients The third Tom Thumb he places under the
reign of king Arthur to which third Tom Thumb says he the actions of
the other two were attributed Now though I know that this opinion is
supported by an assertion of Justus Lipsius Thomam illum Thumbum non
alium quam Herculem fuisse satis constat yet shall I venture to oppose
one line of Mr Midwinter against them all

    In Arthurs court Tom Thumb did live

But then says Dr By if we place Tom Thumb in the court of king
Arthur it will be proper to place that court out of Britain where no
giants were ever heard of Spenser in his Fairy Queen is of another
opinion where describing Albion he says

        Far within a savage nation dwelt
    Of hideous gants

And in the same canto

    Then Elfar with two brethren giants had
    The one of which had two heads
                     The other three

Risum teneatis amici

Footnote  To whisper in books says Mr Ds is arrant nonsense
I am afraid this learned man does not sufficiently understand the
extensive meaning of the word whisper If he had rightly understood what
is meant by the senses whispring the soul in the Persian Princess or
what whispring like winds is in Aurengzebe or like thunder in another
author he would have understood this Emmeline in Dryden sees a voice
but she was born blind which is an excuse Panthea cannot plead in Cyrus
who hears a sight

          Your description will surpass
    All fiction painting or dumb show of horror
    That ever ears yet heard or eyes beheld

When Mr Ds understands these he will understand whispering in books

Footnote  An expression vastly beneath the dignity of tragedy says
Mr Ds yet we find the word he cavils at in the mouth of Mithridates
less properly used and applied to a more terrible idea

    I would be drunk with deathMithridates

The author of the new Sophonisba taketh hold of this monosyllable and
uses it pretty much to the same purpose

    The Carthaginian sword with Roman blood
    Was drunk

I would ask Mr Ds which gives him the best idea a drunken king or a
drunken sword

Mr Tate dresses up king Arthurs resolution in heroic

    Merry my lord o th captains humour right
    I am resolved to be dead drunk tonight

Lee also uses this charming word

Footnote  A tragical exclamation

Footnote  This line is copied verbatim in the Captives

Footnote  We find a candlestick for this candle in two celebrated
authors

    His golden head and burns within the socketNero

    A soul grown old and sunk into the socketSebastian


Footnote  This simile occurs very frequently among the dramatic
writers of both kinds

Footnote  Mr Lee hath stolen this thought from our author

        This perfect face drawn by the gods in council
    Which they were long in makingLuc Jun Brut

        At his birth the heavenly council paused
    And then at last cried out This is a man

Dryden hath improved this hint to the utmost perfection

    So perfect that the very gods who formd you wonderd
    At their own skill and cried A lucky hit
    Has mended our design Their envy hinderd
    Or you had been immortal and a pattern
    When Heaven would work for ostentation sake
    To copy out againAll for Love

Banks prefers the works of Michael Angelo to that of the gods

    A pattern for the gods to make a man by
    Or Michael Angelo to form a statue


Footnote  It is impossible says Mr W sufficiently to admire
this natural easy line

Footnote  This tragedy which in most points resembles the ancients
differs from them in thisthat it assigns the same honour to lowness
of stature which they did to height The gods and heroes in Homer and
Virgil are continually described higher by the head than their followers
the contrary of which is observed by our author In short to exceed on
either side is equally admirable and a man of three foot is as wonderful
a sight as a man of nine

Footnote  This wellbred line seems to be copied in the Persian
Princess

Footnote  This doubt of the king puts me in mind of a passage in
the Captives where the noise of feet is mistaken for the rustling of
leaves

               Methinks I hear
    The sound of feet
    No twas the wind that shook yon cypress boughs

first page of Love Triumphant

Footnote  Don Carlos in the Revenge suns himself in the charms of
his mistress

Footnote  A tragical phrase much in use

Footnote  This speech hath been taken to pieces by several tragical
authors who seem to have rifled it and share its beauties among them

Footnote  There is not one beauty in this charming speech but what
hath been borrowd by almost every tragic writer

Footnote  Mr Banks has I wish I could not say too servilely
imitated this of Grizzle in his Earl of Essex

    Where art thou Essex c


Footnote  The Countess of Nottingham in the Earl of Essex is
apparently acquainted with Dollallolla

Footnote  Grizzle was not probably possessed of that glue of which
Mr Banks speaks in his Cyrus

    Ill glue my ears to every word


Footnote 

    Screechowls dark ravens and amphibious monsters
    Are screaming in that voiceMary Queen of Scots


Footnote  The reader may see all the beauties of this speech in a
late ode called the Naval Lyrick

Footnote  This epithet to a dolphin doth not give one so clear an
idea as were to be wished a smiling fish seeming a little more difficult
to be imagined than a flying fish Mr Dryden is of opinion that smiling
is the property of reason and that no irrational creature can smile

    Smiles not allowd to beasts from reason moveState of Innocence


Footnote  These lines are written in the same key with those in the
Earl of Essex

    Why sayst thou so I love thee well indeed
    I do and thou shalt find by this tis true

Or with this in Cyrus

    The most heroic mind that ever was

And with above half of the modern tragedies

Footnote  Aristotle in that excellent work of his which is very
justly styled his masterpiece earnestly recommends using the terms of
art however coarse or even indecent they may be Mr Tate is of the same
opinion

    Bru Do not like young hawks fetch a course about
    Your game flies fair

    Fra Do not fear it
    He answers you in your hawking phraseIn Love

I think these two great authorities are sufficient to justify Dollallolla
in the use of the phrase Hie away hie when in the same line she says
she is speaking to a settingdog

Footnote  We meet with such another pair of scales in Drydens King
Arthur

    Arthur and Oswald and their different fates
    Are weighing now within the scales of heaven

Also in Sebastian

    This hour my lot is weighing in the scales


Footnote  Mr Rowe is generally imagined to have taken some hints
from this scene in his character of Bajazet but as he of all the tragic
writers bears the least resemblance to our author in his diction I am
unwilling to imagine he would condescend to copy him in this particular

Footnote  This method of surprising an audience by raising their
expectation to the highest pitch and then baulking it hath been
practised with great success by most of our tragical authors

Footnote  Almeyda in Sebastian is in the same distress

    Sometimes methinks I hear the groan of ghosts
    Thin hollow sounds and lamentable screams
    Then like a dying echo from afar
    My mothers voice that cries Wed not Almeyda
    Forewarnd Almeyda marriage is thy crime


Footnote  As very well he may if he hath any modesty in him says
Mr Ds The author of Busiris is extremely zealous to prevent the suns
blushing at any indecent object and therefore on all such occasions he
addresses himself to the sun and desires him to keep out of the way

    Rise never more O sun let night prevail
    Eternal darkness close the worlds wide sceneBusiris

    Sun hide thy face and put the world in mourningIbid

Mr Banks makes the sun perform the office of Hymen and therefore not
likely to be disgusted at such a sight

    The sun sets forth like a gay brideman with youMary Queen of
       Scots

The Earl of Essex is of a different opinion and seems to place the chief
happiness of a general therein

    Then they might eatBankss Earl of Essex

But if we may believe one who knows more than either the devil himself
we shall find eating to be an affair of more moment than is generally
imagined

    Gods are immortal only by their food

Lucifer in the State of Innocence

Footnote  This expression is enough of itself says Mr D
utterly to destroy the character of Huncamunca Yet we find a woman of
no abandoned character in Dryden adventuring farther and thus excusing
herself

    To speak our wishes first forbid it pride
    Forbid it modesty true they forbid it
    But Nature does not When we are athirst
    Or hungry will imperious Nature stay

method of making man One tells his mistress that the mould she was made
in being lost Heaven cannot form such another Lucifer in Dryden gives
a merry description of his own formation

    Whom heaven neglecting made and scarce designd
    But threw me in for number to the restState of Innocence

In one place the same poet supposes man to be made of metal

    Of that coarse metal which when she was made
    The gods threw by for rubbishAll for Love

Footnote  I know some of the commentators have imagined that Mr
Dryden in the altercative scene between Cleopatra and Octavia a scene
which Mr Addison inveighs against with great bitterness is much
beholden to our author How just this their observation is I will not
presume to determine

we may find as monstrous images in the tragic authors Ill put down

authors to a shoemakers

Footnote  Mr L takes occasion in this place to commend the
great care of our author to preserve the metre of blank verse in which
Shakespeare Jonson and Fletcher were so notoriously negligent and the
moderns in imitation of our author so laudably observant

Footnote  Our author who everywhere shows his great penetration
into human nature here outdoes himself where a less judicious poet
would have raised a long scene of whining love he who understood the
passions better and that so violent an affection as this must be too big
for utterance chooses rather to send his characters off in this sullen
and doleful manner in which admirable conduct he is imitated by the
author of the justly celebrated Eurydice Dr Young seems to point at
this violence of passion

Footnote  A ridiculous supposition to any one who considers the
great and extensive largeness of hell says a commentator but not so to
those who consider the great expansion of immaterial substance Mr Banks
makes one soul to be so expanded that heaven could not contain it

The Persian Princess hath a passage not unlike the author of this

    We will send such shoals of murderd slaves
    Shall glut hells empty regions

This threatens to fill hell even though it was empty Lord Grizzle only
to fill up the chinks supposing the rest already full

Footnote  Mr Addison is generally thought to have had this simile
in his eye when he wrote that beautiful one at the end of the third act
of his Cato

Footnote  This beautiful simile is founded on a proverb which does
honour to the English language

    Between two stools the breech falls to the ground

I am not so well pleased with any written remains of the ancients as
with those little aphorisms which verbal tradition hath delivered down
to us under the title of proverbs It were to be wished that instead of
filling their pages with the fabulous theology of the pagans our modern
poets would think it worth their while to enrich their works with the
proverbial sayings of their ancestors Mr Dryden hath chronicled one in
heroic

    Two ifs scarce make one possibilityConq of Granada

My Lord Bacon is of opinion that whatever is known of arts and sciences
might be proved to have lurked in the Proverbs of Solomon I am of
the same opinion in relation to those abovementioned at least I am
confident that a more perfect system of ethics as well as economy might
be compiled out of them than is at present extant either in the works of
the ancient philosophers or those more valuable as more voluminous ones
of the modern divines

Footnote  Of all the particulars in which the modern stage falls
short of the ancients there is none so much to be lamented as the great
scarcity of ghosts Whence this proceeds I will not presume to determine
Some are of opinion that the moderns are unequal to that sublime language
which a ghost ought to speak One says ludicrously that ghosts are
out of fashion another that they are properer for comedy forgetting
I suppose that Aristotle hath told us that a ghost is the soul of
tragedy for so I render the Greek psych ho mythos ts tragdias
which M Dacier amongst others hath mistaken I suppose misled by not
understanding the Fabula of the Latins which signifies a ghost as well
as fable

    Te premet nox fabulque manesHorace

Of all the ghosts that have ever appeared on the stage a very learned
and judicious foreign critic gives the preference to this of our author
These are his words speaking of this tragedyNec quidquam in ill
admirabilius qum phasma quoddam horrendum quod omnibus aliis spectris
quibuscum scatet Angelorum tragoedia long pace Dysii V Doctiss
dixerim prtulerim

Footnote  We have already given instances of this figure

Footnote  The man who writ this wretched pun says Mr D
would have picked your pocket which he proceeds to show not only
bad in itself but doubly so on so solemn an occasion And yet in
that excellent play of Liberty Asserted we find something very much
resembling a pun in the mouth of a mistress who is parting with the
lover she is fond of

by the commentators For my part I find it difficult to understand it at
all Mr Dryden says

    Ive heard something how two bodies meet
    But how two souls join I know not

So that till the body of a spirit be better understood it will be
difficult to understand how it is possible to run him through it

Footnote  Cydaria is of the same fearful temper with Dollalolla

    I never durst in darkness be aloneInd Emp


Footnote 

    Think well of this think that think every waySophon


Footnote  These quotations are more usual in the comic than in the
tragic writers

Footnote  This distress says Mr D I must allow to be
extremely beautiful and tends to heighten the virtuous character of
Dollallolla who is so exceeding delicate that she is in the highest
apprehension from the inanimate embrace of a bolster An example worthy
of imitation for all our writers of tragedy

Footnote 

    Credat Judus Appella
    Non ego

says Mr D For passing over the absurdity of being equal to odds can
we possibly suppose a little insignificant fellowI say again a little
insignificant fellowable to vie with a strength which all the Samsons
and Herculeses of antiquity would be unable to encounter I shall refer
this incredulous critic to Mr Drydens defence of his Almanzor and
lest that should not satisfy him I shall quote a few lines from the
speech of a much braver fellow than Almanzor Mr Johnsons Achilles

    Though human race rise in embattled hosts
    To force her from my armsOh son of Atreus
    By that immortal powr whose deathless spirit
    Informs this earth I will oppose them allVictim


Footnote  I have heard of being supported by a staff says Mr D
but never of being supported by a helmet I believe he never heard of
sailing with wings which he may read in no less a poet than Mr Dryden

    Unless we borrow wings and sail through airLove Triumphant

What will he say to a kneeling valley

                           Ill stand
    Like a safe valley that low bends the knee
    To some aspiring mountainInjured Love

I am ashamed of so ignorant a carper who doth not know that an epithet
in tragedy is very often no other than an expletive Do not we read in
the New Sophonisba of grinding chains blue plagues white occasions
and blue serenity Nay it is not the adjective only but sometimes
half a sentence is put by way of expletive as Beauty pointed high
with spirit in the same play and In the lap of blessing to be most
curst in the Revenge

Footnote  A victory like that of Almanzor

Almanzor is victorious without fightConquest of Granada

Footnote 

    Well have we chose an happy day for fight
    For every man in course of time has found
    Some days are lucky some unfortunateKing Arthur


Footnote  We read of such another in Lee

    Teach his rude wit a flight she never made
    And send her post to the Elysian shadeGloriana


Footnote  These lines are copied verbatim in the Indian Emperor

Footnote  Unborn thunder rolling in a cloudConquest of
Granada

Footnote 

    Were heaven and earth in wild confusion hurld
    Should the rash gods unhinge the rolling world
    Undaunted would I tread the tottring ball

Footnote  The character of Merlin is wonderful throughout but most
so in this prophetic part We find several of these prophecies in the
tragic authors who frequently take this opportunity to pay a compliment
to their country and sometimes to their prince None but our author
who seems to have detested the least appearance of flattery would have
passed by such an opportunity of being a political prophet

Footnote  I saw the villain Myron with these eyes I saw
himBusiris In both which places it is intimated that it is
sometimes possible to see with other eyes than your own

Footnote  This mustard says Mr D is enough to turn ones
stomach I would be glad to know what idea the author had in his head
when he wrote it This will be I believe best explained by a line of
Mr Dennis

    And gave him liberty the salt of lifeLiberty Asserted

The understanding that can digest the one will not rise at the other

Footnote  This last speech of my Lord Grizzle hath been of great
service to our poets

                             Ill hold it fast
    As life and when lifes gone Ill hold this last
    And if thou takst it from me when Im slain
    Ill send my ghost and fetch it back againConq of Gran


Footnote 

    My soul should with such speed obey
    It should not bait at heaven to stop its way


Footnote  Lee seems to have had this last in his eye

    Twas not my purpose sir to tarry there
    I would but go to heaven to take the airGloriana

    A rising vapour rumbling in my brainsCleomenes


Footnote 

    Some kind sprite knocks softly at my soul
    To tell me fates at hand


Footnote  Mr Dryden seems to have had this simile in his eye when
he says

    My soul is packing up and just on wingConq of Gran
    And in a purple vomit pourd his soulCleomenes

Footnote 

    How I could curse my name of Ptolemy
    It is so long it asks an hour to write it
    By heaven Ill change it into Jove or Mars
    Or any other civil monosyllable
    That will not tire my handCleomenes


Footnote  Here is a visible conjunction of two days in one by
which our author may have either intended an emblem of a wedding or
to insinuate that men in the honeymoon are apt to imagine time shorter
than it is It brings into my mind a passage in the comedy called the
CoffeeHouse Politician

    We will celebrate this day at my house tomorrow


Footnote  These beautiful phrases are all to be found in one single
speech of King Arthur or the British Worthy

Footnote 

    I was but teaching him to grace his tale
    With decent horrorCleomenes


Footnote  We may say with Dryden

    Death did at length so many slain forget
    And left the tale and took them by the great

I know of no tragedy which comes nearer to this charming and bloody
catastrophe than Cleomenes where the curtain covers five principal
characters dead on the stage These lines too

    I askd no questions then of who killd who
    The bodies tell the story as they lie

seem to have belonged more properly to this scene of our author nor can
I help imagining they were originally his The Rival Ladies too seem
beholden to this scene

    Were now a chain of lovers linkd in death
    Julia goes first Gonsalvo hangs on her
    And Angelina hangs upon Gonsalvo
    As I on Angelina

No scene I believe ever received greater honours than this It was
applauded by several encores a word very unusual in tragedy And it was
very difficult for the actors to escape without a second slaughter This
I take to be a lively assurance of that fierce spirit of liberty which
remains among us and which Mr Dryden in his essay on Dramatic Poetry
hath observed Whether custom says he hath so insinuated itself
into our countrymen or nature hath so formed them to fierceness I know
not but they will scarcely suffer combats and other objects of horror
to be taken from them And indeed I am for having them encouraged in
this martial disposition nor do I believe our victories over the French
have been owing to anything more than to those bloody spectacles daily
exhibited in our tragedies of which the French stage is so entirely
clear

    SCENEQUEERUMMANIA


PROLOGUE

    To night our comic muse the buskin wears
    And gives herself no small romantic airs
    Struts in heroics and in pompous verse
    Does the minutest incidents rehearse
    In ridicules strict retrospect displays
    The poetasters of these modern days
    Who with big bellowing bombast rend our ears
    Which stript of sound quite void of sense appears
    Or else their fiddlefaddle numbers flow
    Serenely dull elaborately low
    Either extreme when vain pretenders take
    The actor suffers for the authors sake
    The quitetird audience lose whole hours yet pay
    To go unpleasd and unimprovd away
    This being our scheme we hope you will excuse
    The wild excursion of the wanton muse
    Who out of frolic wears a mimic mask
    And sets herself so whimsical a task
    Tis meant to please but if should offend
    Its very short and soon will have an end

    Lulld by the cheerful trumpets gladsome clangour
    The noise of drums and thunder of artillery
    He sleeps supine amidst the din of war
    And yet tis not definitively sleep
    Rather a kind of doze a waking slumber
    That sheds a stupefaction oer his senses

    And at one stroke robbd thousands of their breath
    While on the slaughterd heaps himself did rise
    In pyramids of conquest to the skies
    The gods all haild and fain would have him stay
    But your bright charms have calld him thence away

    You are too pertly lavish in his praise
    Leave me for ever                   TATLANTHE kneeling

    My gracious queen and mistress so severe
    Ive made some horrible mistake no doubt
    Oh tell me what it is

    Queen               No find it out

    Till you some token of forgiveness show

    Too long the triumphs of our early times
    With civil discord and with regal crimes
    Have staind these boards while Shakespeares pen has shown
    Thoughts manners men to modern days unknown
    Too long have Rome and Athens been the rage   Applause
    And classic buskins soild a British stage
    Tonight our bard who scorns pedantic rules
    His plot has borrowd from the German schools
    The German schoolswhere no dull maxims bind
    The bold expansion of the electric mind
    Fixd to no period circled by no space
    He leaps the flaming bounds of time and place
    Round the dark confines of the forest raves
    With gentle robbers stocks his gloomy caves
    Tells how prime ministers are shocking things
    And reigning dukes as bad as tyrant kings
    How to two swains one nymph her vows may give
    And how two damsels with one lover live
    Delicious scenessuch scenes our bard displays
    Which crownd with German sue for British praise
    Slow are the steeds that through Germanias roads
    With hempen rein the slumbering postboy goads
    Slow is the slumbering postboy who proceeds
    Through deep sands floundering on those tardy steeds
    More slow more tedious from his husky throat
    Twangs through the twisted horn the struggling note
    These truths confessdOh yet ye travelld few
    Germanias plays with eyes unjaundiced view
    View and approvethough in each passage fine
    The faint translation mock the genuine line
    Though the nice ear the erring sight belie

    Ye travelld few attend On you our bard
    Builds his fond hope Do you his genius guard Applause

ACT ISCENE I

    Represents a room at an Inn at WeimarOn one side
    of the stage the barroom with jellies lemons in nets
    syllabubs and part of a cold roast fowl cOn the opposite
    side a window looking into the street through which
    persons inhabitants of Weimar are seen passing to and fro
    in apparent agitationMATILDA appears in a greatcoat
    and riding habit seated at the corner of the dinnertable
    which is covered with a clean huckaback clothPlates and
    napkins with buckshornhandled knives and forks are
    laid as if for four persons

MATILDA

    Mat Is it impossible for me to have dinner sooner

    Land Madam the Brunswick postwaggon is not yet come in
    and the ordinary is never before two oclock

    Mat with a look expressive of disappointment but immediately
    recomposing herself Well then I must have patience
    Exit Landlady Oh Casimere How often have the thoughts
    of thee served to amuse these moments of expectation What
    a difference alas Dinnerit is taken away as soon as over
    and we regret it not It returns again with the return of
    appetite The beef of tomorrow will succeed to the mutton of
    today as the mutton of today succeeded to the veal of yesterday
    But when once the heart has been occupied by a beloved
    object in vain would we attempt to supply the chasm by
    another How easily are our desires transferred from dish to
    dish Love only dear delusive delightful love restrains our
    wandering appetites and confines them to a particular
    gratification

Posthorn blowsReenter LANDLADY

Land Madam the postwaggon is come in with only a single gentlewoman

Mat Then show her upand let us have dinner instantly Landlady
going and rememberafter a moments recollection and with great
eagernessremember the toasted cheese

CECILIA enters in a brown cloth ridingdress as if just alighted from
the postwaggon

Mat Madam you seem to have had an unpleasant journey if I may judge
from the dust on your ridinghabit

Cec The way was dusty madam but the weather was delightful It
recalld to me those blissful moments when the rays of desire first
vibrated through my soul

Mat aside Thank Heaven I have at last found a heart which is
in unison with my own to Cecilia Yes I understand youthe first
pulsation of sentimentthe silver tones upon the yet unsounded harp

Cec The dawn of lifewhen this blossom putting her hand upon her
heart first expanded its petals to the penetrating dart of love

Mat Yesthe timethe golden time when the first beams of the
morning meet and embrace one another The blooming blue upon the yet
unplucked plum

Cec Your countenance grows animated my dear madam

Mat And yours too is glowing with illumination

Cec I had long been looking out for a congenial spirit My heart was
withered but the beams of yours have rekindled it

Mat A sudden thought strikes me let us swear an eternal friendship

Cec Let us agree to live together

    Mat Willingly         With rapidity and earnestness

    Cec Let us embrace                     They embrace

    Mat Yes I too have lovedyou too like me have been forsaken
          Doubtingly and as if with a desire to be informed

Cec Too true

Both Ah these men these men

LANDLADY enters and places a leg of muton on the table with sour
krout and prune saucethen a small dish of black puddings CECILIA
and MATILDA appear to take no notice of her

Mat Oh Casimere

muttonthe emissary of the Count was here again this morning and
offered me a large sum of money if I would consent to poison him

    Land Which you refused  With hesitation and anxiety

    Waiter Can you doubt it            With indignation

Land recovering herself and drawing up with an expression of
dignity The conscience of a poor man is as valuable to him as that of
a prince

Waiter It ought to be still more so in proportion as it is generally
more pure

Land Thou sayst truly Job

Waiter with enthusiasm He who can spurn at wealth when profferd
as the price of crime is greater than a prince

Posthorn blows Enter CASIMERE in a travelling dressa light blue

roomthey will be back again in a minute

Cas Where do they come from

     All this while the WAITER reenters with the bason and water
     CASIMERE pulls off his boots takes a napkin from the table and
     washes his face and hands

Land There is one of them I think comes from Nuremburgh

     Scene changes to a subterraneous vault in the Abbey of
     Quedlinburgh with coffins scutcheous Deaths heads and
     crossbonesToads and other loathsome reptiles are seen
     traversing the obscurer parts of the StageROGERO appears
     in chains in a suit of rusty armour with his beard grown
     and a cap of a grotesque form upon his headBeside him a
     crock or pitcher supposed to contain his daily allowance of

     whistle through the cavernsROGERO rises and comes slowly
     forward with his arms folded

Rog Eleven years it is now eleven years since I was first
immured in this living sepulchrethe cruelty of a ministerthe
perfidy of a monkyes Matilda for thy sakealive amidst the

fellowmen Soft what have we here stumbles over a bundle of
sticks This cavern is so dark that I can scarcely distinguish the
objects under my feet Oh the register of my captivity Let me see
how stands the account takes up the sticks and turns them over with
a melancholy air then stands silent for a few moments as if absorbed
in calculation Eleven years and fifteen days Hah the twentyeighth
of August How does the recollection of it vibrate on my heart It was
on this day that I took my last leave of my Matilda It was a summer
eveningher melting hand seemed to dissolve in mine as I pressd it to
my bosom Some demon whispered me that I should never see her more I
stood gazing on the hated vehicle which was conveying her away for ever
The tears were petrified under my eyelids My heart was crystallized with
agony Anon I looked along the road The diligence seemed to diminish
every instant I felt my heart beat against its prison as if anxious
to leap out and overtake it My soul whirled round as I watched the
rotation of the hinder wheels A long trail of glory followed after her
and mingled with the dustit was the emanation of Divinity luminous
with love and beauty like the splendour of the setting sun but it told
me that the sun of my joys was sunk for ever Yes here in the depths
of an eternal dungeonin the nursing cradle of hellthe suburbs of
perdition in a nest of demons where despair in vain sits brooding
over the putrid eggs of hope where agony woos the embrace of death
where patience beside the bottomless pool of despondency sits angling
for impossibilities Yet even here to behold her to embrace heryes
Matilda whether in this dark abode amidst toads and spiders or in a
royal palace amidst the more loathsome reptiles of a Court would be
indifferent to me Angels would shower down their hymns of gratulation
upon our headswhile fiends would envy the eternity of suffering
love Soft what air was that it seemed a sound of more than human
warblings Again listens attentively for some minutesonly the wind
It is well however it reminds me of that melancholy air which has so
often solaced the hours of my captivity Let me see whether the damps of
this dungeon have not yet injured my guitar Takes his guitar tunes
it and begins the following air with a full accompaniment of violins
from the orchestra

    AIR Lanterna Magica


SONG

BY ROGERO

I

    Wheneer with haggard eyes I view
      This dungeon that Im rotting in
    I think of those companions true
      Who studied with me at the U
              niversity of Gottingen
              niversity of Gottingen

     Weeps and pulls out a blue kerchief with which he wipes his
     eyes gazing tenderly at it he proceeds

II

    Sweet kerchief checkd with heavenly blue
      Which once my love sat knotting in
    Alas Matilda then was true
      At least I thought so at the U
              niversity of Gottingen
              niversity of Gottingen

     At the repetition of this line ROGERO clanks his chains in
     cadence

III

    Barbs barbs alas how swift you flew
      Her neat postwaggon trotting in
    Ye bore Matilda from my view
      Forlorn I languishd at the U
              niversity of Gottingen
              niversity of Gottingen

IV

    This faded form this pallid hue
      This blood my veins is clotting in
    My years are manythey were few
      When first I entered at the U
              niversity of Gottingon
              niversity of Gottingen

V

    There first for thee my passion grew
      Sweet sweet Matilda Pottingen
    Thou wast the daughter of my tu
      tor Law Professor at the U
              niversity of Gottingen
              niversity of Gottingen

VI

    Sun moon and thou vain world adieu
      That kings and priests are plotting in
    Here doomd to starve on water gru
      el never shall I see the U
              niversity of Gottingen
              niversity of Gottingen

     During the last stanza ROGERO dashes his head repeatedly
     against the walls of his prison and finally so hard as to
     produce a visible contusion He then throws himself on the floor
     in an agony The curtain dropsthe music still continuing to play
     till it is wholly fallen

                                   

We have received in the course of the last week several long and to
say the truth dull letters from unknown hands reflecting in very
severe terms on Mr Higgins for having as it is affirmed attempted
to pass upon the world as a faithful sample of the productions of the
German Theatre a performance no way resembling any of those pieces
which have of late excited and which bid fair to engross the admiration
of the British public

As we cannot but consider ourselves as the guardians of Mr Higginss
literary reputation in respect to every work of his which is conveyed
to the world through the medium of our paper though what we think of
the danger of his principles we have already sufficiently explained for
ourselves and have we trust succeeded in putting our readers upon
their guard against themwe hold ourselves bound not only to justify
the fidelity of the imitation but contrary to our original intention
to give a further specimen of it in our present number in order to bring
the question more fairly to issue between our author and his calumniators

In the first place we are to observe that Mr Higgins professes to
have taken his notion of German plays wholly from the translations which
have appeared in our language If they are totally dissimilar from
the originals Mr H may undoubtedly have been led into error but the
fault is in the translators not in him That he does not differ widely
from the models which he proposed to himself we have it in our power
to prove satisfactorily and might have done so in our last number by
subjoining to each particular passage of his play the scene in some one
or other of the German plays which he had in view when he wrote it
These parallel passages were faithfully pointed out to us by Mr H with
that candour which marks his character and if they were suppressed by
us as in truth they were on our heads be the blame whatever it may
be Little indeed did we think of the imputation which the omission
would bring upon Mr H as in fact our principal reason for it was the
apprehension that from the extreme closeness of the imitation in most
instances he would lose in praise for invention more than he would gain
in credit for fidelity

The meeting between Matilda and Cecilia for example in the first
act of the Rovers and their sudden intimacy has been censured as
unnatural Be it so It is taken almost word for word from Stella
a German or professedly a German piece now much in vogue from which
also the catastrophe of Mr Higginss play is in part borrowed so far as
relates to the agreement to which the ladies come as the reader will see
byandby to share Casimere between them

The dinner scene is copied partly from the published translation of the
Stranger and partly from the first scene of Stella The song of
Rogero with which the first act concludes is admitted on all hands to
be in the very first taste and if no German original is to be found for
it so much the worse for the credit of German literature

An objection has been made by one anonymous letterwriter to the names
of Puddingfield and Beefington as little likely to have been assigned
to English characters by any author of taste or discernment In answer
to this objection we have in the first place to admit that a small
and we hope not an unwarrantable alteration has been made by us since
the MS has been in our hands These names stood originally Puddincrantz
and Beefinstern which sounded to our ears as being liable especially
the latter to a ridiculous inflectiona difficulty that could only be
removed by furnishing them with English terminations With regard to the
more substantial syllables of the names our author proceeded in all
probability on the authority of Goldoni who though not a German is an
Italian writer of considerable reputation and who having heard that
the English were distinguished for their love of liberty and beef has
judiciously compounded the two words Runnymede and beef and thereby
produced an English nobleman whom he styles Lord Runnybeef

To dwell no longer on particular passagesthe best way perhaps of
explaining the whole scope and view of Mr Hs imitation will be to
transcribe the short sketch of the plot which that gentleman transmitted
to us together with his drama and which it is perhaps the more
necessary to give at length as the limits of our paper not allowing of
the publication of the whole piece some general knowledge of its main
design may be acceptable to our readers in order to enable them to judge
of the several extracts which we lay before them


PLOT

Rogero son of the late Minister of the Count of Saxe Weimar having
while he was at college fallen desperately in love with Matilda
Pottingen daughter of his tutor Doctor Engelbertus Pottingen Professor
of Civil Law and Matilda evidently returning his passion the doctor to
prevent ill consequences sends his daughter on a visit to her aunt in
Wetteravia where she becomes acquainted with Casimere a Polish officer
who happens to be quartered near her aunts and has several children by
him

Roderic Count of Saxe Weimar a prince of tyrannical and licentious
disposition has for his Prime Minister and favourite Gaspar a crafty
villain who had risen to his post by first ruining and then putting to
death Rogeros father Gaspar apprehensive of the power and popularity
which the young Rogero may enjoy at his return to Court seizes the
occasion of his intrigue with Matilda of which he is apprised officially
by Doctor Pottingen to procure from his master an order for the recall
of Rogero from college and for committing him to the care of the prior
of the Abbey of Quedlinburgh a priest rapacious savage and sensual
and devoted to Gaspars interestssending at the same time private
orders to the prior to confine him in a dungeon

Here Rogero languishes many years His daily sustenance is administered
to him through a grated opening at the top of a cavern by the
landlady of the Golden Eagle at Weimar with whom Gaspar contracts
in the Princes name for his support intending and more than once
endeavouring to corrupt the waiter to mingle poison with the food in
order that he may get rid of Rogero for ever

In the meantime Casimere having been called away from the neighbourhood
of Matildas residence to other quarters becomes enamoured of and
marries Cecilia by whom he has a family and whom he likewise deserts
after a few years cohabitation on pretence of business which calls him
to Kamtschatka

Doctor Pottingen now grown old and infirm and feeling the want of his
daughters society sends young Pottingen in search of her with strict
injunctions not to return without her and to bring with her either her
present lover Casimere or should that not be possible Rogero himself
if he can find him the doctor having set his heart upon seeing his
children comfortably settled before his death Matilda about the same
period quits her aunts in search of Casimere and Cecilia having been
advertised by an anonymous letter of the falsehood of his Kamtschatka
journey sets out in the postwaggon on a similar pursuit

It is at this point of time the play openswith the accidental meeting
of Cecilia and Matilda at the inn at Weimar Casimere arrives there soon
after and falls in first with Matilda and then with Cecilia Successive
claircissements take place and an arrangement is finally made by
which the two ladies are to live jointly with Casimere

Young Pottingen wearied with a few weeks search during which he has
not been able to find either of the objects of it resolves to stop
at Weimar and wait events there It so happens that he takes up his
lodging in the same house with Puddincrantz and Beefinstern two English
noblemen whom the tyranny of King John has obliged to fly from their
country and who after wandering about the Continent for some time have
fixed their residence at Weimar

The news of the signature of Magna Charta arriving determines
Puddincrantz and Beefinstern to return to England Young Pottingen opens
his case to them and entreats them to stay to assist him in the object
of his search This they refuse but coming to the inn where they are
to set off for Hamburgh they meet Casimere from whom they have both
received many civilities in Poland

Casimere by this time tired of his Double Arrangement and having
learned from the waiter that Rogero is confined in the vaults of the
neighbouring Abbey for love resolves to attempt his rescue and to
make over Matilda to him as the price of his deliverance He communicates
his scheme to Puddingfield and Beefington who agree to assist him as
also does young Pottingen The waiter of the inn proving to be a Knight
Templar in disguise is appointed leader of the expedition A band of
troubadours who happen to be returning from the Crusades and a company
of Austrian and Prussian Grenadiers returning from the Seven Years War
are engaged as troops

The attack on the Abbey is made with success The Count of Weimar and
Gaspar who are feasting with the prior are seized and beheaded in the
refectory The prior is thrown into the dungeon from which Rogero is
rescued Matilda and Cecilia rush in The former recognizes Rogero and
agrees to live with him The children are produced on all sides and
young Pottingen is commissioned to write to his father the doctor to
detail the joyful events which have taken place and to invite him to
Weimar to partake of the general felicity

     at another table in the corner of the room with a pipe in his
     mouth and a Saxon mug of a singular shape beside him which he
     repeatedly applies to his lips turning back his head and casting
     his eyes towards the firmament At the last trial he holds the mug
     for some moments in a directly inverted position then replaces it
     on the table with an air of dejection and gradually sinks into
     a profound slumber The pipe falls from his hand and is broken

     Exeunt Young POTTINGEN following and waving his hat but
     obviously without much consciousness of the meaning of what has
     passed

Scene changes to the outside of the Abbey A summers
eveningmoonlight Companies of Austrian and Prussian Grenadiers march
across the stage confusedly as if returning from the Seven Years War
Shouts and martial music The Abbey gates are opened The monks are
seen passing in procession with the Prior at their head The choir is
heard chanting vespers After which a pause Then a bell is heard as if
ringing for supper Soon after a noise of singing and jollity

     Enter from the Abbey pushed out of the gates by the Porter a
     Troubadour with a bundle under his cloak and a Lady under his
     arm Troubadour seems much in liquor but caresses the female
     minstrel

Fem Min Trust me Gieronymo thou seemest melancholy What hast thou
got under thy cloak

Trou Pshaw women will be inquiring Melancholy not I I will sing

         putting his hand on the bundle but without showing it
                 A joy Ill neer impart
               It is not wine it is not beer
                 But it consoles my heart

Fem Min interrupting him Ill be hangd if you dont mean the
bottle of cherrybrandy that you stole out of the vaults in the Abbey
cellar

     Fem Min attempts to lay hold of the bottle Troubadour pushes

     Exeunt struggling for the bottle but without anger or
     animosity the Fem Min appearing by degrees to obtain a
     superiority in the contest

Act the Third contains the eclaircissements and final arrangement
between Casimere Matilda and Cecilia which so nearly resemble the
concluding act of Stella that we forbear to lay it before our readers

FOOTNOTES

Footnote  A See the Robbers a German tragedy in which robbery is
put in so fascinating a light that the whole of a German University went
upon the highway in consequence of it

Footnote  See Cabal and Love a German tragedy very severe
against Prime Ministers and reigning Dukes of Brunswick This admirable
performance very judiciously reprobates the hire of German troops for the
American war in the reign of Queen Elizabetha practice which would
undoubtedly have been highly discreditable to that wise and patriotic
princess not to say wholly unnecessary there being no American war at
that particular time

Footnote  See the Stranger or Reformd Housekeeper in which
the former of these morals is beautifully illustrated and Stella a
genteel German comedy which ends with placing a man bodkin between
two wives like Thames between his two banks in the Critic
Nothing can be more edifying than these two dramas I am shocked to hear
that there are some people who think them ridiculous

Footnote  These are the warnings very properly given to readers
to beware how they judge of what they cannot understand Thus if the
translation runs lightning of my soul fulguration of angels sulphur
of hell we should recollect that this is not coarse or strange in the
German language when applied by a lover to his mistress but the English
has nothing precisely parallel to the original Mulychause Archangelichen
which means rather emanation of the archangelican natureor to
Smellmynkern Vankelfer which if literally rendered would signify
made of stuff of the same odour whereof the devil makes flambeaux See
Schttenbrch on the German Idiom

Footnote  This is an excellent joke in German the point and
spirit of which is but illrendered in a translation A Noddy the
reader will observe has two significationsthe one a knave at
allfours the other a fool or booby See the translation by Mr
Render of Count Benyowsky or the Conspiracy of Kamtschatka a German
tragicomicomitragedy where the play opens with a scene of a game at
chess from which the whole of this scene is copied and a joke of the
same point and merriment about pawnsie boors being a match for
kings

Footnote  This word in the original is strictly
fellowlodgerscooccupants of the same room in a house let out
at a small rent by the week There is no single word in English which
expresses so complicated a relation except perhaps the cant term of
chum formerly in use at our universities

Footnote  The balalaika is a Russian instrument resembling the
guitarSee the play of Count Benyowsky rendered into English

Footnote  See Count Benyowsky or the Conspiracy of Kamschatka
where Crustiew an old gentleman of much sagacity talks the following
nonsense

Crustiew with youthful energy and an air of secrecy and confidence
To fly to fly to the Isles of Marianthe island of Tiniana
terrestrial paradise Freefreea mild climatea new created
sunwholesome fruitsharmless inhabitantsand Libertytranquillity

Footnote  See Count Benyowsky as before

Footnote  See Count Benyowsky

Footnote  See Count Benyowsky again from which play this and the
preceding references are taken word for word We acquit the Germans of
such reprobate silly stuff It must be the translators

Footnote  We believe this song to be copied with a small variation
in metre and meaning from a song in Count Benyowsky or the Conspiracy
of Kamtschatkawhere the conspirators join in a chorus for fear of
being overheard

     The KING evinces strong emotions during the song and at the
     conclusion starts up

    Fusbos What ails my liege ah why that look so sad

    King coming forward I am in love I scorch I freeze Im mad
    Oh tell me Fusbos first and best of friends
    You who have wisdom at your fingers ends
    Shall it be so or shall it not be so
    Shall I my Griskinissas charms forego
    Compel her to give up the regal chair
    And place the rosy Distaffina there
    In such a case what course can I pursue
    I love my queen and Distaffina too

    Fusbos And would a king his general supplant
    I cant advise upon my soul I cant

    King So when two feasts whereat theres nought to pay
    Fall unpropitious on the selfsame day
    The anxious Cit each invitation views
    And ponders which to take or which refuse
    From this or that to keep away is loth
    And sighs to think he cannot dine at both         Exit

    Fusbos So when some schoolboy on a rainy day
    Finds all his playmates will no longer stay
    He takes the hint himselfand walks away         Exit

    Distaf aside My dream is out and I shall soon behold
    The pots and pans all turn to shining gold

    King puts his hat down to kneel on Here on my knees

REJECTED ADDRESSES

PREFACE


On the th of August  the following advertisement appeared in most
of the daily papers

Rebuilding of Drury Lane Theatre

The Committee are desirous of promoting a free and fair competition
for an Address to be spoken upon the opening of the Theatre which will
take place on the th of October next They have therefore thought
fit to announce to the public that they will be glad to receive any
such compositions addressed to their Secretary at the Treasury Office
in Drury Lane on or before the th of September sealed up with a
distinguishing word number or motto on the cover corresponding with
the inscription on a separate sealed paper containing the name of the
author which will not be opened unless containing the name of the
successful candidate

Upon the propriety of this plan mens minds were as they usually are
upon matters of moment much divided Some thought it a fair promise of
the future intention of the Committee to abolish that phalanx of authors
who usurp the stage to the exclusion of a large assortment of dramatic
talent blushing unseen in the background while others contended that
the scheme would prevent men of real eminence from descending into an
amphitheatre in which all Grub Street that is to say all London and
Westminster would be arrayed against them The event has proved both
parties to be in a degree right and in a degree wrong One hundred and
twelve Addresses have been sent in each sealed and signed and mottoed
as per order some written by men of great some by men of little and
some by men of no talent

Many of the public prints have censured the taste of the Committee in
thus contracting for Addresses as they would for nailsby the gross but
it is surprising that none should have censured their temerity One
hundred and eleven of the Addresses must of course be unsuccessful
to each of the authors thus infallibly classed with the genus
irritabile it would be very hard to deny six staunch friends who
consider his the best of all possible Addresses and whose tongues will
be as ready to laud him as to hiss his adversary These with the potent
aid of the bard himself make seven foes per Address and thus will be
created seven hundred and seventyseven implacable auditors prepared to
condemn the strains of Apollo himself a band of adversaries which no
prudent manager would think of exasperating

But leaving the Committee to encounter the responsibility they have
incurred the public have at least to thank them for ascertaining
and establishing one point which might otherwise have admitted of
controversy When it is considered that many amateur writers have been
discouraged from becoming competitors and that few if any of the
professional authors can afford to write for nothing and of course
have not been candidates for the honorary prize at Drury Lane we may
confidently pronounce that as far as regards number the present
is undoubtedly the Augustan age of English poetry Whether or not this
distinction will be extended to the quality of its productions must
be decided at the tribunal of posterity though the natural anxiety of
our authors on this score ought to be considerably diminished when they
reflect how few will in all probability be had up for judgment

It is not necessary for the Editor to mention the manner in which he
became possessed of this fair sample of the present state of poetry in
Great Britain It was his first intention to publish the whole but a
little reflection convinced him that by so doing he might depress the
good without elevating the bad He has therefore culled what had the
appearance of flowers from what possessed the reality of weeds and
is extremely sorry that in so doing he has diminished his collection
to twentyone Those which he has rejected may possibly make their
appearance in a separate volume or they may be admitted as volunteers
in the files of some of the newspapers or at all events they are sure
of being received among the awkward squad of the Magazines In general
they bear a close resemblance to each other thirty of them contain
extravagant compliments to the immortal Wellington and the indefatigable
Whitbread and as the lastmentioned gentleman is said to dislike praise
in the exact proportion in which he deserves it these laudatory writers
have probably been only building a wall against which they might run
their own heads

The Editor here begs leave to advance a few words in behalf of that
useful and muchabused bird the Phoenix and in so doing he is biassed
by no partiality as he assures the reader he not only never saw one
but mirabile dictu never caged one in a simile in the whole course
of his life Not less than sixtynine of the competitors have invoked
the aid of this native of Arabia but as from their manner of using him
after they had caught him he does not by any means appear to have been
a native of Arabia Felix the Editor has left the proprietors to treat
with Mr Polito and refused to receive this rara avis or black swan
into the present collection One exception occurs in which the admirable
treatment of this feathered incombustible entitles the author to great
praise That Address has been preserved and in the ensuing pages takes
the lead to which its dignity entitles it

Perhaps the reason why several of the subjoined productions of the MUS
LONDINENSES have failed of selection may be discovered in their being
penned in a metre unusual upon occasions of this sort and in their not
being written with that attention to stage effect the want of which
like want of manners in the concerns of life is more prejudicial than
a deficiency of talent There is an art in writing for the Theatre
technically called touch and go which is indispensable when we
consider the small quantum of patience which so motley an assemblage as
a London audience can be expected to afford All the contributors have
been very exact in sending their initials and mottoes Those belonging
to the present collection have been carefully preserved and each has
been affixed to its respective poem The letters that accompanied the
Addresses having been honourably destroyed unopened it is impossible
to state the real authors with any certainty but the ingenious reader
after comparing the initials with the motto and both with the poem may
form his own conclusions

The Editor does not anticipate any disapprobation from thus giving
publicity to a small portion of the REJECTED ADDRESSES for unless he
is widely mistaken in assigning the respective authors the fame of each
individual is established on much too firm a basis to be shaken by so
trifling and evanescent a publication as the present

                neque ego illi detrahere ausim
    Hrentem capiti mult cum laude coronam

Of the numerous pieces already sent to the Committee for performance
he has only availed himself of three vocal Travesties which he has
selected not for their merit but simply for their brevity Above
one hundred spectacles melodramas operas and pantomimes have been
transmitted besides the two first acts of one legitimate comedy Some
of these evince considerable smartness of manual dialogue and several
brilliant repartees of chairs tables and other inanimate wits but the
authors seem to have forgotten that in the new Drury Lane the audience
can hear as well as see Of late our theatres have been so constructed
that John Bull has been compelled to have very long ears or none at
all to keep them dangling about his skull like discarded servants
while his eyes were gazing at piebalds and elephants or else to stretch
them out to an asinine length to catch the congenial sound of braying
trumpets An auricular revolution is we trust about to take place and
as many people have been much puzzled to define the meaning of the new
era of which we have heard so much we venture to pronounce that as
far as regards Drury Lane Theatre the new era means the reign of ears
If the past affords any pledge for the future we may confidently expect
from the Committee of that House everything that can be accomplished by
the union of taste and assiduity




LOYAL EFFUSION

    Quiequid dicunt laudo id rursum si negant
    Laudo id quoqueTERENCE


    Hail glorious edifice stupendous work
    God bless the Regent and the Duke of York
      Ye Muses by whose aid I cried down Fox
    Grant me in Drury Lane a private box
    Where I may loll cry bravo and profess
    The boundless powers of Englands glorious press
    While Africs sons exclaim from shore to shore
    Quashee ma boo the slavetrade is no more
      In fair Arabia happy once now stony
    Since ruined by that arch apostate Boney
    A phoenix late was caught the Arab host
    Long ponderd part would boil it part would roast
    But while they ponder up the potlid flies
    Fledged beakd and clawd alive they see him rise
    To heaven and caw defiance in the skies
    So Drury first in roasting flames consumed
    Then by old renters to hot water doomd
    By Wyatts trowel patted plump and sleek
    Soars without wings and caws without a beak
    Gallias stern despot shall in vain advance
    From Paris the metropolis of France
    By this day month the monster shall not gain
    A foot of land in Portugal or Spain
    See Wellington in Salamancas field
    Forces his favourite general to yield
    Breaks thro his lines and leaves his boasted Marmont
    Expiring on the plain without his arm on
    Madrid he enters at the cannons mouth
    And then the villages still further south
    Base Buonapart filld with deadly ire
    Sets one by one our playhouses on fire
    Some years ago he pounced with deadly glee on
    The Opera House then burnt down the Pantheon
    Nay still unsated in a coat of flames
    Next at Millbank he crossed the river Thames
    Thy hatch O halfpenny passd in a trice
    Boild some black pitch and burnt down Astleys twice
    Then buzzing on thro ether with a vile hum
    Turnd to the left hand fronting the asylum
    And burnt the Royal Circus in a hurry
    Twas calld the Circus then but now the Surrey
      Who burnt confound his soul the houses twain
    Of Covent Garden and of Drury Lane
    Who while the British squadron lay off Cork
    God bless the Regent and the Duke of York
    With a foul earthquake ravaged the Caraccas
    And raised the price of dry goods and tobaccos
    Who makes the quartern loaf and Luddites rise
    Who fills the butchers shops with large blue flies
    Who thought in flames St Jamess Court to pinch
    Who burnt the wardrobe of poor Lady Finch
    Why he who forging for this isle a yoke
    Reminds me of a line I lately spoke
    The tree of freedom is the British oak
      Bless every man possessed of aught to give
    Long may Long Tilney Wellesley Long Pole live
    God bless the army bless their coats of scarlet
    God bless the navy bless the Princess Charlotte
    God bless the guards though worsted Gallia scoff
    And bless their pigtails tho theyre now cut off
    And oh in Downing Street should Old Nick revel
    Englands prime minister then bless the Devil




THE BABYS DEBUT

BY W W

    Thy lisping prattle and thy mincing gait
    All thy false mimic fooleries I hate
    For thou art Follys counterfeit and she
    Who is right foolish hath the better plea
    Natures true Idiot I prefer to theeCUMBERLAND

     Spoken in the character of NANCY LAKE a girl eight years of
     age who is drawn upon the stage in a childs chaise by SAMUEL
     HUGHES her uncles porter


    My brother Jack was nine in May
    And I was eight on Newyearsday
        So in Kate Wilsons shop
    Papa hes my papa and Jacks
    Bought me last week a doll of wax
        And brother Jack a top

    Jacks in the pouts and this it is
    He thinks mine came to more than his
        So to my drawer he goes
    Takes out the doll and oh my stars
    He pokes her head between the bars
        And melts off half her nose

    Quite cross a bit of string I beg
    And tie it to his pegtops peg
        And bang with might and main
    Its head against the parlour door
    Off flies the head and hits the floor
        And breaks a windowpane

    This made him cry with rage and spite
    Well let him cry it serves him right
        A pretty thing forsooth
    If hes to melt all scalding hot
    Half my dolls nose and I am not
        To draw his pegtops tooth

    Aunt Hannah heard the window break
    And cried O naughty Nancy Lake
        Thus to distress your aunt
    No Drury Lane for you today
    And while papa said Pooh she may
        Mamma said No she shant

    Well after many a sad reproach
    They got into a hackney coach
        And trotted down the street
    I saw them go one horse was blind
    The tails of both hung down behind
        Their shoes were on their feet

    The chaise in which poor brother Bill
    Used to be drawn to Pentonville
        Stood in the lumberroom
    I wiped the dust from off the top
    While Molly moppd it with a mop
        And brushd it with a broom

    My uncles porter Samuel Hughes
    Came in at six to black the shoes
        I always talk to Sam
    So what does he but takes and drags
    Me in the chaise along the flags
        And leaves me where I am

    My fathers walls are made of brick
    But not so tall and not so thick
        As these and goodness me
    My fathers beams are made of wood
    But never never half so good
        As these that now I see

    What a large floor tis like a town
    The carpet when they lay it down
        Wont hide it Ill be bound
    And theres a row of lamps my eye
    How they do blaze I wonder why
        They keep them on the ground

    At first I caught hold of the wing
    And kept away but Mr Thing
        umbob the prompter man
    Gave with his hand my chaise a shove
    And said Go on my pretty love
        Speak to em little Nan

    Youve only got to curtsey whisp
    er hold your chin up laugh and lisp
        And then youre sure to take
    Ive known the day when brats not quite
    Thirteen got fifty pounds a night
        Then why not Nancy Lake

    But while Im speaking wheres papa
    And wheres my aunt and wheres mamma
        Wheres Jack Oh there they sit
    They smile they nod Ill go my ways
    And order round poor Billys chaise
        To join them in the pit

    And now good gentlefolks I go
    To join mamma and see the show
        So bidding you adieu
    I curtsey like a pretty miss
    And if youll blow to me a kiss
        Ill blow a kiss to you
                                       Blows kiss and exit




AN ADDRESS WITHOUT A PHOENIX

BY S T P

    This was lookd for at your hand and this was baulkd
                                                 WHAT YOU WILL


    What stately vision mocks my waking sense
    Hence dear delusion sweet enchantment hence
    Ha is it realcan my doubts be vain
    It is it is and Drury lives again
    Around each grateful veteran attends
    Eager to rush and gratulate his friends
    Friends whose kind looks retraced with proud delight
    Endear the past and make the future bright
    Yes generous patrons your returning smile
    Blesses our toils and consecrates our pile

      When last we met Fates unrelenting hand
    Already graspd the devastating brand
    Slow crept the silent flame ensnared its prize
    Then burst resistless to the astonishd skies
    The glowing walls disrobed of scenic pride
    In trembling conflict stemmd the burning tide
    Till crackling blazing rocking to its fall
    Down rushd the thundering roof and buried all

      Where late the sister Muses sweetly sung
    And rapturd thousands on their music hung
    Where Wit and Wisdom shone by Beauty graced
    Sate lonely Silence empress of the waste
    And still had reigndbut he whose voice can raise
    More magic wonders than Amphions lays
    Bade jarring bands with friendly zeal engage
    To rear the prostrate glories of the stage
    Up leapd the Muses at the potent spell
    And Drurys genius saw his temple swell
    Worthy we hope the British Dramas cause
    Worthy of British arts and your applause

      Guided by you our earnest aims presume
    To renovate the Drama with the dome
    The scenes of Shakespeare and our bards of old
    With due observance splendidly unfold
    Yet raise and foster with parental hand
    The living talent of our native land
    O may we still to sense and nature true
    Delight the many nor offend the few
    Tho varying tastes our changeful drama claim
    Still be its moral tendency the same
    To win by precept by example warn
    To brand the front of vice with pointed scorn
    And Virtues smiling brows with votive wreaths adorn




CUI BONO

BY LORD B


I

    Sated with home of wife of children tired
    The restless soul is driven abroad to roam
    Sated abroad all seen yet nought admired
    The restless soul is driven to ramble home
    Sated with both beneath new Drurys dome
    The fiend Ennui awhile consents to pine
    There growls and curses like a deadly gnome
    Scorning to view fantastic columbine
    Viewing with scorn and hate the nonsense of the Nine


II

    Ye reckless dupes who hither wend your way
    To gaze on puppets in a painted dome
    Pursuing pastimes glittering to betray
    Like falling stars in lifes eternal gloom
    What seek ye here Joys evanescent bloom
    Woes me the brightest wreaths she ever gave
    Are but as flowers that decorate a tomb
    Mans heart the mournful urn oer which they wave
    Is sacred to despair its pedestal the grave


III

    Has life so little store of real woes
    That here ye wend to taste fictitious grief
    Or is it that from truth such anguish flows
    Ye court the lying drama for relief
    Long shall ye find the pang the respite brief
    Or if one tolerable page appears
    In follys volume tis the actors leaf
    Who dries his own by drawing others tears
    And raising present mirth makes glad his future years


IV

    Albeit how like young Betty doth he flee
    Light as the mote that danceth in the beam
    He liveth only in mans present ee
    His life a flash his memory a dream
    Oblivious down he drops in Lethes stream
    Yet what are they the learned and the great
    Awhile of longer wonderment the theme
    Who shall presume to prophesy their date
    Where nought is certain save the uncertainty of fate


V

    This goodly pile upheavd by Wyatts toil
    Perchance than Hollands edifice more fleet
    Again red Lemnos artisan may spoil
    The fire alarm and midnight drum may beat
    And all be strewd ysmoking at your feet
    Start ye Perchance Deaths angel may be sent
    Ere from the flaming temple ye retreat
    And ye who met on revel idlesse bent
    May find in pleasures fane your grave and monument


VI

    Your debts mount highye plunge in deeper waste
    The tradesman callsno warning voice ye hear
    The plaintiff suesto public shows ye haste
    The bailiff threatsye feel no idle fear
    Who can arrest your prodigal career
    Who can keep down the levity of youth
    What sound can startle ages stubborn ear
    Who can redeem from wretchedness and ruth
    Men true to falshoods voice false to the voice of truth


VII

    To thee blest saint who doffd thy skin to make
    The Smithfield rabble leap from theirs with joy
    We dedicate the pilearise awake
    Knock down the Muses wit and sense destroy
    Clear our new stage from reasons dull alloy
    Charm hobbling age and tickle capering youth
    With cleaver marrowbone and Tunbridge toy
    While vibrating in unbelieving tooth
    Harps twang in Drurys walls and make her boards a booth


VIII

    For what is Hamlet but a hare in March
    And what is Brutus but a croaking owl
    And what is Rolla Cupid steepd in starch
    Orlandos helmet in Augustines cowl
    Shakespeare how true thine adage fair is foul
    To him whose soul is with fruition fraught
    The song of Braham is an Irish howl
    Thinking is but an idle waste of thought
    And nought is everything and everything is nought


IX

    Sons of Parnassus whom I view above
    Not laurelcrownd but clad in rusty black
    Not spurring Pegasus through Temps grove
    But pacing Grub Street on a jaded hack
    What reams of foolscap while your brains ye rack
    Ye mar to make again for sure ere long
    Condemnd to tread the bards timesanctioned track
    Ye all shall join the bailiffhaunted throng
    And reproduce in rags the rags ye blot in song


X

    So fares the follower in the Muses train
    He toils to starve and only lives in death
    We slight him till our patronage is vain
    Then round his skeleton a garland wreathe
    And oer his bones an empty requiem breathe
    Oh with what tragic horror would he start
    Could he be conjured from the grave beneath
    To find the stage again a Thespian cart
    And elephants and colts down trampling Shakespeares art


XI

    Hence pedant Nature with thy Grecian rules
    Centaurs not fabulous those rules efface
    Back sister Muses to your native schools
    Here booted grooms usurp Apollos place
    Hoofs shame the boards that Garrick used to grace
    The play of limbs succeeds the play of wit
    Man yields the drama to the Houynim race
    His prompter spurs his licencer the bit
    The stage a stableyard a jockeyclub the pit


XII

    Is it for these ye rear this proud abode
    Is it for these your superstition seeks
    To build a temple worthy of a god
    To laud a monkey or to worship leeks
    Then be the stage to recompense your freaks
    A motley chaos jumbling age and ranks
    Where Punch the lignum vit Roscius squeaks
    And Wisdom weeps and Folly plays his pranks
    And moody Madness laughs and hugs the chain he clanks




To the Secretary of the Managing Committee of Drury Lane Playhouse


SIR

To the gewgaw fetters of rhyme invented by the monks to enslave the
people I have a rooted objection I have therefore written an address
for your theatre in plain homespun yeomans prose in the doing
whereof I hope I am swayed by nothing but an independent wish to open
the eyes of this gulled people to prevent a repetition of the dramatic
bamboozling they have hitherto laboured under If you like what I have
done and mean to make use of it I dont want any such aristocratic
reward as a piece of plate with two griffins sprawling upon it or a dog
and a jackass fighting for a hapworth of gilt gingerbread or any such
Bartholomew Fair nonsense All I ask is that the doorkeepers of your
playhouse may take all the sets of my Register now on hand and force
everybody who enters your door to buy one giving afterwards a debtor and
creditor account of what they have received postpaid and in due course
remitting me the money and unsold Registers carriagepaid

    I am c

IN THE CHARACTER OF A HAMPSHIRE FARMER

                    Rabid qui concitus ir
    Implevit pariter ternis latratibus auras
    Et sparsit virides spumis albentibus agrosOVID


MOST THINKING PEOPLE

When persons address an audience from the stage it is usual either in
words or gesture to say Ladies and Gentlemen your servant If I
were base enough mean enough paltry enough and brute beast enough
to follow that fashion I should tell two lies in a breath In the
first place you are not ladies and gentlemen but I hope something
betterthat is to say honest men and women and in the next place
if you were ever so much ladies and ever so much gentlemen I am not
nor ever will be your humble servant You see me here most thinking
people by mere chance I have not been within the doors of a playhouse
before for these ten years nor till that abominable custom of taking
money at the doors is discontinued will I ever sanction a theatre with
my presence The stagedoor is the only gate of freedom in the whole
edifice and through that I made my way from Bagshaws in Brydges Street
to accost you Look about you Are you not all comfortable Nay never
slink mun speak out if you are dissatisfied and tell me so before
I leave town You are now thanks to Mr Whitbread got into a large
comfortable house Not into a gimcrack palace not into a Solomons
temple not into a frostwork of Brobdingnag filagree but into a plain
honest homely industrious wholesome brown brick playhouse You have
been struggling for independence and elbowroom these three years and
who gave it you Who helped you out of Lilliput Who routed you from a
rathole five inches by four to perch you in a palace Again and again
I answer Mr Whitbread You might have sweltered in that place with the
Greek name till Doomsday and neither Lord Castlereagh Mr Canning
no nor the Marquis Wellesley would have turned a trowel to help you
out Remember that Never forget that Read it to your children and to
your childrens children And now most thinking people cast your eyes
over my head to what the builder I beg his pardon the architect calls
the proscenium No motto no slang no Popish Latin to keep the people
in the dark No Veluti in speculum Nothing in the dead languages
properly so called for they ought to die ay and be damned to boot
The Covent Garden manager tried that and a pretty business he made of
it When a man says Veluti in speculum he is called a man of letters
Very well and is not a man who cries OP a man of letters too You
ran your OP against his Veluti in speculum and pray which beat I
prophesied that though I never told anybody I take it for granted
that every intelligent man woman and child to whom I address myself
has stood severally and respectively in Little Russell Street and cast
their his her and its eyes on the outside of this building before they
paid their money to view the inside Look at the brickwork English
audience Look at the brickwork All plain and smooth like a quakers
meeting None of your Egyptian pyramids to entomb subscribers capitals
No overgrown colonnades of stone like an aldermans gouty legs in white
cotton stockings fit only to use as rammers for paving Tottenham Court
Road This house is neither after the model of a temple in Athens no
nor a temple in Moorfields but it is built to act English plays in and
provided you have good scenery dresses and decorations I dare say you
wouldnt break your hearts if the outside were as plain as the pikestaff
I used to carry when I was a sergeant Apropos as the French valets
say who cut their masters throatsapropos a word about dresses You
must many of you have seen what I have read a description ofKemble
and Mrs Siddons in Macbeth with more gold and silver plastered on
their doublets than would have kept an honest family in butchers meat
and flannel from years end to years end I am informed now mind I
do not vouch for the fact but I am informed that all such extravagant
idleness is to be done away with here Lady Macbeth is to have a plain
quilted petticoat a cotton gown and a mob cap as the court parasites
call it it will be well for them if one of these days they dont
wear a mob capI mean a white cap with a mob to look at them and
Macbeth is to appear in an honest yeomans drab coat and a pair of black
calamanco breeches Not Salamanca no nor Talavera neither my most
noble Marquis but plain honest black calamanco stuff breeches This
is right this is as it should be Most thinking people I have heard
you much abused There is not a compound in the language but is strung
fifty in a rope like onions by the Morning Post and hurled in your
teeth You are called the mob and when they have made you out to be the
mob you are called the scum of the people and the dregs of the people
I should like to know how you can be both Take a basin of brothnot
cheap soup Mr Wilberforce not soup for the poor at a penny a quart as
your mixture of horses legs brickdust and old shoes was denominated
but plain wholesome patriotic beef or mutton broth take this examine
it and you will findmind I dont vouch for the fact but I am told
you will find the dregs at the bottom and the scum at the top I will
endeavour to explain this to you England is a large earthenware pipkin
John Bull is the beef thrown into it Taxes are the hot water he boils
in Rotten boroughs are the fuel that blazes under this same pipkin
Parliament is the ladle that stirs the hodgepodge and sometimesbut
hold I dont wish to pay Mr Newman a second visit I leave you better
off than you have been this many a day You have a good house over your
head you have beat the French in Spain the harvest has turned out
well the comet keeps its distance and red slippers are hawked about in
Constantinople for next to nothing and for all this again and again I
tell you you are indebted to Mr Whitbread




THE LIVING LUSTRES

BY T M

    Jam te juvaverit
    Viros relinquere
    Doctque conjugis
    Sinu quiescereSIR T MORE


I

    O why should our dull retrospective Addresses
      Fall damp as wet blankets on Drury Lane fire
    Away with blue devils away with distresses
      And give the gay spirit to sparkling desire


II

    Let artists decide on the beauties of Drury
      The richest to me is when woman is there
    The question of houses I leave to the jury
      The fairest to me is the house of the fair


III

    When womans soft smile all our senses bewilders
      And gilds while it carves her dear form on the heart
    What need has New Drury of carvers and gilders
      With Nature so bounteous why call upon Art


IV

    How well would our actors attend to their duties
      Our house save in oil and our authors in wit
    In lieu of yon lamps if a row of young beauties
      Glanced light from their eyes between us and the pit


V

    The apples that grew on the fruittree of knowledge
      By woman were pluckd and she still wears the prize
    To tempt us in Theatre Senate or College
      I mean the loveapples that bloom in the eyes


VI

    There too is the lash which all statutes controlling
      Still governs the slaves that are made by the fair
    For man is the pupil who while her eyes rolling
      Is lifted to rapture or sunk in despair


VII

    Bloom Theatre bloom in the roseate blushes
      Of beauty illumed by a lovebreathing smile
    And flourish ye pillars as green as the rushes
      That pillow the nymphs of the Emerald Isle


VIII

    For dear is the Emerald Isle of the Ocean
      Whose daughters are fair as the foam of the wave
    Whose sons unaccustomed to rebel commotion
      Tho joyous are sober tho peaceful are brave


IX

    The shamrock their olive sworn foe to a quarrel
      Protects from the thunder and lightning of rows
    Their sprig of shillelagh is nothing but laurel
      Which flourishes rapidly over their brows


X

    Oh soon shall they burst the tyrannical shackles
      Which each panting bosom indignantly names
    Until not one goose at the capital cackles
      Against the grand question of Catholic claims


XI

    And then shall each Paddy who once on the Liffy
      Perchance held the helm of some mackrel hoy
    Hold the helm of the state and dispense in a jiffy
      More fishes than ever he caught when a boy


XII

    And those who now quit their hods shovels and barrows
      In crowds to the bar of some alehouse to flock
    When bred to our bar shall be Gibbss and Garrows
      Assume the silk gown and discard the smockfrock


XIII

    For Erin surpasses the daughters of Neptune
      As Dian outshines each encircling star
    And the spheres of the Heavens could never have kept tune
      Till set to the music of Eringobra

        From Tower Hill to Piccadilly snored
           Midnight yet not a nose
        From Indra drew the essence of repose
           See with what crimson fury
    By Indra fannd the god of fire ascends the walls of Drury
        The tops of houses blue with lead
        Bend beneath the landlords tread

     Master and prentice serving man and lord
                Nailer and tailor

          Thro streets and alleys pourd
            All all abroad to gaze
            And wonder at the blaze
          Thick calf fat foot and slim knee

    Pent in by smokedried beams twelve moons or more
                    Shorn of his ray

                But thought it would not pay
                    To dig him out
            When lo terrific Yamen lord of hell
                    Solemn as lead
                   Judge of the dead
                  Sworn foe to witticism
                 By men called criticism
                Came passing by that way
    Rise cried the fiend behold a sight of gladness
                 Behold the rival theatre
                  Ive set OP at her
                Who like a bulldog bold

            Thy rival staggers come and spy her
          Deep in the mud as thou art in the mire

      So saying in his arms he caught the beaming one
                 And crossing Russell Street
                 He placed him on his feet
        Neath Covent Garden dome Sudden a sound
             As of the bricklayers of Babel rose
    Horns rattles drums tin trumpets sheets of copper
      Punches and slaps thwacks of all sorts and sizes
        From the knobbd bludgeon to the taper switch
          Ran echoing round the walls paper placards
    Blotted the lamps boots brown with mud the benches
            A sea of heads rolld roaring in the pit
                    On paper wings OPs
                  Reclind in lettered ease
                    While shout and scoff

            Like thunderbolt on Suryas eardrum fell
                    And seemd to paint

           He treats with men of all conditions
        Poets and players tradesmen and musicians

                      Old and new
                      A list he gets
                   Of claims and debts
      And deems nought done while aught remains to do
         Yamen beheld and witherd at the sight
        Long had he aimd the sunbeam to control

       Veeshnoo has stilld the jarring elements
                The spheres hymn music
                 Again the god of day
            Peeps forth with trembling ray
         And pours at intervals a strain divine
      I have an iron yet in the fire cried Yamen
         The vollied flame rides in my breath
             My blast is elemental death
    This hand shall tear their paper bonds to pieces
      Ingross your deeds assignments leases
         My breath shall every line erase
            Soon as I blow the blaze

    The lawyers are met at the Crown and Anchor
    And Yamens visage grows blanker and blanker
    The lawyers are met at the Anchor and Crown
        And Yamens cheek is a russety brown
          Veshnoo now thy work proceeds
                The solicitor reads
               And merit of merit
             Red wax and green ferret
         Are fixd at the foot of the deeds

           Yamen beheld and shiverd
        His finger and thumb were crampd
         His ear by the flea int was bitten
     When he saw by the lawyers clerk written
              Sealed and delivered
              Being first duly stamped

    Now for my turn the demon cries and blows
     A blast of sulphur from his mouth and nose
         Ah bootless aim the critic fiend
           Sagacious Yamen judge of hell
                Is judged in his turn
               Parchment wont burn
    His schemes of vengeance are dissolvd in air
               Parchment wont tear

        Is it not written in the Himakoot book
         That mighty Baly from Kehama took
               Who blows on pounce
             Must the Swerga renounce
        It is it is Yamen thine hour is nigh
            Like as an eagle claws an asp
       Veeshnoo has caught him in his mighty grasp
    And hurld him in spite of his shrieks and his squalls
        Whizzing aloft like the Temple fountain
        Three times as high as Meru mountain
                     Which is
          Ninetynine times as high as St Pauls
         Descending he twisted like Levy the Jew
              Who a durable grave meant
               To dig in the pavement
                 Of Monument Yard
         To earth by the laws of attraction he flew
                 And he fell and he fell
                 To the regions of hell
       Nine centuries bounced he from cavern to rock
       And his head as he tumbled went nicketynock
              Like a pebble in Carisbrooke well

       Now Veeshnoo turnd round to a capering varlet
          Arrayd in blue and white and scarlet
        And cried Oh brown of slipper as of hat
                Lend me harlequin thy bat
      He seizd the wooden sword and smote the earth
              When lo upstarting into birth
              A fabric gorgeous to behold
              Outshone in elegance the old
    And Veeshnoo saw and cried Hail playhouse mine
         Then bending his head to Surya he said
               Go mount yon edifice
               And show thy steady face
                 In renovated pride
          More bright more glorious than before
           But ah coy Surya still felt a twinge
           Still smarted from his former singe
               And to Veeshnoo replied
                In a tone rather gruff
          No thank you one tumbles enough




DRURYS DIRGE

BY LAURA MATILDA

    You praise our sires but though they wrote with force
    Their rhymes were vicious and their diction coarse
    We want their strength agreed but we atone
    For that and more by sweetness all our ownGIFFORD


I

    Balmy Zephyrs lightly flitting
      Shade me with your azure wing
    On Parnassus summit sitting
      Aid me Clio while I sing


II

    Softly slept the dome of Drury
      Oer the empyreal crest
    When Alectos sisterfury
      Softly slumbring sunk to rest


III

    Lo from Lemnos limping lamely
      Lags the lowly Lord of Fire
    Cytherea yielding tamely
      To the Cyclops dark and dire


IV

    Clouds of amber dreams of gladness
      Dulcet joys and sports of youth
    Soon must yield to haughty sadness
      Mercy holds the veil to Truth


V

    See Erostratus the second
      Fires again Dianas fane
    By the Fates from Orcus beckond
      Clouds envelop Drury Lane


VI

    Lurid smoke and frank suspicion
      Hand in hand reluctant dance
    While the god fulfils his mission
      Chivalry resign thy lance


VII

    Hark the engines blandly thunder
      Fleecy clouds dishevelld lie
    And the firemen mute with wonder
      On the son of Saturn cry


VIII

    See the bird of Ammon sailing
      Perches on the engines peak
    And the Eagle firemen hailing
      Soothes them with its bickering beak


IX

    Juno saw and mad with malice
      Lost the prize that Paris gave
    Jealousys ensanguind chalice
      Mantling pours the orient wave


X

    Pan beheld Patroclus dying
      Nox to Niobe was turnd
    From Busiris Bacchus flying
      Saw his Semele inurnd


XI

    Thus fell Drurys lofty glory
      Levelld with the shuddering stones
    Mars with tresses black and gory
      Drinks the dew of pearly groans


XII

    Hark what soft Eolian numbers
      Gem the blushes of the morn
    Break Amphion break your slumbers
      Natures ringlets deck the thorn


XIII

    Ha I hear the strain erratic
      Dimly glance from pole to pole
    Raptures sweet and dreams ecstatic
      Fire my everlasting soul


XIV

    Where is Cupids crimson motion
      Billowy ecstasy of woe
    Bear me straight meandering ocean
      Where the stagnant torrents flow


XV

    Blood in every vein is gushing
      Vixen vengeance lulls my heart
    See the Gorgon gang is rushing
      Never never let us part




A TALE OF DRURY LANE

BY W S

     Thus he went on stringing one extravagance upon another in the
     style his books of chivalry had taught him and imitating as near
     as he could their very phraseDON QUIXOTE


To be spoken by MR KEMBLE in a Suit of the Black Princes Armour
borrowed from the Tower

    Survey this shield all bossy bright
    These cuisses twain behold
    Look on my form in armour dight
    Of steel inlaid with gold
    My knees are stiff in iron buckles
    Stiff spikes of steel protect my knuckles
    These once belongd to sable prince
    Who never did in battle wince
    With valour tart as pungent quince
      He slew the vaunting Gaul
    Rest there awhile my bearded lance
    While from green curtain I advance
    To yon footlights no trivial dance
    And tell the town what sad mischance
      Did Drury Lane befall


The Night

    On fair Augustas towers and trees
    Flitted the silent midnight breeze
    Curling the foliage as it past
    Which from the moontippd plumage cast
    A spangled light like dancing spray
    Then reassumed its still array
    Whenas nights lamp unclouded hung
    And down its full effulgence flung
    It shed such soft and balmy power
    That cot and castle hall and bower
    And spire and dome and turret height
    Appeard to slumber in the light
    From Henrys chapel Rufus hall
    To Savoy Temple and St Paul
    From Knightsbridge Pancras Camden Town
    To Redriff Shadwell Horsleydown
    No voice was heard no eye unclosed
    But all in deepest sleep reposed
    They might have thought who gazed around
    Amid a silence so profound
        It made the senses thrill
    That twas no place inhabited
    But some vast city of the dead
        was so hushd and still


The Burning

    As Chaos which by heavenly doom
    Had slept in everlasting gloom
    Started with terror and surprise
    When light first flashd upon her eyes
    So Londons sons in nightcap woke
        In bedgown woke her dames
    For shouts were heard mid fire and smoke
    And twice ten hundred voices spoke
        The Playhouse is in flames
    And lo where Catherine Street extends
    A fiery tale its lustre lends
        To every windowpane
    Blushes each spout in Martlet Court
    And Barbican motheaten fort
    And Govent Garden kennels sport
        A bright ensanguind drain
    Meuxs new brewhouse shows the light
    Rowland Hills chapel and the height
        Where patent shot they sell
    The Tennis Court so fair and tall
    Partakes the ray with Surgeons Hall
    The ticket porters house of call
    Old Bedlam close by London Wall
    Wrights shrimp and oyster shop withal
        And Richardsons Hotel

    Nor these alone but far and wide
    Across the Thamess gleaming tide
    To distant fields the blaze was borne
    And daisy white and hoary thorn
    In borrowd lustre seemd to sham
    The rose or red sweet William
      To those who on the hills around
      Beheld the flames from Drurys mound
    As from a lofty altar rise
      It seemd that nations did conspire
      To offer to the god of fire
    Some vast stupendous sacrifice
    The summond firemen woke at call
    And hied them to their stations all
    Starting from short and broken snooze
    Each sought his pondrous hobnaild shoes
    But first his worsted hosen plied
    Plush breeches next in crimson dyed
        His nether bulk embraced
    Then jacket thick of red or blue
    Whose massy shoulder gave to view
    The badge of each respective crew
        In tin or copper traced
    The engines thunderd thro the street
    Firehook pipe bucket all complete
    And torches glared and clattering feet
        Along the pavement paced

    And one the leader of the band
    From Charing Cross along the Strand
    Like stag by beagles hunted hard
    Ran till he stoppd at Vingar Yard
    The burning badge his shoulder bore
    The belt and oilskin hat he wore
    The cane he had his men to bang
    Showd foreman of the British gang
    His name was Higginbottom now
    Tis meet that I should tell you how
         The others came in view
    The HandinHand the race begun
    Then came the Phoenix and the Sun
    Th Exchange where old insurers run
      The Eagle where the new
    With these came Rumford Bumford Cole
    Robins from HockleyintheHole
    Lawson and Dawson cheek by jowl
        Crump from St Giless Pound
    Whitford and Mitford joind the train
    Huggins and Muggins from Chick Lane
    And Clutterbuck who got a sprain
         Before the plug was found
    Hobson and Jobson did not sleep
    But ah no trophy could they reap
    For both were in the Donjon Keep
        Of Bridewells gloomy mound

    Een Higginbottom now was posed
    For sadder scene was neer disclosed
    Without within in hideous show
    Devouring flames resistless glow
    And blazing rafters downward go
    And never halloo heads below
        Nor notice give at all
    The firemen terrified are slow
    To bid the pumping torrent flow
        For fear the roof should fall
    Back Robins back Crump stand aloof
    Whitford keep near the walls
    Huggins regard your own behoof
    For lo the blazing rocking roof
    Down down in thunder falls

    An awful pause succeeds the stroke
    And oer the ruins volumed smoke
    Rolling around its pitchy shroud
    Conceald them from th astonishd crowd
    At length the mist awhile was cleard
    When lo amid the wreck upreard
    Gradual a moving head appeard
        And Eagle firemen knew
    Twas Joseph Muggins name revered
        The foreman of their crew
    Loud shouted all in signs of woe
    A Muggins to the rescue ho
        And pourd the hissing tide
    Meanwhile the Muggins fought amain
    And strove and struggled all in vain
    For rallying but to fall again
        He totterd sunk and died

    Did none attempt before he fell
    To succour one they loved so well
    Yes Higginbottom did aspire
    His firemans soul was all on fire
        His brother chief to save
    But ah his reckless generous ire
        Served but to share his grave
    Mid blazing beams and scalding streams
    Thro fire and smoke he dauntless broke
        Where Muggins broke before
    But sulphury stench and boiling drench
    Destroying sight oerwhelmd him quite
        He sunk to rise no more
    Still oer his head while fate he braved
    His whizzing waterpipe he waved
    Whitford and Mitford ply your pumps
    You Clutterbuck come stir your stumps
    Why are you in such doleful dumps
    A fireman and afraid of bumps
    What are they feard on fools od rot em
    Were the last words of Higginbottom


The Revival

    Peace to his soul new prospects bloom
    And toil rebuilds what fires consume
    Eat we and drink we be our ditty
    Joy to the managing committee
    Eat we and drink we join to rum
    Roast beef and pudding of the plum
    Forth from thy nook John Horner come
    With bread of ginger brown thy thumb
      For this is Drurys gay day
    Roll roll thy hoop and twirl thy tops
    And buy to glad thy smiling chops
    Crisp parliament with lollipops
      And fingers of the lady

    Didst mark how toild the busy train
    From morn to eve till Drury Lane
    Leapd like a roebuck from the plain
    Ropes rose and sunk and rose again
      And nimble workmen trod
    To realize bold Wyatts plan
    Rushd many a howling Irishman
    Loud clatterd many a porter can
    And many a ragamuffin clan
      With trowel and with hod

    Drury revives her rounded pate
    Is blue is heavenly blue with slate
    She wings the midway air elate
      As magpie crow or chough
    White paint her modish visage smears
    Yellow and pointed are her ears
    No pendant portico appears
    Dangling beneath for Whitbreads shears
      Have cut the bauble off

    Yes she exalts her stately head
    And but that solid bulk outspread
    Opposed you on your onward tread
    And posts and pillars warranted
    That all was true that Wyatt said
    You might have deemd her walls so thick
    Were not composed of stone or brick
    But all a phantom all a trick
    Of brain disturbd and fancysick
    So high she soars so vast so quick




JOHNSONS GHOST

Ghost of DR JOHNSON rises from trapdoor PS and Ghost of BOSWELL
from trapdoor OP The latter bows respectfully to the House and
obsequiously to the Doctors Ghost and retires


Doctors Ghost loquitur

That which was organized by the moral ability of one has been executed
by the physical efforts of many and Drury Lane Theatre is now complete
Of that part behind the curtain which has not yet been destined to
glow beneath the brush of the varnisher or vibrate to the hammer of
the carpenter little is thought by the public and little need be
said by the committee Truth however is not to be sacrificed for the
accommodation of either and he who should pronounce that our edifice
has received its final embellishment would be disseminating falsehood
without incurring favour and risking the disgrace of detection without
participating the advantage of success

Professions lavishly effused and parsimoniously verified are alike
inconsistent with the precepts of innate rectitude and the practice
of external policy let it not then be conjectured that because we
are unassuming we are imbecile that forbearance is any indication of
despondency or humility of demerit He that is the most assured of
success will make the fewest appeals to favour and where nothing is
claimed that is undue nothing that is due will be withheld A swelling
opening is too often succeeded by an insignificant conclusion Parturient
mountains have ere now produced muscipular abortions and the auditor
who compares incipient grandeur with final vulgarity is reminded of the
pious hawkers of Constantinople who solemnly perambulate her streets
exclaiming In the name of the Prophetfigs

Of many who think themselves wise and of some who are thought wise
by others the exertions are directed to the revival of mouldering
and obscure dramas to endeavours to exalt that which is now rare
only because it was always worthless and whose deterioration while
it condemned it to living obscurity by a strange obliquity of moral
perception constitutes its title to posthumous renown To embody the
flying colours of folly to arrest evanescence to give to bubbles the
globular consistency as well as form to exhibit on the stage the piebald
denizen of the stable and the halfreasoning parent of combs to display
the brisk locomotion of Columbine or the tortuous attitudinizing of
Punch these are the occupations of others whose ambition limited
to the applause of unintellectual fatuity is too innocuous for the
application of satire and too humble for the incitement of jealousy

Our refectory will be found to contain every species of fruit from
the cooling nectarine and luscious peach to the puny pippin and the
noxious nut There indolence may repose and inebriety revel and the
spruce apprentice rushing in at second account may there chatter with
impunity debarred by a barrier of brick and mortar from marring that
scenic interest in others which nature and education have disqualified
him from comprehending himself

Permanent stagedoors we have none That which is permanent cannot be
removed for if removed it soon ceases to be permanent What stationary
absurdity can vie with that ligneous barricado which decorated with
frappant and tintinabulant appendages now serves as the entrance of
the lowly cottage and now as the exit of a ladys bedchamber at one
time insinuating plastic Harlequin into a butchers shop and at another
yawning as the floodgate to precipitate the Cyprians of St Giless into
the embraces of Macheath To elude this glaring absurdity to give to
each respective mansion the door which the carpenter would doubtless have
given we vary our portal with the varying scene passing from deal to
mahogany and from mahogany to oak as the opposite claims of cottage
palace or castle may appear to require

Amid the general hum of gratulation which flatters us in front it is
fit that some regard should be paid to the murmurs of despondence that
assail us in the rear They as I have elsewhere expressed it who live
to please should not have their own pleasures entirely overlooked
The children of Thespis are general in their censures of the architect
in having placed the locality of exit at such a distance from the oily
irradiators which now dazzle the eyes of him who addresses you I am
cries the Queen of Terrors robbed of my fair proportions When the
kingkilling Thane hints to the breathless auditory the murders he means
to perpetrate in the castle of Macduff ere his purpose cool so vast
is the interval he has to travel before he can escape from the stage
that his purpose has even time to freeze Your condition cries the Muse
of Smiles is hard but it is cygnets down in comparison with mine The
peerless peer of capers and congees has laid it down as a rule that the
best good thing uttered by the morning visitor should conduct him rapidly
to the doorway last impressions vieing in durability with first But
when on this boarded elongation it falls to my lot to say a good thing
to ejaculate keep moving or to chaunt hic hoc horum genetivo many
are the moments that must elapse ere I can hide myself from public vision
in the recesses of OP or PS

To objections like these captiously urged and querulously maintained
it is time that equity should conclusively reply Deviation from
scenic propriety has only to vituperate itself for the consequences
it generates Let the actor consider the line of exit as that line
beyond which he should not soar in quest of spurious applause let him
reflect that in proportion as he advances to the lamps he recedes from
nature that the truncheon of Hotspur acquires no additional charm from
encountering the cheek of beauty in the stagebox and that the bravura
of Mandane may produce effect although the throat of her who warbles
it should not overhang the orchestra The Jove of the modern critical
Olympus Lord Mayor of the theatric sky has ex cathedr asserted
that a natural actor looks upon the audience part of the theatre as the
third side of the chamber he inhabits Surely of the third wall thus
fancifully erected our actors should by ridicule or reason be withheld
from knocking their heads against the stucco

Time forcibly reminds me that all things which have a limit must be
brought to a conclusion Let me ere that conclusion arrives recall
to your recollection that the pillars which rise on either side of
me blooming in varied antiquity like two massy evergreens had yet
slumbered in their native quarry but for the ardent exertions of the
individual who called them into life to his neverslumbering talents you
are indebted for whatever pleasure this haunt of the Muses is calculated
to afford If in defiance of chaotic malevolence the destroyer of the
temple of Diana yet survives in the name of Erostratus surely we may
confidently predict that the rebuilder of the temple of Apollo will
stand recorded to distant posterity in that ofSAMUEL WHITBREAD

PHILANDER


I

    Sobriety cease to be sober
      Cease Labour to dig and to delve
    And hail to this tenth of October
      One thousand eight hundred and twelve
    Hah whom do my peepers remark
      Tis Hebe with Jupiters jug
    Oh no tis the pride of the Park
      Fair Lady Elizabeth Mugg


II

    Why beautiful nymph do you close
      The curtain that fringes your eye
    Why veil in the clouds of repose
      The sun that should brighten our sky
    Perhaps jealous Venus has oild
      Thy hair with some opiate drug
    Not choosing her charms should be foild
      By Lady Elizabeth Mugg


III

    But ah why awaken the blaze
      The bright burningglasses contain
    Whose lens with concentrated rays
      Proved fatal to old Drury Lane
    Twas all accidental they cry
      Away with the flimsy humbug
    Twas tired by a flash from the eye
      Of Lady Elizabeth Mugg


IV

    Thy glance can in us raise a flame
      Then why should old Drury be free
    Our doom and its doom are the same
      Both subject to beautys decree
    No candles the workmen consumd
      When deep in the ruins they dug
    Thy flash still their progress illumd
      Sweet Lady Elizabeth Mugg


V

    Thy face a rich fireplace displays
      The mantelpiece marblethy brows
    Thine eyes are the bright beaming blaze
      Thy bib which no trespass allows
    The fenders tall barrier marks
      Thy tippets the firequelling rug
    Which serves to extinguish the sparks
      Of Lady Elizabeth Mugg


VI

    The Countess a lily appears
      Whose tresses the dewdrops emboss
    The Marchioness blooming in years
      A rosebud envelopd in moss
    But thou art the sweet passionflower
      For who would not slavery hug
    To pass but one exquisite hour
      In the arms of Elizabeth Mugg


VII

    When at Court or some dowagers rout
      Her diamond aigrette meets our view
    She looks like a glowworm dressd out
      Or tulips bespangled with dew
    Her two lips denied to mans suit
      Are shared with her favourite Pug
    What lord would not change with the brute
      To live with Elizabeth Mugg


VIII

    Could the stage be a large visvis
      Reservd for the polishd and great
    Where each happy lover might see
      The nymph he adores ttette
    No longer Id gaze on the ground
      And the load of despondency lug
    For Id book myself all the year round
      To ride with the sweet Lady Mugg


IX

    Yes she in herself is a host
      And if she were here all alone
    Our house might nocturnally boast
      A bumper of fashion and ton
    Again should it burst in a blaze
      In vain would they ply Congreves plug
    For nought could extinguish the rays
      From the glance of divine Lady Mugg


X

    O could I as Harlequin frisk
      And thou be my Columbine fair
    My wand should with one magic whisk
      Transport us to Hanover Square
    St George should lend us his shrine
      The parson his shoulders might shrug
    But a licence should force him to join
      My hand in the hand of my Mugg


XI

    Courtplaister the weapons should tip
      By Cupid shot down from above
    Which cut into spots for thy lip
      Should still barb the arrows of love
    The god who from others flies quick
      With us should be slow as a slug
    As close as a leech he should stick
      To me and Elizabeth Mugg


XII

    For Time would like us stead of sand
      Put filings of steel in his glass
    To dry up the blots of his hand
      And spangle lifes page as they pass
    Since all flesh is grass ere tis hay
      O may I in clover live snug
    And when old Time mows me away
      Be stackd with defunct Lady Mugg




FIRE AND ALE

BY M G L

Omnia transformat sese in miracula rerumVIRGIL


    My palate is parchd with Pierian thirst
        Away to Parnassus Im beckond
    List warriors and dames while my lay is rehearsd
    I sing of the singe of Miss Drury the first
        And the birth of Miss Drury the second

    The Fire King one day rather amorous felt
        He mounted his hot copper filly
    His breeches and boots were of tin and the belt
    Was made of cast iron for fear it should melt
        With the heat of the copper colts belly

    Sure never was skin half so scalding as his
        When an infant twas equally horrid
    For the water when he was baptized gave a fizz
    And bubbled and simmerd and started off whizz
        As soon as it sprinkled his forehead

    Oh then there was glitter and fire in each eye
        For two living coals were the symbols
    His teeth were calcined and his tongue was so dry
    It rattled against them as though you should try
        To play the piano in thimbles

    From his nostrils a lava sulphureous flows
        Which scorches wherever it lingers
    A snivelling fellow hes calld by his foes
    For he cant raise his paw up to blow his red nose
        For fear it should blister his fingers

    His wig is of flames curling over his head
        Well powderd with white smoking ashes
    He drinks gunpowder tea melted sugar of lead
    Cream of tartar and dines on hot spice gingerbread
        Which black from the oven he gnashes

    Each fire nymph his kiss from her countenance shields
        Twould soon set her cheekbone afrying
    He spit in the tenterground near Spitalfields
    And the hole that it burnt and the chalk that it yields
        Make a capital limekiln for drying

    When he opend his mouth out there issued a blast
        Nota bene I do not mean swearing
    But the noise that it made and the heat that it cast
    Ive heard it from those who have seen it surpassd
        A shot manufactory flaring

    He blazd and he blazd as he gallopd to snatch
        His bride little dreaming of danger
    His whip was a torch and his spur was a match
    And over the horses left eye was a patch
        To keep it from burning the manger

    And who is the housemaid he means to enthral
        In his cinderproducing alliance
    Tis Drury Lane Playhouse so wide and so tall
    Who like other combustible ladies must fall
        If she cannot set sparks at defiance

    On his warmingpan kneepan he clattering rolld
        And the housemaid his hand would have taken
    But his hand like his passion was too hot to hold
    And she soon let it go but her new ring of gold
        All melted like butter or bacon

    Oh then she lookd sour and indeed well she might
        For Vinegar Yard was before her
    But spite of her shrieks the ignipotent knight
    Enrobing the maid in a flame of gaslight
        To the skies in a skyrocket bore her

    Look look tis the Ale King so stately and starch
        Whose votaries scorn to be sober
    He pops from his vat like a cedar or larch
    Brown stout is his doublet he hops in his march
        And froths at the mouth in October

    His spear is a spigot his shield is a bung
        He taps where the housemaid no more is
    When lo at his magical bidding upsprung
    A second Miss Drury tall tidy and young
        And sported in loco sororis

    Back lurid in air for a second regale
        The Cinder King hot with desire
    To Brydges Street hied but the Monarch of Ale
    With uplifted spigot and faucet and pail
        Thus chided the Monarch of Fire

    Vile tyrant beware of the ferment I brew
        I rule the roast here dash the wig o me
    If spite of your marriage with Old Drury you
    Come here with your tinderbox courting the New
        Ill have you indicted for bigamy

    My pensive public wherefore look you sad
    I had a grandmother she kept a donkey
    To carry to the mart her crockery ware
    And when that donkey lookd me in the face
    His face was sad and you are sad my public

      Joy should be yours this tenth day of October
    Again assembles us in Drury Lane
    Long wept my eye to see the timber planks
    That hid our ruins many a day I cried
    Ah me I fear they never will rebuild it
    Till on one eve one joyful Monday eve
    As along Charles Street I prepared to walk
    Just at the corner by the pastrycooks
    I heard a trowel tick against a brick
    I lookd me up and straight a parapet
    Uprose at least seven inches oer the planks
    Joy to thee Drury to myself I said
    He of Blackfriars Road who hymnd thy downfall
    In loud hosannahs and who prophesied
    That flames like those from prostrate Solyma
    Would scorch the hand that ventured to rebuild thee
    Has proved a lying prophet From that hour
    As leisure offerd close to Mr Springs
    Boxoffice door Ive stood and eyed the builders
    They had a plan to render less their labours
    Workmen in elder times would mount a ladder
    With hodded heads but these stretchd forth a pole
    From the walls pinnacle they placed a pulley
    Athwart the pole a rope athwart the pulley
    To this a basket dangled mortar and bricks
    Thus freighted swung securely to the top
    And in the empty basket workmen twain
    Precipitate unhurt accosted earth

      Oh twas a goodly sound to hear the people
    Who watchd the work express their various thoughts
    While some believd it never would be finishd
    Some on the contrary believd it would

      Ive heard our front that faces Drury Lane
    Much criticisd they say tis vulgar brickwork
    A mimic manufactory of floorcloth
    One of the morning papers wishd that front
    Cemented like the front in Brydges Street
    As it now looks they call it Wyatts Mermaid
    A handsome woman with a fishs tail

      White is the steeple of St Brides in Fleet Street
    The Albion as its name denotes is white
    Morgan and Saunders shop for chairs and tables
    Gleams like a snowball in the setting sun
    White is Whitehall But not St Brides in Fleet Street
    The spotless Albion Morgan no nor Saunders
    Nor white Whitehall is white as Drurys face

      Oh Mr Whitbread fie upon you sir
    I think you should have built a colonnade
    When tender Beauty looking for her coach
    Protrudes her gloveless hand perceives the shower
    And draws the tippet closer round her throat
    Perchance her coach stands half a dozen off
    And ere she mounts the step the oozing mud
    Soaks thro her pale kid slipper On the morrow
    She coughs at breakfast and her gruff papa
    Cries There you go this comes of playhouses
    To build no portico is penny wise
    Heaven grant it prove not in the end pound foolish

      Hail to thee Drury Queen of Theatres
    What is the Regency in Tottenham Street
    The Royal Amphitheatre of Arts
    Astleys Olympic or the Sans Pareil
    Compard with thee Yet when I view thee pushd
    Back from the narrow street that christend thee
    I know not why they call thee Drury Lane

      Amid the freaks that modern fashion sanctions
    It grieves me much to see live animals
    Brought on the stage Grimaldi has his rabbit
    Laurent his cat and Bradbury his pig
    Fie on such tricks Johnson the machinist
    Of former Drury imitated life
    Quite to the life The elephant in Blue Beard
    Stuffd by his hand wound round his lithe proboscis
    As spruce as he who roard in Padmanaba
    Nought born on earth should die On hackney stands
    I reverence the coachman who cries Gee
    And spares the lash When I behold a spider
    Prey on a fly a magpie on a worm
    Or view a butcher with hornhandle knife
    Slaughter a tender lamb as dead as mutton
    Indeed indeed Im very very sick       Exit hastily

ARCHITECTURAL ATOMS

TRANSLATED BY DR B

Lege Dick LegeJOSEPH ANDREWS


To be recited by the Translators Son

    Away fond dupes who smit with sacred lore
    Mosaic dreams in Genesis explore
    Dote with Copernicus or darkling stray
    With Newton Ptolemy or Tycho Brahe
    To you I sing not for I sing of truth
    Primval systems and creations youth
    Such as of old with magic wisdom fraught
    Inspired Lucretius to the Latians taught

      I sing how casual bricks in airy climb
    Encounterd casual horsehair casual lime
    How rafters borne through wondering clouds elate
    Kissd in their slope blue elemental slate
    Claspd solid beams in chancedirected fury
    And gave to birth our renovated Drury
      Thee son of Jove whose sceptre was confessed
    Where fair OEolia springs from Tethys breast
    Thence on Olympus mid Celestials placed
    God of the winds and Ethers boundless waste
    Thee I invoke Oh puff my bold design
    Prompt the bright thought and swell the harmonious line
    Uphold my pinions and my verse inspire
    With Winsors patent gas or wind of fire
    In whose pure blaze thy embryo form enrolld
    The dark enlightens and enchafes the cold

      But while I court thy gifts be mine to shun
    The deprecated prize Ulysses won
    Who sailing homeward from thy breezy shore
    The prisond winds in skins of parchment bore
    Speeds the fleet bark till oer the billowy green
    The azure heights of Ithaca are seen
    But while with favouring gales her way she wins
    His curious comrades ope the mystic skins
    When lo the rescued winds with boisterous sweep
    Roar to the clouds and lash the rocking deep
    Heaves the smote vessel in the howling blast
    Splits the stretchd sail and cracks the tottering mast
    Launchd on a plank the buoyant hero rides
    Where ebon Afric stems the sable tides
    While his duckd comrades oer the ocean fly
    And sleep not in the whole skins they untie

      So when to raise the wind some lawyer tries
    Mysterious skins of parchment meet our eyes
    On speed the smiling suit Pleas of our Lord
    The King shine jetty on the wide record
    Nods the prunellad bar attornies smile
    And siren jurors flatter to beguile
    Till striptnonsuitedhe is doomd to toss
    In legal shipwreck and redeemless loss
    Lucky if like Ulysses he can keep
    His head above the waters of the deep

      olian monarch Emperor of Puffs
    We modern sailors dread not thy rebuffs
    See to thy golden shore promiscuous come
    Quacks for the lame the blind the deaf the dumb
    Fools are their bankersa prolific line
    And every mortal maladys a mine
    Each sly Sangrado with his poisonous pill
    Flies to the printers devil with his bill
    Whose Midas touch can gild his asses ears
    And load a knave with follys rich arrears
    And lo a second miracle is thine
    For sloejuiced water stands transformd to wine
    Where Day and Martins patent blacking rolld
    Burst from the vase Pactolian streams of gold
    Laugh the sly wizards glorying in their stealth
    Quit the black art and loll in lazy wealth
    See Britains Algerines the Lottery fry
    Win annual tribute by the annual lie
    Aided by theebut whither do I stray
    Court city borough own thy sovereign sway
    An age of puffs the age of gold succeeds
    And windy bubbles are the spawn it breeds

      If such thy power O hear the Muses prayer
    Swell thy loud lungs and wave thy wings of air
    Spread viewless giant all thy arms of mist
    Like windmill sails to bring the poet grist
    As erst thy roaring son with eddying gale
    Whirld Orithyia from her native vale
    So while Lucretian wonders I rehearse
    Augustas sons shall patronize my verse

      I sing of Atoms whose creative brain
    With eddying impulse built new Drury Lane
    Not to the labours of subservient man
    To no young Wyatt appertains the plan
    We mortals stalk like horses in a mill
    Impassive media of Atomic will
    Ye stare then truths broad talisman discern
    Tis Demonstration speaksAttend and learn

      From floating elements in chaos hurld
    Selfformd of atoms sprang the infant world
    No great First Cause inspired the happy plot
    But all was matter and no matter what
    Atoms attracted by some law occult
    Settling in spheres the globe was the result
    Pure child of Chance which still directs the ball
    As rotatory atoms rise or fall
    In ether launchd the peopled bubble floats
    A mass of particles and confluent motes
    So nicely poisd that if one atom flings
    Its weight away aloft the planet springs
    And wings its course thro realms of boundless space
    Outstripping comets in eccentric race
    Add but one atom more it sinks outright
    Down to the realms of Tartarus and night
    What waters melt or scorching fires consume
    In different forms their being reassume
    Hence can no change arise except in name
    For weight and substance ever are the same

      Thus with the flames that from old Drury rise
    Its elements primval sought the skies
    There pendulous to wait the happy hour
    When new attractions should restore their power
    So in this procreant theatre elate
    Echoes unborn their future life await
    Here embryo sounds in ether lie conceald
    Like words in northern atmosphere congeald
    Here many a ftus laugh and half encore
    Clings to the roof or creeps along the floor
    By puffs concipient some in ether flit
    And soar in bravos from the thundering pit
    Some forth on ticket nights from tradesmen break
    To mar the actor they design to make
    While some this mortal life abortive miss
    Crushd by a groan or strangled by a hiss
    So when dogsmeat reechoes through the streets
    Rush sympathetic dogs from their retreats
    Beam with bright blaze their supplicating eyes
    Sink their hindlegs ascend their joyful cries
    Each wild with hope and maddening to prevail
    Points the pleased ear and wags the expectant tail

      Ye fallen bricks in Drurys fire calcined
    Since doomd to slumber couchd upon the wind
    Sweet was the hour when tempted by your freaks
    Congenial trowels smoothd your yellow cheeks
    Float dulcet serenades upon the ear
    Bends every atom from its ruddy sphere
    Twinkles each eye and peeping from its veil
    Marks in the adverse crowd its destined male
    The oblong beauties clap their hands of grit
    And brickdust titterings on the breezes flit
    Then down they rush in amatory race
    Their dusty bridegrooms eager to embrace
    Some choose old lovers some decide for new
    But each when fixd is to her station true
    Thus various bricks are made as tastes invite
    The red the grey the dingy or the white

      Perhaps some halfbaked rover frank and free
    To alien beauty bends the lawless knee
    But of unhallowd fascinations sick
    Soon quits his Cyprian for his married brick
    The Dido atom calls and scolds in vain
    No crisp neas soothes the widows pain

      So in Cheapside what time Aurora peeps
    A mingled noise of dustmen milk and sweeps
    Falls on the housemaids ear amazd she stands
    Then opes the door with cindersabled hands
    And matches calls The dustman bubbled flat
    Thinks tis for him and doffs his fantaild hat
    The milkman whom her second cries assail
    With sudden sink unyokes the clinking pail
    Now louder grown by turns she screams and weeps
    Alas her screaming only brings the sweeps
    Sweeps but put outshe wants to raise a flame
    And calls for matches but tis still the same
    Atoms and housemaids mark the moral true
    If once ye go astray no match for you

      As atoms in one mass united mix
    So bricks attraction feel for kindred bricks
    Some in the cellar view perchance on high
    Fair chimney chums on beds of mortar lie
    Enamourd of the sympathetic clod
    Leaps the red bridegroom to the labourers hod
    And up the ladder bears the workman taught
    To think he bears the bricksmistaken thought
    A proof beholdif near the top they find
    The nymphs or broken cornerd or unkind
    Back to the bottom leaping with a bound
    They bear their bleeding carriers to the ground

      So legends tell along the lofty hill
    Paced the twin heroes gallant Jack and Jill
    On trudged the Gemini to reach the rail
    That shields the wells top from the expectant pail
    When ah Jack falls and rolling in the rear
    Jill feels the attraction of his kindred sphere
    Head over heels begins his toppling track
    Throws sympathetic somersets with Jack
    And at the mountains base bobbs plump against him whack

      Ye living atoms who unconscious sit
    Jumbled by chance in gallery box and pit
    For you no Peter opes the fabled door
    No churlish Charon plies the shadowy oar
    Breathe but a space and Boreas casual sweep
    Shall bear your scatterd corses oer the deep
    To gorge the greedy elements and mix
    With water marl and clay and stones and sticks
    While charged with fancied souls sticks stones and clay
    Shall take your seats and hiss or clap the play

      O happy age when convert Christians read
    No sacred writings but the Pagan creed
    O happy age when spurning Newtons dreams
    Our poets sons recite Lucretian themes
    Abjure the idle systems of their youth
    And turn again to atoms and to truth
    O happier still when Englands dauntless dames
    Awed by no chaste alarms no latent shames
    The bards fourth book unblushingly peruse
    And learn the rampant lessons of the stews

      All hail Lucretius renovated sage
    Unfold the modest mystics of thy page
    Return no more to thy sepulchral shelf
    But live kind bardthat I may live myself




THEATRICAL ALARM BELL

BY THE EDITOR OF THE M P

Bounce Jupiter bounceOHARA


LADIES AND GENTLEMEN

As it is now the universallyadmitted and indeed
prettygenerallysuspected aim of Mr Whitbread and the infamous
bloodthirsty and in fact illiberal faction to which he belongs to
burn to the ground this free and happy Protestant city and establish
himself in St Jamess Palace his fellow committeemen have thought
it their duty to watch the principles of a theatre built under his
auspices The information they have received from undoubted authority
particularly from an old fruitwoman who had turned kings evidence and
whose name for obvious reasons we forbear to mention though we have had
it some weeks in our possession has induced them to introduce various
reforms not such reforms as the vile faction clamour for meaning
thereby revolution but such reforms as are necessary to preserve the
glorious constitution of the only free happy and prosperous country
now left upon the face of the earth From the valuable and authentic
source above alluded to we have learnt that a sanguinary plot has
been formed by some united Irishmen combined with a gang of Luddites
and a special committee sent over by the Pope at the instigation of
the beastly Corsican fiend for destroying all the loyal part of
the audience on the anniversary of that deeplytobeabhorred and
highlytobeblamed stratagem the gunpowder plot which falls this year
on Thursday the th of November The whole is under the direction of
a delegated committee of OPs whose treasonable exploits at Covent
Garden you all recollect and all of whom would have been hung from the
chandeliers at that time but for the mistaken lenity of government
At a given signal a wellknown OP was to cry out from the gallery
Nosey Music whereupon all the OPs were to produce from their
inside pockets a long pair of shears edged with felt to prevent their
making any noise manufactured expressly by a wretch at Birmingham
one of Mr Broughams evidences and now in custody With these they
were to cut off the heads of all the loyal NPs in the house without
distinction of sex or age At the signal similarly given of Throw
him over which it now appears always alluded to the overthrow of our
neversufficientlyenoughtobedeeplyanduniversallytobevenerated
constitution all the heads of the NPs were to be thrown at the
fiddlers to prevent their appearing in evidence or perhaps as a false
and illiberal insinuation that they have no heads of their own All that
we know of the further designs of these incendiaries is that they are
byagreatdealtoomuch toohorribletobementioned

The manager has acted with his usual promptitude on this trying
occasion He has contracted for  tons of gunpowder which
are at this moment placed in a small barrel under the pit and
a descendant of Guy Faux assisted by Colonel Congreve has
undertaken to blow up the house when necessary in so novel and
ingenious a manner that every OP shall be annihilated while not
a whisker of the NPs shall be singed This strikingly displays
the advantages of loyalty and attachment to government Several
other hints have been taken from the theatrical regulations of the
notabitthelessonthataccounttobeuniversallyexecrated monster
Bonaparte A park of artillery provided with chainshot is to be
stationed on the stage and play upon the audience in case of any
indication of misplaced applause or popular discontent which accounts
for the large space between the curtain and the lamps and the public
will participate our satisfaction in learning that the indecorous custom
of standing up with the hat on is to be abolished as the Bow Street
officers are provided with daggers and have orders to stab all such
persons to the heart and send their bodies to Surgeons Hall gentlemen
who cough are only to be slightly wounded Fruitwomen bawling Bill of
the Play are to be forthwith shot for which purpose soldiers will be
stationed in the slips and ballcartridge is to be served out with the
lemonade If any of the spectators happen to sneeze or spit they are to
be transported for life and any person who is so tall as to prevent
another seeing is to be dragged out and sent on board the tender or by
an instrument taken out of the pocket of Procrustes to be forthwith cut
shorter either at the head or foot according as his own convenience may
dictate

Thus ladies and gentlemen have the committee through my medium
set forth the notinahurrytobeparalleled plan they have
adopted for preserving order and decorum within the walls of their
magnificent edifice Nor have they while attentive to their own
concerns by any means overlooked those of the cities of London
and Westminster Finding on enumeration that they have with a
withtwohandsandonetonguetobeapplauded liberality contracted
for more gunpowder than they want they have parted with the surplus
to the mattockcarrying and hustingshammering high bailiff of
Westminster who has with his own shovel dug a large hole in
the front of the parish church of St Paul Covent Garden that
upon the least symptom of illbreeding in the mob at the general
election the whole of the market may be blown into the air This
ladies and gentlemen may at first make provisions rise but
we pledge the credit of our theatre that they will soon fall
again and people be supplied as usual with vegetables in the
ingeneralstrewedwithcabbagestalksbutonSaturdaynightlightedup
withlamps market of Covent Garden

I should expatiate more largely on the other advantages of the glorious
constitution of these bythewholeofEuropeenvied realms but I am
called away to take an account of the ladies and other artificial
flowers at a fashionable rout of which a full and particular account
will hereafter appear For the present my fashionable intelligence is
scanty on account of the opening of Drury Lane and the ladies and
gentlemen who honour me with their attention will not be surprised if
they find nothing under my usual head




THE THEATRE

BY THE REV G C

    Nil intentatum nostri liqure poet
    Nec minimum merure decus vestigia Grca
    Ausi desesere et celebrare domestica factaHORAT


A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES

If the following poem should be fortunate enough to be selected for the
opening Address a few words of explanation may be deemed necessary on
my part to avert invidious misrepresentation The animadversion I have
thought it right to make on the noise created by tuning the orchestra
will I hope give no lasting remorse to any of the gentlemen employed
in the band It is to be desired that they would keep their instruments
ready tuned and strike off at once This would be an accommodation to
many wellmeaning persons who frequent the theatre who not being blest
with the ear of St Cecilia mistake the tuning for the overture and
think the latter concluded before it is begun

                              one fiddle will
    Give halfashamed a tiny flourish still

was originally written one hautboy will but having providentially
been informed when this poem was upon the point of being sent off that
there is but one hautboy in the band I averted the storm of popular and
managerial indignation from the head of its blower as it now stands
one fiddle among many the faulty individual will I hope escape
detection The story of the flying playbill is calculated to expose
a practice much too common of pinning playbills to the cushions
insecurely and frequently I fear not pinning them at all If these
lines save one playbill only from the fate I have recorded I shall not
deem my labour ill employed The concluding episode of Patrick Jennings
glances at the boorish fashion of wearing the hat in the oneshilling
gallery Had Jennings thrust his between his feet at the commencement of
the play he might have leaned forward with impunity and the catastrophe
I relate would not have occurred The line of handkerchiefs formed to
enable him to recover his loss is purposely so crossed in texture and
materials as to mislead the reader in respect of the real owner of any
one of them For in the satirical view of life and manners which I
occasionally present my clerical profession has taught me how extremely
improper it would be by any allusion however slight to give any
uneasiness however trivial to any individual however foolish or wicked

     Londonand whyEpisode of the hat


    Tis sweet to view from halfpast five to six
    Our long waxcandles with short cotton wicks
    Touchd by the lamplighters Promethean art
    Start into light and make the lighter start
    To see red Phoebus through the gallery pane
    Tinge with his beam the beams of Drury Lane
    While gradual parties fill our widend pit
    And gape and gaze and wonder ere they sit

      At first while vacant seats give choice and ease
    Distant or near they settle where they please
    But when the multitude contracts the span
    And seats are rare they settle where they can

      Now the full benches to late comers doom
    No room for standing miscalld standingroom

      Hark the checktaker moody silence breaks
    And bawling Pit full gives the check he takes
    Yet onward still the gathering numbers cram
    Contending crowders shout the frequent damn
    And all is bustle squeeze row jabbering jam

      See to their desks Apollos sons repair
    Swift rides the rosin oer the horses hair
    In unison their various tones to tune
    Murmurs the hautboy growls the hoarse bassoon
    In soft vibration sighs the whispering lute
    Tang goes the harpsichord tootoo the flute
    Brays the loud trumpet squeaks the fiddle sharp
    Winds the Frenchhorn and twangs the tingling harp
    Till like great Jove the leader figuring in
    Attunes to order the chaotic din
    Now all seems hushdbut no one fiddle will
    Give halfashamed a tiny flourish still
    Foild in his crash the leader of the clan
    Reproves with frowns the dilatory man
    Then on his candlestick thrice taps his bow
    Nods a new signal and away they go
    Perchance while pit and gallery cry Hats off
    And awed Consumption checks his chided cough
    Some giggling daughter of the Queen of Love
    Drops reft of pin her playbill from above
    Like Icarus while laughing galleries clap
    Soars ducks and dives in air the printed scrap
    But wiser far than he combustion fears
    And as it flies eludes the chandeliers
    Till sinking gradual with repeated twirl
    It settles curling on a fiddlers curl
    Who from his powderd pate the intruder strikes
    And for mere malice sticks it on the spikes

      Say why these Babel strains from Babel tongues
    Whos that calls Silence with such leathern lungs
    He who in quest of quiet silence hoots
    Is apt to make the hubbub he imputes

      What various swains our motley walls contain
    Fashion from Moorfields honour from Chick Lane
    Bankers from Paper Buildings here resort
    Bankrupts from Golden Square and Riches Court
    From the Haymarket canting rogues in grain
    Culls from the Poultry sots from Water Lane
    The lottery cormorant the auction shark
    The fullprice master and the halfprice clerk
    Boys who long linger at the gallery door
    With pence twice five they want but twopence more
    Till some Samaritan the twopence spares
    And sends them jumping up the gallery stairs

      Critics we boast who neer their malice baulk
    But talk their minds we wish theyd mind their talk
    Bigworded bullies who by quarrels live
    Who give the lie and tell the lie they give
    Jews from St Mary Axe for jobs so wary
    That for old clothes theyd even axe St Mary
    And bucks with pockets empty as their pate
    Lax in their gaiters laxer in their gait
    Who oft when we our house lock up carouse
    With tippling tipstaves in a lockup house

      Yet here as elsewhere chance can joy bestow
    Where scowling fortune seemd to threaten woe

      John Richard William Alexander Dwyer
    Was footman to Justinian Stubbs Esquire
    But when John Dwyer listed in the Blues
    Emanuel Jennings polishd Stubbss shoes
    Emanuel Jennings brought his youngest boy
    Up as a corncutter a safe employ
    In Holywell Street St Pancras he was bred
    At number twentyseven it is said
    Facing the pump and near the Granbys Head
    He would have bound him to some shop in town
    But with a premium he could not come down
    Pat was the urchins name a redhaird youth
    Fonder of purl and skittlegrounds than truth

      Silence ye gods to keep your tongues in awe
    The Muse shall tell an accident she saw

      Pat Jennings in the upper gallery sat
    But leaning forward Jennings lost his hat
    Down from the gallery the beaver flew
    And spurnd the one to settle in the two
    How shall he act Pay at the gallery door
    Two shillings for what cost when new but four
    Or till halfprice to save his shilling wait
    And gain his hat again at halfpast eight
    Now while his fears anticipate a thief
    John Mullins whispers Take my handkerchief
    Thank you cries Pat but one wont make a line
    Take mine cried Wilson and cried Stokes take mine
    A motley cable soon Pat Jennings ties
    Where Spitalfields with real India vies
    Like Iris bow down darts the painted hue
    Starrd striped and spotted yellow red and blue
    Old calico torn silk and muslin new
    George Green below with palpitating hand
    Loops the last kerchief to the beavers band
    Up soars the prize the youth with joy unfeignd
    Regaind the felt and felt what he regaind
    While to the applauding galleries grateful Pat
    Made a low bow and touchd the ransomd hat




To the Managing Committee of the New Drury Lane Theatre


GENTLEMEN

Happening to be woolgathering at the foot of Mount Parnassus I was
suddenly seized with a violent travestie in the head The first symptoms
I felt were several triple rhymes floating about my brain accompanied by
a singing in my throat which quickly communicated itself to the ears of
everybody about me and made me a burthen to my friends and a torment
to Doctor Apollo three of whose favourite servants that is to say
Macbeth his butcher Mrs Haller his cook and George Barnwell his
bookkeeper I waylaid in one of my fits of insanity and mauled after
a very frightful fashion In this woeful crisis I accidentally heard
of your invaluable New Patent Hissing Pit which cures every disorder
incident to Grub Street I send you enclosed a more detailed specimen of
my case if you could mould it into the shape of an Address to be said
or sung on the first night of your performance I have no doubt that I
should feel the immediate effects of your invaluable New Patent Hissing
Pit of which they tell me one hiss is a dose

MACBETH

     Enter MACBETH in a red nightcap PAGE following with a torch

    Go boy and thy good mistress tell
    She knows that my purpose is cruel
    Id thank her to tingle her bell
    As soon as shes heated my gruel
    Go get thee to bed and repose
    To sit up so late is a scandal
    But ere you have taen off your clothes
    Be sure that you put out that candle
                               Ri fol de rol tol de rol lol

    My stars in the air heres a knife
    Im sure it cannot be a hum
    Ill catch at the handle adds life
    And then I shall not cut my thumb
    Ive got himno at him again
    Come come Im not fond of these jokes
    This must be some blade of the brain
    Those witches are given to hoax

    Ive one in my pocket I know
    My wife left on purpose behind her
    She bought this of Teddyhighho
    The poor Caledonian grinder
    I see thee again oer thy middle
    Large drops of red blood now are spilld
    Just as much as to say diddle diddle
    Good Duncan pray come and be killd

    It leads to his chamber I swear
    I tremble and quake every joint
    No dog at the scent of a hare
    Ever yet made a cleverer point
    Ah no twas a dagger of straw
    Give me blinkers to save me from starting
    The knife that I thought that I saw
    Was nought but my eye Betty Martin

    Now oer this terrestrial hive
    A life paralytic is spread
    For while the one half is alive
    The other is sleepy and dead
    King Duncan in grand majesty
    Has got my state bed for a snooze
    Ive lent him my slippers so I
    May certainly stand in his shoes

    Blow softly ye murmuring gales
    Ye feet rouse no echo in walking
    For though a dead man tells no tales
    Dead walls are much given to talking
    This knife shall be in at the death
    Ill stick him then off safely get
    Cries the world this could not be Macbeth
    For hed neer stick at anything yet

    Hark hark tis the signal by goles
    It sounds like a funeral knell
    O hear it not Duncan it tolls
    To call thee to heaven or hell
    Or if you to heaven wont fly
    But rather prefer Plutos ether
    Only wait a few years till I die
    And well go to the devil together
                                          Ri fol de rol c




CASE NO II


THE STRANGER

    Who has eer been at Drury must needs know the Stranger
    A wailing old Methodist gloomy and wan
    A husband suspicious his wife acted Ranger
    She took to her heels and left poor Hypochon
    Her martial gallant swore that truth was a libel
    That marriage was thraldom elopement no sin
    Quoth she I remember the words of my Bible
    My spouse is a Stranger and Ill take him in
      With my sentimentalibus lachrym roarem
      And pathos and bathos delightful to see
      And chop and change ribs alamode Germanorum
      And high diddle ho diddle pop tweedle dee

    To keep up her dignity no longer rich enough
    Where was her plate why twas laid on the shelf
    Her land fullers earth and her great riches kitchen stuff
    Dressing the dinner instead of herself
    No longer permitted in diamonds to sparkle
    Now plain Mrs Haller of servants the dread
    With a heart full of grief and a pan full of charcoal
    She lighted the company up to their bed

    Incensed at her flight her poor hubby in dudgeon
    Roamd after his rib in a gig and a pout
    Till tired with his journey the peevish curmudgeon
    Sat down and blubberd just like a church spout
    One day on a bench as dejected and sad he laid
    Hearing a squash he cried Hullo whats that
    Twas a child of the Counts in whose service lived Adelaide
    Soused in the river and squalled like a cat

    Having drawn his young excellence up to the bank it
    Appeard that himself was all dripping I swear
    No wonder he soon became dry as a blanket
    Exposed as he was to the Counts son and heir
    Dear sir quoth the Count in reward of your valour
    To show that my gratitude is not mere talk
    You shall eat a beefsteak which my cook Mrs Haller
    Cut from the rump with her own knife and fork

    Behold now the Count gave the Stranger a dinner
    With gunpowder tea which you know brings a ball
    And thin as he was that he might not grow thinner
    He made of the Stranger no stranger at all
    At dinner fair Adelaide brought up a chicken
    A bird that she never had met with before
    But seeing him screamd and was carried off kicking
    And he bangd his nob gainst the opposite door

    To finish my tale without roundaboutation
    Young master and missee besieged their papa
    They sung a quartetto in grand blubberation
    The Stranger cried Oh Mrs Haller cried Ah
    Though pathos and sentiment largely are dealt in
    I have no good moral to give in exchange
    For though she as a cook might be given to melting
    The Strangers behaviour was certainly strange
      With his sentimentalibus lachrym roarem
      And pathos and bathos delightful to see
      And chop and change ribs alamode Germanorum
      And high diddle ho diddle pop tweedle dee




CASE NO III


GEORGE BARNWELL

    George Barnwell stood at the shop door
    A customer hoping to find sir
    His apron was hanging before
    But the tail of his coat was behind sir
    A lady so painted and smart
    Cried Sir Ive exhausted my stock o late
    Ive got nothing left but a groat
    Could you give me four pennorth of chocolate
            Rum ti c

    Her face was rouged up to the eyes
    Which made her look prouder and prouder
    His hair stood on end with surprise
    And hers with pomatum and powder
    The business was soon understood
    The lady who wishd to be more rich
    Cries Sweet sir my name is Milwood
    And I lodge at the Gunners in Shoreditch
            Rum ti c

    Now nightly he stole out good lack
    And into her lodging would pop sir
    And often forgot to come back
    Leaving master to shut up the shop sir
    Her beauty his wits did bereave
    Determind to be quite the crack O
    He lounged at the Adam and Eve
    And calld for his gin and tobacco
            Rum ti c

    And now for the truth must be told
    Though none of a prentice should speak ill
    He stole from the till all the gold
    And ate the lump sugar and treacle
    In vain did his master exclaim
    Dear George dont engage with that Dragon
    Shell lead you to sorrow and shame
    And leave you the devil a rag on
            Your Rum ti c

    In vain he entreats and implores
    The weak and incurable ninny
    So kicks him at last out of doors
    And Georgy soon spends his last guinea
    His uncle whose generous purse
    Had often relieved him as I know
    Now finding him grow worse and worse
    Refused to come down with the rhino
            Rum ti c

    Cried Milwood whose cruel hearts core
    Was so flinty that nothing could shock it
    If ye mean to come here any more
    Pray come with more cash in your pocket
    Make nunky surrender his dibs
    Rub his pate with a pair of lead towels
    Or stick a knife into his ribs
    Ill warrant hell then show some bowels
            Rum ti c

    A pistol he got from his love
    Twas loaded with powder and bullet
    He trudged off to Camberwell Grove
    But wanted the courage to pull it
    Theres nunky as fat as a hog
    While I am as lean as a lizard
    Heres at you you stingy old dog
    And he whips a long knife in his gizzard
            Rum ti c

    All you who attend to my song
    A terrible end of the farce shall see
    If you join the inquisitive throng
    That followed poor George to the Marshalsea
    If Milwood were here dash my wigs
    Quoth he I would pummel and lam her well
    Had I stuck to my prunes and my figs
    I neer had stuck nunky at Camberwell
            Rum ti c

    Their bodies were never cut down
    For granny relates with amazement
    A witch bore em over the town
    And hung them on Thorowgoods casement
    The neighbours Ive heard the folks say
    The miracle noisily brag on
    And the shop is to this very day
    The sign of the George and the Dragon
            Rum ti c

    Macbeth When spooneys on two knees implore the aid of sorcery
    To suit their wicked purposes they quickly put the laws awry

ODES AND ADDRESSES TO GREAT PEOPLE






ODE TO MR GRAHAM

THE AERONAUT

    Up with meup with me into the sky

        WORDSWORTHON A LARK


I

    Dear Graham whilst the busy crowd
    The vain the wealthy and the proud
      Their meaner flights pursue
    Let us cast off the foolish ties
    That bind us to the earth and rise
      And take a birdseye view


II

    A few more whiffs of my cigar
    And then in Fancys airy car
      Have with thee for the skies
    How oft this fragrant smoke upcurld
    Hath borne me from this little world
      And all that in it lies


III

    Awayawaythe bubble fills
    Farewell to earth and all its hills
      We seem to cut the wind
    So high we mount so swift we go
    The chimneytops are far below
      The Eagles left behind


IV

    Ah me my brain begins to swim
    The world is growing rather dim
      The steeples and the trees
    My wife is getting very small
    I cannot see my babe at all
      The Dollond if you please


V

    Do Graham let me have a quiz
    Lord what a Lilliput it is
      That little world of Moggs
    Are those the London Docksthat channel
    The mighty Thamesa proper kennel
      For that small Isle of Dogs


VI

    What is that seeming teaurn there
    That fairy dome St PaulsI swear
      Wren must have been a wren
    And that small stripeit cannot be
    The City RoadGood lack to see
      The little ways of men


VII

    Little indeedmy eyeballs ache
    To find a turnpike I must take
      Their tolls upon my trust
    And where is mortal labour gone
    Look Graham for a little stone
      MacAdamized to dust


VIII

    Look at the horsesless than flies
    Oh what a waste it was of sighs
      To wish to be a Mayor
    What is the honournone at all
    Ones honour must be very small
      For such a civic chair


IX

    And theres Guildhalltis far aloof
    Methinks I fancy thro the roof
      Its little guardian Gogs
    Like penny dollsa tiny show
    WellI must say theyre ruled below
      By very little logs


X

    Oh Graham how the upper air
    Alters the standards of compare
      One of our silken flags
    Would cover London all about
    Nay thenlets even empty out
      Another brace of bags


XI

    Now for a glass of bright champagne
    Above the cloudsCome let us drain
      A bumper as we go
    But holdfor Gods sake do not cant
    The cork awayunless you want
      To brain your friends below


XII

    Think what a mob of little men
    Are crawling just within our ken
      Like mites upon a cheese
    Pshawhow the foolish sight rebukes
    Ambitious thoughtscan there be Dukes
      Of Gloster such as these


XIII

    Oh what is glorywhat is fame
    Hark to the little mobs acclaim
      Tis nothing but a hum
    A few near gnats would trump as loud
    As all the shouting of a crowd
      That has so far to come


XIV

    Wellthey are wise that choose the near
    A few small buzzards in the ear
      To organs ages hence
    Ah me how distance touches all
    It makes the true look rather small
      But murders poor pretence


XV

    The world recedesit disappears
    Heavn open on my eyesmy ears
      With buzzing noises ring
    A fig for Southeys Laureate lore
    Whats Rogers herewho cares for Moore
      That hears the angels sing


XVI

    A fig for earth and all its minions
    We are above the worlds opinions
      Graham well have our own
    Look what a vantage height weve got
    Nowdo you think Sir Walter Scott
      Is such a Great Unknown


XVII

    Speak upor hath he hid his name
    To crawl thro subways into fame
      Like Williams of Cornhill
    Speak up my ladwhen men run small
    Well show whats little in them all
      Receive it how they will


XVIII

    Think now of Irvingshall he preach
    The princes downshall he impeach
      The potent and the rich
    Merely on ethic stiltsand I
    Not moralize at two miles high
      The true didactic pitch


XIX

    Comewhat dye think of Jeffrey sir
    Is Gifford such a Gulliver
      In Lilliputs Review
    That like Colossus he should stride
    Certain small brazen inches wide
      For poets to pass through


XX

    Look down the world is but a spot
    Now sayIs Blackwoods low or not
      For all the Scottish tone
    It shall not weigh us herenot where
    The sandy burdens lost in air
      Our ladingwhere ist flown


XXI

    Nowlike you Crolys verse indeed
    In heavenwhere one cannot read
      The Warren on a wall
    What think you here of that mans fame
    Tho Jerdan magnified his name
      To me tis very small


XXII

    And truly is there such a spell
    In those three letters L E L
      To witch a world with song
    On clouds the Byron did not sit
    Yet dared on Shakespeares head to spit
      And say the world was wrong


XXIII

    And shall not we   Lets think aloud
    Thus being couchd upon a cloud
      Graham well have our eyes
    We felt the great when we were less
    But well retort on littleness
      Now we are in the skies


XXIV

    O Graham Graham how I blame
    The bastard blushthe petty shame
      That used to fret me quite
    The little sores I coverd then
    No sores on earth nor sorrows when
      The world is out of sight


XXV

    My name is Tims I am the man
    That Norths unseen diminishd clan
      So scurvily abused
    I am the very P A Z
    The Londons Lions small pins head
      So often hath refused


XXVI

    Campbellyou cannot see him here
    Hath scornd my laysdo his appear
      Such great eggs from the sky
    And Longman and his lengthy Co
    Long only in a little Row
      Have thrust my poems by


XXVII

    What elseIm poor and much beset
    With petty dunsthat isin debt
      Some grains of golden dust
    But only worth above is worth
    Whats all the credit of the earth
      An inch of cloth on trust


XXVIII

    Whats Rothschild here that wealthy man
    Nay worlds of wealthOh if you can
      Spy outthe Golden Ball
    Sure as we rose all money sank
    Whats gold or silver nowthe Bank
      Is gonethe Change and all


XXIX

    Whats all the groundrent of the globe
    Oh Graham it would worry Job
      To hear its landlords prate
    But after this survey I think
    Ill neer be bullied more nor shrink
      From men of large estate


XXX

    And less still less will I submit
    To poor mean acres worth of wit
      I that have Heavens span
    I that like Shakespeares self may dream
    Beyond the very clouds and seem
      An Universal Man


XXXI

    Oh Graham mark those gorgeous crowds
    Like birds of paradise the clouds
      Are winging on the wind
    But what is grander than their range
    More lovely than their sunset change
      The free creative mind


XXXII

    Well the Adults Schools in the air
    The greatest men are lessond there
      As well as the lessee
    Oh could earths Ellistons thus small
    Behold the greatest stage of all
      How humbled they would be


XXXIII

    Oh would some god the giftie gie em
    To see themselves as others see em
      Twould much abate their fuss
    If they could think that from the skies
    They are as little in our eyes
      As they can think of us


XXXIV

    Of us are we gone out of sight
    Lessend diminishd vanishd quite
      Lost to the tiny town
    Beyond the Eagles kenthe grope
    Of Dollonds longest telescope
      Graham were going down


XXXV

    Ah me Ive touchd a string that opes
    The airy valvethe gas elopes
      Down goes our bright balloon
    Farewell the skies the clouds I smell
    The lower world Graham farewell
      Man of the silken moon


XXXVI

    The earth is close the City nears
    Like a burnt paper it appears
      Studded with tiny sparks
    Methinks I hear the distant rout
    Of coaches rumbling all about
      Were close above the Parks


XXXVII

    I hear the watchmen on their beats
    Hawking the hour about the streets
      Lord what a cruel jar
    It is upon the earth to light
    Welltheres the finish of our flight
      Ive smoked my last cigar




ODE TO MR MADAM

Let us take to the roadBEGGARS OPERA


I

                        Madam hail
    Hail Roadian hail Colossus who dost stand
    Striding ten thousand turnpikes on the land
        Oh universal Leveller all hail
    To thee a good yet stonyhearted man
      The kindest one and yet the flintiest going
    To theehow much for thy commodious plan
      Lanark Reformer of the Ruts is Owing
                        The Bristol mail
    Gliding oer ways hitherto deemd invincible
      When carrying patriots now shall never fail
    Those of the most unshaken public principle
          Hail to thee Scott of Scots
    Thou northern light amid those heavy men
    Foe to Stonehenge yet friend to all beside
    Thou scatterst flints and favours far and wide
          From palaces to cots
        Dispenser of coagulated good
        Distributor of granite and of food
    Long may thy fame its even path march on
        Een when thy sons are dead
    Best benefactor though thou givst a stone
        To those who ask for bread


II

    Thy first great trial in this mighty town
    Was if I rightly recollect upon
      That gentle hill which goeth
    Down from the County to the Palace gate
      And like a river thanks to thee now floweth
    Past the Old Horticultural Society
    The chemist Cobbs the house of Howell and James
    Where ladies play high shawl and satin games
                    A little Hell of lace
    And past the Athenum made of late
                    Severs a sweet variety
    Of milliners and booksellers who grace
                    Waterloo Place
    Making division the Muse fears and guesses
    Twixt Mr Rivingtons and Mr Hesseys
    Thou stoodst thy trial Mac and shavd the road
    From Barber Beaumonts to the Kings abode
    So well that paviours threw their rammers by
    Let down their tuckd shirtsleeves and with a sigh
    Prepard themselves poor souls to chip or die


III

    Next from the palace to the prison thou
      Didst go the highways watchman to thy beat
      Preventing though the rattling in the street
                     Yet kicking up a row
    Upon the stonesah truly watchmanlike
    Encouraging thy victims all to strike
      To further thy own purpose Adam daily
    Thou hast smoothd alas the path to the Old Bailey
          And to the stony bowers
    Of Newgate to encourage the approach
          By caravan or coach
    Hast strewd the way with flints as soft as flowers


IV

          Who shall dispute thy name
    Insculpt in stone in every street
          We soon shall greet
      Thy trodden down yet all unconquerd fame
    Whereer we take even at this time our way
    Nought see we but mankind in open air
    Hammering thy fame as Chantrey would not dare
          And with a patient care
    Chipping thy immortality all day
    Demosthenes of oldthat rare old man
    Prophetically followd Mac thy plan
            For he we know
            History says so
    Put pebbles in his mouth when he would speak
            The smoothest Greek


V

      It is impossible and cannot be
        But that thy genius hath
        Beside the turnpike many another path
      Trod to arrive at popularity
    Oer Pegasus perchance thou hast thrown a thigh
    Nor ridden a roadster onlymighty Mac
    And faith Id swear when on that winged hack
    Thou hast observd the highways in the sky
    Is the path up Parnassus rough and steep
      And hard to climb as Dr B would say
    Dost think it best for sons of song to keep
      The noiseless tenor of their way see Gray
    What line of road should poets take to bring
      Themselves unto those waters lovd the first
    Those waters which can wet a man to sing
      Which like thy fame from granite basins burst
      Leap into life and sparkling woo the thirst


VI

      That thourt a proser even thy birthplace might
      Vouchsafeand Mr Cadell may God wot
      Have paid thee many a pound for many a blot


            Cadells a wayward wight
    Although no Walter still thou art a Scot
    And I can throw I think a little light
    Upon some works thou hast written for the town
    And publishd like a Lilliput Unknown
      Highways and Byeways is thy book no doubt
            One whole editions out
              And next for it is fair
                  That Fame
      Seeing her children should confess she had em
      Some Passages from the life of Adam Blair
        Blair is a Scottish name
      What are they but thy own good roads MAdam


VII

                O indefatigable labourer
    In the paths of men when thou shalt die twill be
    A mark of thy surpassing industry
      That of the monument which men shall rear
    Over thy most inestimable bone
    Thou didst thy very self lay the first stone
    Of a right ancient line thou comestthrough
    Each crook and turn we trace the unbroken clue
    Until we see thy sire before our eyes
    Rolling his gravel walks in Paradise
    But he our great Mac Parent errd and neer
          Have our walks since been fair
    Yet Time who like the merchant lives on Change
    For ever varying through his varying range
          Time maketh all things even
    In this strange world turning beneath high heaven
      He hath redeemd the Adams and contrivd
          How are Times wonders hivd
      In pity to mankind and to befriend em
          Time is above all praise
    That he who first did make our evil ways
    Reborn in Scotland should be first to mend em




ODE TO THE GREAT UNKNOWN

O breathe not his nameMOORE


I

              Thou Great Unknown
    I do not mean Eternity nor Death
              That vast incog
    For I suppose thou hast a living breath
    Howbeit we know not from whose lung tis blown
              Thou man of fog
    Parent of many childrenchild of none
              Nobodys son
    Nobodys daughterbut a parent still
    Still but an ostrich parent of a batch
    Of orphan eggsleft to the world to hatch
              Superlative Nil
    A vox and nothing moreyet not Vauxhall
    A head in papers yet without a curl
              Not the Invisible Girl
    No handbut a handwriting on a wall
              A popular nonentity
    Still calld the samewithout identity
              A lark heard out of sight
    A nothing shind uponinvisibly bright
              Dark with excess of light
    Constables literary Johnanokes
    The real Scottish wizardto no which
              Nobodyin a niche
              Every ones hoax
              Maybe Sir Walter Scott
                  Perhaps not
    Why dost thou so conceal and puzzle curious folks


II

    Thouwhom the secondsighted never saw
    The Master Fiction of fictitious history
              Chief Nong tong paw
    No mister in the worldand yet all mystery
    The tricksy spirit of a Scotch Cock Lane
    A novel Junius puzzling the worlds brain
    A man of magicyet no talisman
    A man of clair obscurenot him o the moon
              A starat noon
    A nondescriptus in a caravan
    A privateof no corpsa northern light
      In a dark lanternBogie in a crape
              A figurebut no shape
              A vizorand no knight
      The real abstract hero of the age
      The staple Stranger of the stage
    A Some One made in every mans presumption
    Frankensteins monsterbut instinct with gumption
    Another strange state captive in the north
      Constableguarded in an iron mask
                  Still let me ask
              Hast thou no silver platter
    No doorplate or no cardor some such matter
    To scrawl a name upon and then cast forth


III

    Thou Scottish Barmecide feeding the hunger
    Of Curiosity with airy gammon
          Thou mysterymonger
    Dealing it out like middle cut of salmon
    That people buy and cant make head or tail of it
    Howbeit that puzzle never hurts the sale of it
    Thou chief of authors mystic and abstractical
    That lay their proper bodies on the shelf
    Keeping thyself so truly to thyself
          Thou Zimmerman made practical
    Thou secret fountain of a Scottish style
              That like the Nile
    Hideth its source wherever it is bred
          But still keeps disemboguing
          Not disembroguing
    Thro such broad sandy mouths without a head
    Thou disembodied authornot yet dead
    The whole worlds literary Absentee
          Ah wherefore hast thou fled
    Thou learned Nemowise to a degree
          Anonymous LLD


IV

      Thou nameless captain of the nameless gang
    That doand inquests cannot say who did it
      Wert thou at Mrs Donattys deathpang
    Hast thou made gravy of Wears watchor hid it
    Hast thou a Blue Beard chamber Heaven forbid it
      I should be very loth to see thee hang
    I hope thou hast an alibi well plannd
    An innocent altho an inkblack hand
      Tho thou hast newly turnd thy private bolt on
        The curiosity of all invaders
      I hope thou art merely closeted with Colton
    Who knows a little of the Holy Land
        Writing thy next new novelThe Crusaders


V

            Perhaps thou wert even born
    To be unknown Perhaps hung some foggy morn
    At Captain Corams charitable wicket
              Pennd to a ticket
    That Fate had made illegible foreseeing
    The future great unmentionable being
            Perhaps thou hast ridden
    A scholar poor on St Augustines back
    Like Chatterton and found a dusty pack
      Of Rowley novels in an old chest hidden
    A little hoard of clever simulation
      That took the townand Constable has bidden
    Some hundred pounds for a continuation
    To keep and clothe thee in genteel starvation


VI

    I liked thy Waverleyfirst of thy breeding
        I like its modest sixty years ago
    As if it was not meant for ages reading
            I dont like Ivanhoe
    Tho Dymoke doesit makes him think of clattering
        In iron overalls before the king
    Secure from battering to ladies flattering
      Tuning his challenge to the gauntlets ring
    Oh better far than all that anvil clang
      It was to hear thee touch the famous string
    Of Robin Hoods tough bow and make it twang
      Rousing him up all verdant with his clan
            Like Sagittarian Pan


VII

    I like Guy Manneringbut not that sham son
    Of Brown I like that literary Sampson
    Ninetenths a Dyer with a smack of Porson
    I like Dirk Hatteraick that rough sea Orson
            That slew the Gauger
    And Dandie Dinmont like old Ursa Major
    And Merrilies young Bertrams old defender
        That Scottish Witch of Endor
    That doomd thy fame She was the Witch I take it
    To tell a great mans fortuneor to make it


VIII

    I like thy Antiquary With his fit on
      He makes me think of Mr Britton
    Who hasor hadwithin his garden wall
    A miniature Stone Henge so very small
        The sparrows find it difficult to sit on
    And Dousterswivel like Poyais MGregor
    And Edie Ochiltree that old Blue Beggar
              Painted so cleverly
    I think thou surely knowest Mrs Beverly
    I like thy Barberhim that fird the Beacon
    But thats a tender subject now to speak on


IX

      I like longarmd Rob Roy His very charms
    Fashiond him for renown In sad sincerity
      The man that robs or writes must have long arms
    If hes to hand his deeds down to posterity
    Witness Miss Biffins posthumous prosperity
    Her poor brown crumpled mummy nothing more
            Bearing the name she bore
    A thing Times tooth is tempted to destroy
    But Roys can never diewhy else in verity
    Is Paris echoing with Vive le Roy
      Ay Rob shall live again and deathless Di
    Vernon of course shall often live again
    Whilst theres a stone in Newgate or a chain
            Who can pass by
    Nor feel the Thiefs in prison and at hand
    There be Old Bailey Jarveys on the stand


X

      I like thy Landlords TalesI like that Idol
    Of love and Lammermoorthe blueeyed maid
    That led to church the mounted cavalcade
      And then pulld up with such a bloody bridal
    Throwing equestrian Hymen on his haunches
    I like the familynot silver branches
            That hold the tapers
      To light the serious legend of Montrose
    I like MAulays secondsighted vapours
    As if he could not walk or talk alone
    Without the devilor the Great Unknown
      Dalgetty is the dearest of Ducrows


XI

    I like St Leonards Lilydrenchd with dew
    I like thy Vision of the Covenanters
    That bloodyminded Graham shot and slew
          I like the battle lost and won
          The hurlyburlys bravely done
    The warlike gallops and the warlike canters
    I like that girded chieftain of the ranters
    Ready to preach down heathens or to grapple
          With one eye on his sword
          And one upon the Word
    How he would cram the Caledonian Chapel
    I like stern Claverhouse though he doth dapple
      His raven steed with blood of many a corse
    I like dear Mrs Headrigg that unravels
      Her texts of Scripture on a trotting horse
    She is so like Rae Wilson when he travels


XII

    I like thy Kenilworthbut Im not going
      To take a Retrospective ReReview
    Of all thy dainty novelsmerely showing
      The old familiar faces of a few
          The question to renew
    How thou canst leave such deeds without a name
    Forego the unclaimd dividends of fame
    Forego the smiles of literary houris
    Mid Lothians trump and Fifes shrill note of praise
          And all the Carse of Gowries
    When thou mightst have thy statue in Cromarty
      Or see thy image on Italian trays
    Betwixt Queen Caroline and Buonapart
      Be painted by the Titian of RAs
    Or vie in signboards with the Royal Guelph
      Perhaps have thy bust set cheek by jowl with Homers
    Perhaps send out plaster proxies of thyself
      To other Englands with Australian roamers
          Mayhap in literary Owhyhee
          Displace the native wooden gods or be
    The ChinaLar of a Canadian shelf


XIII

      It is not modesty that bids thee hide
    She never wastes her blushes out of sight
            It is not to invite
    The worlds decision for thy fame is tried
    And thy fair deeds are scatterd far and wide
    Even royal heads are with thy readers reckond
      From men in trencher caps to trencher scholars
            In crimson collars
    And learned serjeants in the fortysecond
    Whither by land or sea art thou not beckond
    Mayhap exported from the Frith of Forth
    Defying distance and its dim control
      Perhaps read about Stromness and reckond worth
    A brace of Miltons for capacious soul
      Perhaps studied in the whalers further north
    And set above ten Shakespeares near the pole


XIV

    Oh when thou writest by Aladdins lamp
    With such a giant genius at command
          For ever at thy stamp
    To fill thy treasury from Fairy Land
    When haply thou mightst ask the pearly hand
    Of some great British Viziers eldest daughter
          Tho princes sought her
    And lead her in procession hymeneal
    Oh why dost thou remain a Beau Ideal
    Why stay a ghost on the Lethean wharf
    Envelopd in Scotch mist and gloomy fogs
    Why but because thou art some puny dwarf
    Some hopeless imp like Riquet with the Tuft
    Fearing for all thy wit to be rebuffd
    Or bullied by our great reviewing Gogs


XV

          What in this masquing age
    Maketh Unknowns so many and so shy
          What but the critics page
    One hath a cast he hides from the worlds eye
    Another hath a wenhe wont show where
          A third has sandy hair
    A hunch upon his back or legs awry
    Things for a vile reviewer to espy
    Another hath a mangelwurzel nose
          Finally this is dimpled
      Like a pale crumpet face or that is pimpled
    Things for a monthly critic to expose
    Nay what is thy own casethat being small
    Thou choosest to be nobody at all


XVI

    Well thou art prudent with such puny bones
          Een like Elshender the mysterious elf
          That shadowy revelation of thyself
    To build thee a small hut of haunted stones
    For certainly the first pernicious man
    That ever saw thee would quickly draw thee
    In some vile literary caravan
            Shown for a shilling
            Would be thy killing
    Think of Crachamis miserable span
    No tinier frame the tiny spark could dwell in
            Than there it fell in
    But when she felt herself a show she tried
    To shrink from the worlds eye poor dwarf and died


XVII

        O since it was thy fortune to be born
    A dwarf on some Scotch Inch and then to flinch
    From all the Goglike jostle of great men
          Still with thy small crow pen
    Amuse and charm thy lonely hours forlorn
    Still Scottish story daintily adorn
      Be still a shadeand when this age is fled
    When we poor sons and daughters of reality
      Are in our graves forgotten and quite dead
    And Time destroys our mottoes of morality
    The lithographic hand of Old Mortality
    Shall still restore thy emblem on the stone
          A featureless deaths head
    And rob Oblivion evn of the Unknown

AN ADDRESS TO THE STEAM WASHING COMPANY

    Archer How many are there Scrub
    Scrub Fiveandforty SirBEAUX STRATAGEM

    For shamelet the linen aloneM W OF WINDSOR


    Mr ScrubMr Slopor whoever you be
    The Cock of Steam Laundriesthe head Patentee
    Of Associate Cleanserschief founder and prime
    Of the firm for the wholesale distilling of grime
    Copartners and dealers in linens propriety
    That make washing publicand wash in society
    O lend me your ear if that ear can forego
    For a moment the music that bubbles below
    From your new Surrey Geisers all foaming and hot
    That soft simmers sang so endeard to the Scot
    If your hands may stand still or your steam without danger
    If your suds will not cool and a mere simple stranger
    Both to you and to washing may put in a rub
    O wipe out your Amazon arms from the tub
    And lend me your earLet me modestly plead
    For a race that your labours may soon supersede
    For a race that now washing no living affords
    Like Grimaldi must leave their aquatic old boards
    Not with pence in their pockets to keep them at ease
    Not with bread in the fundsor investments of cheese
    But to droop like sad willows that livd by a stream
    Which the sun has suckd up into vapour and steam
    Ah look at the laundress before you begrudge
    Her hard daily bread to that laudable drudge
    When chanticleer singeth his earliest matins
    She slips her amphibious feet in her pattens
    And beginneth her toil while the morn is still grey
    As if she was washing the night into day
    Not with sleeker or rosier fingers Aurora
    Beginneth to scatter the dewdrops before her
    Not Venus that rose from the billow so early
    Lookd down on the foam with a forehead more pearly
    Her head is involvd in an arial mist
    And a brightbeaded bracelet encircles her wrist
    Her visage glows warm with the ardour of duty
    Shes Industrys moralshes all moral beauty
    Growing brighter and brighter at every rub
    Would any man ruin her    No Mr Scrub
    No man that is manly would work her mishap
    No man that is manly would covet her cap
    Nor her apronher hosenor her gown made of stuff
    Nor her gin nor her tea nor her wet pinch of snuff
    Alas so she thought but that slippery hope
    Has betrayed her as tho she had trod on her soap
    And shewhose support like the fishes that fly
    Was to have her fins wet must now drop from her sky
    She whose living it was and a part of her fare
    To be dampd once a day like the great white sea bear
    With her hands like a sponge and her head like a mop
    Quite a living absorbent that revelld in slop
    She that paddled in water must walk upon sand
    And sigh for her deeps like a turtle on land

      Lo then the poor laundress all wretched she stands
    Instead of a counterpane wringing her hands
    All haggard and pinchd going down in lifes vale
    With no faggot for burning like Allanadale
    No smoke from her flueand no steam from her pane
    Where once she watchd heaven fearing God and the rain
    Or gazd oer her bleachfield so fairly engrossd
    Till the lines wanderd idle from pillar to post
    Ah where are the playful young pinnersah where
    The harlequin quilts that cut capers in air
    The brisk waltzing stockingsthe white and the black
    That dancd on the tightrope or swung on the slack
    The light sylphlike garments so tenderly pinnd
    That blew into shape and embodied the wind
    There was white on the grassthere was white on the spray
    Her gardenit lookd like a garden of May
    But now all is darknot a shirts on a shrub
    Youve ruind her prospects in life Mr Scrub
    Youve ruind her customnow families drop her
    From her silver reducdnay reducd from her copper
    The last of her washing is done at her eye
    One poor little kerchief that never gets dry
    From mere lack of linen she cant lay a cloth
    And boils neither barley nor alkaline broth
    But her children come round her as victuals grow scant
    And recall with foul faces the source of their want
    When she thinks of their poor little mouths to be fed
    And then thinks of her trade that is utterly dead
    And even its pearlashes laid in the grave
    Whilst her tub is a dry rotting stave after stave
    And the greatest of coopers evn he that they dub
    Sir Astley cant bind up her heart or her tub
    Need you wonder she curses your bones Mr Scrub
    Need you wonder when steam has deprivd her of bread
    If she prays that the evil may visit your head
    Nay scald all the heads of your Washing Committee
    If she wishes you all the soot blacks of the city
    In short not to mention all plagues without number
    If she wishes you all in the Wash at the Humber

      Ah perhaps in some moment of drowth and despair
    When her linen got scarce and her washing grew rare
    When the sum of her suds might be summd in a bowl
    And the rusty cold iron quite enterd her soul
    When perhaps the last glance of her wandering eye
    Had caught the Cock Laundresses Coach going by
    Or her lines that hung idle to waste the fine weather
    And she thought of her wrongs and her rights both together
    In a lather of passion that frothd as it rose
    Too angry for grammar too lofty for prose
    On her sheetif a sheet were still left herto write
    Some remonstrance like this then perchance saw the light

ODE TO R W ELLISTON ESQUIRE

THE GREAT LESSEE

     Rover Do you know you villain that I am this moment the
     greatest man livingWILD OATS


I

    Oh Great Lessee Great Manager Great Man
    Oh Lord High Elliston Immortal Pan
    Of all the pipes that play in Drury Lane
    Macreadys master Westminsters high Dane
    As Galway Martin in the Houses walls
    Hamlet and Doctor Ireland justly calls
    Friend to the sweet and eversmiling Spring
    Magician of the lamp and prompters ring
    Drurys Aladdin Whipperin of Actors
    Kicker of rebelprefacemalefactors
    Glassblowers corrector King of the chequetaker
    At once Great Leamington and WinstonMaker
    Dramatic Bolter of plain Bunns and cakes
    In silken hose the most reformd of Rakes
    Oh Lord High Elliston lend me an ear
    Poole is away and Williams shall keep clear
    While I in little slips of prose not verse
    Thy splendid course as patternwork rehearse


II

    Bright was thy youththy manhood brighter still
    The greatest Romeo upon Holborn Hill
    Lightest comedian of the pleasant day
    When Jordan threw her sunshine oer a play
    But these though happy were but subject times
    And no man cares for bottomsteps that climbs
    Far from my wish it is to stifle down
    The hours that saw thee snatch the Surrey crown
    Tho now thy hand a mightier sceptre wields
    Fair was thy reign in sweet St Georges Fields
    Dibdin was Premierand a golden age
    For a short time enrichd the subject stage
    Thou hadst than other Kings more peaceandplenty
    Ours but one Bench could boast but thou hadst twenty
    But the times changedand Boothacting no more
    Drew Rulers shillings to the gallery door
    Thou didst with bag and baggage wander thence
    Repentant like thy neighbour Magdalens


III

    Next the Olympic Games were tried each feat
    Practisd the most bewitching in Wych Street
    Charles had his royal ribaldry restord
    And in a downright neighbourhood drank and whord
    Rochester there in dirty ways again
    Revelldand livd once more in Drury Lane
    But thou R W kept thy moral ways
    Pitlecturing twixt the farces and the plays
    A lamplight Irving to the butcher boys
    That soild the benches and that made a noise
    YOUin the backcan scarcely hear a line
    Down from those benchesbutchersthey are MINE


IV

    Lastlyand thou wert built for it by nature
    Crownd was thy head in Drury Lane Theatre
    Gentle George Robins saw that it was good
    And renters cluckd around thee in a brood
    King thou wert made of Drury and of Kean
    Of many a lady and of many a Quean
    With Poole and Larpent was thy reign begun
    But now thou turnest from the Dead and Dun
    Hooks in thine eye to write thy plays no doubt
    And Colman lives to cut the damnlets out
    Oh worthy of the house the Kings commission
    Isnt thy condition a most blessd condition
    Thou reignest over Winston Kean and all
    The very lofty and the very small
    Showest the plumbless Bunn the way to kick
    Keepest a Williams for thy veriest stick
    Seest a Vestris in her sweetest moments
    Without the danger of newspaper comments
    Tellest Macready as none dared before
    Thine open mind from the halfopen door
    Alas I fear he has left Melpomenes crown
    To be a Boniface in Buxton town
    Thou holdst the watch as halfprice people know
    And callest to them to a moment Go
    Teachest the sapient Sapio how to sing
    Hangest a cat most oddly by the wing
    Hast known the length of a Cubittfootand kissd
    The pearly whiteness of a Stephens wrist
    Kissing and pityingtender and humane
    By heaven she loves me Oh it is too plain
    A sigh like this thy trembling passion slips
    Dimpling the warm Madeira at thy lips


V

    Go on Lessee Go on and prosper well
    Fear not though forty glassblowers should rebel
    Show them how thou hast long befriended them
    And teach Dubois their treason to condemn
    Go on addressing pits in prose and worse
    Be long be slow be anything but terse
    Kiss to the gallery the hand thats glovd
    Make Bunn the Great and Winston the Belovd
    Go onand but in this reverse the thing
    Walk backward with wax lights before the King
    Go on Spring ever in thine eye Go on
    Hopes favourite child ethereal Elliston




ODE TO RICHARD MARTIN ESQUIRE

MP FOR GALWAY


I

          How many sing of wars
          Of Greek and Trojan jars
          The butcheries of men
    The Muse hath a Perpetual Ruby Pen
    Dabbling with heroes and the blood they spill
          But no one sings the man
          That like a pelican
    Nourishes Pity with his tender Bill


II

          Thou Wilberforce of hacks
          Of whites as well as blacks
          Piebald and dapple gray
            Chestnut and bay
      No poets eulogy thy name adorns
          But oxen from the fens
          Sheepin their pens
    Praise thee and red cows with their winding horns
          Thou art sung on brutal pipes
            Drovers may curse thee
            Knackers asperse thee
      And sly MPs bestow their cruel wipes
            But the old horse neighs thee
            And zebras praise thee
      Asses I meanthat have as many stripes


III

    Hast thou not taught the drover to forbear
    In Smithfields muddy murderous vile environ
    Staying his lifted bludgeon in the air
            Bullocks dont wear
            Oxide of iron
    The cruel Jarvy thou hast summond oft
    Enforcing mercy on the coarse Yahoo
    That thought his horse the courser of the two
      Whilst Swift smiled down aloft
    O worthy pair for this when ye inhabit
    Bodies of birdsif so the spirit shifts
    From flesh to featherwhen the clown uplifts
    His hand against the sparrows nest to grab it
    He shall not harm the MARTINS and the Swifts


IV

    Ah when Dean Swift was quick how he enhancd
    The horseand humbled biped man like Plato
    But now hes dead the charger is mischancd
    Gone backward in the worldand not advancd
            Remember Cato
    Swift was the horses championnot the Kings
            Whom Southey sings
    Mounted on Pegasuswould he were thrown
    Hell wear that ancient hackney to the bone
    Like a mere clotheshorse airing royal things
    Ah welladay the ancients did not use
    Their steeds so cruellylet it debar men
    From wanton rowelling and whips abuse
          Look at the ancients Muse
            Look at their Carmen


V

          O Martin how thine eye
      That one would think had put aside its lashes
            That cant bear gashes
    Thro any horses side must ache to spy
    That horrid window fronting Fetter Lane
    For theres a nag the crows have pickd for victual
      Or some man painted in a bloody vein
          Gods is there no Horsespital
    That such raw shows must sicken the humane
            Sure Mr Whittle
            Loves thee but little
    To let that poor horse linger in his pane


VI

      O build a Brookess Theatre for horses
    O wipe away the national reproach
      And find a decent Vulture for their corses
            And in thy funeral track
    Four sorry steeds shall follow in each coach
      Steeds that confess the luxury of wo
    True mourning steeds in no extempore black
            And many a wretched hack
    Shall sorrow for theesore with kick and blow
    And bloody gashit is the Indian knack
    Save that the savage is his own tormentor
    Banting shall weep too in his sable scarf
    The biped woe the quadruped shall enter
      And Man and Horse go half and half
    As if their griefs met in a common Centaur

of Making a Will

     I rule the roast as Milton saysCALEB QUOTEM


I

          Hail multifarious man
    Thou Wondrous Admirable Kitchen Crichton
            Born to enlighten
    The laws of optics peptics music cooking
    Master of the pianoand the pan
    As busy with the kitchen as the skies
            Now looking
    At some rich stew thro Galileos eyes
    Or boiling eggstimed to a metronome
            As much at home
    In spectacles as in mere isinglass
    In the art of frying brownas a digression
    On music and poetical expression
    Whereas how few of all our cooks alas
    Could tell Calliope from Calliopee
          How few there be
    Could leave the lowest for the highest stories
            Observatories
    And turn like thee Dianas calculator
    However cooks synonymous with Kater
        Alas still let me say
        How few could lay
    The carvingknife beside the tuningfork
    Like the proverbial Jack ready for any work


II

    Oh to behold thy features in thy book
    Thy proper head and shoulders in a plate
          How it would look
    With one raisd eye watching the dials date
    And one upon the roast gently cast down
          Thy chopsdone nicely brown
    The garnishd browwith a few leaves of bay
          The hairdone Wiggys way
    And still one studious finger near thy brains
          As if thou wert just come
          From editing some
    New soupor hashing Dibdins cold remains
    Or Orpheuslikefresh from thy dying strains
    Of musicEpping luxuries of sound
          As Milton says in many a bout
          Of linked sweetness long drawn out
    Whilst all thy tame stuffd leopards listend round


III

    Oh rather thy whole proper length reveal
    Standing like Fortuneon the jackthy wheel
    Thou art like Fortune full of chops and changes
    Thou hast a fillet too before thine eye
    Scanning our kitchen and our vocal ranges
    As tho it were the same to sing or fry
    Nay so it ishear how Miss Patons throat
            Makes fritters of a note
    And is not reading near akin to feeding
      Or why should Oxford sausages be fit
            Receptacles for wit
      Or why should Cambridge put its little smart
            Mincd brains into a tart
    Nay then thou wert but wise to frame receipts
              Booktreats
    Equally to instruct the cook and cram her
        Receipts to be devourd as well as read
            The culinary art in gingerbread
          The Kitchens Eaten Grammar


IV

    Oh very pleasant is thy motley page
      Ay very pleasant in its chatty vein
      Soin a kitchenwould have talkd Montaigne
    That merry Gasconhumorist and sage
    Let slender minds with single themes engage
      Like Mr Bowles with his eternal Pope
    Or Lovelass upon Willsthou goest on
    Plaiting ten topics like Tate Wilkinson
      Thy brain is like a rich kaleidoscope
    Stuffd with a brilliant medley of odd bits
      And ever shifting on from change to change
    Saucepansold songspillsspectaclesand spits
      Thy range is wider than a Rumford range
    Thy grasp a miracletill I recall
    Th indubitable cause of thy variety
    Thou art of course th epitome of all
    That spyingfryingsingingmixd Society
    Of Scientific Friends who used to meet
    Welsh Rabbitsand thyselfin Warren Street


V

    Oh hast thou still those conversazioni
    Where learned visitors discoursedand fed
              There came Belzoni
    Fresh from the ashes of Egyptian dead
          And gentle Pokiand that royal pair
          Of whom thou didst declare
    Thanks to the greatest Cooke we ever read
    They werewhat Sandwiches should behalf bred
    There famd MAdam from his manual toil
    Relaxdand freely ownd he took thy hints
            On making broth with flints
    There Parry came and showd the polar oil
    For melted butterCoombe with his medullary
            Notions about the scullery
    And Mr Poole too partial to a broil
    There witty Rogers came that punning elf
            Who used to swear thy book
              Would really look
      A Delphic Oracle if laid on Delf
    There once a month came Campbell and discussd
    His ownand thy ownMagazine of Taste
          There Wilberforce the Just
    Came in his old black suit till once he tracd
      Thy sly advice to poachers of black folks
          That do not break their yolks
    Which huffd him home in grave disgust and haste


VI

      There came John Clare the poet nor forbore
    Thy pattiesthou wert handandglove with Moore
    Who calld thee Kitchen Addisonfor why
    Thou givest rules for health and peptic pills
    Forms for made dishes and receipts for wills
    Teaching us how to live and how to die
    There came thy cousincook good Mrs Fry
    There Trench the Thames projector first brought on
                His sine Quay non
    There Martin would drop in on Monday eves
    Or Fridays from the pens and raise his breath
              Gainst cattle days and death
    Answerd by Mellish feeder of fat beeves
      Who swore that Frenchmen never could be eager
              For fighting on soup meagre
    And yet as thou wouldst add the French have seen
              A Marshal Tureen


VII

    Great was thy evening clusteroften gracd
    With DollondBurgessand Sir Humphry Davy
    Twas there MDermot first inclind to taste
    There Colburn learnd the art of making paste
    For puffsand Accum analysed a gravy
    Colman the cutter of Colman Street tis said
    Came there and Parkins with his Exwisehead
    His claim to lettersKater too the Moons
    Cronyand Graham lofty on balloons
    There Croly stalkd with holy humour heated
    Who wrote a lighthorse play which Yates completed
        And Lady Morgan that grinding organ
    And Brasbridge telling anecdotes of spoons
    Madame Valbrque thrice honourd thee and came
    With great Rossini his own bow and fiddle
    And even Irving spard a night from fame
    And talkdtill thou didst stop him in the middle
          To serve round Tewahdiddle


VIII

    Then all the guests rose up and sighed goodbye
    So let themthou thyself art still a Host
      DibdinCornaroNewtonMrs Fry
      Mrs GlasseMr SpecLovelassand Weber
      Mathews in QuotemMoores fireworshipping Gheber
    Thriceworthy worthy seem by thee engrossd
    Howbeit the peptic cook still rules the roast
    Potent to hush all ventriloquial snarling
    And ease the bosom pangs of indigestion
              Thou art sans question
    The Corporations loveits Doctor Darling
    Look at the civic palatenay the bed
      Which set dear Mrs Opie on supplying
              Illustrations of Lying
    Ninety square feet of down from heel to head
              It measured and I dread
    Was haunted by a terrible night Mare
    A monstrous burthen on the corporation
    Look at the bill of fare for one days share
    Seaturtles by the scoreoxen by droves
    Geese turkeys by the flockfishes and loaves
      Countless as when the Lilliputian nation
    Was making up the huge manmountains ration


IX

    Oh worthy Doctor surely thou hast driven
    The squatting demon from great Garratts breast
              His honour seems to rest
    And what is thy rewardHath London given
    Thee public thanks for thy important service
              Alas not even
    The tokens it bestowd on Howe and Jervis
    Yet could I speak as orators should speak
    Before the worshipful the Common Council
    Utter my bold bad grammar and pronounce ill
    Thou shouldst not miss thy freedom for a week
    Richly engrossd on vellumReason urges
    That he who rules our cookerythat he
    Who edits soups and gravies ought to be
    A Citizen where sauce can make a Burgess
