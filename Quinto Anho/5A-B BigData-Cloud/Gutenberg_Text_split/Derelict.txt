    What was the mystery of this great ship from the dark deep reaches
    of space For within its deathfilled chamberswas the avenue of
    life


DERELICT

By Alan E Nourse

Illustrated by Ed Emsh


John Sabo second in command sat bolt upright in his bunk blinking
wideeyed at the darkness The alarm was screaming through the Satellite
Station its harsh nervejarring clang echoing and reechoing down the
metal corridors penetrating every nook and crevice and cubicle of the
lonely outpost screaming incredibly through the dark sleeping period
Sabo shook the sleep from his eyes and then a panic of fear burst into
his mind The alarm Tumbling out of his bunk in the darkness he
crashed into the far bulkhead staggering giddily in the impossible
gravity as he pawed about for his magnaboots his heart pounding
fiercely in his ears The alarm Impossible after so long after
these long months of bitter waiting In the corridor he collided with
Brownie looking like a frightened gnome and he growled profanity as he
raced down the corridor for the Central Control

Frightened eyes turned to him as he blinked at the bright lights of the
room The voices rose in a confused anxious babble and he shook his
head and swore and ploughed through them toward the screen Kill that
damned alarm he roared blinking as he counted faces Somebody get
the Skipper out of his sack pronto and stop that clatter Whats the
trouble

The radioman waved feebly at the view screen shimmering on the great
side panel We just picked it up

It was a ship moving in from beyond Saturns rings a huge grayblack
blob in the silvery screen moving in toward the Station with ponderous
clumsy grace growing larger by the second as it sped toward them Sabo
felt the fear spill over in his mind driving out all thought and he
sank into the control chair like a welltrained automaton His gray eyes
were wide trained for long military years to miss nothing his fingers
moved over the panel with deft skill Get the men to stations he
growled and will somebody kindly get the Skipper down here if he can
manage to take a minute

Im right here The little graying man was at his elbow staring at
the screen with angry red eyes Who told you to shut off the alarm

Nobody told me Everyone was here and it was getting on my nerves

What a shame Captain Loomis voice was icy I give orders on this
Station he said smoothly and youll remember it He scowled at the
great gray ship looming closer and closer Whats its course

Going to miss us by several thousand kilos at least Look at that
thing Its traveling

Contact it This is what weve been waiting for The captains voice
was hoarse

Sabo spun a dial and cursed No luck Cant get through Its passing
us

Then grapple it stupid You want me to wipe your nose too

Sabos face darkened angrily With slow precision he set the servo fixes
on the huge gray hulk looming up in the viewer and then snapped the
switches sharply Two small servos shoved their blunt noses from the
landing port of the Station and slipped silently into space alongside
Then like a pair of trained dogs they sped on their beams straight out
from the Station toward the approaching ship The intruder was dark
moving at tremendous velocity past the Station as though unaware of its
existence The servos moved out and suddenly diverged and reversed
twisting in long arcs to come alongside the strange ship finally moving
in at the same velocity on either side There was a sharp flash of
contact power then like a mammoth slowmotion monster the ship jerked
in midspace and turned a graceful endforend arc as the servograpplers
gripped it like leeches and whined glowing ruddy with the jolting power
flowing through them Sabo watched hardly breathing until the great
ship spun and slowed and stopped Then it reversed direction and the
servos led it triumphantly back toward the landing port of the Station

Sabo glanced at the radioman a frown creasing his forehead Still
nothing

Not a peep

He stared out at the great ship feeling a chill of wonder and fear
crawl up his spine So this is the mysterious puzzle of Saturn he
muttered This is what weve been waiting for

There was a curious eager light in Captain Loomis eyes as he looked up
Oh no Not this

What

Not this The ships weve seen before were tiny flat His little eyes
turned toward the ship and back to Sabos heavy face This is
something else something quite different A smile curved his lips and
he rubbed his hands together We go out for trout and come back with a
whale This ships from space deep space Not from Saturn This ones
from the stars

                                   

The strange ship hung at the side of the Satellite Station silent as a
tomb still gently rotating as the Station slowly spun in its orbit
around Saturn

In the captains cabin the men shifted restlessly uneasily facing the
eager eyes of their captain The old man paced the floor of the cabin
his white hair mussed his face red with excitement Even his carefully
calm face couldnt conceal the eagerness burning in his eyes as he faced
the crew Still no contact he asked Sparks

The radioman shook his head anxiously Not a sign Ive tried every
signal I know at every wave frequency that could possibly reach them
Ive even tried a dozen frequencies that couldnt possibly reach them
and I havent stirred them up a bit They just arent answering

Captain Loomis swung on the group of men All right now I want you to
get this straight This is our catch We dont know whats aboard it
and we dont know where it came from but its our prize That means not
a word goes back home about it until weve learned all there is to
learn Were going to get the honors on this one not some eager Admiral
back home

The men stirred uneasily worried eyes seeking Sabos face in alarm
What about the law growled Sabo The law says everything must be
reported within two hours

Then well break the law the captain snapped Im captain of this
Station and those are your orders You dont need to worry about the
lawIll see that youre protected but this is too big to fumble This
ship is from the stars That means it must have an Interstellar drive
You know what that means The Government will fall all over itself to
reward us

Sabo scowled and the worry deepened in the mens faces It was hard to
imagine the Government falling all over itself for anybody They knew
too well how the Government worked They had heard of the swift trials
the harsh imprisonments that awaited even the petty infringers The
Military Government had no time to waste on those who stepped out of
line they had no mercy to spare And the men knew that their captain
was not in favor in top Government circles Crack patrol commanders were
not shunted into remote lifeless Satellite Stations if their stand in
the Government was high And deep in their minds somehow the men knew
they couldnt trust this little sharpeyed whitehaired man The
credit for such a discovery as this might go to him yesbut there
would be little left for them

The law Sabo repeated stubbornly

Damn the law Were stationed out here in this limbo to watch Saturn
and report any activity we see coming from there Theres nothing in our
orders about anything else There have been ships from there they
think but not this ship The Government has spent billions trying to
find an Interstellar and never gotten to first base The captain
paused his eyes narrowing Well go aboard this ship he said softly
Well find out whats aboard it and where its from and well take
its drive Theres been no resistance yet but it could be dangerous We
cant assume anything The boarding party will report everything they
find to me One of them will have to be a drive man Thats you
Brownie

The little man with the sharp black eyes looked up eagerly I dont
know if I could tell anything

You can tell more than anyone else here Nobody else knows space drive
Ill count on you If you bring back a good report perhaps we can
cancel out certainunfortunate items in your record But one other
should board with you His eyes turned toward John Sabo

Not me This is your goat The mates eyes were sullen This is gross
breach and you know it Theyll have you in irons when we get back I
dont want anything to do with it

Youre under orders Sabo You keep forgetting

Theyre illegal orders sir

Ill take responsibility for that

Sabo looked the old man straight in the eye You mean youd sell us
down a rat hole to save your skin Thats what you mean

Captain Loomis eyes widened incredulously Then his face darkened and
he stepped very close to the big man Youll watch your tongue I
think he gritted Be careful what you say to me Sabo Be very
careful Because if you dont youll be in irons and well see just
how long you last when you get back home Now youve got your orders
Youll board the ship with Brownie

The big mans fists were clenched until the knuckles were white You
dont know whats over there he burst out We could be slaughtered

The captains smile was unpleasant That would be such a pity he
murmured Id really hate to see it happen

                                   

The ship hung dark and silent like a shadowy ghost No flicker of light
could be seen aboard it no sound nor faintest sign of life came from
the tall dark hull plates It hung there huge and imponderable and
swung around with the Station in its silent orbit

The men huddled about Sabo and Brownie helping them into their pressure
suits checking their equipment They had watched the little scanning
beetles crawl over the surface of the great ship examining probing
every nook and crevice reporting crystals and metals and irons while
the boarding party prepared And still the radioman waited alertly for a
flicker of life from the solemn giant

Frightened as they were of their part in the illegal secrecy the
arrival of the ship had brought a change in the crew lighting fires of
excitement in their eyes They moved faster their voices were lighter
more cheerful Long months on the Station had worn on their nervesout
of contact with their homes on a mission that was secretly jeered as
utter Governmental folly Ships had been seen years before
disappearing into the sullen bright atmospheric crust of Saturn but
there had been no sign of anything since And out there on the lonely
guard Station nerves had run ragged always waiting always watching
wearing away even the iron discipline of their military background They
grew bitterly weary of the same faces the same routine the constant
repetition of inactivity And through the months they had watched with
increasing anxiety the conflict growing between the captain and his
bitter sulleneyed secondincommand John Sabo

And then the ship had come incredibly from the depths of space and
the tensions of loneliness were forgotten in the flurry of activity The
locks whined and opened as the two men moved out of the Station on the
little propulsion sleds linked to the Station with light silk guy
ropes Sabo settled himself on the sled cursing himself for falling so
foolishly into the captains scheme cursing his tongue for wandering
And deep within him he felt a new sensation a vague uneasiness and
insecurity that he had not felt in all his years of military life The
strange ship was a variant an imponderable factor thrown suddenly into
his small world of hatred and bitterness forcing him into unknown
territory throwing his mind into a welter of doubts and fears He
glanced uneasily across at Brownie vaguely wishing that someone else
were with him Brownie was a troublemaker Brownie talked too much
Brownie philosophized in a world that ridiculed philosophy Hed known
men like Brownie before and he knew that they couldnt be trusted

The gray hull gleamed at them as they moved toward it a monstrous wall
of polished metal There were no dents no surface scars from its
passage through space They found the entrance lock without difficulty
near the top of the ships great hull and Brownie probed the rim of the
lock with a dozen instruments his dark eyes burning eagerly And then
with a squeal that grated in Sabos ears the oval port of the ship
quivered and slowly opened

Silently the sleds moved into the opening They were in a small vault
quite dark and the sleds settled slowly onto a metal deck Sabo eased
himself from the seat tuning up his audios to their highest
sensitivity moving over to Brownie Momentarily they touched helmets
and Brownies excited voice came to him muted but breathless No
trouble getting it open It worked on the same principle as ours

Better get to work on the inner lock

Brownie shot him a sharp glance But what aboutinside I mean we
cant just walk in on them

Why not Weve tried to contact them

Reluctantly the little engineer began probing the inner lock with
trembling fingers Minutes later they were easing themselves through
moving slowly down the dark corridor waiting with pounding hearts for
a sound a sign The corridor joined another and then still another
until they reached a great oval door And then they were inside in the
heart of the ship and their eyes widened as they stared at the thing in
the center of the great vaulted chamber

My God Brownies voice was a hoarse whisper in the stillness Look
at them Johnny

Sabo moved slowly across the room toward the frail crushed form lying
against the great gleaming panel Thin almost boneless arms were
pasted against the hard metal an oval humanoid skull was crushed like
an eggshell into the knobs and levers of the control panel Sudden
horror shot through the big man as he looked around At the far side of
the room was another of the things and still another mashed like
lifeless jelly into the floors and panels Gently he peeled a bit of
jelly away from the metal then turned with a mixture of wonder and
disgust All dead he muttered

Brownie looked up at him his hands trembling No wonder there was no
sign He looked about helplessly Its a derelict Johnny A wanderer
How could it have happened How long ago

Sabo shook his head bewildered Then it was just chance that it came
to us that we saw it

No pilot no charts It might have wandered for centuries Brownie
stared about the room a frightened look on his face And then he was
leaning over the control panel probing at the array of levers his
fingers working eagerly at the wiring Sabo nodded approvingly Well
have to go over it with a comb he said Ill see what I can find in
the rest of the ship You go ahead on the controls and drive Without
waiting for an answer he moved swiftly from the round chamber out into
the corridor again his stomach almost sick

It took them many hours They moved silently as if even a slight sound
might disturb the sleeping alien forms smashed against the dark metal
panels In another room were the charts great beautiful charts
totally unfamiliar studded with star formations he had never seen
noted with curious meaningless symbols As Sabo worked he heard Brownie
moving down into the depths of the ship toward the giant engine rooms
And then some silent alarm clicked into place in Sabos mind
tightening his stomach screaming to be heard Heart pounding he dashed
down the corridor like a cat seeing again in his mind the bright eager
eyes of the engineer Suddenly the meaning of that eagerness dawned on
him He scampered down a ladder along a corridor and down another
ladder down to the engine room almost colliding with Brownie as he
crossed from one of the engines to a battery of generators on the far
side of the room

Brownie

Whats the trouble

Sabo trembled then turned away Nothing he muttered Just a
thought But he watched as the little man snaked into the labyrinth of
dynamos and coils and wires peering eagerly probing searching making
notes in the little pad in his hand

Illustration

Finally hours later they moved again toward the lock where they had
left their sleds Not a word passed between them The uneasiness was
strong in Sabos mind now growing deeper mingling with fear and a
premonition of impending evil A dead ship a derelict come to them by
merest chance from some unthinkably remote star He cursed without
knowing why and suddenly he felt he hated Brownie as much as he hated
the captain waiting for them in the Station

But as he stepped into the Stations lock a new thought crossed his
mind almost dazzling him with its unexpectedness He looked at the
engineers thin face and his hands were trembling as he opened the
pressure suit

                                   

He deliberately took longer than was necessary to give his report to the
captain dwelling on unimportant details watching with malicious
amusement the captains growing annoyance Captain Loomis eyes kept
sliding to Brownie as though trying to read the information he wanted
from the engineers face Sabo rolled up the charts slowly stowing them
in a pile on the desk Thats the picture sir Perhaps a qualified
astronomer could make something of it I havent the knowledge or the
instruments The ship came from outside the system beyond doubt
Probably from a planet with lighter gravity than our own judging from
the frailty of the creatures Oxygen breathers from the looks of their
gas storage If you ask me Id say

All right all right the captain breathed impatiently You can write
it up and hand it to me It isnt really important where they came from
or whether they breathe oxygen or fluorine He turned his eyes to the
engineer and lit a cigar with trembling fingers The important thing
is how they got here The drive Brownie You went over the engines
carefully What did you find

Brownie twitched uneasily and looked at the floor Oh yes I examined
them carefully Wasnt too hard I examined every piece of drive
machinery on the ship from stem to stern

Sabo nodded slowly watching the little man with a carefully blank
face Thats right You gave it a good going over

Brownie licked his lips Its a derelict like Johnny told you They
were dead All of them Probably had been dead for a long time I
couldnt tell of course Probably nobody could tell But they must have
been dead for centuries

The captains eyes blinked as the implication sank in Wait a minute
he said What do you mean centuries

Brownie stared at his shoes The atomic piles were almost dead he
muttered in an apologetic whine The ship wasnt going any place
captain It was just wandering Maybe its wandered for thousands of
years He took a deep breath and his eyes met the captains for a
brief agonized moment They dont have Interstellar sir Just plain
simple slow atomics Nothing different Theyve been traveling for
centuries and it would have taken them just as long to get back

The captains voice was thin choked Are you trying to tell me that
their drive is no different from our own That a ship has actually
wandered into Interstellar space without a space drive

Brownie spread his hands helplessly Something must have gone wrong
They must have started off for another planet in their own system and
something went wrong They broke into space and they all died And the
ship just went on moving They never intended an Interstellar hop They
couldnt have They didnt have the drive for it

The captain sat back numbly his face pasty gray The light had faded in
his eyes now he sat as though hed been struck Youyou couldnt be
wrong You couldnt have missed anything

Brownies eyes shifted unhappily and his voice was very faint No
sir

The captain stared at them for a long moment like a stricken child
Slowly he picked up one of the charts his mouth working Then with a
bitter roar he threw it in Sabos face Get out of here Take this
garbage and get out And get the men to their stations Were here to
watch Saturn and by god well watch Saturn He turned away a hand
over his eyes and they heard his choking breath as they left the
cabin

Slowly Brownie walked out into the corridor started down toward his
cabin with Sabo silent at his heels He looked up once at the mates
heavy face a look of pleading in his dark brown eyes and then opened
the door to his quarters Like a cat Sabo was in the room before him
dragging him in slamming the door He caught the little man by the neck
with one savage hand and shoved him unceremoniously against the door
his voice a vicious whisper All right talk Lets have it now

Brownie choked his eyes bulging his face turning gray in the dim light
of the cabin Johnny Let me down Whats the matter Youre choking
me Johnny

The mates eyes were red with heavy lines of disgust and bitterness
running from his eyes and the corners of his mouth You stinking little
liar Talk damn it Youre not messing with the captain now youre
messing with me and Ill have the truth if I have to cave in your
skull

I told you the truth I dont know what you mean

Sabos palm smashed into his face jerking his head about like an apple
on a string Thats the wrong answer he grated I warn you dont
lie The captain is an ambitious ass he couldnt think his way through
a multiplication table Hes a little child But Im not quite so dull
He threw the little man down in a heap his eyes blazing You silly
fool your story is so full of holes you could drive a tank through it
They just up and died did they Im supposed to believe that Smashed
up against the panels the way they were Only one thing could crush them
like that Any fool could see it Acceleration And I dont mean atomic
acceleration Something else He glared down at the man quivering on
the floor They had Interstellar drive didnt they Brownie

Brownie nodded his head weakly almost sobbing trying to pull himself
erect Dont tell the captain he sobbed Oh Johnny for gods sake
listen to me dont let him know I lied I was going to tell you anyway
Johnny really I was Ive got a plan a good plan cant you see it
The gleam of excitement came back into the sharp little eyes They had
it all right Their trip probably took just a few months They had a
drive Ive never seen before nonatomic I couldnt tell the principle
with the look I had but I think I could work it He sat up his whole
body trembling Dont give me away Johnny listen a minute

Sabo sat back against the bunk staring at the little man Youre out
of your mind he said softly You dont know what youre doing What
are you going to do when His Nibs goes over for a look himself Hes
stupid but not that stupid

Brownies voice choked his words tumbling over each other in his
eagerness He wont get a chance to see it Johnny Hes got to take
our word until he sees it and we can stall him

Sabo blinked A day or somaybe But what then Oh how could you be
so stupid Hes on the skids hes out of favor and fighting for his
life That drive is the break that could put him on top Cant you see
hes selfish He has to be in this world to get anything Anything or
anyone who blocks him hell destroy if he can Cant you see that
When he spots this your life wont be worth spitting at

Brownie was trembling as he sat down opposite the big man His voice was
harsh in the little cubicle heavy with pain and hopelessness Thats
right he said My life isnt worth a nickle Neither is yours
Neither is anybodys here or back home Nobodys life is worth a
nickle Somethings happened to us in the past hundred years
Johnnysomething horrible Ive seen it creeping and growing up around
us all my life People dont matter any more its the Government what
the Government thinks that matters Its a web a cancer that grows in
its own pattern until it goes so far it cant be stopped Men like
Loomis could see the pattern and adapt to it throw away all the
worthwhile things the love and beauty and peace that we once had in our
lives Those men can get somewhere they can turn this life into a
climbing game waiting their chance to get a little farther toward the
top a little closer to some semblance of security

Everybody adapts to it Sabo snapped They have to You dont see me
moving for anyone else do you Im for me and believe me I know it
I dont give a hang for you or Loomis or anyone else alivejust me I
want to stay alive thats all Youre a dreamer Brownie But until you
pull something like this you can learn to stop dreaming if you want
to

No no youre wrongoh youre horribly wrong Johnny Some of us
cant adapt we havent got what it takes or else we have something
else in us that wont let us go along And right there were beat before
we start Theres no place for us now and there never will be He
looked up at the mates impassive face Were in a life where we dont
belong impounded into a senseless neverending series of fights and
skirmishes and long lonely waits feeding this insane urge of the
Government to expand out to the planets to the stars farther and
farther bigger and bigger Weve got to go seeking newer and greater
worlds to conquer with nothing to conquer them with and nothing to
conquer them for Theres life somewhere else in our solar system so it
must be sought out and conquered no matter what or where it is We live
in a world of iron and fear and there was no place for me and others
like me until this ship came

Sabo looked at him strangely So I was right I read it on your face
when we were searching the ship I knew what you were thinking His
face darkened angrily You couldnt get away with it Brownie Where
could you go what could you expect to find Youre talking death
Brownie Nothing else

No no Listen Johnny Brownie leaned closer his eyes bright and
intent on the mans heavy face The captain has to take our word for
it until he sees the ship Even then he couldnt tell for sureIm
the only drive engineer on the Station We have the charts we could
work with them try to find out where the ship came from I already have
an idea of how the drive is operated Another look and I could make it
work Think of it Johnny What difference does it make where we went
or what we found Youre a misfit too you know thatthis coarseness
and bitterness is a shell if you could only see it a sham You dont
really believe in this world were inwho cares where if only we could
go get away Oh its a chance the wildest freak chance but we could
take it

If only to get away from him said Sabo in a muted voice Lord how
I hate him Ive seen smallness and ambition beforepettiness and
treachery plenty of it But that man is our whole world knotted up in
one little ball I dont think Id get home without killing him just to
stop that voice from talking just to see fear cross his face one time
But if we took the ship it would break him for good A new light
appeared in the big mans eyes Hed be through Brownie Washed up

And wed be free

Sabos eyes were sharp What about the acceleration It killed those
that came in the ship

But they were so frail so weak Light brittle bones and soft jelly
Our bodies are stronger we could stand it

Sabo sat for a long time staring at Brownie His mind was suddenly
confused by the scope of the idea racing in myriad twirling fantasies
parading before his eyes the long bitter frustrating years the
hopelessness of his own life the dull aching feeling he felt deep in
his stomach and bones each time he set back down on Earth to join the
teeming throngs of hungry people He thought of the rows of drab
apartments the thin faces the hollow hunted eyes of the people he had
seen He knew that that was why he was a soldierbecause soldiers ate
well they had time to sleep they were never allowed long hours to
think and wonder and grow dull and empty But he knew his life had
been barren The life of a mindless automaton moving from place to
place never thinking never daring to think or speak hoping only to
work without pain each day and sleep without nightmares

And then he thought of the nights in his childhood when he had lain
awake sweating with fear as the airships screamed across the dark sky
above bound he never knew where and then hearing in the far distance
the booming explosion he had played that horrible little game with
himself seeing how high he could count before he heard the weary
plodding footsteps of the people on the road moving on to another
place He had known even as a little boy that the only safe place was
in those bombers that the place for survival was in the striking
armies and his life had followed the hardlearned pattern twisting him
into the cynical mold of the mercenary soldier dulling the quick and
clever mind drilling into him the ways and responses of order and obey
stripping him of his heritage of love and humanity Others less
thoughtful had been happier they had succeeded in forgetting the life
they had known before they had been able to learn easily and well the
lessons of the repudiation of the rights of men which had crept like a
blight through the world But Sabo too was a misfit wrenched into a
mold he could not fit He had sensed it vaguely never really knowing
when or how he had built the shell of toughness and cynicism but also
sensing vaguely that it was built and that in it he could hide
somehow and laugh at himself and his leaders and the whole world
through which he plodded He had laughed but there had been long
nights in the narrow darkness of spaceship bunks when his mind pounded
at the shell screaming out in nightmare and he had wondered if he had
really lost his mind

His gray eyes narrowed as he looked at Brownie and he felt his heart
pounding in his chest pounding with a fury that he could no longer
deny It would have to be fast he said softly Like lightning
tonight tomorrowvery soon

Oh yes I know that But we can do it

Yes said Sabo with a hard bitter glint in his eyes Maybe we can

                                   

The preparation was tense For the first time in his life Sabo knew the
meaning of real fear felt the clinging aura of sudden death in every
glance every word of the men around him It seemed incredible that the
captain didnt notice the brief exchanges with the little engineer or
his own sudden appearances and disappearances about the Station But the
captain sat in his cabin with angry eyes snapping answers without even
looking up Still Sabo knew that the seeds of suspicion lay planted in
his mind ready to burst forth with awful violence at any slight
provocation As he worked the escape assumed greater and greater
proportions in Sabos mind he knew with increasing urgency and daring
that nothing must stop him The ship was there the only bridge away
from a life he could no longer endure and his determination blinded him
to caution

Primarily he pondered over the charts while Brownie growing hourly
more nervous poured his heart into a study of his notes and sketches A
second look at the engines was essential the excuse he concocted for
returning to the ship was recklessly slender and Sabo spent a grueling
five minutes dissuading the captain from accompanying him But the
captains eyes were dull and he walked his cabin sunk in a gloomy
remorseful trance

The hours passed and the men saw in despair that more precious
dangerous hours would be necessary before the flight could be attempted
And then abruptly Sabo got the call to the captains cabin He found
the old man at his desk regarding him with cold eyes and his heart
sank The captain motioned him to a seat and then sat back lighting a
cigar with painful slowness I want you to tell me he said in a
lifeless voice exactly what Brownie thinks hes doing

Sabo went cold Carefully he kept his eyes on the captains face I
guess hes nervous he said He doesnt belong on a Satellite Station
He belongs at home The place gets on his nerves

I didnt like his report

I know said Sabo

The captains eyes narrowed It was hard to believe Ships dont just
happen out of space They dont wander out interstellar by accident
either An unpleasant smile curled his lips Im not telling you
anything new I wouldnt want to accuse Brownie of lying of courseor
you either But well know soon A patrol craft will be here from the
Triton supply base in an hour I signaled as soon as I had your
reports The smile broadened maliciously The patrol craft will have
experts aboard Space drive experts Theyll review your report

An hour

The captain smiled Thats what I said In that hour you could tell me
the truth Im not a drive man Im an administrator and organizer and
director Youre the technicians The truth now could save you much
unhappinessin the future

Sabo stood up heavily Youve got your information he said with a
bitter laugh The patrol craft will confirm it

The captains face went a shade grayer All right he said Go ahead
laugh I told you anyway

Sabo didnt realize how his hands were trembling until he reached the
end of the corridor In despair he saw the plan crumbling beneath his
feet and with the despair came the cold undercurrent of fear The
patrol would discover them disclose the hoax There was no choice
leftready or not theyd have to leave

Quickly he turned in to the central control room where Brownie was
working He sat down repeating the captains news in a soft voice

An hour But how can we

Weve got to We cant quit now were dead if we do

Brownies eyes were wide with fear But cant we stall them somehow
Maybe if we turned on the captain

The crew would back him They wouldnt dare go along with us Weve got
to run nothing else He took a deep breath Can you control the
drive

Brownie stared at his hands II think so I can only try

Youve got to Its now or never Get down to the lock and Ill get
the charts Get the sleds ready

He scooped the charts from his bunk folded them carefully and bound
them swiftly with cord Then he ran silently down the corridor to the
landing port lock Brownie was already there in the darkness closing
the last clamps on his pressure suit Sabo handed him the charts and
began the laborious task of climbing into his own suit panting in the
darkness

And then the alarm was clanging in his ear and the lock was flooded
with brilliant light Sabo stopped short a cry on his lips staring at
the entrance to the control room

The captain was grinning a nasty evil grin his eyes hard and
humorless as he stood there flanked by three crewmen His hand gripped
an ugly power gun tightly He just stood there grinning and his voice
was like fire in Sabos ears Too bad he said softly You almost
made it too Trouble is two cant keep a secret Shame Johnny a
smart fellow like you I might have expected as much from Brownie but I
thought you had more sense

Something snapped in Sabos mind then With a roar he lunged at the
captains feet screaming his bitterness and rage and frustration
catching the old mans calves with his powerful shoulders The captain
toppled and Sabo was fighting for the power gun straining with all his
might to twist the gun from the thin hand and he heard his voice
shouting Run Go Brownie make it go

The lock was open and he saw Brownies sled nose out into the
blackness The captain choked his face purple Get him Dont let him
get away

The lock clanged and the screens showed the tiny fragile sled jet out
from the side of the Station the small huddled figure clinging to it
heading straight for the open port of the gray ship Stop him The
guns you fools the guns

The alarm still clanged and the control room was a flurry of activity
Three men snapped down behind the tracerguns firing without aiming in
a frenzied attempt to catch the fleeing sled The sled began
zigzagging twisting wildly as the shells popped on either side of it
The captain twisted away from Sabos grip with a roar and threw one of
the crewmen to the deck wrenching the gun controls from his hands Get
the big ones on the ship Blast it If it gets away youll all pay

Suddenly the sled popped into the ships port and the hatch slowly
closed behind it Raving the captain turned the gun on the sleek
polished hull plates pressed the firing levels on the warhead servos
Three of them shot out from the Satellite like deadly bugs careening
through the intervening space until one of them struck the side of the
gray ship and exploded in purple fury against the impervious hull And
the others nosed into the flame and passed on through striking
nothing

Like the blinking of a light the alien ship had throbbed and jerked
and was gone

With a roar the captain brought his fist down on the hard plastic and
metal of the control panel kicked at the sheet of knobs and levers with
a heavy foot his face purple with rage His whole body shook as he
turned on Sabo his eyes wild You let him get away It was your fault
yours But you wont get away Ive got you and youll pay do you
hear that He pulled himself up until his face was bare inches from
Sabos his teeth bared in a frenzy of hatred Now well see wholl
laugh my friend Youll laugh in the death chamber if you can still
laugh by then He turned to the men around him Take him he snarled
Lock him in his quarters and guard him well And while youre doing
it take a good look at him See how he laughs now

They marched him down to his cabin stunned still wondering what had
happened Something had gone in his mind in that second something that
told him that the choice had to be made instantly Because he knew
with dull wonder that in that instant when the lights went on he could
have stopped Brownie could have saved himself He could have taken for
himself a piece of the glory and promotion due to the discoverers of an
Interstellar drive But he had also known somehow in that short
instant that the only hope in the world lay in that one nervous
frightened man and the ship which could take him away

And the ship was gone That meant the captain was through Hed had his
chance the ships coming had given him his chance and he had muffed
it Now he too would pay The Government would not be pleased that
such a ship had leaked through his fingers Captain Loomis was through

And him Somehow it didnt seem to matter any more He had made a stab
at it he had tried He just hadnt had the luck But he knew there was
more to that Something in his mind was singing some deep feeling of
happiness and hope had crept into his mind and he couldnt worry about
himself any more There was nothing more for him they had him cold But
deep in his mind he felt a curious satisfaction transcending any fear
and bitterness Deep in his heart he knew that one man had escaped

And then he sat back and laughed
