PREFACE


The following tales are with one exception taken from the second volume
of Count L N Tolstos collected works and are representative of his
literary activity between  and 

The first story though only a fragment of a projected novel to be called
A Russian Proprietor is perfect and complete in itself One cannot help
feeling that it is autobiographical Count Tolsto himself it will be
remembered having suddenly quitted the University of Kazan in spite of
the entreaties of his friends and retired to his paternal estate of
Yasnaya Polyana near Tula The aunt whose letter is quoted in the first
chapter must have been Count Tolstos aunt mentioned in the second
chapter of My Confession

The Recollections of a Scorer and Two Hussars are both evidently
reminiscent of Count Tolstos gamblingdays Both must have been suggested
by some such terrible experience as that told of the counts gamblingdebt
in the Caucasus

Lucerne and Albert are likewise evidently transcripts from the authors
own experience The strange benefactor in each and the shadowy Prince
Nekhliudof are all Count Tolsto in phases quite distinct from what he is
at present

The Three Deaths written in  has little of the sombre power of
Ivn Ilyitch The scalpel which was so remorselessly applied to the soul
in the latter is wholly hidden It is realism pure and simple and the
contrast between the death of the peasant and of the lady is left to
inference made all the stronger by the unexpected and grandiose finale in
the death of the tree

In interesting contrast to these characteristic stories is the little gem
entitled A Prisoner in the Caucasus which is found in Vol IV of the
Counts works under the heading Tales for Children The style is
perfectly simple and lucid the pictures of life in the Tatar village among
the mountains are intensely vivid painted with strong and masterly
touches and the reader will not soon forget the little laughing maiden
Dina with the rubles jingling in her braided hair She stands forth as one
of the most fascinating of the authors creations

A RUSSIAN PROPRIETOR


I

Prince Nekhliudof was nineteen years of age when at the end of his third
term at the university he came to spend his summer vacation on his estate
He was alone there all the summer

In the autumn he wrote in his unformed boyish hand a letter to his aunt
the Countess Biloretskaa who according to his notion was his best
friend and the most genial woman in the world The letter was in French
and was to the following effect

     DEAR AUNTIEI have adopted a resolution upon which must
     depend the fate of my whole existence I have left the
     university in order to devote myself to a country life
     because I feel that I was born for it For Gods sake dear
     auntie dont make sport of me You say that I am young
     Perhaps I am still almost a child but this does not prevent
     me from feeling sure of my vocation from wishing to
     accomplish it successfully and from loving it

     As I have already written you I found our affairs in
     indescribable confusion Wishing to bring order out of
     chaos I made an investigation and discovered that the
     principal trouble was due to the most wretched miserable
     condition of the peasants and that this trouble could be
     remedied only by work and patience

     If you could only see two of my peasants David and Ivn
     and the way that they and their families live I am
     convinced that one glance at these two unfortunates would do
     more to persuade you than all that I can tell you in
     justification of my resolve Is not my obligation sacred and
     clear to labor for the welfare of these seven hundred human
     beings for whom I must be responsible to God Would it not
     be a sin to leave them to the mercy of harsh elders and
     overseers so as to carry out plans of enjoyment or
     ambition And why should I seek in any other sphere the
     opportunity of being useful and doing good when such a
     noble brilliant and paramount duty lies right at hand

     I feel that I am capable of being a good farmer and in
     order to make myself such an one as I understand the word to
     mean I do not need my diploma as BA nor the rank which
     you so expect of me Dear auntie do not make ambitious
     plans for me accustom yourself to the thought that I am
     going on an absolutely peculiar path but one that is good
     and I think will bring me to happiness I have thought and
     thought about my future duties have written out some rules
     of conduct and if God only gives me health and strength I
     shall succeed in my undertaking

     Footnote  khozyn

     Do not show this letter to my brother Vsya I am afraid of
     his ridicule He generally dictates to me and I am
     accustomed to give way to him Whilst Vanya may not approve
     of my resolve at least he will understand it

The countess replied to her nephew in the following letter also written in
French

     Your letter dear Dmitri showed nothing else to me than
     that you have a warm heart and I have never had reason to
     doubt that But my dear our good tendencies do us more
     harm in life than our bad ones I will not tell you that you
     are committing a folly that your behavior annoys me but I
     will do my best to make one argument have an effect upon
     you Let us reason together my dear

     You say you feel that your vocation is for a country life
     that you wish to make your serfs happy and that you hope to
     be a good farmer

     In the first place I must tell you that we feel sure of
     our vocation only when we have once made a mistake in one
     secondly that it is easier to win happiness for ourselves
     than for others and thirdly that in order to be a good
     master it is necessary to be a cold and austere man which
     you will never in this world succeed in being even though
     you strive to make believe that you are

     You consider your arguments irresistible and go so far as
     to adopt them as rules for the conduct of life but at my
     age my dear people dont care for arguments and rules but
     only for experience Now experience tells me that your
     plans are childish

     I am now in my fiftieth year and I have known many fine
     men but I have never heard of a young man of good family
     and ability burying himself in the country under the pretext
     of doing good

     You have always wished to appear original but your
     originality is nothing else than morbidly developed egotism
     And my dear choose some bettertrodden path It will lead
     you to success and success if it is not necessary for you
     as success is at least indispensable in giving you the
     possibility of doing good which you desire The poverty of a
     few serfs is an unavoidable evil or rather an evil which
     cannot be remedied by forgetting all your obligations to
     society to your relatives and to yourself

     With your intellect with your kind heart and your love
     for virtue no career would fail to bring you success but
     at all events choose one which would be worth your while
     and bring you honor

     I believe that you are sincere when you say that you are
     free from ambition but you are deceiving yourself Ambition
     is a virtue at your age and with your means it becomes a
     fault and an absurdity when a man is no longer in the
     condition to satisfy this passion

     And you will experience this if you do not change your
     intention Goodby dear Mitya It seems to me that I have
     all the more love for you on account of your foolish but
     still noble and magnanimous plan Do as you please but I
     forewarn you that I shall not be able to sympathize with
     you

The young man read this letter considered it long and seriously and
finally having decided that his genial aunt might be mistaken sent in his
petition for dismissal from the university and took up his residence at
his estate


II

The young proprietor had as he wrote his aunt devised a plan of action in
the management of his estate and his whole life and activity were measured
by hours days and months

Sunday was reserved for the reception of petitioners domestic servants
and peasants for the visitation of the poor serfs belonging to the estate
and the distribution of assistance with the approval of the Commune which
met every Sunday evening and was obliged to decide who should have help
and what amount should be given

In such employments passed more than a year and the young man was now no
longer a novice either in the practical or theoretical knowledge of estate
management

It was a clear July Sunday when Nekhliudof having finished his coffee and
run through a chapter of Maison Rustique put his notebook and a packet
of banknotes into the pocket of his light overcoat and started out of
doors It was a great countryhouse with colonnades and terraces where he
lived but he occupied only one small room on the ground floor He made his
way over the neglected weedgrown paths of the old English garden toward
the village which was distributed along both sides of the highway

Nekhliudof was a tall slender young man with long thick wavy auburn
hair with a bright gleam in his dark eyes a clear complexion and rosy
lips where the first down of young manhood was now beginning to appear

In all his motions and gait could be seen strength energy and the
goodnatured selfsatisfaction of youth

The serfs in variegated groups were returning from church old men
maidens children mothers with babies in their arms dressed in their
Sunday best were scattering to their homes and as they met the brin they
bowed low and made room for him to pass

After Nekhliudof had walked some distance along the street he stopped and
drew from his pocket his notebook on the last page of which inscribed in
his own boyish hand were a number of names of his serfs with memoranda He
read Ivn Churis asks for aid and then proceeding still farther
along the street entered the gate of the second hut on the right

Footnote  izb

Churiss domicile consisted of a halfdecayed structure with musty
corners the sides were rickety It was so buried in the ground that the
banking made of earth and dung almost hid the two windows The one on the
front had a broken sash and the shutters were half torn away the other
was small and low and was stuffed with flax A boarded entry with rotting
sills and low door another small building still older and still
lowerstudded than the entry a gate and a barn were clustered about the
principal hut

All this had once been covered by one irregular roof but now only over the
eaves hung the thick straw black and decaying Above in places could be
seen the framework and rafters

In front of the yard were a well with rotten curb the remains of a post
and the wheel and a mudpuddle stirred up by the cattle where some ducks
were splashing

Near the well stood two old willows split and broken with their
whitishgreen foliage They were witnesses to the fact that some one some
time had taken interest in beautifying this place Under one of them sat a
fairhaired girl of seven summers watching another little girl of two who
was creeping at her feet The watchdog gambolling about them as soon as
he saw the brin flew headlong under the gate and there set up a
quavering yelp expressive of panic

Ivn at home asked Nekhliudof

The little girl seemed stupefied at this question and kept opening her
eyes wider and wider but made no reply The baby opened her mouth and set
up a yell

A little old woman in a torn checkered skirt belted low with an old red
girdle peered out of the door and also said nothing Nekhliudof
approached the entry and repeated his inquiry

Yes hes at home replied the little old woman in a quavering voice
bowing low and evincing timidity and agitation

After Nekhliudof had asked after her health and passed through the entry
into the little yard the old woman resting her chin in her hand went to
the door and without taking her eyes off the brin began gently to shake
her head

The yard was in a wretched condition with heaps of old blackened manure
that had not been carried away on the manure were thrown in confusion a
rotting block pitchforks and two harrows

There were penthouses around the yard under one side of which stood a
wooden plough a cart without a wheel and a pile of empty
goodfornothing beehives thrown one upon another The roof was in
disrepair and one side had fallen in so that the covering in front rested
not on the supports but on the manure

Churis with the edge and head of an axe was breaking off the wattles that
strengthened the roof Ivn was a peasant fifty years of age In stature
he was short The features of his tanned oval face framed in a dark auburn
beard and hair where a trace of gray was beginning to appear were handsome
and expressive His dark blue eyes gleamed with intelligence and lazy
goodnature from under halfshut lids His small regular mouth sharply
defined under his sandy thin mustache when he smiled betrayed a calm
selfconfidence and a certain bantering indifference toward all around
him

By the roughness of his skin by his deep wrinkles by the veins that stood
out prominently on his neck face and hands by his unnatural stoop and
the crooked position of his legs it was evident that all his life had been
spent in hard work far beyond his strength

His garb consisted of white hempen drawers with blue patches on the knees
and a dirty shirt of the same material which kept hitching up his back and
arms The shirt was belted low in the waist by a girdle from which hung a
brass key

Goodday said the brin as he stepped into the yard Churis glanced
around and kept on with his work making energetic motions he finished
clearing away the wattles from under the shed and then only having struck
the axe into the block he came out into the middle of the yard

A pleasant holiday your excellency said he bowing low and smoothing
his hair

Thanks my friend I came to see how your affairs were progressing
said Nekhliudof with boyish friendliness and timidity glancing at the
peasants garb Just show me what you need in the way of supports that you
asked me about at the last meeting

Supports of course sir your excellency sir I should like it fixed
a little here sir if you will have the goodness to cast your eye on it
here this corner has given way sir and only by the mercy of God the
cattle didnt happen to be there It barely hangs at all said Churis
gazing with an expressive look at his brokendown ramshackly and ruined
sheds Now the girders and the supports and the rafters are nothing but
rot you wont see a sound timber But where can we get lumber nowadays I
should like to know

Footnote  khozystvo

Footnote  btiushka

Well what do you want with the five supports when the one shed has fallen
in the others will be soon falling in too wont they You need to have
every thing made newrafters and girders and posts but you dont want
supports said the brin evidently priding himself on his comprehension
of the case

Churis made no reply

Of course you need lumber but not supports You ought to have told me
so

Surely I do but theres nowhere to get it Not all of us can come to the
manorhouse If we all should get into the habit of coming to the
manorhouse and asking your excellency for every thing we wanted what kind
of serfs should we be But if your kindness went so far as to let me have
some of the oak saplings that are lying idle over by the threshingfloor
said the peasant making a low bow and scraping with his foot then
maybe I might exchange some and piece out others so that the old would
last some time longer

What is the good of the old Why you just told me that it was all old and
rotten This part has fallen in today tomorrow that one will the day
after a third So if any thing is to be done it must be all made new so
that the work may not be wasted Now tell me what you think about it Can
your premises last out this winter or not

Who can tell

No but what do you think Will they fall in or not

Churis meditated for a moment Cant help falling in said he suddenly

Well now you see you had better have said that at the meeting that you
needed to rebuild your whole place instead of a few props You see I
should be glad to help you

Footnote  dvor

Many thanks for your kindness replied Churis in an incredulous tone and
not looking at the brin If you would give me four joists and some props
then perhaps I might fix things up myself but if any one is hunting
after goodfornothing timbers then hed find them in the joists of the
hut

Why is your hut so wretched as all that

My old woman and I are expecting it to fall in on us any day replied
Churis indifferently A day or two ago a girder fell from the ceiling
and struck my old woman

What struck her

Yes struck her your excellency whacked her on the back so that she lay
half dead all night

Well did she get over it

Pretty much but shes been ailing ever since but then shes always
ailing

What are you sick asked Nekhliudof of the old woman who had been
standing all the time at the door and had begun to groan as soon as her
husband mentioned her

It bothers me here more and more especially on Sundays she replied
pointing to her dirty lean bosom

Again asked the young master in a tone of vexation shrugging his
shoulders Why if you are so sick dont you come and get advice at the
dispensary That is what the dispensary was built for Havent you been
told about it

Certainly we have but I have not had any time to spare have had to work
in the field and at home and look after the children and no one to help
me if I werent all alone


III

Nekhliudof went into the hut The uneven smokebegrimed walls of the
dwelling were hung with various rags and clothes and in the livingroom
were literally covered with reddish cockroaches clustering around the holy
images and benches

In the middle of this dark fetid apartment not fourteen feet square was
a huge crack in the ceiling and in spite of the fact that it was braced up
in two places the ceiling hung down so that it threatened to fall from
moment to moment

Yes the hut is very miserable said the brin looking into the face of
Churis who it seems had not cared to speak first about this state of
things

It will crush us to death it will crush the children said the woman in
a tearful voice attending to the stove which stood under the loft

Hold your tongue cried Churis sternly and with a slight smile playing
under his mustaches he turned to the master And I havent the wit to
know whats to be done with it your excellencywith this hut and props
and planks Theres nothing to be done with them

How can we live through the winter here Okh okh Oh oh groaned the
old woman

Theres one thingif we put in some more props and laid a new floor
said the husband interrupting her with a calm practical expression and
threw over one set of rafters then perhaps we might manage to get through
the winter It is possible to live but youd have to put some props all
over the hut like that but if it gets shaken then there wont be any
thing left of it As long as it stands it holds together he concluded
evidently perfectly contented that he appreciated this contingency

Nekhliudof was both vexed and grieved that Churis had got himself into such
a condition without having come to him long before since he had more than
once during his sojourn on the estate told the peasants and insisted
upon it that they should all apply directly to him for whatever they
needed

He now felt some indignation against the peasant he angrily shrugged his
shoulders and frowned But the sight of the poverty in the midst of which
he found himself and Churiss calm and selfsatisfied appearance in
contrast with this poverty changed his vexation into a sort of feeling of
melancholy and hopelessness

Well Ivn why on earth didnt you tell me about this before he asked
in a tone of reproach as he took a seat on the filthy unsteady bench

I didnt dare to your excellency replied Churis with the same scarcely
perceptible smile shuffling with his black bare feet over the uneven
surface of the mud floor but this he said so fearlessly and with such
composure that it was hard to believe that he had any timidity about going
to his master

We are mere peasants how could we be so presuming began the old woman
sobbing

Hush up said Churis again addressing her

It is impossible for you to live in this hut its all rotten cried
Nekhliudof after a brief silence Now this is how we shall manage it my
friend

Footnote  bratets brother

I am listening

Have you seen the improved stone cottages that I have been building at the
new farmthe one with the undressed walls

Indeed I have seen them replied Churis with a smile that showed his
white teeth still unimpaired Everybodys agog at the way theyre built
Fine cottages The boys were laughing and wondering if they wouldnt be
turned into granaries they would be so secure against rats Fine
cottages he said in conclusion with an expression of absurd perplexity
shaking his head just like a jail

Yes theyre splendid cottages dry and warm and no danger of fire
replied the brin a frown crossing his youthful face as he perceived the
peasants involuntary sarcasm

Without question your excellency fine cottages

Well then one of these cottages is just finished It is twentyfour feet
square with an entry and a barn and its entirely ready I will let you
have it on credit if you say so at cost price you can pay for it at your
own convenience said the brin with a selfsatisfied smile which he
could not control at the thought of his benevolence You can pull down
this old one he went on to say it will make you a granary We will also
move the pens The water there is splendid I will give you enough land for
a vegetablegarden and Ill let you have a strip of land on all three
sides You can live there in a decent way Now does not that please you
asked Nekhliudof perceiving that as soon as he spoke of moving Churis
became perfectly motionless and looked at the ground without even a
shadow of a smile

Its as your excellency wills he replied not raising his eyes

The old woman came forward as though something had stung her to the quick
and began to speak but her husband anticipated her

Its as your excellency wills he repeated resolutely and at the same
time humbly glancing at his master and tossing back his hair But it
would never do for us to live on a new farm

Why not

Nay your excellency not if you move us over there here we are wretched
enough but over there we could never in the world get along What kind of
peasants should we be there Nay nay it is impossible for us to live
there

But why not pray

We should be totally ruined your excellency

But why cant you live there

What kind of a life would it be Just think it has never been lived in
we dont know any thing about the water no pasture anywhere Here we have
had hempfields ever since we can remember all manured but what is there
there Yes what is there there A wilderness No hedges no cornkilns no
sheds no nothing at all Oh yes your excellency we should be ruined if
you took us there we should be perfectly ruined A new place all unknown
to us he repeated shaking his head thoughtfully but resolutely

Nekhliudof tried to point out to the peasant that the change on the
contrary would be very advantageous for him that they would plant hedges
and build sheds that the water there was excellent and so on but
Churiss obstinate silence exasperated him and he accordingly felt that he
was speaking to no purpose

Churis made no objection to what he said but when the master finished
speaking he remarked with a crafty smile that it would be best of all to
remove to that farm some of the old domestic servants and Alysha the
fool so that they might watch over the grain there

That would be worth while he remarked and smiled once more This is
foolish business your excellency

What makes you think the place is not inhabitable insisted Nekhliudof
patiently This place here isnt inhabitable and hasnt been and yet you
live here But there you will get settled there before you know it you
will certainly find it easy

But your excellency kind sir how can it be compared replied Churis
eagerly as though he feared that the master would not accept a conclusive
argument Here is our place in the world we are happy in it we are
accustomed to it and the road and the pondwhere would the old woman do
her washing where would the cattle get watered And all our peasant ways
are here here from time out of mind And heres the threshingfloor and
the little garden and the willows and here my parents lived and my
grandfather and my father gave his soul into Gods keeping here and I too
would end my days here your excellency I ask nothing more than that Be
good and let the hut be put in order we shall be always grateful for your
kindness but no not for any thing would we spend our last days anywhere
else Let us stay here and say our prayers he continued bowing low do
not take us from our nest kind sir

Footnote  btiushka

Footnote  btiushka

All the time that Churis was speaking there was heard in the place under
the loft where his wife was standing sobs growing more and more violent
and when the husband said kind sir she suddenly darted forward and
with tears in her eyes threw herself at the brins feet

Dont destroy us benefactor you are our father you are our mother
Where are you going to move us to We are old folks we have no one to help
us You are to us as God is lamented the old woman

Nekhliudof leaped up from the bench and was going to lift the old woman
but she with a sort of passionate despair beat her forehead on the earth
floor and pushed aside the masters hand

What is the matter with you Get up I beg of you If you dont wish to
go it is not necessary I wont oblige you to said he waving his hand
and retreating to the door

When Nekhliudof sat down on the bench again and silence was restored in
the room interrupted only by the sobs of the old woman who was once more
busy under the loft and was wiping away her tears with the sleeves of her
shirt the young proprietor began to comprehend what was meant for the
peasant and his wife by the dilapidated little hut the crumbling well with
the filthy pool the decaying stalls and sheds and the broken willows
which could be seen before the crooked window and the feeling that arose
in him was burdensome melancholy and touched with shame

Why didnt you tell the Commune last Sunday Ivn that you needed a new
hut I dont know now how to help you I told you all at the first
meeting that I had come to live in the country and devote my life to you
that I was ready to deprive myself of every thing to make you happy and
contented and I vowed before God now that I would keep my word said
the young proprietor not knowing that such a manner of opening the heart
is incapable of arousing faith in any one and especially in the Russian
who loves not words but deeds and is reluctant to be stirred up by
feelings no matter how beautiful they may be

But the simplehearted young man was so pleased with this feeling that he
experienced that he could not help speaking

Churis leaned his head to one side and slowly blinking listened with
constrained attention to his master as to a man to whom he must needs
listen even though he says things not entirely good and absolutely
foreign to his way of thinking

But you see I cannot do all that everybody asks of me If I did not refuse
some who ask me for wood I myself should be left without any and I could
not give to those who really needed When I made this rule I did it for
the regulation of the peasants affairs and I put it entirely in the hands
of the Commune This wood now is not mine but yours you peasants and I
cannot any longer dispose of it but the Commune disposes of it as you
know Come to the meeting tonight I will tell the Commune about your
request if they are disposed to give you a new hut well and good but I
havent any more wood I wish with all my soul to help you but if you
arent willing to move then it is no longer my affair but the Communes
Do you understand me

Many thanks for your kindness replied Churis in some agitation If you
will give me some lumber then we can make repairs What is the Commune
Its a wellknown fact that

No you come

I obey I will come Why shouldnt I come Only this thing is sure I
wont ask the Commune


IV

The young proprietor evidently desired to ask some more questions of the
peasants He did not move from the bench and he glanced irresolutely now
at Churis now at the empty unlighted stove

Well have you had dinner yet he asked at last

A mocking smile arose to Churiss lips as though it were ridiculous to him
for his master to ask such foolish questions he made no reply

What do you meandinner benefactor said the old woman sighing
deeply Weve eaten a little bread thats our dinner We couldnt get any
vegetables today so as to boil some soup but we had a little
kvasenough for the children

Footnote  shchets for shchi

Today was a fastday for us your excellency remarked Churis
sarcastically taking up his wifes words Bread and onions thats the
way we peasants live Howsomever praise be to the Lord I have a little
grain yet thanks to your kindness its lasted till now but theres
plenty of our peasants as aint got any Everywheres theres scarcity of
onions Only a day or two ago they sent to Mikhl the gardener to get a
bunch for a farthing couldnt get any anywheres Havent been to Gods
church scarcely since Easter Havent had nothing to buy a taper for Mikla
St Nicholas with

Nekhliudof not by hearsay nor by trust in the words of others but by the
evidence of his own eyes had long known the extreme depth of poverty into
which his peasantry had sunken but the entire reality was in such perfect
contrast to his own bringingup the turn of his mind and the course of
his life that in spite of himself he kept forgetting the truth of it and
every time when as now it was brought vividly tangibly before him his
heart was torn with painful almost unendurable melancholy as though some
absolute and unavoidable punishment were torturing him

Why are you so poor he exclaimed involuntarily expressing his thought

How could such as we help being poor sir your excellency Our land
is so bad you yourself may be pleased to knowclay and sandheaps and
surely we must have angered God for this long time ever since the
cholera the corn wont grow Our meadows and every thing else have been
growing worse and worse And some of us have to work for the farm and some
detailed for the manorlands And here I am with no one to help me and Im
getting old Id be glad enough to work but I haint no strength And my
old womans ailing and every year theres a new girl born and I have to
feed em all I get tired out all alone and heres seven dependent on me
I must be a sinner in the eyes of the Lord God I often think to myself
And when God takes me off suddenlike I feel it would be easier for me
just as its better for them than to lead such a dogs life here

Footnote  btiushka

Oh okh groaned the old woman as a sort of confirmation of her
husbands words

And this is all the help I have continued Churis pointing to the
whiteheaded unkempt little boy of seven with a huge belly who at this
moment timidly and quietly pushing the door open came into the hut and
resting his eyes in wonder and solemnity on the master clung hold of
Churiss shirtband with both hands

This is all the assistance I have here continued Churis in a sonorous
voice laying his shaggy hand on the little lads white hair When will he
be good for any thing But my work isnt much good When I reach old age I
shall be good for nothing the rupture is getting the better of me In wet
weather it makes me fairly scream I am getting to be an old man and yet I
have to take care of my land And heres Yermilof Demkin Zabref all
younger than I am and they have been freed from their land long ago Well
I havent any one to help me with it thats my misfortune Have to feed so
many thats where my struggle lies your excellency

I should be very glad to make it easier for you truly But how can I
asked the young brin in a tone of sympathy looking at the serf

How make it easier Its a wellknown fact if you have the land you must
do enforced labor also thats the regulation I expect something from
this youngster If only youd be good enough to let him off from going to
school But just a day or two ago the officer came and said that your
excellency wanted him to go to school Do let him off he has no capacity
for learning your excellency Hes too young yet he wont understand any
thing

Footnote  The lands belonging to the Russian commune or mir were
periodically distributed by allotment each fullgrown peasant receiving as
his share a tiagl representing what the average man and his wife were
capable of cultivating When the period was longten years for
instanceit sometimes happened that a serf by reason of illness
laziness or other misfortune would find it hard to cultivate his share
pay the tax on it and also do the work required of him on his brins
land Such was Churiss complaint

Footnote  barshchina work on the masters land

Footnote  zemski

No brother youre wrong there said the brin Your boy is old enough
to understand its time for him to be learning Just think of it How
hell grow up and learn about farming yes and hell know his abcs
and know how to read and read in church Hell be a great help to you if
God lets him live said Nekhliudof trying to make himself as plain as
possible and at the same time blushing and stammering

Very true your excellency You dont want to do us an injury but theres
no one to take care of the house for while I and the old woman are doing
the enforced labor the boy though hes so young is a great help driving
the cattle and watering the horses Whatever he is hes a true muzhk
and Churis with a smile took the lads nose between his fat fingers and
deftly removed the mucus

Nevertheless you must send him to school for now you are at home and he
has plenty of timedo you hear Dont you fail

Churis sighed deeply and made no reply


V

Theres one other thing I wished to speak to you about said Nekhliudof
Why dont you haul out your manure

What manure sir your excellency There isnt any to haul out What
cattle have I got One mare and colt and last autumn I sold my heifer to
the porterthats all the cattle Ive got

Footnote  btiushka

I know you havent much but why did you sell your heifer asked the
brin in amazement

What have I got to feed her on

Didnt you have some straw for feeding the cow The others did

The others have their fields manured but my lands all clay I cant do
any thing with it

Why dont you dress it then so it wont be clay Then the land would
give you grain and youd have something to feed to your stock

But I havent any stock so how am I going to get dressing

Thats an odd cercle vicieux said Nekhliudof to himself and he
actually was at his wits ends to find an answer for the peasant

And I tell you this your excellency it aint the manure that makes the
corn grow but God continued the peasant Now one summer I had six
sheaves on one little unmanured piece of land and only a twelfth as much
on that which was manured well No one like God he added with a sigh
Yes and my stock are always dying off Five years past I havent had any
luck with em Last summer one heifer died had to sell another hadnt any
thing to feed her on and last year my best cow perished They were driving
her home from pasture nothing the matter but suddenly she staggered and
staggered And so now its all empty here Just my bad luck

Well brother since you say that you have no cattle to help you make
fodder and no fodder for your cattle heres something towards a cow
said Nekhliudof reddening and fetching forth from his pocket a packet of
crumpled banknotes and untying it Buy you a cow at my expense and get
some fodder from the granary I will give orders See to it that you have a
cow by next Sunday I shall come to see

Churis hesitated long and when he did not offer to take the money
Nekhliudof laid it down on the end of the table and a still deeper flush
spread over his face

Many thanks for your kindness said Churis with his ordinary smile
which was somewhat sarcastic

The old woman sighed heavily several times as she stood under the loft and
seemed to be repeating a prayer

The situation was embarrassing for the young prince he hastily got up from
the bench went out into the entry and called to Churis to follow him The
sight of the man whom he had been befriending was so pleasant that he found
it hard to tear himself away

I am glad to help you said he halting by the well Its in my power to
help you because I know that you are not lazy You will work and I will
assist you and with Gods aid you will come out all right

Theres no hope of coming out all right your excellency said Churis
suddenly assuming a serious and even stern expression of countenance as
though the young mans assurance that he would come out all right had
awakened all his opposition In my fathers time my brothers and I did not
see any lack but when he died we broke all up It kept going from bad to
worse Perfect wretchedness

Why did you break up

All on account of the women your excellency It was just after your
grandfather died when he was alive we should not have ventured to do it
then the present order of things came in He was just like you he took an
interest in every thing and we should not have dared to separate The late
master did not like to look after the peasants but after your
grandfathers time Andr Ilyitch took charge God forgive him he was a
drunken careless man We came to him once and again with complaintsno
living on account of the womenbegged him to let us separate Well he
put it off and put it off but at last things came to such a pass the
women kept each to their own part we began to live apart and of course
what could a single peasant do Well there wasnt no law or order Andr
Ilyitch managed simply to suit himself Take all you can get And
whatever he could extort from a peasant he took without asking Then the
polltax was raised and they began to exact more provisions and we had
less and less land and the grain stopped growing Well when the new
allotment was made then he took away from us our manured land and added
it to the masters the villain and ruined us entirely He ought to have
been hung Your fatherthe kingdom of heaven be hiswas a good
brin but it was rarely enough that we ever had sight of him he always
lived in Moscow Well of course they used to drive the carts in pretty
often Sometimes it would be the season of bad roads and no fodder
but no matter The brin couldnt get along without it We did not dare to
complain at this but there wasnt system But now your grace lets any of
us peasants see your face and so a change has come over us and the
overseer is a different kind of man Now we know for sure that we have a
brin And it is impossible to say how grateful your peasants are for your
kindness But before you came there wasnt any real brin every one was
brin Ilyitch was brin and his wife put on the airs of a lady and
the scribe from the policestation was brin Too many of em ukh the
peasants had to put up with many trials

Again Nekhliudof experienced a feeling akin to shame or remorse He put on
his hat and went on his way

Yukhvanka the clever wants to sell a horse was what Nekhliudof next
read in his notebook and he proceeded along the street to Yukhvankas
place Yukhvankas hut was carefully thatched with straw from the
threshingfloor of the estate the framework was of new lightgray
aspenwood also from stock belonging to the estate had two handsome
painted shutters for the window and a porch with eaves and ingenious
balustrades cut out of deal planks

Footnote  YukhvnkaMudrynui

Footnote  dvor

The narrow entry and the cold hut were also in perfect order but the
general impression of sufficiency and comfort given by this establishment
was somewhat injured by a barn enclosed in the gates which had a
dilapidated hedge and a sagging pent roof appearing from behind it

Just as Nekhliudof approached the steps from one side two peasant women
came up on the other carrying a tub full of water One was Yukhvankas
wife the other his mother

The first was a robust healthylooking woman with an extraordinarily
exuberant bosom and wide fat cheeks She wore a clean shirt embroidered on
the sleeves and collar an apron of the same material a new linen skirt
peasants shoes a string of beads and an elegant fourcornered headdress
of embroidered red paper and spangles

The end of the wateryoke was not in the least unsteady but was firmly
settled on her wide and solid shoulder Her easy forcefulness manifested
in her rosy face in the curvature of her back and the measured swing of
her arms and legs made it evident that she had splendid health and rugged
strength

Yukhvankas mother balancing the other end of the yoke was on the
contrary one of those elderly women who seem to have reached the final
limit of old age and decrepitude Her bony frame clad in a black
dilapidated shirt and a faded linen skirt was bent so that the wateryoke
rested rather on her back than on her shoulder Her two hands whose
distorted fingers seemed to clutch the yoke were of a strange dark
chestnut color and were convulsively cramped Her drooping head wrapped
up in some sort of a clout bore the most monstrous evidences of indigence
and extreme old age

From under her narrow brow perfectly covered with deep wrinkles two red
eyes unprotected by lashes gazed with leaden expression to the ground
One yellow tooth protruded from her sunken upper lip and constantly
moving sometimes came in contact with her sharp chin The wrinkles on the
lower part of her face and neck hung down like little bags quivering at
every motion

She breathed heavily and hoarsely but her bare distorted legs though it
seemed as if they would have barely strength to drag along over the ground
moved with measured steps


VII

Almost stumbling against the prince the young wife precipitately set down
the tub showed a little embarrassment dropped a courtesy and then with
shining eyes glanced up at him and endeavoring to hide a slight smile
behind the sleeve of her embroidered shirt ran up the steps clattering in
her wooden shoes

Mother you take the wateryoke to aunt Nastsia said she pausing
at the door and addressing the old woman

Footnote  mtushka

The modest young proprietor looked sternly but scrutinizingly at the rosy
woman frowned and turned to the old dame who seizing the yoke with her
crooked fingers submissively lifted it to her shoulder and was about to
direct her steps to the adjacent hut

Your son at home asked the prince

The old woman her bent form bent more than usual made an obeisance and
tried to say something in reply but suddenly putting her hand to her
mouth was taken with such a fit of coughing that Nekhliudof without
waiting went into the hut

Yukhvanka who had been sitting on the bench in the red corner when
he saw the prince threw himself upon the oven as though he were anxious
to hide from him hastily thrust something away in the loft and with
mouth and eyes twitching squeezed himself close to the wall as though to
make way for the prince

Footnote  Where the holy images and the lighted taper are to be found

Yukhvanka was a lightcomplexioned fellow thirty years of age spare with
a young pointed beard He was well proportioned and rather handsome save
for the unpleasant expression of his hazel eyes under his knitted brow
and for the lack of two front teeth which immediately attracted ones
attention because his lips were short and constantly parted

He wore a Sunday shirt with bright red gussets striped print drawers and
heavy boots with wrinkled legs

The interior of Vankas hut was not as narrow and gloomy as that of
Churiss though it was fully as stifling as redolent of smoke and
sheepskin and showing as disorderly an array of peasant garments and
utensils

Two things here strangely attracted the attentiona small damaged samovr
standing on the shelf and a black frame near the ikon with the remains
of a dirty mirror and the portrait of some general in a red uniform

Nekhliudof looked with distaste on the samovr the generals portrait and
the loft where stuck out from under some rags the end of a
coppermounted pipe Then he turned to the peasant

How do you do Yepifn said he looking into his eyes

Yepifn bowed low and mumbled Goodmorning slency with a
peculiar abbreviation of the last word while his eyes wandered restlessly
from the prince to the ceiling and from the ceiling to the floor and not
pausing on any thing Then he hastily ran to the loft dragged out a coat
and began to put it on

Footnote  vaciaso for vashe sitelstvo your excellency

Why are you putting on your coat asked Nekhliudof sitting down on the
bench and evidently endeavoring to look at Yepifn as sternly as possible

How can I appear before you without it slency You see we can
understand

I have come to ask you why you need to sell a horse Have you many horses
What horse do you wish to sell said the prince without wasting words but
propounding questions that he had evidently preconsidered

We are greatly beholden to you slency that you do not think it beneath
you to visit me a mere peasant replied Yukhvanka casting hasty glances
at the generals portrait at the stove at the princes boots and every
thing else except Nekhliudofs face We always pray God for your slency

Why sell the horse repeated Nekhliudof raising his voice and coughing

Yukhvanka sighed tossed back his hair again his glance roved about the
hut and noticing the cat that lay on the bench contentedly purring he
shouted out to her Scat you rubbish and quickly addressed himself to
the brin A horse slency which aint worth any thing If the beast was
good for any thing I shouldnt think of selling him slency

How many horses have you in all

Three horses slency

No colts

Of course slency There is one colt


VIII

Come show me your horses Are they in the yard

Footnote  dvor

Indeed they are slency I have done as I was told slency Could we
fail to heed you slency Yakof Ilyitch told me not to send the horses out
to pasture The prince says he is coming to look at them and so we
didnt send them For of course we shouldnt dare to disobey you
slency

While Nekhliudof was on his way to the door Yukhvanka snatched down his
pipe from the loft and flung it into the stove His lips were still drawn
in with the same expression of constraint as when the prince was looking at
him

A wretched little gray mare with thin tail all stuck up with burrs was
sniffing at the filthy straw under the pent roof A longlegged colt two
months old of some nondescript color with bluish hoofs and nose followed
close behind her

In the middle of the yard stood a potbellied brown gelding with closed
eyes and thoughtfully pendent head It was apparently an excellent little
horse for a peasant

So these are all your horses

No indeed slency Heres still another mare and heres the little
colt replied Yukhvanka pointing to the horses which the prince could
not help seeing

I see Which one do you propose to sell

This here one slency he replied waving his jacket in the direction of
the somnolent gelding and constantly winking and sucking in his lips

The gelding opened his eyes and lazily switched his tail

He does not seem to be old and hes fairly plump said Nekhliudof
Bring him up and show me his teeth I can tell if hes old

You cant tell by one indication slency The beast isnt worth a
farthing Hes peculiar You have to judge both by tooth and limb
slency replied Yukhvanka smiling very gayly and letting his eyes rove
in all directions

What nonsense Bring him here I tell you

Yukhvanka stood still smiling and made a deprecatory gesture and it was
only when Nekhliudof cried angrily Well what are you up to that he
moved toward the shed seized the halter and began to pull at the horse
scaring him and getting farther and farther away as the horse resisted

The young prince was evidently vexed to see this and perhaps also he
wished to show his own shrewdness

Give me the halter he cried

Excuse me Its impossible for you slencydont

But Nekhliudof went straight up to the horses head and suddenly seizing
him by the ears threw him to the ground with such force that the gelding
who as it seems was a very peaceful peasant steed began to kick and
strangle in his endeavors to get away

When Nekhliudof perceived that it was perfectly useless to exert his
strength so and looked at Yukhvanka who was still smiling the thought
most maddening at his time of life occurred to himthat Yukhvanka was
laughing at him and regarding him as a mere child

He reddened let go of the horses ears and without making use of the
halter opened the creatures mouth and looked at his teeth they were
sound the crowns full so far as the young man had time to make his
observations No doubt the horse was in his prime

Meantime Yukhvanka came to the shed and seeing that the harrow was lying
out of its place seized it and stood it up against the wattled hedge

Come here shouted the prince with an expression of childish annoyance
in his face and almost with tears of vexation and wrath in his voice
What call this horse old

Excuse me slency very old twenty years old at least A horse that

Silence You are a liar and a goodfornothing No decent peasant will
lie theres no need for him to said Nekhliudof choking with the angry
tears that filled his throat

He stopped speaking lest he should be detected in weeping before the
peasant Yukhvanka also said nothing and had the appearance of a man who
was almost on the verge of tears blew his nose and slowly shook his head

Well how are you going to plough when you have disposed of this horse
continued Nekhliudof calming himself with an effort so as to speak in his
ordinary voice You are sent out into the field on purpose to drive the
horses for ploughing and you wish to dispose of your last horse And I
should like to know why you need to lie about it

In proportion as the prince calmed down Yukhvanka also calmed down He
straightened himself up and while he sucked in his lips constantly he
let his eyes rove about from one object to another

Lie to you slency We are no worse off than others in going to work

But what will you go on

Dont worry We will do your work slency he replied starting up the
gelding and driving him away Even if we didnt need money I should want
to get rid of him

Why do you need money

Havent no grain slency and besides we peasants have to pay our debts
slency

How is it you have no grain Others who have families have corn enough
but you have no family and you are in want Where is it all gone

Ate it up slency and now we havent a bit I will buy a horse in the
autumn slency

Dont for a moment think of selling your horse

But if we dont then whatll become of us slency No grain and
forbidden to sell any thing he replied turning his head to one side
sucking in his lips and suddenly glancing boldly into the princes face
Of course we shall die of starvation

Look here brother cried Nekhliudof paling and experiencing a feeling
of righteous indignation against the peasant I cant endure such peasants
as you are It will go hard with you

Just as you will slency he replied shutting his eyes with an
expression of feigned submission I should not think of disobeying you
But it comes not from any fault of mine Of course I may not please you
slency at all events I can do as you wish only I dont see why I
deserve to be punished

This is why because your yard is exposed your manure is not ploughed in
your hedges are broken down and yet you sit at home smoking your pipe and
dont work because you dont give a crust of bread to your mother who
gave you your whole place and you let your wife beat her and she has
to come to me with her complaints

Footnote  khozystvo

Excuse me slency I dont know what you mean by smoking your pipe
replied Yukhvanka in a constrained tone showing beyond peradventure that
the complaint about his smoking touched him to the quick It is possible
to say any thing about a man

Now youre lying again I myself saw

How could I venture to lie to you slency

Nekhliudof made no answer but bit his lip and began to walk back and
forth in the yard Yukhvanka standing in one place and not lifting his
eyes followed the princes legs

See here Yepifn said Nekhliudof in a childishly gentle voice coming
to a pause before the peasant and endeavoring to hide his vexation it is
impossible to live so and you are working your own destruction Just
think If you want to be a good peasant then turn over a new leaf cease
your evil courses stop lying dont get drunk any more honor your mother
You see I know all about you Take hold of your work dont steal from the
crown woods for the sake of going to the tavern Think how well off you
might be If you really need any thing then come to me tell me honestly
what you need and why you need it and dont tell lies but tell the whole
truth and then I wont refuse you any thing that I can possibly grant

Excuse me slency I think I understand you slency replied Yukhvanka
smiling as though he comprehended the entire significance of the princes
words

That smile and answer completely disenchanted Nekhliudof so far as he had
any hope of reforming the man and of turning him into the path of virtue by
means of moral suasion It seemed to him hard that it should be wasted
energy when he had the power to warn the peasant and that all that he had
said was exactly what he should not have said

He shook his head gravely and went into the house The old woman was
sitting on the threshold and groaning heavily as it seemed to the young
proprietor as a sign of approbation of his words which she had overheard

Heres something for you to get bread with said Nekhliudof in her ear
pressing a banknote into her hand But keep it for yourself and dont
give it to Yepifn else hell drink it up

The old woman with her distorted hand laid hold of the doorpost and tried
to get up She began to pour out her thanks to the prince her head began
to wag but Nekhliudof was already on the other side of the street when she
got to her feet


IX

Davidka Bylui asks for grain and posts was what followed
Yukhvankas case in the notebook

Footnote  Little David White

After passing by a number of places Nekhliudof came to a turn in the lane
and there fell in with his overseer Yakof Alptitch who while the prince
was still at a distance took off his oiled cap and pulling out a crumpled
bandanna handkerchief began to wipe his fat red face

Cover yourself Yakof Yakof cover yourself I tell you

Where do you wish to go your excellency asked Yakof using his cap to
shield his eyes from the sun but not putting it on

I have been at Yukhvankas Tell me pray why does he act so asked the
prince as he walked along the street

Why indeed your excellency echoed the overseer as he followed behind
the prince in a respectful attitude He put on his cap and began to twist
his mustache

Whats to be done with him Hes thoroughly good for nothing lazy
thievish a liar he persecutes his mother and to all appearances he is
such a confirmed goodfornothing that there is no reforming him

I didnt know your excellency that he displeased you so

And his wife continued the prince interrupting the overseer seems
like a bad woman The old mother is dressed worse than a beggar and has
nothing to eat but she wears all her best clothes and so does he I
really dont know what is to be done with them

Yakof knit his brows thoughtfully when Nekhliudof spoke of Yukhvankas
wife

Well if he behaves so your excellency began the overseer then it
will be necessary to find some way to correct things He is in abject
poverty like all the peasants who have no assistance but he seems to
manage his affairs quite differently from the others Hes a clever fellow
knows how to read and hes far from being a dishonest peasant At the
collection of the polltaxes he was always on hand And for three years
while I was overseer he was bailiff and no fault was found with him In
the third year the warden took it into his head to depose him so he was
obliged to take to farming Perhaps when he lived in town at the station he
got drunk sometimes so we had to devise some means They used to threaten
him in fun and he came to his senses again He was goodnatured and got
along well with his family But as it does not please you to use these
means I am sure I dont know what we are to do with him He has really got
very low He cant be sent into the army because as you may be pleased to
remember two of his teeth are missing Yes and there are others besides
him I venture to remind you who absolutely havent any

Enough of that Yakof interrupted Nekhliudof smiling shrewdly You and
I have discussed that again and again You know what ideas I have on this
subject and whatever you may say to me I still remain of the same
opinion

Certainly your excellency you understand it all said Yakof shrugging
his shoulders and looking askance at the prince as though what he saw were
worthy of no consideration But as far as the old woman is concerned I
beg you to see that you are disturbing yourself to no purpose he
continued Certainly it is true that she has brought up the orphans she
has fed Yukhvanka and got him a wife and so forth but you know that is
common enough among peasants When the mother or father has transferred the
property to the son then the new owners get control and the old
mother is obliged to work for her own living to the utmost of her strength
Of course they are lacking in delicate feelings but this is common enough
among the peasantry and so I take the liberty of explaining to you that
you are stirred up about the old woman all for nothing She is a clever old
woman and a good housewife is there any reason for a gentleman to
worry over her Well she has quarrelled with her daughterinlaw maybe
the young woman struck her thats like a woman and they would make up
again while you torment yourself You really take it all too much to
heart said the overseer looking with a certain expression of fondness
mingled with condescension at the prince who was walking silently with
long strides before him up the street

Footnote  khozystvo

Footnote  khozyka

Will you go home now he added

No to Davidka Byluis or Kazylswhat is his name

Well hes a goodfornothing I assure you All the race of the Kazyls
are of the same sort I havent had any success with him he cares for
nothing Yesterday I rode past the peasants field and his buckwheat
wasnt even sowed yet What do you wish done with such people The old man
taught his son but still hes a goodfornothing just the same whether
for himself or for the estate he makes a bungle of every thing Neither
the warden nor I have been able to do any thing with him weve sent him to
the stationhouse and weve punished him at home because you are pleased
now to like

Who the old man

Yes the old man The warden more than once has punished him before the
whole assembly and would you believe it he would shake himself go home
and be as bad as ever And Davidka I assure your excellency is a
lawabiding peasant and a quickwitted peasant that is he doesnt smoke
and doesnt drink explained Yakof and yet hes worse than the other who
gets drunk Theres nothing else to do with him than to make a soldier of
him or send him to Siberia All the Kazyls are the same and Matriushka
who lives in the village belongs to their family and is the same sort of
cursed goodfornothing Dont you care to have me here your excellency
inquired the overseer perceiving that the prince did not heed what he was
saying

No go away replied Nekhliudof absentmindedly and turned his steps
toward Davidka Byluis

Davidkas hovel stood askew and alone at the very edge of the village
It had neither yard nor cornkiln nor barn Only some sort of dirty stalls
for cattle were built against one side On the other a heap of brushwood
and logs was piled up in imitation of a yard

Footnote  izb

Footnote  dvor

Tall green steppegrass was growing in the place where the courtyard
should have been

There was no living creature to be seen near the hovel except a sow lying
in the mire at the threshold and grunting

Nekhliudof tapped at the broken window but as no one made answer he went
into the entry and shouted Holloa there

Footnote  khozyeva literally master and mistress

This also brought no response He passed through the entry peered into the
empty stalls and entered the open hut

An old red cock and two hens with ruffs were scratching with their legs
and strutting about over the floor and benches When they saw a man they
spread their wings and cackling with terror flew against the walls and
one took refuge on the oven

The whole hut which was not quite fourteen feet square was occupied
by the oven with its broken pipe a loom which in spite of its being
summertime was not taken down and a most filthy table made of a split and
uneven plank

Footnote  Six arshin

Although it was a dry situation there was a filthy puddle at the door
caused by the recent rain which had leaked through roof and ceiling Loft
there was none It was hard to realize that this was a human habitation
such decided evidence of neglect and disorder was impressed upon both the
exterior and the interior of the hovel nevertheless in this hovel lived
Davidka Bylui and all his family

At the present moment notwithstanding the heat of the June day Davidka
with his head covered by his sheepskin was fast asleep curled up on
one corner of the oven The panicstricken hen skipping up on the oven
and growing more and more agitated took up her position on Davidkas back
but did not awaken him

Footnote  polushubok

Nekhliudof seeing no one in the hovel was about to go when a prolonged
humid sigh betrayed the sleeper

Footnote  khozyn

Holloa whos there cried the prince

A second prolonged sigh was heard from the oven

Whos there Come here

Still another sigh a sort of a bellow and a heavy yawn responded to the
princes call

Well who are you

Something moved slightly on the oven The skirt of a torn sheepskin
was lifted one huge leg in a dilapidated boot was put down then another
and finally Davidkas entire figure emerged He sat up on the oven and
rubbed his eyes drowsily and morosely with his fist

Footnote  tulup

Slowly shaking his head and yawning he looked down into the hut and
seeing the prince began to make greater haste than before but still his
motions were so slow that Nekhliudof had time to walk back and forth three
times from the puddle to the loom before Davidka got down from the oven

Davidka Bylui or David White was white in reality his hair and his body
and his face all were perfectly white

He was tall and very stout but stout as peasants are wont to be that is
not in the waist alone but in the whole body His stoutness however was
of a peculiar flabby unhealthy kind His rather comely face with
paleblue goodnatured eyes and a wide trimmed beard bore the impress of
ill health There was not the slightest trace of tan or blood it was of a
uniform yellowish ashen tint with pale livid circles under the eyes quite
as though his face were stuffed with fat or bloated

His hands were puffy and yellow like the hands of men afflicted with
dropsy and they wore a growth of fine white hair He was so drowsy that he
could scarcely open his eyes or cease from staggering and yawning

Well arent you ashamed of yourself began Nekhliudof sleeping in the
very best part of the day when you ought to be attending to your work
when you havent any corn

Footnote  Literally middle of the white day

As Davidka little by little shook off his drowsiness and began to realize
that it was the prince who was standing before him he folded his arms
across his stomach hung his head inclining it a trifle to one side and
did not move a limb or say a word but the expression of his face and the
pose of his whole body seemed to say I know I know it is an old story
with me Well strike me if it must be I will endure it

He evidently was anxious for the prince to get through speaking and give
him his thrashing as quickly as possible even if he struck him severely on
his swollen cheeks and then leave him in peace

Perceiving that Davidka did not understand him Nekhliudof endeavored by
various questions to rouse the peasant from his vexatiously obstinate
silence

Why have you asked me for wood when you have enough to last you a whole
month here and you havent had any thing to do What

Davidka still remained silent and did not move

Well answer me

Davidka muttered something and blinked his white eyelashes

You must go to work brother What will become of you if you dont work
Now you have no grain and whats the reason of it Because your land is
badly ploughed and not harrowed and no seed put in at the right
timeall from laziness You asked me for grain well let us suppose that
I gave it to you so as to keep you from starving to death still it is not
becoming to do so Whose grain do I give you whose do you think Answer
mewhose grain do I give you demanded Nekhliudof obstinately

The Lords muttered Davidka raising his eyes timidly and questioningly

But where did the Lords grain come from Think for yourself who ploughed
for it who harrowed who planted it who harvested it The peasants hey
Just look here if the Lords grain is given to the peasants then those
peasants who work most will get most but you work less than anybody You
are complained about on all sides You work less than all the others and
yet you ask for more of the Lords grain than all the rest Why should it
be given to you and not to the others Now if all like you lay on their
backs it would not be long before everybody in the world died of
starvation Brother youve got to labor This is disgraceful Do you hear
David

I hear you said the other slowly through his teeth

At this moment the window was darkened by the head of a peasant woman who
passed carrying some linen on a yoke and presently Davidkas mother came
into the hovel She was a tall woman fifty years old very fresh and
lively Her ugly face was covered with pockmarks and wrinkles but her
straight firm nose her delicate compressed lips and her keen gray eyes
gave witness to her mental strength and energy

The angularity of her shoulders the flatness of her chest the thinness of
her hands and the solid muscles of her black bare legs made it evident
that she had long ago ceased to be a woman and had become a mere drudge

She came hurrying into the hovel shut the door set down her linen and
looked angrily at her son

Nekhliudof was about to say something to her but she turned her back on
him and began to cross herself before the black wooden ikon that was
visible behind the loom

When she had thus done she adjusted the dirty checkered handkerchief which
was tied around her head and made a low obeisance to the prince

A pleasant Lords day to you excellency she said God spare you you
are our father

When Davidka saw his mother he grew confused bent his back a little and
hung his head still lower

Thanks Arna replied Nekhliudof I have just been talking with your
son about your affairs

Arna or Arshka Burlk as the peasants used to call her when she was
a girl rested her chin on the clinched fist of her right hand which she
supported with the palm of the left and without waiting for the prince to
speak further began to talk so sharply and loud that the whole hovel was
filled with the sound of her voice and from outside it might have been
concluded that several women had suddenly fallen into a discussion

Footnote  khozystvo

Footnote  clodhopper

What my father what is then to be said to him You cant talk to him as
to a man Here he stands the lout she continued contemptuously wagging
her head in the direction of Davidkas woebegone stolid form

How are my affairs your excellency We are poor In your whole village
there are none so bad off as we are either for our own work or for yours
Its a shame And its all his fault I bore him fed him gave him to
drink Didnt expect to have such a lubber There is but one end to the
story Grain is all gone and no more work to be got out of him than from
that piece of rotten wood All he knows is to lie on top of the oven or
else he stands here and scratches his empty pate she said mimicking
him

If you could only frighten him father I myself beseech you punish him
for the Lord Gods sake send him off as a soldierits all one But hes
no good to methats the way it is

Now arent you ashamed Davidka to bring your mother to this said
Nekhliudof reproachfully addressing the peasant

Davidka did not move

One might think that he was a sick peasant continued Arna with the
same eagerness and the same gestures but only to look at him you can see
hes fatter than the pig at the mill It would seem as if he might have
strength enough to work on something the lubber But no not he He
prefers to curl himself up on top of the oven And even when he undertakes
to do any thing it would make you sick even to look at him the way he
goes about the work He wastes time when he gets up when he moves when he
does any thing said she dwelling on the words and awkwardly swaying
from side to side with her angular shoulders

Now here today my old man himself went to the forest after wood and
told him to dig a hole but he did not even put his hand to the shovel

She paused for a moment

He has killed me she suddenly hissed gesticulating with her arms and
advancing toward her son with threatening gesture Curse your smooth bad
face

She scornfully and at the same time despairingly turned from him spat
and again addressed the prince with the same animation still swinging her
arms but with tears in her eyes

I am the only one benefactor My old man is sick old yes and I get no
help out of him and I am the only one at all And this fellow hangs around
my neck like a stone If he would only die then it would be easier that
would be the end of it He lets me starve the poltroon You are our
father Theres no help for me My daughterinlaw died of work and I
shall too


XI

How did she die inquired Nekhliudof somewhat sceptically

She died of hard work as God knows benefactor We brought her last year
from Baburin she continued suddenly changing her wrathful expression to
one of tearfulness and grief Well the woman was young fresh
obliging good stuff As a girl she lived at home with her father in
clover never knew want and when she came to us then she learned to do
our workfor the estate and at home and everywhere She and Ithat
was all to do it What was it to me I was used to it She was going to
have a baby good father and she began to suffer pain and all because she
worked beyond her strength Well she did herself harm the poor little
sweetheart Last summer about the time of the feast of Peter and Paul she
had a poor little boy born But there was no bread We ate whatever we
could get my father She went to work too soon her milk all dried up The
baby was her firstborn There was no cow and we were mere peasants She
had to feed him on rye Well of course it was sheer folly It kept pining
away on this And when the child died she became so downspiritedshe
would sob and sob and howl and howl and then it was poverty and work and
all the time going from bad to worse So she passed away in the summer
the sweetheart at the time of the feast of St Marys Intercession He
brought her to it the beast she cried turning to her son with wrathful
despair I wanted to ask your excellency a favor she continued after a
short pause lowering her voice and making an obeisance

Footnote  baba

What asked Nekhliudof in some constraint

You see hes a young peasant still He demands so much work of me Today
I am alive tomorrow I may die How can he live without a wife He wont
be any good to you at all Help us to find some one for him good father

That is you want to get a wife for him What What an idea

Gods will be done You are in the place of parents to us

And after making a sign to her son she and the man threw themselves on the
floor at the princes feet

Why do you stoop to the ground asked Nekhliudof peevishly taking her by
the shoulder You know I dont like this sort of thing Marry your son of
course if you have a girl in view I should be very glad if you had a
daughterinlaw to help you

The old woman got up and began to rub her dry eyes with her sleeves
Davidka followed her example and rubbing his eyes with his weak fist
with the same patientlysubmissive expression continued to stand and
listen to what Arna said

Plenty of brides certainly Heres Vasiutka Mikhekins daughter and a
right good girl she is but the girl would not come to us without your
consent

Isnt she willing

No benefactor she isnt

Well whats to be done I cant compel her Select some one else If you
cant find one at home go to another village I will pay for her only she
must come of her own free will It is impossible to marry her by force
Theres no law allows that that would be a great sin

Eekh benefactor Is it possible that any one would come to us of her
own accord seeing our way of life our wretchedness Not even the wife of
a soldier would like to undergo such want What peasant would let us have
his daughter It is not to be expected You see were in the very
depths of poverty They will say Since you starved one to death it will
be the same with my daughter Who is to give her she added shaking her
head dubiously Give us your advice excellency

Footnote  dyevka marriageable girl

Well what can I do

Think of some one for us kind sir repeated Arna urgently What are we
to do

How can I think of any one I cant do any thing at all for you as things
are

Who will help us if you do not said Arna drooping her head and
spreading her palms with an expression of melancholy discontent

Here you ask for grain and so I will give orders for some to be delivered
to you said the prince after a short silence during which Arna sighed
and Davidka imitated her But I cannot do any thing more

Nekhliudof went into the entry Mother and son with low bows followed the
prince


XII

Ookh alas for my wretchedness exclaimed Arna sighing deeply

She paused and looked angrily at her son Davidka immediately turned
around and clumsily lifting his stout leg incased in a huge dirty boot
over the threshold took refuge in the opposite door

What shall I do with him father continued Arna turning to the prince
You yourself see what he is He is not a bad man doesnt get drunk
and is peaceable wouldnt hurt a little child Its a sin to say hard
things of him Theres nothing bad about him and God knows what has taken
place in him to make him so bad to himself You see he himself does not
like it Would you believe it father my heart bleeds when I look at
him and see what suffering he undergoes You see whatever he is he is my
son I pity him Oh how I pity him You see it isnt as though he had
done any thing against me or his father or the authorities But no hes a
bashful man almost like a child How can he bear to be a widower Help us
out benefactor she said once more evidently desirous of removing the
unfavorable impression which her bitter words might have left upon the
prince Father your excellency IShe went on to say in a confidential
whisper My wit does not go far enough to explain him It seems as though
bad men had spoiled him

Footnote  muzhk

Footnote  btiushka

She paused for a moment

If we could find the men we might cure him

What nonsense you talk Arna How can he be spoiled

My father they spoil him so that they make him a noman forever Many bad
people in the world Out of illwill they take a handful of earth from out
of ones path or something of that sort and one is made a noman forever
after Isnt that a sin I think to myself Might I not go to the old man
Danduk who lives at Vorobyevka He knows all sorts of words and he knows
herbs and he can make charms and he finds water with a cross Wouldnt he
help me said the woman Maybe he will cure him

What abjectness and superstition thought the young prince shaking his
head gloomily and walking back with long strides through the village

Whats to be done with him To leave him in this situation is impossible
both for myself and for the others and for himimpossible he said to
himself counting off on his fingers these reasons

I cannot bear to see him in this plight but how extricate him He renders
nugatory all my best plans for the management of the estate If such
peasants are allowed none of my dreams will ever be realized he went on
experiencing a feeling of despite and anger against the peasant in
consequence of the ruin of his plans To send him to Siberia as Yakof
suggests against his will would that be good for him or to make him a
soldier That is best At least I should be quit of him and I could
replace him by a decent peasant

Such was his decision

He thought about this with satisfaction but at the same time something
obscurely told him that he was thinking with only one side of his mind and
not wholly right

He paused

I will think about it some more he said to himself To send him off as
a soldierwhy He is a good man better than many and I know Shall I
free him he asked himself putting the question from a different side of
his mind It wouldnt be fair Yes its impossible

But suddenly a thought occurred to him that greatly pleased him He smiled
with the expression of a man who has decided a difficult question

I will take him to the house he said to himself I will look after him
myself and by means of kindness and advice and selecting his employment
I will teach him to work and reform him


XIII

Thats the way Ill do said Nekhliudof to himself with a pleasant
selfconsciousness and then recollecting that he had still to go to the
rich peasant Dutlof he directed his steps toward a lofty and ample
establishment with two chimneys standing in the midst of the village

As he passed a neighboring hut on his way thither he stopped to speak with
a tall disorderlylooking peasantwoman of forty summers who came to meet
him

A pleasant holiday father she said with some show of assurance
stopping at a little distance from him with a pleased smile and a low
obeisance

Goodmorning my nurse How are you I was just going to see your
neighbor

Pretty well your excellency my father Its a good idea But wont you
come in I beg you to My old man would be very pleased

Well Ill come and well have a little talk with you nurse Is this
your house

It is sir

Footnote  btiushka

And the nurse led the way into the hut Nekhliudof followed her into the
entry and sat down on a tub and began to smoke a cigarette

Its hot inside Its better to sit down here and have our talk he said
in reply to the womans invitation to go into the hut

The nurse was a wellpreserved and handsome woman In the features of her
countenance and especially in her big black eyes there was a strong
resemblance to the prince himself She folded her hands under her apron
and looking fearlessly at him and incessantly moving her head began to
talk with him

Why is it father why do you wish to visit Dutlof

Oh I am anxious for him to take thirty desiatins of land of me and
enlarge his domain and moreover I want him to buy some wood from me also
You see he has money so why should it be idle What do you think about
it nurse

Footnote  eightyone acres

Well what can I say The Dutlofs are strong people hes the leading
peasant in the whole estate replied the nurse shaking her head Last
summer he built another building out of his own lumber He did not call
upon the estate at all He has horses and yearling colts besides at least
six trokas and cattle cows and sheep so that it is a sight worth
seeing when they are driven along the street from pasture and the women of
the house come out to get them into the yard There is such a crush of
animals at the gate that they can scarcely get through so many of them
there are And two hundred beehives at the very least He is a strong
peasant and must have money

But what do you thinkhas he much money asked the prince

Men say out of spite of course that the old man has no little money But
he does not go round talking about it and he does not tell even his sons
but he must have Why shouldnt he take hold of the woodland Perhaps he
is afraid of getting the reputation for money Five years ago he went into
a small business with Shkalik the porter They got some meadowland and
this Shkalik some way or other cheated him so that the old man was three
hundred rubles out of pocket And from that time he has sworn off How can
he help being forehanded your excellency father continued the nurse
He has three farms a big family all workers and besides the old
manit is hard to say itis a capital manager He is lucky in every
thing it is surprisingin his grain and in his horses and in his cattle
and in his bees and hes lucky in his children Now he has got them all
married off He has found husbands for his daughters and he has just
married Ilyushka and given him his freedom He himself bought the letter
of enfranchisement And so a fine woman has come into his house

Well do they live harmoniously asked the prince

As long as theres the right sort of a head to the house they get along
Yet even the Dutlofsbut of course thats among the women The
daughtersinlaw bark at each other a little behind the oven but the old
man generally holds them in hand and the sons live harmoniously

The nurse was silent for a little

Now the old man we hear wants to leave his eldest son Karp as master
of the house I am getting old says he Its my business to attend to
the bees Well Karp is a good peasant a careful peasant but he doesnt
manage to please the old man in the least Theres no sense in it

Well perhaps Karp wants to speculate in land and wood What do you think
about it pursued the prince wishing to learn from the woman all that
she knew about her neighbors

Scarcely sir continued the nurse The old man hasnt disclosed his
money to his son As long as he lives of course the money in the house
will be under the old mans control and it will increase all the time
too

Footnote  btiushka

But isnt the old man willing

He is afraid

What is he afraid of

How is it possible sir for a seignorial peasant to make a noise about
his money And its a hard question to decide what to do with money anyway
Here he went into business with the porter and was cheated Where was he
to get redress And so he lost his money But with the proprietor he would
have any loss made good immediately of course

Yes hence  said Nekhliudof reddening But goodby nurse

Goodby sir your excellency Greatly obliged to you


XIV

Hadnt I better go home mused Nekhliudof as he strode along toward the
Dutlof enclosure and felt a boundless melancholy and moral weariness

But at this moment the new deal gates were thrown open before him with a
creaking sound and a handsome ruddy fellow of eighteen in wagoners
attire appeared leading a troka of powerfullimbed and still sweaty
horses He hastily brushed back his blonde hair and bowed to the prince

Well is your father at home Ilya asked Nekhliudof

At the beehouse back of the yard replied the youth driving the
horses one after the other through the halfopened gates

I will not give it up I will make the proposal I will do the best I
can reflected Nekhliudof and after waiting till the horses had passed
out he entered Dutlofs spacious yard

It was plain to see that the manure had only recently been carried away
The ground was still black and damp and in places particularly in the
hollows were left red fibrous clots

In the yard and under the high sheds many carts stood in orderly rows
together with ploughs sledges harrows barrels and all sorts of farming
implements Doves were flitting about cooing in the shadows under the
broad solid rafters There was an odor of manure and tar

In one corner Karp and Ignt were fitting a new crossbar to a large
ironmounted threehorse cart

All three of Dutlofs sons bore a strong family resemblance The youngest
Ilya who had met Nekhliudof at the gate was beardless of smaller
stature ruddier complexion and more neatly dressed than the others The
second Ignt was rather taller and darker He had a wedgeshaped beard
and though he wore boots a drivers shirt and a lambsskin cap he had
not such a festive holiday appearance as his brother had

The eldest Karp was still taller He wore clogs a gray kaftan and a
shirt without gussets He had a reddish beard trimmed and his expression
was serious even to severity

Do you wish my father sent for your excellency he asked coming to meet
the prince and bowing slightly and awkwardly

No I will go to him at the hives I wish to see what hes building there
But I should like a talk with you said Nekhliudof drawing him to the
other side of the yard so that Ignt might not overhear what he was about
to talk about with Karp

The selfconfidence and degree of pride noticeable in the deportment of the
two peasants and what the nurse had told the young prince so troubled
him that it was difficult for him to make up his mind to speak with them
about the matter proposed

He had a sort of guilty feeling and it seemed to him easier to speak with
one brother out of the hearing of the other Karp seemed surprised that the
prince took him to one side but he followed him

Well now began Nekhliudof awkwardlyI wished to inquire of you if
you had many horses

We have about five trokas also some colts replied Karp in a
freeandeasy manner scratching his back

Well are your brothers going to take out relays of horses for the post

We shall send out three trokas to carry the mail And theres Ilyushka
he has been off with his team but hes just come back

Well is that profitable for you How much do you earn that way

What do you mean by profit your excellency We at least get enough to
live on and bait our horses thank God for that

Then why dont you take hold of something else You see you might buy
wood or take more land

Of course your excellency we might rent some land if there were any
convenient

I wish to make a proposition to you Since you only make enough out of
your teaming to live on you had better take thirty desiatins of land from
me All that strip behind Sapof I will let you have and you can carry on
your farming better

And Nekhliudof carried away by his plan for a peasant farm which more
than once he had proposed to himself and deliberated about began fluently
to explain to the peasant his proposition about it

Karp listened attentively to the princes words

We are very grateful for your kindness said he when Nekhliudof stopped
and looked at him in expectation of his answer Of course here theres
nothing very bad To occupy himself with farming is better for a peasant
than to go off as a whip He goes among strangers he sees all sorts of
men he gets wild Its the very best thing for a peasant to occupy
himself with land

You think so do you

As long as my father is alive how can I think your excellency Its as
he wills

Take me to the beehives I will talk with him

Come with me this way said Karp slowly directing himself to the barn
back of the house He opened a low gate which led to the apiary and after
letting the prince pass through he shut it and returned to Ignt and
silently took up his interrupted labors


XV

Nekhliudof stooping low passed through the low gate under the gloomy
shed to the apiary which was situated behind the yard

A small space surrounded by straw and a wattled hedge through the chinks
of which the light streamed was filled with beehives symmetrically
arranged and covered with shavings while the golden bees were humming
around them Every thing was bathed in the warm and brilliant rays of the
July sun

From the gate a welltrodden footway led through the middle to a wooden
sidebuilding with a tinfoil image on it gleaming brightly in the sun

A few orderly young lindens lifting above the thatched roof of the
neighboring courtyard their bushy tops almost audibly rustled their
darkgreen fresh foliage in unison with the sound of the buzzing bees
All the shadows from the covered hedge from the lindens and from the
hives fell dark and short on the delicate curling grass springing up
between the planks

The bent small figure of the old man with his gray hair and bald spot
shining in the sun was visible near the door of a strawthatched structure
situated among the lindens When he heard the creaking of the gate the old
man looked up and wiping his heated sweaty face with the flap of his
shirt and smiling with pleasure came to meet the prince

In the apiary it was so comfortable so pleasant so warm so free The
figure of the grayhaired old man with thick wrinkles radiating from his
eyes and wearing wide shoes on his bare feet as he came waddling along
goodnaturedly and contentedly smiling to welcome the prince to his own
private possessions was so ingenuously soothing that Nekhliudof for a
moment forgot the trying impressions of the morning and his cherished
dream came vividly up before him He already saw all his peasants just as
prosperous and contented as the old man Dutlof and all smiling soothingly
and pleasantly upon him because to him alone they were indebted for their
prosperity and happiness

Would you like a net your excellency The bees are angry now said the
old man taking down from the fence a dirty gingham bag fragrant of honey
and handing it to the prince The bees know me and dont sting he
added with the pleasant smile that rarely left his handsome sunburned
face

I dont need it either Well are they swarming yet asked Nekhliudof
also smiling though without knowing why

Yes they are swarming father Mitri Mikolayvitch replied the old
man throwing an expression of peculiar endearment into this form of
addressing his brin by his name and patronymic They have only just begun
to swarm it has been a cold spring you know

Footnote  btiushka Mitri Mikolayvitch rustic for Dmitri
Nikolayvitch

I have just been reading in a book began Nekhliudof defending himself
from a bee which had got entangled in his hair and was buzzing under his
ear that if the wax stands straight on the bars then the bees swarm
earlier Therefore such hives as are made of boards  with crossb

You dont want to gesticulate that makes it worse said the little old
man Now dont you think you had better put on the net

Nekhliudof felt a sharp pain but by some sort of childish egotism he did
not wish to give in to it and so once more refusing the bag continued to
talk with the old man about the construction of hives about which he had
read in Maison Rustique and which according to his idea ought to be
made twice as large But another bee stung him in the neck and he lost the
thread of his discourse and stopped short in the midst of it

Thats well enough father Mitri Mikolayvitch said the old man
looking at the prince with paternal protection thats well enough in
books as you say Yes maybe the advice is given with some deceit with
some hidden meaning but only just let him do as he advises and we shall
be the first to have a good laugh at his expense And this happens How are
you going to teach the bees where to deposit their wax They themselves put
it on the crossbar sometimes straight and sometimes aslant Just look
here he continued opening one of the nearest hives and gazing at the
entrancehole blocked by a bee buzzing and crawling on the crooked comb
Heres a young one It sees at its head sits the queen but it lays the
wax straight and sideways both according to the position of the block
said the old man evidently carried away by his interest in his occupation
and not heeding the princes situation Now today it will fly with the
pollen Today is warm its on the watch he continued again covering up
the hive and pinning down with a cloth the crawling bee and then brushing
off into his rough palm a few of the insects from his wrinkled neck

The bees did not sting him but as for Nekhliudof he could scarcely
refrain from the desire to beat a retreat from the apiary The bees had
already stung him in three places and were buzzing angrily on all sides
around his head and neck

You have many hives he asked as he retreated toward the gate

What God has given replied Dutlof sarcastically It is not necessary to
count them father the bees dont like it Now your excellency I wanted
to ask a favor of you he went on to say pointing to the small posts
standing by the fence It was about Osip the nurses husband If you
would only speak to him In our village its so hard to act in a neighborly
way its not good

How so Ah how they sting exclaimed the prince already seizing the
latch of the gate

Every year now he lets his bees out among my young ones We could stand
it but strange bees get away their comb and kill them said the old man
not heeding the princes grimaces

Very well by and by right away said Nekhliudof And having no longer
strength of will to endure he hastily beat a retreat through the gate
fighting his tormentors with both hands

Rub it with dirt Its nothing said the old man coming to the door
after the prince The prince took some earth and rubbed the spot where he
had been stung and reddened as he cast a quick glance at Karp and Ignt
who did not deign to look at him Then he frowned angrily


XVI

I wanted to ask you something about my sons your excellency said the
old man either pretending not to notice or really not noticing the
princes angry face

What

Well we are well provided with horses praise the Lord and thats our
trade and so we dont have to work on your land

What do you mean

If you would only be kind enough to let my sons have leave of absence
then Ilyushka and Ignt would take three trokas and go out teaming for
all summer Maybe theyd earn something

Where would they go

Just as it happened replied Ilyushka who at this moment having put the
horses under the shed joined his father The Kadminski boys went with
eight horses to Romen Not only earned their own living they say but
brought back a gain of more than three hundred per cent Fodder they say
is cheap at Odest

Well thats the very thing I wanted to talk with you about said the
prince addressing the old man and anxious to draw him shrewdly into a
talk about the farm Tell me please if it would be more profitable to go
to teaming than farming at home

Why not more profitable your excellency said Ilyushka again putting in
his word and at the same time quickly shaking back his hair Theres no
way of keeping horses at home

Well how much do you earn in the summer

Since spring as feed was high we went to Kief with merchandise and to
Kursk and back again to Moscow with grits and in that way we earned our
living And our horses had enough and we brought back fifteen rubles in
money

Theres no harm in taking up with an honorable profession whatever it
is said the prince again addressing the old man But it seems to me
that you might find another form of activity And besides this work is
such that a young man goes everywhere He sees all sorts of peoplemay
get wild he added quoting Karps words

What can we peasants take up with if not teaming objected the old man
with his sweet smile If you are a good driver you get enough to eat and
so do your horses but as regards mischief they are just the same as at
home thank the Lord It isnt the first time that they have been I have
been myself and never saw any harm in it nothing but good

How many other things you might find to do at home with fields and
meadows

How is it possible interrupted Ilyushka with animation We were born
for this All the regulations are at our fingers ends We like the work
Its the most enjoyable we have your excellency How we like to go
teaming

Your excellency will you not do us the honor of coming into the house
You have not yet seen our new domicile said the old man bowing low and
winking to his son

Ilyushka hastened into the house and Nekhliudof and the old man followed
after him


XVII

As soon as he got into the house the old man bowed once more then using
his coattail to dust the bench in the front of the room he smiled and
said

What do you want of us your excellency

The hut was bright and roomy with a chimney and it had a loft and berths
The fresh aspenwood beams between which could be seen the moss scarcely
faded were as yet not turned dark The new benches and the loft were not
polished smooth and the floor was not worn One young peasant woman
rather lean with a serious oval face was sitting on a berth and using
her foot to rock a hanging cradle that was suspended from the ceiling by a
long hook This was Ilyas wife

In the cradle lay at full length a suckling child scarcely breathing and
with closed eyes

Another young woman robust and rosycheeked with her sleeves rolled up
above her elbows showing strong arms and hands red even higher than her
wrists was standing in front of the oven and mincing onions in a wooden
dish This was Karps wife

A pockmarked woman showing signs of pregnancy which she tried to
conceal was standing near the oven The room was hot not only from the
summer sun but from the heat of the oven and there was a strong smell of
baking bread

Two flaxenheaded little boys and a girl gazed down from the loft upon the
prince with faces full of curiosity They had come in expecting something
to eat

Nekhliudof was delighted to see this happy household and at the same time
he felt a sense of constraint in presence of these peasants men and women
all looking at him He flushed a little as he sat down on the bench

Give me a crust of hot bread I am fond of it said he and the flush
deepened

Karps wife cut off a huge slice of bread and handed it on a plate to the
prince Nekhliudof said nothing not knowing what to say The women also
were silent the old man smiled benevolently

Well now why am I so awkward as though I were to blame for something
thought Nekhliudof Why shouldnt I make my proposition about the farm
What stupidity Still he remained silent

Well father Mitri Mikolayvitch what are you going to say about my boys
proposal asked the old man

I should advise you absolutely not to send them away but to have them
stay at home and work said Nekhliudof suddenly collecting his wits
You know what I have proposed to you Go in with me and buy some of the
crown woods and some more land

But how are we going to get money to buy it your excellency he asked
interrupting the prince

Why it isnt very much wood only two hundred rubles worth replied
Nekhliudof

The old man gave an indignant laugh

Very good if thats all Why not buy it said he

Havent you money enough asked the prince reproachfully

Okh Sir your excellency replied the old man with grief expressed in
his tone looking apprehensively toward the door Only enough to feed my
family not enough to buy woodland

But you know you have moneywhat do you do with it insisted
Nekhliudof

The old man suddenly fell into a terrible state of excitement his eyes
flashed his shoulders began to twitch

Wicked men may say all sorts of things about me he muttered in a
trembling voice But so may God be my witness he said growing more and
more animated and turning his eyes toward the ikon may my eyes crack
may I perish with all my family if I have any thing more than the fifteen
silver rubles which Ilyushka brought home and we have to pay the polltax
you yourself know that And we built the hut

Well well all right said the prince rising from the bench Goodby
friends

My God my God was Nekhliudofs mental exclamation as with long strides
he hastened home through the shady alleys of his weedgrown garden and
absentmindedly snapped off the leaves and branches which fell in his way

Is it possible that my dreams about the ends and duties of my life are all
idle nonsense Why is it hard for me and mournful as though I were
dissatisfied with myself because I imagined that having once begun this
course I should constantly experience the fulness of the morally pleasant
feeling which I had when for the first time these thoughts came to me

And with extraordinary vividness and distinctness he saw in his imagination
that happy moment which he had experienced a year before

He had arisen very early before every one else in the house and feeling
painfully those secret indescribable impulses of youth he had gone
aimlessly out into the garden and from there into the woods and amid the
energetic but tranquil nature pulsing with the new life of Maytime he had
wandered long alone without thought and suffering from the exuberance of
some feeling and not finding any expression for it

Then with all the allurement of what is unknown his youthful imagination
brought up before him the voluptuous form of a woman and it seemed to him
that was the object of his indescribable longing But another deeper
sentiment said Not that and impelled him to search and be disturbed in
mind

Without thought or desire as always happens after extra activity he lay
on his back under a tree and looked at the diaphanous morningclouds
drifting over him across the deep endless sky

Suddenly without any reason the tears sprang to his eyes and God knows
in what way the thought came to him with perfect clearness filling all his
soul and giving him intense delightthe thought that love and
righteousness are the same as truth and enjoyment and that there is only
one truth and only one possible happiness in the world

The deeper feeling this time did not say Not that He sat up and began
to verify this thought

That is it that is it said he to himself in a sort of ecstasy
measuring all his former convictions all the phenomena of his life by the
truth just discovered to him and as it seemed to him absolutely new

What stupidity All that I knew all that I believed in all that I
loved he had said to himself Love is selfdenying this is the only
true happiness independent of chance he had said over and over again
smiling and waving his hands

Applying this thought on every side to life and finding in it confirmation
both of life and that inner voice which told him that this was it he had
experienced a new feeling of pleasant agitation and enthusiasm

And so I ought to do good if I would be happy he thought and all his
future vividly came up before him not as an abstraction but in images in
the form of the life of a proprietor

He saw before him a huge field conterminous with his whole life which he
was to consecrate to the good and in which really he should find
happiness There was no need for him to search for a sphere of activity it
was all ready He had one outandout obligation he had his serfs

And what comfortable and beneficent labor lay before him To work for this
simple impressionable incorruptible class of people to lift them from
poverty to give them pleasure to give them education which fortunately
I will turn to use in correcting their faults which arise from ignorance
and superstition to develop their morals to induce them to love the
right What a brilliant happy future And besides all this I who am
going to do this for my own happiness shall take delight in their
appreciation shall see how every day I shall go farther and farther toward
my predestined end A wonderful future Why could I not have seen this
before

And besides so he had thought at the same time who will hinder me from
being happy in love for a woman in enjoyment of family

And his youthful imagination portrayed before him a still more bewitching
future

I and my wife whom I shall love as no one ever loved a wife before in the
world we shall always live amid this restful poetical rural nature with
our children maybe and with my old aunt We have our love for each other
our love for our children and we shall both know that our aim is the
right We shall help each other in pressing on to this goal I shall make
general arrangements I shall give general aid when it is right I shall
carry on the farm the savings bank the workshop And she with her dear
little head and dressed in a simple white dress which she lifts above
her dainty ankle as she steps through the mud will go to the peasants
school to the hospital to some unfortunate peasant who in truth does not
deserve help and everywhere carry comfort and aid Children old men
women will wait for her and look on her as on some angel as on
Providence Then she will return and hide from me the fact that she has
been to see the unfortunate peasant and given him money but I shall know
all and give her a hearty hug and rain kisses thick and fast on her
lovely eyes her modestlyblushing cheeks and her smiling rosy lips


XIX

Where are those dreams the young man now asked himself as he walked home
after his round of visits Here more than a year has passed since I have
been seeking for happiness in this course and what have I found It is
true I sometimes feel that I can be contented with myself but this is a
dry doubtful kind of content Yet no I am simply dissatisfied I am
dissatisfied because I find no happiness here and I desire I passionately
long for happiness I have not experienced delight I have cut myself off
from all that gives it Wherefore for what end Does that make it easier
for any one

My aunt was right when she wrote that it is easier to find happiness than
to give it to others Have my peasants become any richer Have they learned
any thing or have they shown any moral improvement Not the least They
are no better off but it grows harder and harder every day for me If I
saw any success in my undertakings if I saw any signs of gratitude 
but no I see falsely directed routine vice untruthfulness
helplessness I am wasting the best years of my life

Thus he said to himself and he recollected that his neighbors as he heard
from his nurse called him a mere boy that he had no money left in the
countingroom that his new threshingmachine which he had invented much
to the amusement of the peasants only made a noise and did not thresh
any thing when it had been set in motion for the first time in presence of
numerous spectators who had gathered at the threshingfloor that from day
to day he had to expect the coming of the district judge for the list of
goods and chattels which he had neglected to make out having been
engrossed in various new enterprises on his estate

And suddenly there arose before him just as vividly as before that walk
through the forest and his ideal of rural life had arisenjust as vividly
there appeared his little university room at Moscow where he used to sit
half the night before a solitary candle with his chum and his favorite boy
friend

They used to read for five hours on a stretch and study such stupid
lessons in civil law and when they were done with them they would send
for supper open a bottle of champagne and talk about the future which
awaited them

How entirely different the young student had thought the future would be
Then the future was full of enjoyment of varied occupation brilliant with
success and beyond a peradventure sure to bring them both to what seemed
to them the greatest blessing in the worldto fame

He will go on and go on rapidly in that path thought Nekhliudof of his
friend but I

But by this time he was already mounting the steps to his house and near
it were standing a score of peasants and houseservants waiting with
various requests to the prince And this brought him back from dreams to
the reality

Among the crowd was a ragged and bloodstained peasantwoman who was
lamenting and complaining of her fatherinlaw who had been beating her
There were two brothers who for two years past had been going on shares in
their domestic arrangements and now looked at each other with hatred and
despair There was also an unshaven grayhaired domestic serf with hands
trembling from the effects of intoxication and this man was brought to the
prince by his son a gardener who complained of his disorderly conduct
There was a peasant who had driven his wife out of the house because she
had not worked any all the spring There was also the wife a sick woman
who sobbed but said nothing as she sat on the grass by the stepsonly
showed her inflamed and swollen leg carelessly wrapped up in a filthy rag

Nekhliudof listened to all the petitions and complaints and after he had
given advice to one blamed others and replied to still others he began
to feel a sort of whimsical sensation of weariness shame weakness and
regret And he went to his room


XX

In the small room occupied by Nekhliudof stood an old leather sofa
decorated with copper nails a few chairs of the same description an
oldfashioned inlaid extensiontable with scallops and brass mountings and
strewn with papers and an oldfashioned English grand with narrow keys
broken and twisted

Between the windows hung a large mirror with an old carved frame gilded On
the floor near the table lay packages of papers books and accounts

This room on the whole had a characterless and disorderly appearance and
this lively disorder presented a sharp contrast with the affectedly
aristocratic arrangement of the other rooms of the great mansion

When Nekhliudof reached his room he flung his hat angrily on the table
and sat down in a chair which stood near the piano crossed his legs and
shook his head

Will you have lunch your excellency asked a tall thin wrinkled old
woman who entered just at this instant dressed in a cap a great
kerchief and a print dress

Nekhliudof looked at her for a moment or two in silence as though
collecting his thoughts

No I dont wish any thing nurse said he and again fell into thought

The nurse shook her head at him in some vexation and sighed

Eh Father Dmitri Nikolayvitch are you melancholy Such tribulation
comes but it will pass away God knows

I am not melancholy What have you brought Malanya Finogenovna replied
Nekhliudof endeavoring to smile

Aint melancholy cant I see the old woman began to say with warmth
The whole livelong day to be all sole alone And you take every thing to
heart so and look out for every thing and besides you scarcely eat any
thing Whats the reason of it If youd only go to the city or visit your
neighbors as others do You are young and the idea of bothering over
things so Pardon me little father I will sit down pursued the old
nurse taking a seat near the door You see we have got into such a habit
that we lose fear Is that the way gentlemen do Theres no good in it You
are only ruining yourself and the people are spoiled Thats just like our
people they dont understand it thats a fact You had better go to your
auntie What she wrote was good sense said the old nurse admonishing
him

Nekhliudof kept growing more and more dejected His right hand resting on
his knee lazily struck the piano making a chord a second a third

Nekhliudof moved nearer drew his other hand from his pocket and began to
play The chords which he made were sometimes not premeditated were
occasionally not even according to rule often remarkable for absurdity
and showed that he was lacking in musical talent but the exercise gave him
a certain indefinable melancholy enjoyment

At every modification in the harmony he waited with muffled heartbeat for
what would come out of it and when any thing came he in a dark sort of
way completed with his imagination what was missing

It seemed to him that he heard a hundred melodies and a chorus and an
orchestra simultaneously joining in with his harmony But his chief
pleasure was in the powerful activity of his imagination confused and
broken but bringing up with striking clearness before him the most varied
mixed and absurd images and pictures from the past and the future

Now it presents the puffy figure of Davidka Bylui timidly blinking his
white eyelashes at the sight of his mothers black fist with its network
of veins his bent back and huge hands covered with white hairs
exhibiting a uniform patience and submission to fate sufficient to
overcome torture and deprivation

Then he saw the brisk presuming nurse and somehow seemed to picture her
going through the villages and announcing to the peasants that they ought
to hide their money from the proprietors and he unconsciously said to
himself Yes it is necessary to hide money from the proprietors

Then suddenly there came up before him the fair head of his future wife
for some reason weeping and leaning on his shoulder in deep grief

Then he seemed to see Churiss kindly blue eyes looking affectionately at
his potbellied little son Yes he saw in him a helper and savior apart
from his son That is love he whispered

Then he remembered Yukhvankas mother remembered the expression of
patience and conciliation which notwithstanding her prominent teeth and
her irregular features he recognized on her aged face

It must be that I have been the first during her seventy years of life to
recognize her good qualities he said to himself and whispered
Strange but he continued still to drum on the piano and to listen to
the sounds

Then he vividly recalled his retreat from the bees and the expressions on
the faces of Karp and Ignt who evidently wanted to laugh though they made
believe not look at him He reddened and involuntarily glanced at the old
nurse who still remained sitting by the door looking at him with silent
attention occasionally shaking her gray head

Here suddenly he seemed to see a troka of sleek horses and Ilyushkas
handsome robust form with bright curls gayly shining narrow blue eyes
fresh complexion and delicate down just beginning to appear on lip and
chin

He remembered how Ilyushka was afraid that he would not be permitted to go
teaming and how eagerly he argued in favor of the work that he liked so
well And he saw the gray early morning that began with mist and the
smooth paved road and the long lines of threehorse wagons heavily laden
and protected by mats and marked with big black letters The stout
contented wellfed horses thundering along with their bells arching
their backs and tugging on the traces pulled in unison up the hill
forcefully straining on their longnailed shoes over the smooth road

As the train of wagons reached the foot of the hill the postman had
quickly dashed by with jingling bells which were echoed far and wide by
the great forest extending along on both sides of the road

Aaa in a loud boyish voice shouts the head driver who has a
badge on his lambskin cap and swings his whip around his head

Beside the front wheel of the front team the redheaded crosslooking
Karp is walking heavily in huge boots In the second team Ilyushka shows
his handsome head as he sits on the drivers seat playing the bugle Three
trokawagons loaded with boxes with creaking wheels with the sound of
bells and shouts file by Ilyushka once more hides his handsome face under
the matting and falls off to sleep

Now it is a fresh clear evening The deal gates open for the weary horses
as they halt in front of the tavern yard and one after the other the high
matcovered teams roll in across the planks that lie at the gates and come
to rest under the wide sheds

Ilyushka gayly exchanges greetings with the lightcomplexioned
widebosomed landlady who asks Have you come far and will there be many
of you to supper and at the same time looks with pleasure on the handsome
lad with her bright kindly eyes

And now having unharnessed the horses he goes into the warm house
crowded with people crosses himself sits down at the generous wooden
bowl and enters into lively conversation with the landlady and his
companions

Footnote  izb

And then he goes to bed in the open air under the stars which gleam down
into the shed His bed is fragrant hay and he is near the horses which
stamping and snorting eat their fodder in the wooden cribs He goes to the
shed turns toward the east and after crossing himself thirty times in
succession on his broad brawny chest and throwing back his bright curls
he repeats Our Father and Lord have mercy a score of times and
wrapping himself head and all in his cloak sleeps the healthy dreamless
sleep of strong fresh manhood

And here he sees in his vision the city of Kief with its saints and
throngs of priests Romen with its merchants and merchandise he sees
Odest and the distant blue sea studded with white sails and the city of
Tsargrad with its golden palaces and the whitebreasted darkbrowed
Turkish maidens and thither he flies lifting himself on invisible wings

Footnote  Constantinople

He flies freely and easily always farther and farther away and sees below
him golden cities bathed in clear effulgence and the blue sky with bright
stars and a blue sea with white sails and smoothly and pleasantly he
flies always farther and farther away

Splendid whispers Nekhliudof to himself and the thought Why am I not
Ilyushka comes to him




LUCERNE

FROM THE RECOLLECTIONS OF PRINCE NEKHLIUDOF


JULY 

Yesterday evening I arrived at Lucerne and put up at the best inn there
the Schweitzerhof

Lucerne the chief city of the canton situated on the shore of the
Vierwaldsttter See says Murray is one of the most romantic places of
Switzerland here cross three important highways and it is only an hours
distance by steamboat to Mount Righi from which is obtained one of the
most magnificent views in the world

Whether that be true or no other Guides say the same thing and
consequently at Lucerne there are throngs of travellers of all
nationalities especially the English

The magnificent fivestoried building of the Hotel Schweitzerhof is
situated on the quay at the very edge of the lake where in olden times
there used to be the crooked covered wooden bridge with chapels on the
corners and pictures on the roof Now thanks to the tremendous inroad of
Englishmen with their necessities their tastes and their money the old
bridge has been torn down and in its place has been erected a granite
quay straight as a stick On the quay are built the long quadrangular
fivestoried houses in front of the houses two rows of lindens have been
set out and provided with supports and between the lindens are the usual
supply of green benches

Footnote  Hofbrcke torn down in 

This is the promenade and here back and forth stroll the Englishwomen in
their Swiss straw hats and the Englishmen in simple and comfortable
attire and rejoice in that which they have caused to be created Possibly
these quays and houses and lindens and Englishmen would be excellent in
their way anywhere else but here they seem discordant amid this strangely
grandiose and at the same time indescribably harmonious and smiling nature

As soon as I went up to my room and opened the window facing the lake the
beauty of the sheet of water of these mountains and of this sky at the
first moment literally dazzled and overwhelmed me I experienced an inward
unrest and the necessity of expressing in some manner the feelings that
suddenly filled my soul to overflowing I felt a desire to embrace
powerfully to embrace some one to tickle him or to pinch him in short
to do to him and to myself something extraordinary

It was seven oclock in the evening The rain had been falling all day but
now it had cleared off

The lake blue as heated sulphur spread out before my windows smooth and
motionless like a concave mirror between the variegated green shores its
surface was dotted with boats which left behind them vanishing trails
Farther away it was contracted between two monstrous headlands and
darkling set itself against and disappeared behind a confused pile of
mountains clouds and glaciers In the foreground stretched a panorama of
moist fresh green shores with reeds meadows gardens and villas
Farther away the darkgreen wooded heights crowned with the ruins of
feudal castles in the background the rolling palelilaccolored vista of
mountains with fantastic peaks built up of crags and dead white mounds of
snow And every thing was bathed in a fresh transparent atmosphere of
azure blue and kindled by the warm rays of the setting sun bursting forth
through the riven skies

Not on the lake nor on the mountains nor in the skies was there a single
completed line a single unmixed color a single moment of repose
everywhere motion irregularity fantasy endless conglomeration and
variety of shades and lines and above all a calm a softness a unity
and a striving for the beautiful

And here amid this indefinable confused unfettered beauty before my very
window stretched in stupid kaleidoscopic confusion the white line of the
quay the lindens with their supports and the green seatsmiserable
tasteless creations of human ingenuity not subordinated like the distant
villas and ruins to the general harmony of the beautiful scene but on the
contrary brutally contradicting it Constantly though against my will
my eyes were attracted to that horribly straight line of the quay and
mentally I should have liked to spurn it to demolish it like a black spot
disfiguring the nose beneath ones eye

But the quay with the sauntering Englishmen remained where it was and I
involuntarily tried to find a point of view where it would be out of my
sight I succeeded in finding such a view and till dinner was ready I took
delight alone by myself in this incomplete and therefore the more
enjoyable feeling of oppression that one experiences in the solitary
contemplation of natural beauty

About halfpast seven I was called to dinner Two long tables
accommodating at least a hundred persons were spread in the great
magnificently decorated diningroom on the first floor The silent
gathering of the guests lasted three minutesthe froufrou of womens
dresses the soft steps the softlyspoken words addressed to the courtly
and elegant waiters And all the places were occupied by ladies and
gentlemen dressed elegantly even richly and for the most part in perfect
taste

As is apt to be the case in Switzerland the majority of the guests were
English and this gave the ruling characteristics of the common table that
is a strict decorum regarded as an obligation a reserve founded not in
pride but in the absence of any necessity for social relationship and
finally a uniform sense of satisfaction felt by each in the comfortable and
agreeable gratification of his wants

On all sides gleamed the whitest laces the whitest collars the whitest
teethnatural and artificialthe whitest complexions and hands But the
faces many of which were very handsome bore the expression merely of
individual prosperity and absolute absence of interest in all that
surrounded them unless it bore directly on their own individual selves and
the white hands glittering with rings or protected by mitts moved only
for the purpose of straightening collars cutting meat or filling
wineglasses no soulfelt emotion was betrayed in these actions

Occasionally members of some one family would exchange remarks in subdued
voices about the excellence of such and such a dish or wine or about the
beauty of the view from Mount Righi

Individual tourists whether men or women sat alongside of each other in
silence and did not even seem to see each other If it happened
occasionally that out of this fivescore human beings two spoke to each
other the topic of their conversation consisted uniformly in the weather
or the ascent of the Righi

Knives and forks scarcely rattled on the plates so perfect was the
observance of propriety and no one dared to convey pease and vegetables to
the mouth otherwise than on the fork The waiters involuntarily subdued by
the universal silence asked in a whisper what wine you would be pleased to
order

Such dinners invariably depress me I dislike them and before they are
over I become blue It always seems to me as if I were in some way to
blame just as when I was a boy I was set upon a chair in consequence of
some naughtiness and bidden ironically Now rest a little while my dear
young fellow And all the time my young blood was pulsing through my
veins and in the other room I could hear the merry shouts of my brothers

I used to try to rebel against this feeling of being choked down which I
experienced at such dinners but in vain All these deadandalive faces
have an irresistible ascendency over me and I myself become also as one
dead I have no desires I have no thoughts I do not even observe

At first I attempted to enter into conversation with my neighbors but I
got no response beyond the phrases which had been repeated in that place a
hundred times a thousand times with absolutely no variation of
countenance

And yet these people were by no means all stupid and feelingless but
evidently many of them though they seemed so dead had got into the habit
of leading selfcentred lives which in reality were far more complicated
and interesting than my own Why then should they deprive themselves of
one of the greatest enjoyments of lifethe enjoyment that comes from the
intercourse of man with man

How different it used to be in our pension at Paris where twenty of us
belonging to as many different nationalities professions and
individualities met together at a common table and under the influence
of the Gallic sociability found the keenest zest

There from the very moment that we sat down from one end of the table to
the other was general conversation sandwiched with witticisms and puns
though often in a broken speech There every one without being solicitous
for the proprieties said whatever came into his head There we had our own
philosopher our own disputant our own bel esprit our own buttall
common property

There immediately after dinner we would move the table to one side and
without paying too much attention to rhythm take to dancing the polka on
the dusty carpet and often keep it up till evening There though we were
rather flirtatious and not overwise but perfectly respectable still we
were human beings

And the Spanish countess with romantic proclivities and the Italian
abbate who insisted on declaiming from the Divine Comedy after dinner
and the American doctor who had the entre into the Tuileries and the
young dramatic author with long hair and the pianist who according to her
own account had composed the best polka in existence and the unhappy
widow who was a beauty and wore three rings on every fingerall of us
enjoyed this society which though somewhat superficial was human and
pleasant And we each carried away from it hearty recollections of each
other perhaps lighter in some cases and more serious in others

But at these English tabledhte dinners as I look at all these laces
ribbons jewels pomaded locks and silken dresses I often think how many
living women would be happy and would make others happy with these
adornments

Strange to think how many friends and loversmost fortunate friends and
loversare sitting here side by side without perhaps knowing it And
God knows why they never come to this knowledge and never give each other
this happiness which they might so easily give and which they so long
for

I began to feel blue as invariably happens after such a dinner and
without waiting for dessert I sallied out in the same frame of mind for a
constitutional through the city My melancholy frame of mind was not
relieved but rather confirmed by the narrow muddy streets without
lanterns the shuttered shops the encounters with drunken workmen and
with women hastening after water or in bonnets glancing around them as
they turned the corners

It was perfectly dark in the streets when I returned to the hotel without
casting a glance about me or having an idea in my head I hoped that sleep
would put an end to my melancholy I experienced that peculiar spiritual
chill and loneliness and heaviness which without any reason beset those
who are just arrived in any new place

Looking steadfastly down I walked along the quay to the Schweitzerhof
when suddenly my ear was struck by the strains of a peculiar but thoroughly
agreeable and sweet music

These strains had an immediately enlivening effect upon me It was as
though a bright cheerful light had poured into my soul I felt contented
gay My slumbering attention was awakened again to all surrounding objects
and the beauty of the night and the lake to which till then I had been
indifferent suddenly came over me with quickening force like a novelty

I involuntarily took in at a glance the dark sky with gray clouds flecking
its deep blue now lighted by the rising moon the glassy darkgreen lake
with its surface reflecting the lighted windows and far away the snowy
mountains and I heard the croaking of the frogs over on the Freshenburg
shore and the dewy fresh call of the quail

Directly in front of me in the spot whence the sounds of music had first
come and which still especially attracted my attention I saw amid the
semidarkness on the street a throng of people standing in a semicircle
and in front of the crowd at a little distance a small man in dark
clothes

Behind the throng and the man there stood out harmoniously against the
dark ragged sky gray and blue the black tops of a few Lombardy poplars
in some garden and rising majestically on high the two stern spires that
stand on the towers of the ancient cathedral

I drew nearer and the strains became more distinct At some distance I
could clearly distinguish the full accords of a guitar sweetly swelling in
the evening air and several voices which while taking turns with each
other did not sing any definite theme but gave suggestions of one in
places wherever the melody was most pronounced

The theme was in somewhat the nature of a mazurka sweet and graceful The
voices sounded now near at hand now far distant now a bass was heard now
a tenor now a falsetto such as the Tyrolese warblers are wont to sing

It was not a song but the graceful masterly sketch of a song I could not
comprehend what it was but it was beautiful

Those voluptuous soft chords of the guitar that sweet gentle melody and
that solitary figure of the man in black amid the fantastic environment of
the lake the gleaming moon and the twin spires of the cathedral rising in
majestic silence and the black tops of the poplarsall was strange and
perfectly beautiful or at least seemed so to me

All the confused arbitrary impressions of life suddenly became full of
meaning and beauty It seemed to me as though a fresh fragrant flower had
sprung up in my soul In place of the weariness dulness and indifference
toward every thing in the world which I had been feeling the moment
before I experienced a necessity for love a fulness of hope and an
unbounded enjoyment of life

What dost thou desire what dost thou long for an inner voice seemed to
say Here it is Thou art surrounded on all sides by beauty and poetry
Breathe it in in full deep draughts as long as thou hast strength Enjoy
it to the full extent of thy capacity Tis all thine all blessed

I drew nearer The little man was as it seemed a travelling Tyrolese He
stood before the windows of the hotel one leg a little advanced his head
thrown back and as he thrummed on the guitar he sang his graceful song
in all those different voices

I immediately felt an affection for this man and a gratefulness for the
change which he had brought about in me

The singer so far as I was able to judge was dressed in an old black
coat He had short black hair and he wore a civilians hat that was no
longer new There was nothing artistic in his attire but his clever and
youthfully gay motions and pose together with his diminutive stature
formed a pleasing and at the same time pathetic spectacle

On the steps in the windows and on the balconies of the brilliantly
lighted hotel stood ladies handsomely decorated and attired gentlemen
with polished collars porters and lackeys in goldembroidered liveries in
the street in the semicircle of the crowd and farther along on the
sidewalk among the lindens were gathered groups of welldressed waiters
cooks in white caps and aprons and young girls wandering about with arms
about each others waists

All it seemed were under the influence of the same feeling that I myself
experienced All stood in silence around the singer and listened
attentively Silence reigned except in the pauses of the song when there
came from far away across the waters the regular click of a hammer and
from the Freshenburg shore rang in fascinating monotone the voices of the
frogs interrupted by the mellow monotonous call of the quail

The little man in the darkness in the midst of the street poured out his
heart like a nightingale in couplet after couplet song after song Though
I had come close to him his singing continued to give me greater and
greater gratification

His voice which was not of great power was extremely pleasant and tender
the taste and feeling for rhythm which he displayed in the control of it
were extraordinary and proved that he had great natural gifts

After he sung each couplet he invariably repeated the theme in variation
and it was evident that all his graceful variations came to him at the
instant spontaneously

Among the crowd and above on the Schweitzerhof and near by on the
boulevard were heard frequent murmurs of approval though generally the
most respectful silence reigned

The balconies and the windows kept filling more and more with handsomely
dressed men and women leaning on their elbows and picturesquely
illuminated by the lights in the house

Promenaders came to a halt and in the darkness on the quay stood men and
women in little groups Near me at some distance from the common crowd
stood an aristocratic cook and lackey smoking their cigars The cook was
forcibly impressed by the music and at every high falsetto note
enthusiastically nodded his head to the lackey and nudged him with his
elbow with an expression of astonishment that seemed to say How he sings
hey

The lackey whose careless smile betrayed the depth of feeling that he
experienced replied to the cooks nudges by shrugging his shoulders as if
to show that it was hard enough for him to be made enthusiastic and that
he had heard much better music

In one of the pauses of his song while the minstrel was clearing his
throat I asked the lackey who he was and if he often came there

Twice this summer he has been here replied the lackey He is from
Aargau he goes round begging

Well do many like him come round here I asked

Oh yes replied the lackey not comprehending the full force of what I
asked but immediately after recollecting himself he added Oh no
This one is the only one I ever heard here No one else

At this moment the little man had finished his first song briskly twanged
his guitar and said something in his German patois which I could not
understand but which brought forth a hearty round of laughter from the
surrounding throng

What was that he said I asked

He says that his throat is dried up he would like some wine replied the
lackey who was standing near me

What is he rather fond of the glass

Yes all that sort of people are replied the lackey smiling and
pointing at the minstrel

The minstrel took off his cap and swinging his guitar went toward the
hotel Raising his head he addressed the ladies and gentlemen standing by
the windows and on the balconies saying in a halfItalian halfGerman
accent and with the same intonation that jugglers use in speaking to their
audiences

Messieurs et mesdames si vous croyez que je gagne quelque chose vous
vous trompez je ne suis quun pauvre tiaple

He stood in silence a moment but as no one gave him any thing he once
more took up his guitar and said

 prsent messieurs et mesdames je vous chanterai lair du Righi

His hotel audience made no response but stood in expectation of the coming
song Below on the street a laugh went round probably in part because he
had expressed himself so strangely and in part because no one had given
him any thing

I gave him a few centimes which he deftly changed from one hand to the
other and bestowed them in his vestpocket and then replacing his cap
began once more to sing the graceful sweet Tyrolese melody which he had
called lair du Righi

This song which formed the last on his programme was even better than the
preceding and from all sides in the wondering throng were heard sounds of
approbation

He finished Again he swung his guitar took off his cap held it out in
front of him went two or three steps nearer to the windows and again
repeated his stock phrase

Messieurs et mesdames si vous croyez que je gagne quelque chose which
he evidently considered to be very shrewd and witty but in his voice and
motions I perceived a certain irresolution and childish timidity which were
especially touching in a person of such diminutive stature

The elegant public still picturesquely grouped in the lighted windows and
on the balconies were shining in their rich attire a few conversed in
soberly discreet tones apparently about their singer who was standing
there below them with outstretched hand others gazed down with attentive
curiosity on the little black figure on one balcony could be heard the
merry ringing laughter of some young girl

In the surrounding crowd the talk and laughter grew constantly louder and
louder

The singer for the third time repeated his phrase but in a still weaker
voice and did not even end the sentence and again he stretched his hand
with his cap but instantly drew it back Again not one of those
brilliantly dressed scores of people standing to listen to him threw him a
penny

The crowd laughed heartlessly

The little singer so it seemed to me shrunk more into himself took his
guitar into his other hand lifted his cap and said

Messieurs et mesdames je vous remercie et je vous souhais une bonne
nuit Then he put on his hat

The crowd cackled with laughter and satisfaction The handsome ladies and
gentlemen calmly exchanging remarks withdrew gradually from the
balconies On the boulevard the promenading began once more The street
which had been still during the singing assumed its wonted liveliness a
few men however stood at some distance and without approaching the
singer looked at him and laughed

I heard the little man muttering something between his teeth as he turned
away and I saw him apparently growing more and more diminutive hurry
toward the city with brisk steps The promenaders who had been looking at
him followed him at some distance still making merry at his expense My
mind was in a whirl I could not comprehend what it all meant and still
standing in the same place I gazed abstractedly into the darkness after
the little man who was fast disappearing as he went with everincreasing
swiftness with long strides into the city followed by the merrymaking
promenaders

I was overmastered by a feeling of pain of bitterness and above all of
shame for the little man for the crowd for myself as though it were I
who had asked for money and received none as though it were I who had been
turned to ridicule

Without looking any longer feeling my heart oppressed I also hurried with
long strides toward the entrance of the Schweitzerhof I could not explain
the feeling that overmastered me only there was something like a stone
from which I could not free myself weighing down my soul and oppressing
me

At the ample welllighted entrance I met the porter who politely made
way for me An English family was also at the door A portly handsome and
tall gentleman with black sidewhiskers in a black hat and with a plaid
on one arm while in his hand he carried a costly cane came out slowly and
full of importance Leaning on his arm was a lady who wore a raw silk
dress and bonnet with bright ribbons and the most costly laces Together
with them was a pretty freshlooking young lady in a graceful Swiss hat
with a feather  la mousquetaire from under it escaped long lightyellow
curls softly encircling her fair face In front of them skipped a buxom
girl of ten with round white knees which showed from under her thin
embroideries Magnificent night the lady was saying in a sweet happy
voice as I passed them

Oh yes growled the Englishman lazily and it was evident that he found
it so enjoyable to be alive in the world that it was too much trouble even
to speak

And it seemed as though all of them alike found it so comfortable and easy
so light and free to be alive in the world their faces and motions
expressed such perfect indifference to the lives of every one else and
such absolute confidence that it was to them that the porter made way and
bowed so profoundly and that when they returned they would find clean
comfortable beds and rooms and that all this was bound to be and was
their indefeasible right that I involuntarily contrasted them with the
wandering minstrel who weary perhaps hungry full of shame was retreating
before the laughing crowd And then suddenly I comprehended what it was
that oppressed my heart with such a load of heaviness and I felt an
indescribable anger against these people

Twice I walked up and down past the Englishman and each time without
turning out for him my elbow punched him which gave me a feeling of
indescribable satisfaction and then darting down the steps I hastened
through the darkness in the direction toward the city taken by the little
man

Overtaking the three men who had been walking together I asked them where
the singer was they laughed and pointed straight ahead There he was
walking alone with brisk steps no one was with him all the time as it
seemed to me he was indulging in bitter monologue

I caught up with him and proposed to him to go somewhere with me and drink
a bottle of wine He kept on with his rapid walk and scarcely deigned to
look at me but when he perceived what I was saying he halted

Well I would not refuse if you would be so kind said he here is a
little caf we can go in there Its not fashionable he added pointing
to a drinkingsaloon that was still open

His expression not fashionable involuntarily suggested the idea of not
going to an unfashionable caf but to go to the Schweitzerhof where those
who had been listening to him were Notwithstanding the fact that several
times he showed a sort of timid disquietude at the idea of going to the
Schweitzerhof declaring that it was too fine for him there still I
insisted in carrying out my purpose and he putting the best face on the
matter gayly swinging his guitar went back with me across the quay

A few loiterers who had happened along as I was talking with the minstrel
and had stopped to hear what I had to say now after arguing among
themselves followed us to the very entrance of the hotel evidently
expecting from the Tyrolese some further demonstration

I ordered a bottle of wine of a waiter whom I met in the hall The waiter
smiled and looked at us and went by without answering The head waiter to
whom I addressed myself with the same order listened to me solemnly and
measuring the minstrels modest little figure from head to foot sternly
ordered the waiter to take us to the room at the left

The room at the left was a barroom for simple people In the corner of
this room a hunchbacked maid was washing dishes The whole furniture
consisted of bare wooden tables and benches

The waiter who came to serve us looked at us with a supercilious smile
thrust his hands in his pockets and exchanged some remarks with the
humpbacked dishwasher He evidently tried to give us to understand that he
felt himself immeasurably higher than the minstrel both in dignity and
social position so that he considered it not only an indignity but even
an actual joke that he was called upon to serve us

Do you wish vin ordinaire he asked with a knowing look winking toward
my companion and switching his napkin from one hand to the other

Champagne and your very best said I endeavoring to assume my
haughtiest and most imposing appearance

But neither my champagne nor my endeavor to look haughty and imposing had
the least effect on the servant he smiled incredulously loitered a moment
or two gazing at us took time enough to glance at his gold watch and with
leisurely steps as though going out for a walk left the room

Soon he returned with the wine bringing two other waiters with him These
two sat down near the dishwasher and gazed at us with amused attention
and a bland smile just as parents gaze at their children when they are
gently playing Only the dishwasher it seemed to me did not look at us
scornfully but sympathetically

Though it was trying and awkward to lunch with the minstrel and to play
the entertainer under the fire of all these waiters eyes I tried to do
my duty with as little constraint as possible In the lighted room I could
see him better He was a small but symmetrically built and muscular man
though almost a dwarf in stature he had bristly black hair teary big
black eyes bushy eyebrows and a thoroughly pleasant attractively shaped
mouth He had little sidewhiskers his hair was short his attire was very
simple and mean He was not overclean was ragged and sunburnt and in
general had the look of a laboringman He was far more like a poor
tradesman than an artist

Only in his ever humid and brilliant eyes and in his firm mouth was there
any sign of originality or genius By his face it might be conjectured that
his age was between twentyfive and forty in reality he was
thirtyseven

Here is what he related to me with goodnatured readiness and evident
sincerity of his life He was a native of Aargau In early childhood he
had lost father and mother other relatives he had none He had never owned
any property He had been apprenticed to a carpenter but twentytwo years
previously one of his hands had been attacked by caries which had
prevented him from ever working again

From childhood he had been fond of singing and he began to be a singer
Occasionally strangers had given him money With this he had learned his
profession bought his guitar and now for eighteen years he had been
wandering about through Switzerland and Italy singing before hotels His
whole luggage consisted of his guitar and a little purse in which at the
present time there was only half a franc That would have to suffice for
supper and lodgings this night

Every year now for eighteen years he had made the round of the best and
most popular resorts of SwitzerlandZurich Lucerne Interlaken
Chamounix etc by the way of the St Bernard he would go down into Italy
and return over the St Gothard or through Savoy Just at present it was
rather hard for him to walk as he had caught a cold causing him to suffer
from some trouble in his legshe called it rheumatismwhich grew more
severe from year to year and moreover his voice and eyes had grown
weaker Nevertheless he was on his way to Interlaken AixlesBains and
thence over the Little St Bernard to Italy which he was very fond of It
was evident that on the whole he was well content with his life

When I asked him why he returned home if he had any relatives there or a
house and land his mouth parted in a gay smile and he replied Oui le
sucre est bon il est doux pour les enfants and he winked at the
servants

I did not catch his meaning but the group of servants burst out laughing

No I have nothing of the sort but still I should always want to go
back he explained to me I go home because there is always a something
that draws one to ones native place And once more he repeated with a
shrewd selfsatisfied smile his phrase Oui le sucre est bon and
then laughed goodnaturedly

The servants were very much amused and laughed heartily only the
hunchbacked dishwasher looked earnestly from her big kindly eyes at the
little man and picked up his cap for him when as we talked he once
knocked it off the bench I have noticed that wandering minstrels
acrobats even jugglers delight in calling themselves artists and several
times I hinted to my comrade that he was an artist but he did not at all
accept this designation but with perfect simplicity looked upon his work
as a means of existence

When I asked him if he had not himself written the songs which he sang he
showed great surprise at such a strange question and replied that the
words of whatever he sang were all of old Tyrolese origin

But how about that song of the Righi I think that cannot be very
ancient I suggested

Oh that was composed about fifteen years ago There was a German in
Basel he was a clever man it was he who composed it A splendid song You
see he composed it especially for travellers And he began to repeat the
words of the Righi song which he liked so well translating them into
French as he went along

    If you wish to go to Righi
    You will not need shoes to Wegis
    For you go that far by steamboat
    But from Wegis take a stout staff
    Also take upon your arm a maiden
    Drink a glass of wine on starting
    Only do not drink too freely
    For if you desire to drink here
    You must earn the right to first

Oh a splendid song he exclaimed as he finished

The servants evidently also found the song much to their mind because
they came up closer to us

Yes but who was it composed the music I asked

Oh no one at all you know you must have something new when you are going
to sing for strangers

When the ice was brought and I had given my comrade a glass of champagne
he seemed somewhat ill at ease and glancing at the servants he turned
and twisted on the bench

We touched our glasses to the health of all artists he drank half a glass
then he seemed to be collecting his ideas and knit his brows in deep
thought

It is long since I have tasted such wine je ne vous dis que a In
Italy the vino dAsti is excellent but this is still better Ah Italy
it is splendid to be there he added

Yes there they know how to appreciate music and artists said I trying
to bring him round to the evenings mischance before the Schweitzerhof

No he replied There as far as music is concerned I cannot give
anybody satisfaction The Italians are themselves musiciansnone like
them in the world but I know only Tyrolese songs They are something of a
novelty to them though

Well you find rather more generous gentlemen there dont you I went on
to say anxious to make him share in my resentment against the guests of
the Schweitzerhof There it would not be possible to find a big hotel
frequented by rich people where out of a hundred listening to an artists
singing not one would give him any thing

My question utterly failed of the effect that I expected It did not enter
his head to be indignant with them on the contrary he saw in my remark an
implied slur upon his talent which had failed of its reward and he
hastened to set himself right before me It is not every time that you get
any thing he remarked sometimes one isnt in good voice or you are
tired now today I have been walking ten hours and singing almost all the
time That is hard And these important aristocrats do not always care to
listen to Tyrolese songs

But still how can they help giving I insisted

He did not comprehend my remark

Thats nothing he said but here the principal thing is on est tres
serr pour la police thats whats the trouble Here according to these
republican laws you are not allowed to sing but in Italy you can go
wherever you please no one says a word Here if they want to let you
they let you but if they dont want to then they can throw you into
jail

What Thats incredible

Yes it is true If you have been warned once and are found singing
again they may put you in jail I was kept there three months once he
said smiling as though that were one of his pleasantest recollections

Oh that is terrible I exclaimed What was the reason

That was in consequence of one of the new republican laws he went on to
explain growing animated They cannot comprehend here that a poor fellow
must earn his living somehow If I were not a cripple I would work But
what harm do I do to any one in the world by my singing What does it mean
The rich can live as they wish un pauvre tiaple like myself cant live
at all What kind of laws are these republican ones If that is the way
they run then we dont want a republic isnt that so my dear sir We
dont want a republic but we wantwe simply wantwe wanthe hesitated
a littlewe want natural laws

I filled up his glass You are not drinking I said

He took the glass in his hand and bowed to me

I know what you wish he said blinking his eyes at me and threatening
me with his finger You wish to make me drunk so as to see what you can
get out of me but no you shant have that gratification

Why should I make you drunk I inquired All I wished was to give you a
pleasure

He seemed really sorry that he had offended me by interpreting my
insistence so harshly He grew confused stood up and touched my elbow

No no said he looking at me with a beseeching expression in his moist
eyes I was only joking

And immediately after he made use of some horribly uncultivated slang
expression intended to signify that I was nevertheless a fine young man
Je ne vous dis que a he said in conclusion In this fashion the
minstrel and I continued to drink and converse and the waiters continued
unceremoniously to stare at us and as it seemed to make ridicule of us

In spite of the interest which our conversation aroused in me I could not
avoid taking notice of their behavior and I confess I began to grow more
and more angry

One of the waiters arose came up to the little man and regarding the top
of his head began to smile I was already full of wrath against the
inmates of the hotel and had not yet had a chance to pour it out on any
one and now I confess I was in the highest degree irritated by this
audience of waiters

The porter not removing his hat came into the room and sat down near me
leaning his elbows on the table This last circumstance which was so
insulting to my dignity or my vainglory completely enraged me and gave an
outlet for all the wrath which all the evening long had been boiling within
me I asked myself why he had so humbly bowed when he had met me before
and now because I was sitting with the travelling minstrel he came and
took his place near me so rudely I was entirely overmastered by that
boiling angry indignation which I enjoy in myself which I sometimes
endeavor to stimulate when it comes over me because it has an exhilarating
effect upon me and gives me if only for a short time a certain
extraordinary flexibility energy and strength in all my physical and
moral faculties

I leaped to my feet

Whom are you laughing at I screamed at the waiter and I felt my face
turn pale and my lips involuntarily set together

I am not laughing replied the waiter moving away from me

Yes you are you are laughing at this gentleman And what right have you
to come and to take a seat here when there are guests Dont you dare to
sit down

The porter muttering something got up and turned to the door

What right have you to make sport of this gentleman and to sit down by
him when he is a guest and you are a waiter Why didnt you laugh at me
this evening at dinner and come and sit down beside me Because he is
meanly dressed and sings in the streets Is that the reason and because I
have better clothes He is poor but he is a thousand times better than you
are that I am sure of because he has never insulted any one but you have
insulted him

I didnt mean any thing replied my enemy the waiter Perhaps I
disturbed him by sitting down

The waiter did not understand me and my German was wasted on him The rude
porter was about to take the waiters part but I fell upon him so
impetuously that the porter pretended not to understand me and waved his
hand

The hunchbacked dishwasher either because she perceived my wrathful
state and feared a scandal or possibly because she shared my views took
my part and trying to force her way between me and the porter told him
to hold his tongue saying that I was right but at the same time urging me
to calm myself

Der Herr hat Recht Sie haben Recht she said over and over again The
minstrels face presented a most pitiable terrified expression and
evidently he did not understand why I was angry and what I wanted and he
urged me to let him go away as soon as possible

But the eloquence of wrath burned within me more and more I understood it
allthe throng that had made merry at his expense and his auditors who
had not given him any thing and not for all the world would I have held my
peace

I believe that if the waiters and the porter had not been so submissive
I should have taken delight in having a brush with them or striking the
defenceless English lady on the head with a stick If at that moment I had
been at Sevastpol I should have taken delight in devoting myself to
slaughtering and killing in the English trench

And why did you take this gentleman and me into this room and not into
the other What I thundered at the porter seizing him by the arm so that
he could not escape from me What right had you to judge by his appearance
that this gentleman must be served in this room and not in that Have not
all guests who pay equal rights in hotels Not only in a republic but in
all the world Your scurvy republic Equality indeed You would not
dare to take an Englishman into this room not even those Englishmen who
have heard this gentleman free of cost that is who have stolen from him
each one of them the few centimes which ought to have been given to him
How did you dare to take us to this room

That room is closed said the porter

No I cried that isnt true it isnt closed

Then you know best

I knowI know that you are lying

The porter turned his back on me

Eh What is to be said he muttered

What is to be said I cried You conduct us instanter into that room

In spite of the dishwashers warning and the entreaties of the minstrel
who would have preferred to go home I insisted on seeing the head waiter
and went with my guest into the big diningroom The head waiter hearing
my angry voice and seeing my menacing face avoided a quarrel and with
contemptuous servility said that I might go wherever I pleased I could
not prove to the porter that he had lied because he had hastened out of
sight before I went into the hall

The diningroom was in fact open and lighted and at one of the tables
sat an Englishman and a lady eating their supper Although we were shown
to a special table I took the dirty minstrel to the very one where the
Englishman was and bade the waiter bring to us there the unfinished
bottle

The two guests at first looked with surprised then with angry eyes at the
little man who more dead than alive was sitting near me They talked
together in a low tone then the lady pushed back her plate her silk dress
rustled and both of them left the room Through the glass doors I saw the
Englishman saying something in an angry voice to the waiter and pointing
with his hand in our direction The waiter put his head through the door
and looked at us I waited with pleasurable anticipation for some one to
come and order us out for then I could have found a full outlet for all my
indignation But fortunately though at the time I felt injured we were
left in peace The minstrel who before had fought shy of the wine now
eagerly drank all that was left in the bottle so that he might make his
escape as quickly as possible

He however expressed his gratitude with deep feeling as it seemed to me
for his entertainment His teary eyes grew still more humid and brilliant
and he made use of a most strange and complicated phrase of gratitude But
still very pleasant to me was the sentence in which he said that if
everybody treated artists as I had been doing it would be very good and
ended by wishing me all manner of happiness We went out into the hall
together There stood the servants and my enemy the porter apparently
airing his grievances against me before them All of them I thought
looked at me as though I were a man who had lost his wits I treated the
little man exactly like an equal before all that audience of servants and
then with all the respect that I was able to express in my behavior I
took off my hat and pressed his hand with its dry and hardened fingers

The servants made believe not pay the slightest attention to me One of
them only indulged in a sarcastic laugh

As soon as the minstrel had bowed himself out and disappeared in the
darkness I went upstairs to my room intending to sleep off all these
impressions and the foolish childish anger which had come upon me so
unexpectedly But finding that I was too much excited to sleep I once more
went down into the street with the intention of walking until I should have
recovered my equanimity and I must confess with the secret hope that I
might accidentally come across the porter or the waiter or the Englishman
and show them all their rudeness and most of all their unfairness But
beyond the porter who when he saw me turned his back I met no one and I
began to promenade in absolute solitude along the quay

This is an example of the strange fate of poetry said I to myself
having grown a little calmer All love it all are in search of it it is
the only thing in life that men love and seek and yet no one recognizes
its power no one prizes this best treasure of the world and those who
give it to men are not rewarded Ask any one you please ask all these
guests of the Schweitzerhof what is the most precious treasure in the
world and all or ninetynine out of a hundred putting on a sardonic
expression will say that the best thing in the world is money

Maybe though this does not please you or coincide with your elevated
ideas it will be urged but what is to be done if human life is so
constituted that money alone is capable of giving a man happiness I cannot
force my mind not to see the world as it is it will be added that is
to see the truth

Pitiable is your intellect pitiable the happiness which you desire And
you yourselves unhappy creatures not knowing what you desire  why
have you all left your fatherland your relatives your moneymaking trades
and occupations and come to this little Swiss city of Lucerne Why did you
all this evening gather on the balconies and in respectful silence listen
to the little beggars song And if he had been willing to sing longer you
would have been silent and listened longer What could money even
millions of it have driven you all from your country and brought you all
together in this little nook of Lucerne Could money have gathered you all
on the balconies to stand for half an hour silent and motionless No One
thing compels you to do it and will forever have a stronger influence than
all the other impulses of life the longing for poetry which you know
which you do not realize but feel always will feel so long as you have
any human sensibilities The word poetry is a mockery to you you make
use of it as a sort of ridiculous reproach you regard the love for poetry
as something meet for children and silly girls and you make sport of them
for it For yourselves you must have something more definite

But children look upon life in a healthy way they recognize and love what
man ought to love and what gives happiness But life has so deceived and
perverted you that you ridicule the only thing that you really love and
you seek for what you hate and for what gives you unhappiness

You are so perverted that you did not perceive what obligations you were
under to the poor Tyrolese who rendered you a pure delight but at the same
time you feel yourselves needlessly obliged to bow before some lord which
gives you neither pleasure nor profit but rather causes you to sacrifice
your comfort and convenience What absurdity what incomprehensible lack of
reason

But it was not this that made the most powerful impression upon me this
evening This blindness to all that gives happiness this unconsciousness
of poetic enjoyment I can almost comprehend or at least I have become
wonted to it since I have almost everywhere met with it in the course of
my life the harsh unconscious churlishness of the crowd was no novelty to
me whatever those who argue in favor of popular sentiment may say the
throng is a conglomeration of very possibly good people but of people who
touch each other only on their coarse animal sides and express only the
weakness and harshness of human nature But how was it that you children
of a humane people you Christians you simple people repaid with coldness
and ridicule the poor beggar who gave you a pure enjoyment But no in
your country there are asylums for beggars There are no beggars there can
be none and there can be no feelings of sympathy since that would be a
confession that beggary existed

But he labored he gave you enjoyment he besought you to give him
something of your superfluity in payment for his labor of which you took
advantage But you looked upon him with a cool smile as upon one of the
curiosities in your lofty brilliant palaces and though there were a
hundred of you favored with happiness and wealth not one man or one woman
among you gave him a sou Abashed he went away from you and the
thoughtless throng laughing followed and ridiculed not you but him
because you were cold harsh and dishonorable because you robbed him in
receiving the entertainment which he gave you for this they jeered him

On the th of July  before the Schweitzerhof Hotel in which were
lodging very opulent people a wandering beggar minstrel sang for half an
hour his songs and played his guitar About a hundred people listened to
him The minstrel thrice asked you all to give him something No one person
gave him a thing and many made sport of him

This is not an invention but an actual fact as those who desire can find
out for themselves by consulting the papers for the list of those who were
at the Schweitzerhof on the th of July

This is an event which the historians of our time ought to describe in
letters of inextinguishable flame This event is more significant and more
serious and fraught with far deeper meaning than the facts that are
printed in newspapers and histories That the English have killed several
thousand Chinese because the Chinese would not sell them any thing for
money while their land is overflowing with ringing coins that the French
have killed several thousand Kabyles because the wheat grows well in
Africa and because constant war is essential for the drill of an army
that the Turkish ambassador in Naples must not be a Jew and that the
Emperor Napoleon walks about in Plombires and gives his people the
express assurance that he rules only in direct accordance with the will of
the peopleall these are words which darken or reveal something long
known But the episode that took place in Lucerne on the th of July seems
to me something entirely novel and strange and it is connected not with
the everlastingly ugly side of human nature but with a wellknown epoch in
the development of society This fact is not for the history of human
activities but for the history of progress and civilization

Why is it that this inhuman fact impossible in any countryGermany
France or Italyis quite possible here where civilization freedom and
equality are carried to the highest degree of development where there are
gathered together the most civilized travellers from the most civilized
nations Why is it that these cultivated human beings generally capable of
every honorable human action had no hearty human feeling for one good
deed Why is it that these people who in their palaces their meetings and
their societies labor warmly for the condition of the celibate Chinese in
India about the spread of Christianity and culture in Africa about the
formation of societies for attaining all perfectionwhy is it that they
should not find in their souls the simple primitive feeling of human
sympathy Has such a feeling entirely disappeared and has its place been
taken by vainglory ambition and cupidity governing these men in their
palaces meetings and societies Has the spreading of that reasonable
egotistical association of people which we call civilization destroyed
and rendered nugatory the desire for instinctive and loving association
And is this that boasted equality for which so much innocent blood has been
shed and so many crimes have been perpetrated Is it possible that
nations like children can be made happy by the mere sound of the word
equality

Equality before the law Does the whole life of a people revolve within
the sphere of law Only the thousandth part of it is subject to the law
the rest lies outside of it in the sphere of the customs and intuitions of
society

But in society the lackey is better dressed than the minstrel and insults
him with impunity I am better dressed than the lackey and insult him with
impunity The porter considers me higher but the minstrel lower than
himself when I made the minstrel my companion he felt that he was on an
equality with us both and behaved rudely I was impudent to the porter
and the porter acknowledged that he was inferior to me The waiter was
impudent to the minstrel and the minstrel accepted the fact that he was
inferior to the waiter

And is that government free even though men seriously call it free where
a single citizen can be thrown into prison because without harming any
one without interfering with any one he does the only thing that he can
to prevent himself from dying of starvation

A wretched pitiable creature is man with his craving for positive
solutions thrown into this everlastingly tossing limitless ocean of
good and evil of combinations and contradictions For centuries men
have been struggling and laboring to put the good on one side the evil
on the other Centuries will pass and no matter how much the unprejudiced
mind may strive to decide where the balance lies between the good and the
evil the scales will refuse to tip the beam and there will always be
equal quantities of the good and the evil on each scale

If only man would learn to form judgments and not to indulge in rash and
arbitrary thoughts and not to make reply to questions that are propounded
merely to remain forever unanswered If only he would learn that every
thought is both a lie and a trutha lie from the onesidedness and
inability of man to recognize all truth and true because it expresses one
side of mortal endeavor There are divisions in this everlastingly
tumultuous endless endlessly confused chaos of the good and the evil
They have drawn imaginary lines over this ocean and they contend that the
ocean is really thus divided

But are there not millions of other possible subdivisions from absolutely
different standpoints in other planes Certainly these novel subdivisions
will be made in centuries to come just as millions of different ones have
been made in centuries past

Civilization is good barbarism is evil freedom good slavery
evil Now this imaginary knowledge annihilates the instinctive
beatific primitive craving for the good that is in human nature And who
will explain to me what is freedom what is despotism what is
civilization what is barbarism

Where are the boundaries that separate them And whose soul possesses so
absolute a standard of good and evil as to measure these fleeting
complicated facts Whose wit is so great as to comprehend and weigh all the
facts in the irretrievable past And who can find any circumstance in which
there is no union of good and evil And because I know that I see more
of one than of the other is it not because my standpoint is wrong And who
has the ability to separate himself so absolutely from life even for a
moment as to look upon it from above

One only one infallible Guide we havethe universal Spirit which
penetrates all collectively and as units which has endowed each of us with
the craving for the right the Spirit which impels the tree to grow toward
the sun which stimulates the flower in autumntide to scatter its seed
and which obliges each one of us unconsciously to draw closer together And
this one unerring inspiring voice rings out louder than the noisy hasty
development of culture

Who is the greater man and who the greater barbarianthat lord who
seeing the minstrels wellworn clothes angrily left the table who gave
him not the millionth part of his possessions in payment of his labor and
now lazily sitting in his brilliant comfortable room calmly opines about
the events that are happening in China and justifies the massacres that
have been done there or the little minstrel who risking imprisonment
with a franc in his pocket and doing no harm to any one has been going
about for a score of years up hill and down dale rejoicing mens hearts
with his songs though they have jeered at him and almost cast him out of
the pale of humanity and who in weariness and cold and shame has gone
off to sleep no one knows where on his filthy straw

At this moment from the city through the dead silence of the night far
far away I caught the sound of the little mans guitar and his voice

No something involuntarily said to me you have no right to commiserate
the little man or to blame the lord for his wellbeing Who can weigh the
inner happiness which is found in the soul of each of these men There he
stands somewhere in the muddy road and gazes at the brilliant moonlit sky
and gayly sings amid the smiling fragrant night in his soul there is no
reproach no anger no regret And who knows what is transpiring now in the
hearts of all these men within those opulent brilliant rooms Who knows if
they all have as much unencumbered sweet delight in life and as much
satisfaction with the world as dwells in the soul of that little man

Endless are the mercy and wisdom of Him who has permitted and formed all
these contradictions Only to thee miserable little worm of the dust
audaciously lawlessly attempting to fathom His laws His designsonly to
thee do they seem like contradictions

Full of love He looks down from His bright immeasurable height and
rejoices in the endless harmony in which you all move in endless
contradictions In thy pride thou hast thought thyself able to separate
thyself from the laws of the universe No thou also with thy petty
ridiculous anger against the waitersthou also hast disturbed the
harmonious craving for the eternal and the infinite




RECOLLECTIONS OF A SCORER

A STORY


Well it happened about three oclock The gentlemen were playing There
was the big stranger as our men called him The prince was therethe two
are always together The whiskered brin was there also the little hussar
Oliver who was an actor and there was the pan It was a pretty good
crowd

Footnote  Polish name for lord or gentleman

The big stranger and the prince were playing together Now here I was
walking up and down around the billiardtable with my stick keeping
tallyten and fortyseven twelve and fortyseven

Everybody knows its our business to score You dont get a chance to get a
bite of any thing and you dont get to bed till two oclock o nights but
youre always being screamed at to bring the balls

I was keeping tally and I look and see a new brin comes in at the door
He gazed and gazed and then sat down on the sofa Very well

Now who can that be thinks I to myself He must be somebody

His dress was neatneat as a pincheckered tricot pants stylish little
short coat plush vest and gold chain and all sorts of trinkets dangling
from it

He was dressed neat but there was something about the man neater still
slim tall his hair brushed forward in style and his face fair and
ruddywell in a word a fine young fellow

You must know our business brings us into contact with all sorts of people
And theres many that aint of much consequence and theres a good deal of
poor trash So though youre only a scorer you get used to telling folks
that is in a certain way you learn a thing or two

I looked at the brin I see him sit down modest and quiet not knowing
anybody and the clothes on him are so brannew that thinks I Either
hes a foreigneran Englishman maybeor some count just come And
though hes so young he has an air of some distinction Oliver sat down
next him so he moved along a little

They began a game The big man lost He shouts to me Says he Youre
always cheating You dont count straight Why dont you pay attention

He scolded away then threw down his cue and went out Now just look
here Evenings he and the prince plays for fifty silver rubles a game and
here he only lost a bottle of Makon wine and got mad Thats the kind of a
character he is

Another time he and the prince plays till two oclock They dont bank down
any cash and so I know neither of thems got any cash but they are simply
playing a bluff game

Ill go you twentyfive rubles says he

All right

Just yawning and not even stopping to place the ballyou see he was not
made of stonenow just notice what he said We are playing for money
says he and not for chips

But this man puzzled me worse than all the rest Well then when the big
man left the prince says to the new brin Wouldnt you like says he
to play a game with me

With pleasure says he

He sat there and looked rather foolish indeed he did He may have been
courageous in reality but at all events he got up went over to the
billiardtable and did not seem flustered as yet He was not exactly
flustered but you couldnt help seeing that he was not quite at his ease

Either his clothes were a little too new or he was embarrassed because
everybody was looking at him at any rate he seemed to have no energy He
sort of sidled up to the table caught his pocket on the edge began to
chalk his cue dropped his chalk

Whenever he hit the ball he always glanced around and reddened Not so
the prince He was used to it he chalked and chalked his hand tucked up
his sleeve he goes and sits down when he pockets the ball even though he
is such a little man

They played two or three games then I notice the prince puts up the cue
and says Would you mind telling me your name

Nekhliudof says he

Says the prince Was your father commander in the corps of cadets

Yes says the other

Then they began to talk in French and I could not understand them I
suppose they were talking about family affairs

Au revoir says the prince I am very glad to have made your
acquaintance He washed his hands and went to get a lunch but the other
stood by the billiardtable with his cue and was knocking the balls about

Its our business you know when a new man comes along to be rather
sharp its the best way I took the balls and go to put them up He
reddened and says Cant I play any longer

Certainly you can says I Thats what billiards is for But I dont
pay any attention to him I straighten the cues

Will you play with me

Certainly sir says I

I place the balls

Shall we play for odds

What do you meanplay for odds

Well says I you give me a halfruble and I crawl under the table

Of course as he had never seen that sort of thing it seemed strange to
him he laughs

Go ahead says he

Very well says I only you must give me odds

What says he are you a worse player than I am

Most likely says I We have few players who can be compared with you

We began to play He certainly had the idea that he was a crack shot It
was a caution to see him shoot but the Pole sat there and kept shouting
out every time

Ah what a chance ah what a shot

But what a man he was His ideas were good enough but he didnt know how
to carry them out Well as usual I lost the first game crawled under the
table and grunted

Thereupon Oliver and the Pole jumped down from their seats and applauded
thumping with their cues

Splendid Do it again they cried once more

Well enough to cry once more especially for the Pole That fellow would
have been glad enough to crawl under the billiardtable or even under the
Blue bridge for a halfruble Yet he was the first to cry Splendid but
you havent wiped off all the dust yet

I Petrushka the marker was pretty well known to everybody

Only of course I did not care to show my hand yet I lost my second game

It does not become me at all to play with you sir says I

He laughs Then as I was playing the third game he stood fortynine and I
nothing I laid the cue on the billiardtable and said Brin shall we
play off

What do you mean by playing off says he How would you have it

You make it three rubles or nothing says I

Why says he have I been playing with you for money The fool

He turned rather red

Very good He lost the game He took out his pocketbookquite a new one
evidently just from the English shopopened it I see he wanted to make a
little splurge It is stuffed full of billsnothing but hundredruble
notes

No says he theres no small stuff here

He took three rubles from his purse There says he theres your two
rubles the other pays for the games and you keep the rest for vodka

Thank you sir most kindly I see that he is a splendid fellow For such
a one I would crawl under any thing For one thing its a pity that he
wont play for money For then thinks I I should know how to work him for
twenty rubles and maybe I could stretch it out to forty

As soon as the Pole saw the young mans money he says Wouldnt you like
to try a little game with me You play so admirably Such sharpers prowl
around

No says the young man excuse me I have not the time And he went
out

I dont know who that man was that Pole Some one called him Pan or the
Pole and so it stuck to him Every day he used to sit in the
billiardroom and always look on He was no longer allowed to take a hand
in any game whatever but he always sat by himself and got out his pipe
and smoked But then he could play well

Very good Nekhliudof came a second time a third time he began to come
frequently He would come morning and evening He learned to play French
carom and pyramid poolevery thing in fact He became less bashful got
acquainted with everybody and played tolerably well Of course being a
young man of a good family with money everybody liked him The only
exception was the big guest he quarrelled with him

And the whole thing grew out of a trifle

They were playing poolthe prince the big guest Nekhliudof Oliver and
some one else Nekhliudof was standing near the stove talking with some
one When it came the big mans turn to play it happened that his ball
was just opposite the stove There was very little space there and he
liked to have elbowroom

Now either he didnt see Nekhliudof or he did it on purpose but as he
was flourishing his cue he hit Nekhliudof in the chest a tremendous rap
It actually made him groan What then He did not think of apologizing he
was so boorish He even went further he didnt look at him he walks off
grumbling

Whos jostling me there It made me miss my shot Why cant we have some
room

Then the other went up to him pale as a sheet but quite selfpossessed
and says so politely

You ought first sir to apologize you struck me says he

Catch me apologizing now I should have won the game says he but now
you have spoiled it for me

Then the other one says You ought to apologize

Get out of my way I insist upon it I wont

And he turned away to look after his ball

Nekhliudof went up to him and took him by the arm

Youre a boor says he my dear sir

Though he was a slender young fellow almost like a girl still he was all
ready for a quarrel His eyes flash fire he looks as if he could eat him
alive The big guest was a strong tremendous fellow no match for
Nekhliudof

Whaat says he you call me a boor Yelling out these words he raises
his hand to strike him

Then everybody there rushed up and seized them both by the arms and
separated them

After much talk Nekhliudof says Let him give me satisfaction he has
insulted me

Not at all said the other I dont care a whit about any satisfaction
Hes nothing but a boy a mere nothing Ill pull his ears for him

If you arent willing to give me satisfaction then you are no gentleman

And saying this he almost cried

Well and you you are a little boy nothing you say or do can offend me

Well we separated themled them off as the custom is to different
rooms Nekhliudof and the prince were friends

Go says the former for Gods sake make him listen to reason

The prince went The big man says I aint afraid of any one says he I
am not going to have any explanation with such a baby I wont do it and
thats the end of it

Well they talked and talked and then the matter died out only the big
guest ceased to come to us any more

As a result of thisthis row I might call ithe was regarded as quite
the cock of the walk He was quick to take offenceI mean Nekhliudofas
to so many other things however he was as unsophisticated as a newborn
babe

I remember once the prince says to Nekhliudof Whom do you keep here

No one says he

What do you meanno one

Why should I says Nekhliudof

How sowhy should you

I have always lived thus Why shouldnt I continue to live the same way

You dont say so Did you ever

And saying this the prince burst into a peal of laughter and the
whiskered brin also roared They couldnt get over it

What never they asked

Never

They were dying with laughter Of course I understood well enough what they
were laughing at him for I keep my eyes open What thinks I will come
of it

Come says the prince come right off

No not for any thing was his answer

Now that is absurd says the prince Come along

They went out

They came back at one oclock They sat down to supper quite a crowd of
them were assembled Some of our very best customersAtnof Prince
Razin Count Shustakh Mirtsof And all congratulate Nekhliudof laughing
as they do so They call me in I see that they are pretty jolly

Congratulate the brin they shout

What on I ask

How did he call it His initiation or his enlightenment I cant remember
exactly

I have the honor says I to congratulate you

And he sits there very red in the face yet he smiles Didnt they have fun
with him though

Well and good They went afterwards to the billiardroom all very gay and
Nekhliudof went up to the billiardtable leaned on his elbow and said

Its amusing to you gentlemen says he but its sad for me Why says
he did I do it Prince says he I shall never forgive you or myself
as long as I live

And he actually burst into tears Evidently he did not know himself what he
was saying The prince went up to him with a smile

Dont talk nonsense says he Lets go home Anatoli

I wont go anywhere says the other Why did I do that

And the tears poured down his cheeks He would not leave the
billiardtable and that was the end of it Thats what it means for a
young and inexperienced man to

In this way he used often to come to us Once he came with the prince and
the whiskered man who was the princes crony the gentlemen always called
him Fedotka He had prominent cheekbones and was homely enough to be
sure but he used to dress neatly and ride in a carriage What was the
reason that the gentlemen were so fond of him I really could not tell

Fedotka Fedotka theyd call and ask him to eat and to drink and
theyd spend their money paying up for him but he was a thoroughgoing
beat If ever he lost he would be sure not to pay but if he won you bet
he wouldnt fail to collect his money Often too he came to grief yet
there he was walking arm in arm with the prince

You are lost without me he would say to the prince I am Fedot
says he but not a Fedot of that sort

Footnote  Fedot da ny tot an untranslatable play on the word

And what jokes he used to crack to be sure Well as I said they had
already arrived that time and one of them says Lets have the balls for
threehanded pool

All right says the other

They began to play at three rubles a stake Nekhliudof and the prince play
and chat about all sorts of things meantime

Ah says one of them you mind only what a neat little foot she has

Oh says the other her foot is nothing her beauty is her wealth of
hair

Of course they paid no attention to the game only kept on talking to one
another

As to Fedotka that fellow was alive to his work he played his very best
but they didnt do themselves justice at all

And so he won six rubles from each of them God knows how many games he had
won from the prince yet I never knew them to pay each other any money but
Nekhliudof took out two greenbacks and handed them over to him

No says he I dont want to take your money Lets square it play
quits or doubleeither double or nothing

Footnote  Kitudubl  Fr quitte ou double

I set the balls Fedotka began to play the first hand Nekhliudof seemed to
play only for fun sometimes he would come very near winning a game yet
just fail of it Says he It would be too easy a move I wont have it
so But Fedotka did not forget what he was up to Carelessly he proceeded
with the game and thus as if it were unexpectedly won

Let us play double stakes once more says he

All right says Nekhliudof

Once more Fedotka won the game

Well says he it began with a mere trifle I dont wish to win much
from you Shall we make it once more or nothing

Yes

Say what you may but fifty rubles is a pretty sum and Nekhliudof himself
began to propose Let us make it double or quit So they played and
played

It kept going worse and worse for Nekhliudof Two hundred and eighty rubles
were written up against him As to Fedotka he had his own method he would
lose a simple game but when the stake was doubled he would win sure

As for the prince he sits by and looks on He sees that the matter is
growing serious

Enough says he hold on

Footnote  as  assez

My they keep increasing the stake

At last it went so far that Nekhliudof was in for more than five hundred
rubles Fedotka laid down his cue and said

Arent you satisfied for today Im tired says he

Yet I knew he was ready to play till dawn of day provided there was money
to be won Stratagem of course And the other was all the more anxious to
go on Come on Come on

Nopon my honor Im tired Come says Fedot lets go upstairs
there you shall have your revanche

Upstairs with us meant the place where the gentlemen used to play cards
From that very day Fedotka wound his net round him so that he began to
come every day He would play one or two games of billiards and then
proceed upstairsevery day upstairs

What they used to do there God only knows but it is a fact that from that
time he began to be an entirely different kind of man and seemed hand in
glove with Fedotka Formerly he used to be stylish neat in his dress with
his hair slightly curled even but now it would be only in the morning that
he would be any thing like himself but as soon as he had paid his visit
upstairs he would not be at all like himself

Once he came down from upstairs with the prince pale his lips trembling
and talking excitedly

I cannot permit such a one as he is says he to say that I am
notHow did he express himself I cannot recollect something like not
refined enough or whatand that he wont play with me any more I tell
you I have paid him ten thousand and I should think that he might be a
little more considerate before others at least

Oh bother says the prince is it worth while to lose ones temper with
Fedotka

No says the other I will not let it go so

Why old fellow how can you think of such a thing as lowering yourself to
have a row with Fedotka

That is all very well but there were strangers there mind you

Well what of that says the prince strangers Well if you wish I
will go and make him ask your pardon

No says the other

And then they began to chatter in French and I could not understand what
it was they were talking about

And what would you think of it That very evening he and Fedotka ate supper
together and they became friends again

Well and good At other times again he would come alone

Well he would say do I play well

Its our business you know to try to make everybody contented and so I
would say Yes indeed and yet how could it be called good play when he
would poke about with his cue without any sense whatever

And from that very evening when he took in with Fedotka he began to play
for money all the time Formerly he didnt care to play for stakes either
for a dinner or for champagne Sometimes the prince would say

Lets play for a bottle of champagne

No he would say Let us rather have the wine by itself Hollo there
bring a bottle

And now he began to play for money all the time he used to spend his
entire days in our establishment He would either play with some one in the
billiardroom or he would go upstairs

Well thinks I to myself every one else gets something from him why dont
I get some advantage out of it

Well sir says I one day its a long time since you have had a game
with me

And so we began to play Well when I won ten halfrubles of him I says

Dont you want to make it double or quit sir

He said nothing Formerly if you remember he would call me a fool for
such a boldness And we went to playing quit or double

I won eighty rubles of him

Well what would you think Since that first time he used to play with me
every day He would wait till there was no one about for of course he
would have been ashamed to play with a mere marker in presence of others
Once he had got rather warmed up by the play he already owed me sixty
rubles and so he says

Do you want to stake all you have won

All right says I

I won One hundred and twenty to one hundred and twenty

All right says I

Again I won Two hundred and forty against two hundred and forty

Isnt that too much I ask

He made no reply We played the game Once more it was mine Four hundred
and eighty against four hundred and eighty

I says Well sir I dont want to wrong you Let us make it a hundred
rubles that you owe me and call it square

You ought to have heard how he yelled at this and yet he was not a proud
man at all Either play or dont play says he

Well I see theres nothing to be done Three hundred and eighty then if
you please says I

I really wanted to lose I allowed him forty points in advance He stood
fiftytwo to my thirtysix He began to cut the yellow one and missed
eighteen points and I was standing just at the turningpoint I made a
stroke so as to knock the ball off of the billiardtable Noso luck would
have it Do what I might he even missed the doublet I had won again

Listen says he Peterhe did not call me Petrushka thenI cant
pay you the whole right away In a couple of months I could pay three
thousand even if it were necessary

And there he stood just as red and his voice kind of trembled

Very good sir says I

With this he laid down the cue Then he began to walk up and down up and
down the perspiration running down his face

Peter says he lets try it again double or quit

And he almost burst into tears

What sir what would you play against such luck

Oh let us play I beg of you And he brings the cue and puts it in my
hand

I took the cue and I threw the balls on the table so that they bounced
over on to the floor I could not help showing off a little naturally I
say All right sir

But he was in such a hurry that he went and picked up the balls himself
and I thinks to myself Anyway Ill never be able to get the seven
hundred rubles from him so I can lose them to him all the same I began
to play carelessly on purpose But nohe wont have it so Why says he
you are playing badly on purpose

But his hands trembled and when the ball went towards a pocket his
fingers would spread out and his mouth would screw up to one side as if he
could by any means force the ball into the pocket Even I couldnt stand
it and I say That wont do any good sir

Very well As he won this game I says This will make it one hundred and
eighty rubles you owe me and fifty games and now I must go and get my
supper So I laid down my cue and went off

I went and sat down all by myself at a small table opposite the door and
I look in and see and wonder what he will do Well what would you think
He began to walk up and down up and down probably thinking that no ones
looking at him and then he would give a pull at his hair and then walk up
and down again and keep muttering to himself and then he would pull his
hair again

After that he wasnt seen for a week Once he came into the diningroom as
gloomy as could be but he didnt enter the billiardroom The prince
caught sight of him

Come says he lets have a game

No says the other I am not going to play any more

Nonsense come along

No says he I wont come I tell you For you its all one whether I go
or not yet for me its no good to come here

And so he did not come for ten days more And then it being the holidays
he came dressed up in a dress suit hed evidently been into company And
he was here all day long he kept playing and he came the next day and
the third

And it began to go in the old style and I thought it would be fine to have
another trial with him

No says he Im not going to play with you and as to the one hundred
and eighty rubles that I owe you if youll come at the end of a month you
shall have it

Very good So I went to him at the end of a month

By God says he I cant give it to you but come back on Thursday

Well I went on Thursday I found that he had a splendid suite of
apartments

Well says I is he at home

He hasnt got up yet I was told

Very good I will wait

For a bodyservant he had one of his own serfs such a grayhaired old man
That servant was perfectly singleminded he didnt know any thing about
beating about the bush So we got into conversation

Well says he what is the use of our living here master and I Hes
squandered all his property and its mighty little honor or good that we
get out of this Petersburg of yours As we started from the country I
thought it would be as it was with the last brin may his soul rest in
peace we would go about with princes and counts and generals he thought
to himself Ill find a countess for a sweetheart and shell have a big
dowry and well live on a big scale But its quite a different thing
from what he expected here we are running about from one tavern to
another as bad off as we could be The Princess Rtishcheva you know is
his own aunt and Prince Borotintsef is his godfather What do you think
He went to see them only once that was at Christmastime he never shows
his nose there Yes and even their people laugh about it to me Why
says they your brin is not a bit like his father And once I take it
upon myself to say to him

Why wouldnt you go sir and visit your aunt They are feeling bad
because you havent been for so long

Its stupid there Demynitch says he Just to think he found his only
amusement here in the saloon If he only would enter the service yet no
he has got entangled with cards and all the rest of it When men get going
that way theres no good in any thing nothing comes to any good
Eekh we are going to the dogs and no mistake The late mistress
may her soul rest in peace left us a rich inheritance no less than a
thousand souls and about three hundred thousand rubles worth of
timberlands He has mortgaged it all sold the timber let the estate go
to rack and ruin and still no money on hand When the master is away of
course the overseer is more than the master What does he care He only
cares to stuff his own pockets

A few days ago a couple of peasants brought complaints from the whole
estate He has wasted the last of the property they say What do you
think he pondered over the complaints and gave the peasants ten rubles
apiece Says he Ill be there very soon I shall have some money and I
will settle all accounts when I come says he

But how can he settle accounts when we are getting into debt all the time
Money or no money yet the winter here has cost eighty thousand rubles and
now there isnt a silver ruble in the house And all owing to his
kindheartedness You see hes such a simple brin that it would be hard
to find his equal thats the very reason that hes going to ruingoing
to ruin all for nothing And the old man almost wept

Nekhliudof woke up about eleven and called me in

They havent sent me any money yet says he But it isnt my fault Shut
the door says he

I shut the door

Here says he take my watch or this diamond pin and pawn it They
will give you more than one hundred and eighty rubles for it and when I
get my money I will redeem it says he

No matter sir says I If you dont happen to have any money its no
consequence let me have the watch if you dont mind I can wait for your
convenience

I can see that the watch is worth more than three hundred

Very good I pawned the watch for a hundred rubles and carried him the
ticket You will owe me eighty rubles says I and you had better redeem
the watch

And so it happened that he still owed me eighty rubles

After that he began to come to us again every day I dont know how matters
stood between him and the prince but at all events he kept coming with him
all the time or else they would go and play cards upstairs with Fedotka
And what queer accounts those three men kept between them this one would
lend money to the other the other to the third yet who it was that owed
the money you never could find out

And in this way he kept on coming our way for wellnigh two years only it
was to be plainly seen that he was a changed man such a devilmaycare
manner he assumed at times He even went so far at times as to borrow a
ruble of me to pay a hackdriver and yet he would still play with the
prince for a hundred rubles stake

He grew gloomy thin sallow As soon as he came he used to order a little
glass of absinthe take a bite of something and drink some port wine and
then he would grow more lively

He came one time before dinner it happened to be carnival time and he
began to play with a hussar

Says he Do you want to play for a stake

Very well says he What shall it be

A bottle of Claude Vougeaux What do you say

All right

Very good The hussar won and they went off for their dinner They sat
down at table and then Nekhliudof says Simon a bottle of Claude
Vougeaux and see that you warm it to the proper point

Simon went out brought in the dinner but no wine

Well says he wheres the wine

Simon hurried out brought in the roast

Let us have the wine says he

Simon makes no reply

Whats got into you Here weve almost finished dinner and no wine Who
wants to drink with dessert

Simon hurried out The landlord says he wants to speak to you

Nekhliudof turned scarlet He sprang up from the table

Whats the need of calling me

The landlord is standing at the door

Says he I cant trust you any more unless you settle my little bill

Well didnt I tell you that I would pay the first of the month

That will be all very well says the landlord but I cant be all the
time giving credit and having no settlement There are more than ten
thousand rubles of debts outstanding now says he

Well thatll do monshoor you know that you can trust me Send the
bottle and I assure you that I will pay you very soon

And he hurried back

What was it Why did they call you out asked the hussar

Oh some one wanted to ask me a question

Now it would be a good time says the hussar to have a little warm wine
to drink

Simon hurry up

Simon came back but still no wine nothing Too bad He left the table
and came to me

For Gods sake says he Petrushka let me have six rubles

He was pale as a sheet No sir says I by God you owe me quite too
much now

I will give forty rubles for six in a weeks time

If only I had it says I I should not think of refusing you but I
havent

What do you think He rushed away his teeth set his fist doubled up and
ran down the corridor like one mad and all at once he gave himself a knock
on the forehead

O my God says he what has it come to

But he did not return to the diningroom he jumped into a carriage and
drove away Didnt we have our laugh over it The hussar asks

Where is the gentleman who was dining with me

He has gone said some one

Where has he gone What message did he leave

He didnt leave any he just took to his carriage and went off

Thats a fine way of entertaining a man says he

Now thinks I to myself itll be a long time before he comes again after
this that is on account of this scandal But no On the next day he came
about evening He came into the billiardroom He had a sort of a box in
his hand Took off his overcoat

Now let us have a game says he

He looked out from under his eyebrows rather fierce like

We played a game Thats enough now says he go and bring me a pen and
paper I must write a letter

Not thinking any thing not suspecting any thing I bring some paper and
put it on the table in the little room

Its all ready sir says I

Very good He sat down at the table He kept on writing and writing and
muttering to himself all the time then he jumps up and frowning says
Look and see if my carriage has come yet

It was on a Friday during carnival time and so there werent any of the
customers on hand they were all at some ball I went to see about the
carriage and just as I was going out of the door Petrushka Petrushka
he shouted as if something suddenly frightened him

I turn round I see hes pale as a sheet standing here and looking at me

Did you call me sir says I

He makes no reply

What do you want says I

He says nothing Oh yes says he Lets have another game

Then says he Havent I learned to play pretty well

He had just won the game Yes says I

All right says he go now and see about my carriage He himself
walked up and down the room

Without thinking any thing I went down to the door I didnt see any
carriage at all I started to go up again

Just as I am going up I hear what sounds like the thud of a billiardcue
I go into the billiardroom I notice a peculiar smell

I look around and there he is lying on the floor in a pool of blood with
a pistol beside him I was so scared that I could not speak a word

He keeps twitching twitching his leg and stretched himself a little Then
he sort of snored and stretched out his full length in such a strange way
And God knows why such a sin came abouthow it was that it occurred to
him to ruin his own soulbut as to what he left written on this paper I
dont understand it at all Truly you can never account for what is going
on in the world

                                   

God gave me all that a man can desirewealth name intellect noble
aspirations I wanted to enjoy myself and I trod in the mire all that was
best in me I have done nothing dishonorable I am not unfortunate I have
not committed any crime but I have done worse I have destroyed my
feelings my intellect my youth I became entangled in a filthy net from
which I could not escape and to which I could not accustom myself I feel
that I am falling lower and lower every moment and I cannot stop my fall

And what ruined me Was there in me some strange passion which I might
plead as an excuse No

My recollections are pleasant One fearful moment of forgetfulness which
can never be erased from my mind led me to come to my senses I shuddered
when I saw what a measureless abyss separated me from what I desired to be
and might have been In my imagination arose the hopes the dreams and the
thoughts of my youth

Where are those lofty thoughts of life of eternity of God which at
times filled my soul with light and strength Where that aimless power of
love which kindled my heart with its comforting warmth

But how good and happy I might have been had I trodden that path which
at the very entrance of life was pointed out to me by my fresh mind and
true feelings More than once did I try to go from the ruts in which my
life ran into that sacred path

I said to myself Now I will use my whole strength of will and yet I
could not do it When I happened to be alone I felt awkward and timid
When I was with others I no longer heard the inward voice and I fell all
the time lower and lower

At last I came to a terrible conviction that it was impossible for me to
lift myself from this low plane I ceased to think about it and I wished
to forget all but hopeless repentance worried me still more and more
Then for the first time the thought of suicide occurred to me

I once thought that the nearness of death would rouse my soul I was
mistaken In a quarter of an hour I shall be no more yet my view has not
in the least changed I see with the same eyes I hear with the same ears
I think the same thoughts there is the same strange incoherence
unsteadiness and lightness in my thoughts




ALBERT

A STORY




I

Five rich young men went at three oclock in the morning to a ball in
Petersburg to have a good time

Much champagne was drunk a majority of the gentlemen were very young the
girls were pretty a pianist and a fiddler played indefatigably one polka
after another there was no cease to the noise of conversation and dancing
But there was a sense of awkwardness and constraint every one felt somehow
or otherand this is not unusualthat all was not as it should be

There were several attempts made to make things more lively but simulated
liveliness is much worse than melancholy

One of the five young men who was more discontented than any one else
both with himself and with the others and who had been feeling all the
evening a sense of disgust took his hat and went out noiselessly on
purpose intending to go home

There was no one in the anteroom but in the next room at the door he
heard two voices disputing The young man paused and listened

It is impossible there are guests in there said a womans voice

Come let me in please I will not do any harm urged a man in a gentle
voice

Indeed I will not without madames permission said the woman Where are
you going Oh what a man you are

The door was flung open and on the threshold appeared the figure of a
stranger Seeing a guest the maid ceased to detain the man and the
stranger timidly bowing came into the room with a somewhat unsteady gait

He was a man of medium stature with a lank crooked back and long
dishevelled hair He wore a short paletot and tight ragged pantaloons over
coarse dirty boots His necktie twisted into a string exposed his long
white neck His shirt was filthy and the sleeves came down over his lean
hands

But notwithstanding his thoroughly emaciated body his face was attractive
and fair and a fresh color even mantled his cheeks under his thin dark
beard and sidewhiskers His dishevelled locks thrown back exposed a low
and remarkably pure forehead His dark languid eyes looked unswervingly
forward with an expression of serenity submission and sweetness which
made a fascinating combination with the expression of his fresh curved
lips visible under his thin moustache

Advancing a few steps he paused turned to the young man and smiled He
found it apparently rather hard to smile But his face was so lighted up by
it that the young man without knowing why smiled in return

Who is that man he asked of the maid in a whisper as the stranger
walked toward the room where the dancing was going on

A crazy musician from the theatre replied the maid He sometimes comes
to call upon madame

Where are you going Delesof some one at this moment called from the
drawingroom

The young man who was called Delesof returned to the drawingroom The
musician was now standing at the door and as his eyes fell on the
dancers he showed by his smile and by the beating of his foot how much
pleasure this spectacle afforded him

Wont you come and have a dance too said one of the guests to him The
musician bowed and looked at the hostess inquiringly

Come come Why not since the gentlemen have invited you said the
hostess The musicians thin weak face suddenly assumed an expression of
decision and smiling and winking and shuffling his feet he awkwardly
clumsily went to join the dancers in the drawingroom

In the midst of a quadrille a jolly officer who was dancing very
beautifully and with great liveliness accidentally hit the musician in the
back His weak weary legs lost their equilibrium and the musician making
ineffectual struggles to keep his balance measured his length on the
floor

Notwithstanding the sharp hard sound made by his fall almost everybody at
the first moment laughed

But the musician did not rise The guests grew silent even the piano
ceased to sound Delesof and the hostess were the first to reach the
prostrate musician He was lying on his elbow and gloomily looking at the
ground When he had been lifted to his feet and set in a chair he threw
back his hair from his forehead with a quick motion of his bony hand and
began to smile without replying to the questions that were put

Mr Albert Mr Albert exclaimed the hostess Were you hurt Where
Now I told you that you had better not try to dance He is so weak
she added addressing her guests It takes all his strength

Who is he some one asked the hostess

A poor man an artist A very nice young fellow but hes a sad case as
you can see

She said this without paying the least heed to the musicians presence He
suddenly opened his eyes as though frightened at something collected
himself and remarked to those who were standing about him Its nothing
at all said he suddenly arising from the chair with evident effort

And in order to show that he had suffered no injury he went into the
middle of the room and was going to dance but he tottered and would have
fallen again had he not been supported

Everybody felt constrained All looked at him and no one spoke The
musicians glance again lost its vivacity and apparently forgetting that
any one was looking he put his hand to his knee Suddenly he raised his
head advanced one faltering foot and with the same awkward gesture as
before tossed back his hair and went to a violincase and took out the
instrument

It was nothing at all said he again waving the violin Gentlemen we
will have a little music

What a strange face said the guests among themselves

Maybe there is great talent lurking in that unhappy creature said one of
them

Yes its a sad casea sad case said another

What a lovely face There is something extraordinary about it said
Delesof Let us have a look at him


II

Albert by this time not paying attention to any one had raised his violin
to his shoulder and was slowly crossing over to the piano and tuning his
instrument His lips were drawn into an expression of indifference his
eyes were almost shut but his lank bony back his long white neck his
crooked legs and disorderly black hair presented a strange but somehow not
entirely ridiculous appearance After he had tuned his violin he struck a
quick chord and throwing back his head turned to the pianist who was
waiting to accompany him Melancholie G sharp he said turning to the
pianist with a peremptory gesture And immediately after as though in
apology for his peremptory gesture he smiled sweetly and with the same
smile turned to his audience again

Tossing back his hair with the hand that held the bow Albert stood at one
side of the piano and with a flowing motion of the bow touched the
strings Through the room there swept a pure harmonious sound which
instantly brought absolute silence

At first it was as though a ray of unexpectedly brilliant light had
flashed across the inner world of each hearers consciousness and the
notes of the theme immediately followed pouring forth abundant and
beautiful

Not one discordant or imperfect note distracted the attention of the
listeners All the tones were clear beautiful and full of meaning All
silently with trembling expectation followed the development of the
theme From a state of tedium of noisy gayety or of deep drowsiness into
which these people had fallen they were suddenly transported to a world
whose existence they had forgotten

In one instant there arose in their souls now a sentiment as though they
were contemplating the past now of passionate remembrance of some
happiness now the boundless longing for power and glory now the feelings
of humility of unsatisfied love and of melancholy

Now bittersweet now vehemently despairing the notes freely
intermingling poured forth and poured forth so sweetly so powerfully
and so spontaneously that it was not so much that sounds were heard as
that some sort of beautiful stream of poetry long known but now for the
first time expressed gushed through the soul

At each note that he played Albert grew taller and taller At a little
distance he had no appearance of being either crippled or peculiar
Pressing the violin to his chin and with an expression of listening with
passionate attention to the tones that he produced he convulsively moved
his feet Now he straightened himself up to his full height now
thoughtfully leaned forward

His left hand curving over spasmodically on the strings seemed as though
it had swooned in its position while it was only the bony fingers that
changed about spasmodically the right hand moved smoothly gracefully
without effort

His face shone with complete enthusiastic delight his eyes gleamed with a
radiant steely light his nostrils quivered his red lips were parted in
rapture

Sometimes his head bent down closer to his violin his eyes almost closed
and his face half shaded by his long locks lighted up with a smile of
genuine blissfulness Sometimes he quickly straightened himself up changed
from one leg to the other and his pure forehead and the radiant look
which he threw around the room were alive with pride greatness and the
consciousness of power Once the pianist made a mistake and struck a false
chord Physical pain was apparent in the whole form and face of the
musician He paused for a second and with an expression of childish anger
stamped his foot and cried Moll ce moll The pianist corrected his
mistake Albert closed his eyes smiled and again forgetting himself and
everybody else gave himself up with beatitude to his work Everybody who
was in the room while Albert was playing preserved an attentive silence
and seemed to live and breathe only in the music

The gay officer sat motionless in a chair by the window with his eyes
fixed upon the floor and drawing long heavy sighs The girls awed by the
universal silence sat along by the walls only occasionally exchanging
glances expressive of satisfaction or perplexity

The fat smiling face of the hostess was radiant with happiness The pianist
kept his eyes fixed on Alberts face and while his whole figure from head
to foot showed his solicitude lest he should make some mistake he did his
best to follow him One of the guests who had been drinking more heavily
than the rest lay at full length on the sofa and tried not to move lest
he should betray his emotion Delesof experienced an unusual sensation It
seemed as though an icy band now contracting now expanding were pressed
upon his head The roots of his hair seemed endued with consciousness the
cold shivers ran down his back something rose higher and higher in his
throat his nose and palate were full of little needles and the tears
stole down his cheeks

He shook himself tried to swallow them back and wipe them away without
attracting attention but fresh tears followed and streamed down his face
By some sort of strange association of impressions the first tones of
Alberts violin carried Delesof back to his early youth

Old before his time weary of life a broken man he suddenly felt as
though he were a boy of seventeen again selfsatisfied and handsome
blissfully dull unconsciously happy He remembered his first love for his
cousin who wore a pink dress he remembered his first confession of it in
the linden alley he remembered the warmth and the inexpressible charm of
the fortuitous kiss he remembered the immensity and enigmatical mystery of
Nature as it surrounded them then

In his imagination as it went back in its flight she gleamed in a mist
of indefinite hopes of incomprehensible desires and the indubitable faith
in the possibility of impossible happiness All the priceless moments of
that time one after the other arose before him not like unmeaning
instants of the fleeting present but like the immutable fullformed
reproachful images of the past

He contemplated them with rapture and weptwept not because the time had
passed and he might have spent it more profitably if that time had been
given to him again he would not have spent it any more profitably but he
wept because it had passed and would never return His recollections
evolved themselves without effort and Alberts violin was their
mouthpiece It said They have passed forever passed the days of thy
strength of love and of happiness passed forever and never will return
Weep for them shed all thy tears let thy life pass in tears for these
days this is the only and best happiness that remains to thee

At the end of the next variation Alberts face grew serene his eyes
flushed great clear drops of sweat poured down his cheeks The veins
swelled on his forehead his whole body swayed more and more his pale lips
were parted and his whole figure expressed an enthusiastic craving for
enjoyment Despairingly swaying with his whole body and throwing back his
hair he laid down his violin and with a smile of proud satisfaction and
happiness gazed at the bystanders Then his back assumed its ordinary
curve his head sank his lips grew set his eyes lost their fire and as
though he were ashamed of himself timidly glancing round and stumbling
he went into the next room


III

Something strange came over all the audience and something strange was
noticeable in the dead silence that succeeded Alberts playing It was as
though each desired and yet dared not to acknowledge the meaning of it
all

What did it meanthis brightly lighted warm room these brilliant women
the dawn just appearing at the windows these hurrying pulses and the pure
impressions made by the fleeting tones of music But no one ventured to
acknowledge the meaning of it all on the contrary almost all feeling
incapable of throwing themselves completely under the influence of what the
new impression concealed from them rebelled against it

Well now he plays mighty well said the officer

Wonderfully replied Delesof stealthily wiping his cheek with his
sleeve

One thing sure its time to be going gentlemen said the gentleman who
had been lying on the sofa straightening himself up a little Well have
to give him something gentlemen Let us make a collection

At this time Albert was sitting alone in the next room on the sofa As he
supported himself with his elbows on his bony knees he smoothed his face
with his dirty sweaty hand tossed back his hair and smiled at his own
happy thoughts

A large collection was taken up and Delesof was chosen to present it
Aside from this Delesof who had been so keenly and unwontedly affected by
the music had conceived the thought of conferring some benefit upon this
man

It came into his head to take him home with him to feed him to establish
him somewherein other words to lift him from his vile position

Well are you tired asked Delesof approaching him Albert replied with
a smile You have creative talent you ought seriously to devote yourself
to music to play in public

I should like to have something to drink exclaimed Albert as though
suddenly waking up

Delesof brought him some wine and the musician greedily drained two
glasses

What splendid wine he exclaimed

What a lovely thing that Melancholie is said Delesof

Oh yes yes replied Albert with a smile But pardon me I do not know
with whom I have the honor to be talking maybe you are a count or a
prince Couldnt you let me have a little money He paused for a moment
I have nothingI am a poor man I couldnt pay it back to you

Delesof flushed grew embarrassed and hastened to hand the musician the
money that had been collected for him

Very much obliged to you said Albert seizing the money Now let us
have some more music I will play for you as much as you wish Only let me
have something to drink something to drink he repeated as he started to
his feet

Delesof gave him some more wine and asked him to sit down by him

Pardon me if I am frank with you said Delesof Your talent has
interested me so much It seems to me that you are in a wretched position

Albert glanced now at Delesof now at the hostess who just then came into
the room

Permit me to help you continued Delesof If you need any thing then I
should be very glad if you would come and stay with me for a while I live
alone and maybe I could be of some service to you

Albert smiled and made no reply

Why dont you thank him said the hostess It seems to me that this
would be a capital thing for youOnly I would not advise you she
continued turning to Delesof and shaking her head warningly

Very much obliged to you said Albert seizing Delesofs hand with both
his moist ones Only now let us have some music please

But the rest of the guests were already making their preparations to
depart and as Albert did not address them they came out into the
anteroom

Albert bade the hostess farewell and having taken his worn hat with wide
brim and a last summers alma viva which composed his only protection
against the winter he went with Delesof down the steps

As soon as Delesof took his seat in his carriage with his new friend and
became conscious of that unpleasant odor of intoxication and filthiness
exhaled by the musician he began to repent of the step that he had taken
and to curse himself for his childish softness of heart and lack of reason
Moreover all that Albert said was so foolish and in such bad taste and he
seemed so near a sudden state of beastly intoxication that Delesof was
disgusted What shall I do with him he asked himself

After they had been driving for a quarter of an hour Albert relapsed into
silence took off his hat and laid it on his knee then threw himself into
a corner of the carriage and began to snore The wheels crunched
monotonously over the frozen snow the feeble light of dawn scarcely made
its way through the frosty windows

Delesof glanced at his companion His long body wrapped in his mantle lay
almost lifeless near him It seemed to him that a long head with large
black nose was swaying on his trunk but on examining more closely he
perceived that what he took to be nose and face was the mans hair and
that his actual face was lower down

He bent over and studied the features of Alberts face Then the beauty of
his brow and of his peacefully closed mouth once more charmed him Under
the influence of nervous excitement caused by the sleepless hours of the
long night and the music Delesof as he looked at that face was once more
carried back to the blessed world of which he had caught a glimpse once
before that night again he remembered the happy and magnanimous time of
his youth and he ceased to repent of his rashness At that moment he loved
Albert truly and warmly and firmly resolved to be a benefactor to him


IV

The next morning when Delesof was awakened to go to his office he saw
with an unpleasant feeling of surprise his old screen his old servant
and his clock on the table

What did I expect to see if not the usual objects that surround me he
asked himself

Then he recollected the musicians black eyes and happy smile the motive
of the Melancholie and all the strange experiences of the night came back
into his consciousness It was never his way however to reconsider
whether he had done wisely or foolishly in taking the musician home with
him After he had dressed he carefully laid out his plans for the day he
took some paper wrote out some necessary directions for the house and
hastily put on his cloak and galoshes

As he went by the diningroom he glanced in at the door Albert with his
face buried in the pillow and lying at full length in his dirty tattered
shirt was buried in the profoundest slumber on the saffron sofa where in
absolute unconsciousness he had been laid the night before

Delesof felt that something was not right it disturbed him Please go for
me to Boriuzovsky and borrow his violin for a day or two said he to his
man and when he wakes up bring him some coffee and get him some clean
linen and some old suit or other of mine Fix him up as well as you can
please

When he returned home in the afternoon Delesof to his surprise found
that Albert was not there

Where is he he asked of his man

He went out immediately after dinner replied the servant He took the
violin and went out saying that he would be back again in an hour but
since that time we have not seen him

Ta ta how provoking said Delesof Why did you let him go Zakhr

Zakhr was a Petersburg lackey who had been in Delesofs service for eight
years Delesof as a single young bachelor could not help intrusting him
with his plans and he liked to get his judgment in regard to each of his
undertakings

How should I have ventured to detain him replied Zakhr playing with
his watchcharms If you had intimated Dmitri Ivnovitch that you wished
me to keep him here I might have kept him at home But you only spoke of
his wardrobe

Ta how vexatious Well what has he been doing while I was out

Zakhr smiled

Indeed hes a real artist as you may say Dmitri Ivnovitch As soon as
he woke up he asked for some madeira then he began to keep the cook and me
pretty busy Such an absurd However hes a very interesting character
I brought him some tea got some dinner ready for him but he would not eat
alone so he asked me to sit down with him But when he began to play on
the fiddle then I knew that you would not find many such artists at
Izlers One might well keep such a man When he played Down the Little
Mother Volga for us why it was enough to make a man weep It was too
good for any thing The people from all the floors came down into our
entry to listen

Well did you give him some clothes asked the brin

Certainly I did I gave him your dressshirt and I put on him an overcoat
of mine You want to help such a man as that hes a fine fellow Zakhr
smiled He asked me what rank you were and if you had had important
acquaintances and how many souls of peasantry you had

Very good but now we must send and find him and henceforth dont give
him any thing to drink otherwise youll do him more harm than good

That is true said Zakhr in assent He doesnt seem in very robust
health we used to have an overseer who like him

Delesof who had already long ago heard the story of the drunken overseer
did not give Zakhr time to finish but bade him make every thing ready for
the night and then go out and bring the musician back

He threw himself down on his bed and put out the candle but it was long
before he fell asleep for thinking about Albert

This may seem strange to some of my friends said Delesof to himself
but how seldom it is that I can do any thing for any one beside myself
and I ought to thank God for a chance when one presents itself I will not
send him away I will do every thing at least every thing that I can to
help him Maybe he is not absolutely crazy but only inclined to get drunk
It certainly will not cost me very much Where one is there is always
enough to satisfy two Let him live with me a while and then we will find
him a place or get him up a concert well help him off the shoals and
then there will be time enough to see what will come of it An agreeable
sense of selfsatisfaction came over him after making this resolution

Certainly I am not a bad man I might say I am far from being a bad man
he thought I might go so far as to say that I am a good man when I
compare myself with others

He was just dropping off to sleep when the sound of opening doors and
steps in the anteroom roused him again Well shall I treat him rather
severely he asked himself I suppose that is best and I ought to do
it

He rang

Well did you find him he asked of Zakhr who answered his call

Hes a poor wretched fellow Dmitri Ivnovitch said Zakhr shaking his
head significantly and closing his eyes

What is he drunk

Very weak

Had he the violin with him

I brought it the lady gave it to me

All right Now please dont bring him to me tonight let him sleep it
off and tomorrow dont under any circumstances let him out of the house

But before Zakhr had time to leave the room Albert came in


V

You dont mean to say that youve gone to bed at this time said Albert
with a smile I was there again at Anna Ivnovnas I spent a very
pleasant evening We had music told stories there was a very pleasant
company there Please let me have a glass of something to drink he added
seizing a carafe of water that stood on the table only not water

Albert was just as he had been the night beforethe same lovely smiling
eyes and lips the same fresh inspired brow and weak features Zakhrs
overcoat fitted him as though it had been made for him and the clean
tall stifflystarched collar of the dressshirt picturesquely fitted
around his delicate white neck giving him a peculiarly childlike and
innocent appearance

He sat down on Delesofs bed smiling with pleasure and gratitude and
looked at him without speaking Delesof gazed into Alberts eyes and
suddenly felt himself once under the sway of that smile All desire for
sleep vanished from him he forgot his resolution to be stern on the
contrary he felt like having a gay time to hear some music and to talk
confidentially with Albert till morning Delesof bade Zakhr bring a bottle
of wine cigarettes and the violin

This is excellent said Albert Its early yet well have a little
music I will play whatever you like

Zakhr with evident satisfaction brought a bottle of Lafitte two
glasses some mild cigarettes such as Albert smoked and the violin But
instead of going off to bed as his brin bade him he lighted a cigar and
sat down in the next room

Let us talk instead said Delesof to the musician who was beginning to
tune the violin

Albert sat down submissively on the bed and smiled pleasantly

Oh yes said he suddenly striking his forehead with his hand and
putting on an expression of anxious curiosity The expression of his face
always foretold what he was going to say I wanted to ask youhe
hesitated a littlethat gentleman who was there with you last
evening You called him N Was he the son of the celebrated N

His own son replied Delesof not understanding at all what Albert could
find of interest in him

Indeed he exclaimed smiling with satisfaction I instantly noticed
that there was something peculiarly aristocratic in his manners I love
aristocrats There is something splendid and elegant about an aristocrat
And that officer who danced so beautifully he went on to ask He also
pleased me very much he was so gay and noble looking It seems he is
called Adjutant N N

Who asked Delesof

The one who ran into me when we were dancing He must be a splendid man

No he is a silly fellow replied Delesof

Oh no it cant be rejoined Albert hotly Theres something very very
pleasant about him And hes a fine musician added Albert He played
something from an opera Its a long time since I have seen any one who
pleased me so much

Yes he plays very well but I dont like his playing said Delesof
anxious to bring his companion to talk about music He does not understand
classic music but only Donizetti and Bellini and thats no music you
know You agree with me dont you

Oh no no Pardon me replied Albert with a gentle expression of
vindication The old music is music but modern music is music too And in
the modern music there are extraordinarily beautiful things Now
Somnambula and the finale of Lucia and Chopin and Robert I
often thinkhe hesitated apparently collecting his thoughtsthat if
Beethoven were alive he would weep tears of joy to hear Somnambula Its
so beautiful all through I heard Somnambula first when Viardot and
Rubini were here That was something worth while he said with shining
eyes and making a gesture with both hands as though he were casting
something from his breast Id give a good deal but it would be
impossible to bring it back

Well but how do you like the opera nowadays asked Delesof

Bosio is good very good was his reply exquisite beyond words but she
does not touch me here he said pointing to his sunken chest A singer
must have passion and she hasnt any She is enjoyable but she doesnt
torture you

Well how about Lablache

I heard him in Paris in The Barber of Seville Then he was the only
one but now he is old He cant be an artist he is old

Well supposing he is old still he is fine in morceaux densemble
said Delesof still speaking of Lablache

Who said that he was old said Albert severely He cant be old The
artist can never be old Much is needed in an artist but fire most of
all he declared with glistening eyes and raising both hands in the air
And indeed a terrible inner fire seemed to glow throughout his whole
frame Ah my God he exclaimed suddenly You dont know Petrof do
youPetrof the artist

No I dont know him replied Delesof with a smile

How I wish that you and he might become acquainted You would enjoy
talking with him How he does understand art He and I often used to meet
at Anna Ivnovnas but now she is vexed with him for some reason or other
But I really wish that you might make his acquaintance He has great great
talent

Oh Does he paint pictures asked Delesof

I dont know No I think not but he was an artist of the Academy What
thoughts he had Whenever he talks it is wonderful Oh Petrof has great
talent only he leads a very gay life Its too bad said Albert with a
smile The next moment he got up from the bed took the violin and began
to play

Have you been at the opera lately asked Delesof

Albert looked round and sighed

Ah I have not been able to he said clutching his head Again he sat
down by Delesof I will tell you he went on to say almost in a whisper
I cant go I cant play there I have nothing nothing at allno
clothes no home no violin Its a wretched lifea wretched life he
repeated the phrase Yes and why have I got into such a state Why
indeed It ought not to have been said he smiling Akh Don Juan

And he struck his head

Now let us have something to eat said Delesof

Albert without replying sprang up seized the violin and began to play
the finale of the first act of Don Juan accompanying it with a
description of the scene in the opera

Delesof felt the hair stand up on his head when he played the voice of the
dying commander

No I cannot play tonight said Albert laying down the instrument I
have been drinking too much But immediately after he went to the table
poured out a brimming glass of wine drank it at one gulp and again sat
down on the bed near Delesof

Delesof looked steadily at Albert The latter occasionally smiled and
Delesof returned his smile Neither of them spoke but the glance and smile
brought them close together into a reciprocity of affection Delesof felt
that he was growing constantly fonder and fonder of this man and he
experienced an inexpressible pleasure

Were you ever in love he asked suddenly Albert remained sunk in thought
for a few seconds then his face lighted up with a melancholy smile He
bent over toward Delesof and gazed straight into his eyes

Why did you ask me that question he whispered But I will tell you all
about it I like you he added after a few moments of thought and
glancing around I will not deceive you I will tell you all just as it
was from the beginning He paused and his eyes took on a strange wild
appearance You know that I am weak in judgment he said suddenly Yes
yes he continued Anna Ivnovna has told you about it She tells
everybody that I am crazy It isnt true she says it for a joke she is a
good woman but I really have not been quite well for some time Albert
paused again and stood up gazing with wideopened eyes at the dark door
You asked me if I had ever been in love Yes I have been in love he
whispered raising his brows That happened long ago it was at a time
when I still had a place at the theatre I went to play second violin at
the opera and she came into a parquet box at the left

Albert stood up and bent over to Delesofs ear But no said he why
should I mention her name You probably know her everybody knows her I
said nothing but simply looked at her I knew that I was a poor artist
and she an aristocratic lady I knew that very well I only looked at her
and had no thoughts

Albert paused for a moment as though making sure of his recollections

How it happened I know not but I was invited once to accompany her on my
violin Now I was only a poor artist he repeated shaking his head and
smiling But no I cannot tell you I cannot he exclaimed again
clutching his head How happy I was

What did you go to her house often asked Delesof

Once only once But it was my own fault I wasnt in my right mind I
was a poor artist and she an aristocratic lady I ought not to have spoken
to her But I lost my senses I committed a folly Petrof told me the
truth It would have been better only to have seen her at the theatre

What did you do asked Delesof

Ah wait wait I cannot tell you that

And hiding his face in his hands he said nothing for some time

I was late at the orchestra Petrof and I had been drinking that evening
and I was excited She was sitting in her box and talking with some
general I dont know who that general was She was sitting at the very
edge of the box with her arm resting on the rim She wore a white dress
with pearls on her neck She was talking with him but she looked at me
Twice she looked at me She had arranged her hair in such a becoming way I
stopped playing and stood near the bass and gazed at her Then for the
first time something strange took place in me She smiled on the general
but she looked at me I felt certain that she was talking about me and
suddenly I seemed to be not in my place in the orchestra but was standing
in her box and seizing her hand in that place What was the meaning of
that asked Albert after a moments silence

A powerful imagination said Delesof

No no  I cannot tell said Albert frowning Even then I was poor I
hadnt any room and when I went to the theatre I sometimes used to sleep
there

What in the theatre asked Delesof

Ah I am not afraid of these stupid things Ah just wait a moment As
soon as everybody was gone I went to that box where she had been sitting
and slept there That was my only pleasure How many nights I spent there
Only once again did I have that experience At night many things seemed to
come to me But I cannot tell you much about them Albert contracted his
brows and looked at Delesof What did it mean he asked

It was strange replied the other

No wait wait he bent over to his ear and said in a whisper

I kissed her hand wept there before her and said many things to her I
heard the fragrance of her sighs I heard her voice She said many things
to me that one night Then I took my violin and began to play softly And
I played beautifully But it became terrible to me I am not afraid of such
stupid things and I dont believe in them but my head felt terribly he
said smiling sweetly and moving his hand over his forehead It seemed
terrible to me on account of my poor mind something happened in my head
Maybe it was nothing what do you think

Neither spoke for several minutes

    Und wenn die Wolken sie verhllen
    Die Sonne bleibt doch ewig klar

hummed Albert smiling gently That is true isnt it he asked

    Ich auch habe gelebt und genossen

Footnote 

    Een though the clouds may veil it
      The sun shines ever clear



Footnote 

    I also have lived and rejoiced



Ah old man Petrof how this would have made things clear to you

Delesof in silence and with dismay looked at his companions excited and
colorless face

Do you know the Juristen waltzes suddenly asked Albert in a loud voice
and without waiting for an answer jumped up seized the violin and began
to play the waltz In absolute selfforgetfulness and evidently imagining
that a whole orchestra was playing for him Albert smiled began to dance
to shuffle his feet and to play admirably

Hey we will have a good time he exclaimed as he ended and waved his
violin I am going said he after sitting down in silence for a little
Wont you come along too

Where asked Delesof in surprise

Let us go to Anna Ivnovnas again Its gay therebustle people
music

Delesof for a moment was almost persuaded However coming to his senses
he promised Albert that he would go with him the next day

I should like to go this minute

Indeed I wouldnt go

Albert sighed and laid down the violin

Shall I stay then He looked over at the table but the wine was gone
and so wishing him a goodnight he left the room

Delesof rang Look here said he to Zakhr dont let Mr Albert go
anywhere without asking me about it first


VI

The next day was a holiday Delesof on waking sat in his parlor drinking
his coffee and reading a book Albert who was in the next room had not
yet moved Zakhr discreetly opened the door and looked into the
diningroom

Would you believe it Dmitri Ivnovitch there he lies asleep on the bare
sofa I would not send him away for any thing God knows Hes like a
little child Indeed hes an artist

At twelve oclock there was a sound of yawning and coughing on the other
side of the door

Zakhr again crept into the diningroom and the brin heard his wheedling
voice and Alberts gentle beseeching voice

Well how is he asked Delesof when Zakhr came out

He feels blue Dmitri Ivnovitch He doesnt want to get dressed Hes so
cross All he asks for is something to drink

Now if we are to get hold of him we must strengthen his character said
Delesof to himself And forbidding Zakhr to give him any wine he again
devoted himself to his book in spite of himself however listening all
the time for developments in the diningroom

But there was no movement there only occasionally were heard a heavy chest
cough and spitting Two hours passed Delesof after dressing to go out
resolved to look in upon his guest Albert was sitting motionless at the
window leaning his head on his hands

He looked round His face was sallow morose and not only melancholy but
deeply unhappy He tried to welcome his host with a smile but his face
assumed a still more woebegone expression It seemed as though he were on
the point of tears

With effort he stood up and bowed If I might have just a little glass of
simple vodka he exclaimed with a supplicating expression I am so weak
If you please

Coffee will be more strengthening I would advise you

Alberts face lost its childish expression he gazed coldly sadly out of
the window and fell back into the chair

Wouldnt you like some breakfast

No thank you I havent any appetite

If you want to play on the violin you will not disturb me said Delesof
laying the instrument on the table Albert looked at the violin with a
contemptuous smile

No I am too weak I cannot play he said and pushed the instrument from
him

After that in reply to all Delesofs propositions to go to walk to go to
the theatre in the evening or any thing else he only shook his head
mournfully and refused to speak

Delesof went out made a few calls dined out and before the theatre hour
he returned to his rooms to change his attire and find out how the musician
was getting along

Albert was sitting in the dark anteroom and with his head resting on his
hand was gazing at the heated stove He was neatly dressed washed and
combed but his eyes were sad and vacant and his whole form expressed even
more weakness and debility than in the morning

Well have you had dinner Mr Albert asked Delesof

Albert nodded his head and after looking with a terrified expression at
Delesof dropped his eyes It made Delesof feel uncomfortable

I have been talking today with a manager said he also dropping his
eyes He would be very glad to make terms with you if you would like to
accept an engagement

I thank you but I cannot play said Albert almost in a whisper and he
went into his room and closed the door as softly as possible After a few
minutes lifting the latch as softly as possible he came out of the room
bringing the violin Casting a sharp angry look at Delesof he laid the
instrument on the table and again disappeared

Delesof shrugged his shoulders and smiled

What am I to do now Wherein am I to blame he asked himself

Well how is the musician was his first question when he returned home
late that evening

Bad was Zakhrs short and ringing reply He sighs all the time and
coughs and says nothing at all only he has asked for vodka four or five
times and once I gave him some How can we avoid killing him this way
Dmitri Ivnovitch That was the way the overseer

Well hasnt he played on the fiddle

Didnt even touch it I took it to him twiceWell he took it up slowly
and carried it out said Zakhr with a smile Do you still bid me refuse
him something to drink

Dont give him any thing today well see whatll come of it What is he
doing now

He has shut himself into the parlor

Delesof went into his library took down a few French books and the
Testament in German Put these books tomorrow in his room and look out
dont let him get away said he to Zakhr

The next morning Zakhr informed his brin that the musician had not slept
a wink all night He kept walking up and down his rooms and going to the
sideboard to try to open the cupboard and door but every thing in spite
of his efforts remained locked

Zakhr told how while he was going to sleep he heard Albert muttering to
himself in the darkness and gesticulating

                                   

Each day Albert grew more gloomy and taciturn It seemed as though he were
afraid of Delesof and his face expressed painful terror whenever their
eyes met He did not touch either book or violin and made no replies to
the questions put to him

On the third day after the musician came to stay with him Delesof returned
home late in the evening tired and worried He had been on the go all day
attending to his duties Though they had seemed very simple and easy yet
as is often the case he had not made any progress at all in spite of his
strenuous endeavors Afterwards he had stopped at the club and lost at
whist He was out of spirits

Well God be with him he replied to Zakhr who had been telling him of
Alberts pitiable state Tomorrow I shall be really worried about him Is
he willing or not to stay with me and follow my advice No Then its
idle I have done the best that I could

Thats what comes of trying to be a benefactor to people said he to
himself I am putting myself to inconvenience for him I have taken this
filthy creature into my rooms which keeps me from receiving strangers in
the morning I work and trot and yet he looks upon me as some enemy who
against his will would keep him in pound But the worst is that he is not
willing to take a step in his own behalf Thats the way with them all

That word all referred to people in general and especially to those with
whom he had been associated in business that day But what is to be done
for him now What is he contemplating Why is he melancholy Is he
melancholy on account of the debauch from which I rescued him on account
of the degradation in which he has been the humiliation from which I saved
him Can it be that he has fallen so low that it is a burden for him to
look on a pure life

No this was a childish action reasoned Delesof Why should I undertake
to direct others when it is as much as I can do to manage my own affairs

The impulse came over him to let him go immediately but after a little
deliberation he postponed it till the morning

During the night Delesof was aroused by the noise of a falling table in the
anteroom and the sound of voices and stamping feet

Just wait a little I will tell Dmitri Ivnovitch said Zakhrs voice
Alberts voice replied passionately and incoherently

Delesof leaped up and went with a candle into the anteroom Zakhr in his
nightdress was standing against the door Albert in cap and alma viva was
trying to pull him away and was screaming at him in a pathetic voice

You have no right to detain me I have a passport I have not stolen any
thing from you You must let me go I will go to the police

I beg of you Dmitri Ivnovitch said Zakhr turning to his brin and
continuing to stand guard at the door He got up in the night found the
key in my overcoatpocket and he has drunk up the whole decanter of sweet
vodka Was that good And now he wants to go You didnt give me orders
and so I could not let him out

Albert seeing Delesof began to pull still more violently on Zakhr No
one has the right to detain me He cannot do it he screamed raising his
voice more and more

Let him go Zakhr said Delesof I do not wish to detain you and I
have no right to but I advise you to stay till tomorrow he added
addressing Albert

No one has the right to detain me I am going to the police screamed
Albert more and more furiously addressing only Zakhr and not heeding
Delesof Guard he suddenly shouted at the top of his voice

Now what are you screaming like that for You see you are free to go
said Zakhr opening the door

Albert ceased screaming How did they dare They were going to murder me
No he muttered to himself as he put on his galoshes Not offering to say
goodby and still muttering something unintelligible he went out of the
door Zakhr accompanied him to the gate and came back

Thank the Lord Dmitri Ivnovitch Any longer would have been a sin said
he to his brin And now we must count the silver

Delesof only shook his head and made no reply There came over him a
lively recollection of the first two evenings which he and the musician had
spent together he remembered the last wretched days which Albert had spent
there and above all he remembered the sweet but absurd sentiment of
wonder of love and of sympathy which had been aroused in him by the very
first sight of this strange man and he began to pity him

What will become of him now he asked himself Without money without
warm clothing alone at midnight He thought of sending Zakhr after him
but now it was too late

Is it cold out doors he asked

A healthy frost Dmitri Ivnovitch replied the man I forgot to tell
you that you will have to buy some more firewood to last till spring

But what did you mean by saying that it would last


VII

Out of doors it was really cold but Albert did not feel it he was so
excited by the wine that he had taken and by the quarrel

As he entered the street he looked around him and rubbed his hands with
pleasure The street was empty but the long lines of lights were still
brilliantly gleaming the sky was clear and beautiful What he cried
addressing the lighted window in Delesofs apartments and then thrusting
his hands in his trousers pockets under his coat and looking straight
ahead he walked with heavy and uncertain steps straight up the street

He felt an absolute weight in his legs and abdomen something hummed in his
head some invisible power seemed to hurl him from side to side but he
still plunged ahead in the direction of where Anna Ivnovna lived

Strange disconnected thoughts rushed through his head Now he remembered
his quarrel with Zakhr now something recalled the sea and his first
voyage in the steamboat to Russia now the merry night that he had spent
with some friend in the wineshop by which he was passing then suddenly
there came to him a familiar air singing itself in his recollections and
he seemed to see the object of his passion and the terrible night in the
theatre

But notwithstanding their incoherence all these recollections presented
themselves before his imaginations with such distinctness that when he
closed his eyes he could not tell which was nearer to the reality what he
was doing or what he was thinking He did not realize and he did not feel
how his legs moved how he staggered and hit against a wall how he looked
around him and how he made his way from street to street

As he went along the Little Morskaya Albert tripped and fell Collecting
himself in a moment he saw before him some huge and magnificent edifice
and he went toward it

In the sky not a star was to be seen nor sign of dawn nor moon neither
were there any streetlights there but all objects were perfectly
distinguishable The windows of the edifice which loomed up at the corner
of the street were brilliantly lighted but the lights wavered like
reflections The building kept coming nearer and nearer clearer and
clearer to Albert

But the lights vanished the moment that Albert entered the wide portals
Inside it was dark He took a few steps under the vaulted ceiling and
something like shades glided by and fled at his approach

Why did I come here wondered Albert but some irresistible power dragged
him forward into the depths of the immense hall

There stood some lofty platform and around it in silence stood what seemed
like little men Who is going to speak asked Albert No one answered
but some one pointed to the platform There stood now on the platform a
tall thin man with bushy hair and dressed in a variegated gown Albert
immediately recognized his friend Petrof

How strange what is he doing here said Albert to himself

No brethren said Petrof pointing to something you did not appreciate
the man while he was living among you you did not appreciate him He was
not a cheap artist not a merely mechanical performer not a crazy ruined
man He was a genius a great musical genius who perished among you
unknown and unvalued

Albert immediately understood of whom his friend was speaking but not
wishing to interrupt him he hung his head modestly He like a sheaf of
straw was wholly consumed by the sacred fire which we all serve
continued the voice But he has completely fulfilled all that God gave
him therefore he ought to be considered a great man You may despise him
torture him humiliate him continued the voice more and more
energetically but he has been is and will be immeasurably higher than
you all He is happy he is good He loved you all alike or cared for you
it is all the same but he has served only that with which he was so highly
endowed He loved one thingbeauty the only infinite good in the world
Oh yes what a man he is Fall all of you before him On your knees
cried Petrof in a thundering voice

But another voice mildly answered from another corner of the hall I do
not wish to bow my knee before him said the voice

Albert instantly recognized Delesof

Why is he great And why should we bow before him Has he conducted
himself in an honorable and righteous manner Has he brought society any
advantage Do we not know how he borrowed money and never returned it
how he carried off a violin that belonged to a brother artist and pawned
it

My God how did he know all that said Albert to himself drooping his
head still lower

Do we not know the voice went on how he pandered to the lowest of the
low pandered to them for money Do we not know how he was driven out of
the theatre How Anna Ivnovna threatened to hand him over to the police

My God that is all true but protect me cried Albert You are the only
one who knows why I did so

Stop for shame cried Petrofs voice again What right have you to
accuse him Have you lived his life Have you experienced his enthusiasms

Right right whispered Albert

Art is the highest manifestation of power in man It is given only to the
favored few and it lifts the chosen to such an eminence that the head
swims and it is hard to preserve its integrity In art as in every
struggle there are heroes who bring all under subjection to them and
perish if they do not attain their ends

Petrof ceased speaking and Albert lifted his head and tried to shout in a
loud voice Right right but his voice died without a sound

That is not the case with you This does not concern you sternly said
the artist Petrof addressing Delesof Yes humble him despise him he
continued for he is better and happier than all the rest of you

Albert with rapture in his heart at hearing these words could not contain
himself but went up to his friend and was about to kiss him

Get thee gone I do not know you replied Petrof Go your own way you
cannot come here

Here you drunken fellow you cannot come here cried a policeman at the
crossing

Albert hesitated then collected all his forces and endeavoring not to
stumble crossed over to the next street

It was only a few steps to Anna Ivnovnas From the hall of her house a
stream of light fell on the snowy dvor and at the gate stood sledges and
carriages

Clinging with both hands to the balustrade he made his way up the steps
and rang the bell

The maids sleepy face appeared at the open door and looked angrily at
Albert

It is impossible she cried I have been forbidden to let you in and
she slammed the door The sounds of music and womens voices floated down
to him

Albert sat down on the ground and leaned his head against the wall and
shut his eyes At that very instant a throng of indistinct but correlated
visions took possession of him with fresh force mastered him and carried
him off into the beautiful and free domain of fancy

Yes he is better and happier involuntarily the voice repeated in his
imagination

From the door were heard the sounds of a polka These sounds also told him
that he was better and happier In a neighboring church was heard the sound
of a prayerbell and the prayerbell also told him that he was better and
happier

Now I will go back to that hall again said Albert to himself Petrof
must have many things still to tell me

There seemed to be no one now in the hall and in the place of the artist
Petrof Albert himself stood on the platform and was playing on his violin
all that the voice had said before

But his violin was of strange make it was composed of nothing but glass
and he had to hold it with both hands and slowly rub it on his breast to
make it give out sounds The sounds were so sweet and delicious that
Albert felt he had never before heard any thing like them The more tightly
he pressed the violin to his breast the more sweet and consoling they
became The louder the sounds the more swiftly the shadows vanished and
the more brilliantly the walls of the hall were illuminated But it was
necessary to play very cautiously on the violin lest it should break

Albert played on the instrument of glass cautiously and well He played
things the like of which he felt no one would ever hear again

He was growing tired when a heavy distant sound began to annoy him It was
the sound of a bell but this sound seemed to have a language

Yes said the bell with its notes coming from somewhere far off and high
up yes he seems to you wretched you despise him but he is better and
happier than you No one ever will play more on that instrument

These words which he understood seemed suddenly so wise so novel and so
true to Albert that he stopped playing and while trying not to move
lifted his eyes and his arms toward heaven He felt that he was beautiful
and happy Although no one was in the hall Albert expanded his chest and
proudly lifted his head and stood on the platform so that all might see
him

Suddenly some ones hand was gently laid on his shoulder he turned around
and in the half light saw a woman She looked pityingly at him and shook
her head He immediately became conscious that what he was doing was wrong
and a sense of shame came over him

Where shall I go he asked her Once more she gazed long and fixedly at
him and bent her head pityingly She was the one the very one whom he
loved and her dress was the same on her round white neck was the pearl
necklace and her lovely arms were bare above the elbows

She took him in her arms and bore him away through the hall At the
entrance of the hall Albert saw the moon and water But the water was not
below as is usually the case and the moon was not above there was a white
circle in one place as sometimes happens The moon and the water were
togethereverywhere above and below and on all sides and around them
both Albert and his love darted off toward the moon and the water and he
now realized that she whom he loved more than all in the world was in his
arms he embraced her and felt inexpressible felicity

Is not this a dream he asked himself But no it was the reality it was
more than reality it was reality and recollection combined

Then he felt that the indescribable pleasure which he had felt during the
last moment was gone and would never be renewed

Why am I weeping he asked of her She looked at him in silence with
pitying eyes Albert understood what she desired to say in reply Just as
when I was alive he went on to say She without replying looked
straight forward

This is terrible How can I explain to her that I am alive he asked
himself in horror My God I am alive Do understand me he whispered

He is better and happier said a voice

But something kept oppressing Albert ever more powerfully Whether it was
the moon or the water or her embrace or his tears he could not tell but
he was conscious that he could not say all that it was his duty to say and
that all would be quickly over

                                   

Two guests coming out from Anna Ivnovnas rooms stumbled against Albert
lying on the threshold One of them went back to Anna Ivnovna and called
her That was heartless he said You might let a man freeze to death
that way

Akh why that is my Albert See where he was lying exclaimed the
hostess Annushka have him brought into the room find a place for him
somewhere she added addressing the maid

Oh I am alive why do you bury me muttered Albert as they brought him
unconscious into the room




TWO HUSSARS

A TALE



        Jomini ay Jomini
    But not a single word of vodka

D DAVUIDOF


At the very beginning of this century when there were no railways no
macadamized roads no gas or stearine candles no low and springy sofas no
unvarnished furniture no disillusionized young men with eyeglasses no
women philosophers of liberal tendencies no dear Camilles such as our
time has produced in abundance in those nave days when travellers made
the journey from Moscow to Petersburg by stage or carriage and took with
them a whole kitchen of domestic preparations and travelled for a week
night and day over soft roads muddy or dusty as the case might be pinned
their faith to Pozharsky cutlets Valda bluebells and pretzels when
during the long autumn evenings tallow candles burned till they had to be
snuffed and cast their rays on family circles of twenty or thirty people
at balls wax or spermaceti candles were set up in candelabra when
furniture was placed with stiff precision when our fathers were still
young not merely by the absence of wrinkles and gray hair but fought
duels for women and were fain to rush from one end of a room to the other
to pick up a handkerchief dropped accidentally or otherwise and our
mothers wore short waists and huge sleeves and decided family affairs by
the drawing of lots when charming Camilles avoided the light of day in
the nave period of Masonic lodges of Martinists and of the Tugendbund
at the time of the Miloradovitches Davuidofs and Pushkinsa meeting of
landed proprietors took place in the governmental city of K and the
election of the college of nobles was drawing to a close

Footnote  From the poem entitled The Song of an Old Hussar in which
a veteran contrasts the mighty days of the past with the dilettanti
present Denis Vasilyevitch Davuidof who was an officer of hussars died
in TR


I

Well all right its all the same be it in the hall said a young
officer dressed in a shuba and wearing a hussars helmet as he dismounted
from a travelling sledge in front of the best hotel of the city of K

A great meeting little father your excellencya tremendous crowd
said the hallboy who had already learned from the officers man that it
was Count Turbin and therefore honored him with the address of your
excellency Madame Afrimova and her daughters have expressed the
intention of going away this evening you can be accommodated with their
room as soon as it is vacatedNo  the hallboy went on to say
noiselessly showing the count the way and constantly turning round to look
at him

In the sittingroom at a small table under a blackened fulllength
portrait of the Emperor Alexander sat a number of men evidently belonging
to the local aristocracy drinking champagne and on one side were some
travelling merchants in blue shubas

The count entered the room and calling Blcher a huge gray boarhound that
accompanied him he threw off his cloak the collar of which was covered
with frost and after ordering vodka sat down at the table in a short
bluesatin jacket and entered into conversation with the gentlemen sitting
there The latter attracted toward the newcomer by his handsome and frank
exterior offered him a glass of champagne

The count had begun to drink his glass of vodka but now he also ordered a
bottle of champagne in order to return the courtesy of his new companions

The driver came in to ask for vodkamoney

Sashka cried the count give it to him

Footnote  Diminished diminutive of Aleksandr

The driver went out with Sashka but quickly returned holding the money in
his hands

What little father slency is that right I did my best for you You
promised me a halfruble and you have only given me a quarter

Sashka give him a ruble

Sashka hanging down his head gazed at the drivers feet

He will have enough said he in his deep voice Besides I havent any
more money

The count drew from his pocketbook the two solitary blue notes which
were in it and gave one to the driver who kissed his hand and went off
I have come to the end said the count my last five rubles

Footnote  Blue notes were five rubles

True hussar style count said one of the nobles whose mustaches voice
and a certain energetic freedom in the use of his legs proclaimed him
beyond a peradventure to be a retired cavalryman Are you going to spend
some time here count

I must have some money if I stay otherwise I should not be very likely
to Besides there are no spare rooms the Devil take it in this cursed
tavern

I beg of you count pursued the cavalryman wouldnt you like to come
in with me My room is No  If you wouldnt object to sleep there for the
present We shall be here three days at least Today I was at the
marshals how glad he would be to see you

Thats right count stay with us urged another of the table companions
a handsome young man What is your hurry And besides this happens only
once in three yearsthese elections We might get a glimpse of some of
our girls count

Sashka get me some clean linen I am going to have a bath said the
count rising And then we will see perhaps I may decide to pay my
respects to the marshal

Then he called the waiter and said something to him in an undertone The
waiter replied with a laugh That is within human possibility and went
out

Well then little father I have given orders to have my trunk taken to
your room cried the count as he went out of the door

I shall consider it a favor it delights me replied the cavalryman as he
hastened to the door and cried No dont forget

When the count was out of hearing the cavalryman returned to his place
and drawing his chair nearer to the chinovnik and looking him straight
in his smiling eyes said

Well hes the very one

What one

I tell you that hes that very same hussar duellistlet me see the
famous Turbin He knew me Ill wager he knew me I assure you at Lebedyan
he and I were on a spree for three weeks and were never sober once That
was when I lost my remount There was one little affair at that timewe
were engaged in it together Ah he is a gay lad isnt he though

Indeed he is What pleasant manners he has Theres no fault to be found
with him replied the handsome young man How quickly we became
acquainted He isnt more than twentytwo is he

He certainly would not seem so would he But hes really more than
that Well now you want to know who he is dont you Who carried off
Megunova He did He killed Sablin He kicked Matnyef out of the window He
did Prince Nesterof out of three hundred thousand rubles Hes a regular
madcap You ought to know hima gambler duellist seducer but a
wholesouled fellow a genuine hussar We got talked about a good deal but
if any one really understood what it meant to be a genuine hussar Those
were great times

And the cavalryman began to tell his comrade of a drinkingbout with the
count which had never taken place nor could have taken place It could
not have taken place first because he had never seen the count before
and had retired from the service two years before the count had entered it
and secondly because this cavalryman had never served in the cavalry but
had served four years as a very insignificant yunker in the Bielevsky
regiment and just as soon as he was promoted to be ensign he retired

But ten years before he had received an inheritance and actually went to
Lebedyan and there he spent seven hundred rubles with the cavalry
officers and had had made for him an uhlans uniform with orange lapels
with the intention of entering the uhlans His thought of entering the
cavalry and his three weeks spent with the officers at Lebedyan made the
very happiest and most brilliant period of his life so that he began to
transfer his thought into a reality Then as he added remembrance to it
he began actually to believe in his military pastwhich did not prevent
him from being a worthy man through his kindness of heart and uprightness

Yes any one who has never served in the cavalry he went on to say
will never understand us fellows

He sat astride of his chair and thrusting out his lower lip went on in a
deep voice It happens you are riding along in front of the battalion A
devil is under you not a horse prancing along thus you sit on this
perfect devil The battalion commander comes along Lieutenant says he
I beg of youyour service is absolutely indispensable You must lead the
battalion for the parade Very well and so it goes You look around you
give a shout you lead the brave fellows who are under your command Ah
the deuce take it twas a glorious time

The count came back from the bath all ruddy and with his hair wet and
went directly to No  where the cavalryman was already sitting in his
dressinggown with his pipe and thinking with delight and some little
anxiety of the good fortune that had befallen him in sharing his room with
the famous Turbin Well now the thought came into his head suppose he
should take me and strip me naked and carry me outside the town limits
and set me down in the snow  or smear me with tar  or simply 
But no he would not do such a thing to a comrade he said trying to
comfort himself

Sashka give Blcher something to eat cried the count

Sashka made his appearance He had been drinking glasses of vodka ever
since his arrival and was beginning to be genuinely tipsy

You have not been able to control yourself You have been getting drunk
canaillya Feed Blcher

It wont kill him to fast You see  hes so plump replied Sashka
caressing the dog

Now none of your impudence Go and feed him

All you care for is to have your dog fat but if a man drinks a little
glass then you pitch into him

Hey Ill strike you cried the count with a voice that made the
windowpanes rattle and even scared the cavalryman somewhat

You would better ask if Sashka has had any thing to eat today All
right strike away if a dog is more to you than a man continued Sashka

But at that instant he received such a violent blow of the fist across the
face that he staggered struck his head against the partition and
clutching his nose leaped through the door and threw himself down on a
bench in the corridor

He has broken my teeth he growled wiping his bloody nose with one hand
and with the other scratching Blchers back as the dog licked him He
has broken my teeth Blchka and yet he is my count and I would jump into
the fire for him thats a fact Because hes my count do you understand
Blchka And do you want something to eat

After lying there a while he got up gave the dog his dinner and almost
sobered went to serve his master and get him his tea

You would simply offend me said the cavalryman timidly standing in
front of the count who was lying on the bed with his feet propped against
the partition Now you see I am an old soldier and comrade I may say
instead of letting you borrow of any one else it would give me great
pleasure to let you have two hundred rubles I havent them with me
nowonly a hundredbut I can get the rest today dont refuse you
would simply offend me count

Thanks little father said Turbin instantly perceiving what sort of
relationship would exist between them and slapping the cavalryman on the
shoulder Thanks Well then well go to the ball if you say so But now
what shall we do Tell me whom you have in your city any pretty girls
anybody ready for a spree Who plays cards

The cavalryman explained that there would be a crowd of pretty girls at the
ball that the police commissioner Kolkof who had just been
reelected was the greatest hand for sprees only he lacked the spirit of
a genuine hussar but still was a firstrate fellow that Ilyushkas chorus
of gypsies had been singing at K ever since the elections began that
Stioshka was the soloist and that after the marshals reception
everybody went there nowadays And the stakes were pretty high Lukhnof a
visitor here he said is sweeping in the money and Ilyin a cornet of
uhlans who rooms in No  has already lost a pile The game has already
begun there They play there every evening and hes a wonderfully fine
young fellow I tell you count this Ilyin is Theres nothing mean about
himhed give you his last shirt

Then let us go to his room We will see what sort of men you have said
the count

Come on come on they will be mighty glad


II

Ilyin the cornet of uhlans had not long been awake The evening before
he had sat down at the gamblingtable at eight oclock and lost for
fifteen consecutive hours till eleven oclock that day He had lost a
great amount but exactly how much he did not know because he had had
three thousand rubles of his money and fifteen thousand belonging to the
treasury which he had long ago mixed up with his own and he did not dare
to settle his accounts lest his anticipations that he had made too great
inroads on the public money should be confirmed

He went to sleep about noon and slept that heavy dreamless sleep
peculiar to very young men who have been losing heavily Waking at six
about the time that Count Turbin had arrived at the hotel and seeing cards
and chalk and soiled tables scattered around him in confusion in the room
he remembered with horror the evenings games and the last card a knave
which had lost him five hundred rubles but still scarcely believing in
the reality he drew out from under his pillow his money and began to
count it He recognized a few notes which with corners turned down and
indorsements had gone from hand to hand around the table he remembered
all the particulars He had lost his own three thousand rubles and
twentyfive hundred belonging to the treasury had disappeared

The uhlan had been playing for four nights in succession

He had come from Moscow where the public money had been intrusted to him
At K the postsuperintendent had detained him under the pretext that there
were no posthorses but in reality in accordance with his agreement with
the hotelkeeper to detain all visitors for a day

The uhlan who was a gay young fellow and had just received from his
parent three thousand rubles for his military equipment was glad to spend
a few days in the city of K during the elections and counted on having a
good time

He knew a landed proprietor whose family lived there and he was preparing
to call upon him and pay his addresses to his daughter when the cavalryman
appeared and made his acquaintance That very evening without malice
prepense he took him down into the parlor and introduced him to his
friends Lukhnof and several other gamblers From that time the uhlan had
kept steadily at gaming and not only had not called on the proprietor but
had not thought of inquiring further for horses and for four days had not
left his room

After he had dressed and taken his tea he went to the window He felt an
inclination to go out so as to dispel the importunate recollections of the
game He put on his cloak and went into the street

The sun had just sunk behind the white houses with their red roofs It was
already twilight It was warm The snow was softly falling in big damp
flakes in the muddy streets His mind suddenly became filled with
unendurable melancholy at the thought that he had spent all that day in
sleep and now the day was done

This day which has gone will never come back again he said to himself

I have wasted my youth he suddenly exclaimed not because he really felt
that he had wasted his youthhe did not think about it at allbut
simply this phrase came into his head

What shall I do now he reasoned borrow of some one and go away

A lady was passing along the sidewalk

What a stupid woman he said to himself for some reason

Theres no one I can borrow of I have wasted my youth

He came to a block of stores A merchant in a foxskin shuba was standing
at the door of his shop and inviting custom

If I hadnt taken the eight I should have won

A little old beggarwoman followed him snivelling

I have no one to borrow of

A gentleman in a bearskin shuba passed him A policeman was standing on
the corner

What can I do that will make sensation Fire a pistol at them No That
would be stupid I have wasted my youth Akh what a splendid harness
that is hanging in that shop I should like to be riding behind a
troka Ekh you fine fellows I am going back Lukhnof will be
there pretty soon and well have a game

Footnote  golbchiki little pigeons

He returned to the hotel and once more counted his money No he was not
mistaken the first time twentyfive hundred rubles of public money were
missing just as before

I will put up twentyfive rubles first the next time a quarter stake
then on seven on fifteen on thirty and on sixty  three thousand I
will buy that harness and start He wont give me any odds the villain
I have wasted my youth

This was what was passing through the uhlans mind just as Lukhnof himself
came into the room

Well have you been up long Mikhlo Vaslyitch inquired Lukhnof
deliberately removing from his thin nose his gold eyeglasses and
carefully wiping them with a red silk handkerchief

No only just this minute I had a splendid sleep

A new hussar has just come He is staying with Zavalshevsky Had you heard
about it

No I hadnt Well no one seems to be here yet I believe they have gone
to call on Priakhin Theyll be here very soon

In fact in a short time there came into the room an officer of the
garrison who was always hovering round Lukhnof a Greek merchant with a
huge hooked nose cinnamon complexion and deepset black eyes a stout
puffy proprietor a brandydistiller who gambled all night long and always
made his stakes on the basis of half a ruble All of these wished to begin
playing as promptly as possible but the more daring players said nothing
about it Lukhnof in particular with perfect equanimity told stories of
rascality in Moscow

Just think of it said he Moscow the metropolis the capital and
there they go out at night with crooks dressed like demons and they scare
the stupid people and rob pedestrians and that is the end of it Do the
police notice it No It is astonishing

The uhlan listened attentively to the tales of these highwaymen but
finally got up and unobtrusively ordered cards to be brought The stout
proprietor was the first to notice it

Well gentlemen we are wasting golden moments To work let us to work

Yes you won by the halfruble last evening and so you like it
exclaimed the Greek

Its a good time to begin said the garrison officer

Ilyin looked at Lukhnof Lukhnof returning his gaze went on calmly with
his story of the robbers who dressed themselves up like devils Will you
start the bank asked the uhlan

Isnt it rather early

Bylof cried the uhlan reddening for some reason or other bring me
something to eat I havent had any dinner today gentlemen Bring some
champagne and distribute the cards

A this moment the count and Zavalshevsky entered It proved that Turbin
and Ilyin were in the same division They immediately struck up an
acquaintance drank a glass of champagne clinking their glasses together
and in five minutes were calling each other thou

It was evident that Ilyin made a very pleasant impression on the count The
count smiled whenever he looked at him and was amused at his freshness

What a fine young uhlan he said what a mustache what a splendid
mustache

Ilyins upper lip bore the first down of a mustache that was as yet almost
white

You were preparing to play were you not asked the count Well I
should like to win from you Ilyin I think that you must be a master he
added smiling

Yes we were just starting in replied Lukhnof opening a pack of
cards Arent you going to join us count

No I wont tonight If I did there wouldnt be any thing left of any of
you When I take a hand I always break the bank But I havent any money
just now I lost at Volotchok at the stationhouse It was by some sort of
infantryman who wore rings what a cheat he was and he cleaned me out
completely

Were you long there at the station asked Ilyin

I staid there twentytwo hours I shall not forget that station curse it
and the superintendent wont forget it either

Why

I got there you see the superintendent comes out rascally face the
liar There are no horses said he Well now I must tell you I have
made a rule in such cases when there are no horses I keep on my shuba
and go straight to the superintendents roomnot the waitingroom mind
you but the superintendents own roomand I have all the windows and
doors opened as though it were stifling Well thats what I did here
Cold you remember how cold it has been this last month twenty degrees
below The superintendent began to remonstrate I knock his teeth in for
him There was some old woman there and some young girls and
peasantwomen set up a piping were going to seize their pots and fly
to the village I go to the door and say Let me have horses and Ill
go away if you dont I wont let you out Ill freeze you all to death

Footnote  babas

What an admirable way said the puffy proprietor bursting out into a
laugh Thats the way one would freeze out cockroaches

But I wasnt sufficiently on my guard the superintendent and all his
women managed to get out and run away Only the old woman remained on the
oven as my hostage She kept sniffing and offering prayers to God Then we
entered into negotiations The superintendent came back and standing at a
distance tried to persuade me to let the old woman go But I set Blcher
on him Blcher is a magnificent dog to take care of superintendents Even
then the rascal did not let me have horses till the next morning And then
came along that footpad I went into the next room and began to play Have
you seen BlcherBlcher Fiu Blcher came running in The players
received him with flattering attention although it was evident that they
were anxious to get to work at entirely different matters

By the way gentlemen why dont you begin your game I beg of you dont
let me interfere with you You see I am a chatterbox said Turbin
Whether you love or not tis an excellent thing


III

Lukhnof took two candles brought out a huge darkcolored pocketbook full
of money slowly as though performing some sacrament opened it on the
table took out two onehundredruble notes and laid them on the cards

There just the same as last evening the bank begins with two hundred
said he adjusting his glasses and opening a pack of cards

Very well said Ilyin not glancing at him or interrupting his
conversation with Turbin

The game began Lukhnof kept the bank with mechanical regularity
occasionally pausing and deliberately making notes or looking sternly
over his glasses and saying in a weak voice Throw

The stout proprietor talked louder than the rest making various
calculations at the top of his voice while he wet his clumsy fingers and
dogeared his cards

The garrison officer silently wrote in a fine hand his account on a card
turned down small corners pressing them against the table

The Greek sat next the banker attentively following the game with his deep
black eyes as though waiting for something

Zavalshevsky as he stood by the table would suddenly become all of a
tremble draw from his trouserspocket a blue note or a red lay a card
on it pound on it with his palm and say Bring me luck little seven
then he would bite his mustache change from one leg to the other and be
in a continual state of excitement until the card came out

Footnote  Five or ten rubles

Ilyin who had been eating veal and cucumbers placed near him on the
haircloth sofa briskly wiped his hands on his coat and began to put down
one card after another

Turbin who had taken his seat at first on the sofa immediately noticed
that something was wrong Lukhnof did not look at the uhlan or say any
thing to him but occasionally his eyes for an instant rested on the
uhlans hands The most of his cards lost

If I could only trump that little card exclaimed Lukhnof in reference to
one of the stout proprietors cards He was still making halfruble wagers

Trump Ilyins instead what would be the use of trumping mine replied
the proprietor

And in point of fact Ilyins cards were trumped oftener than the others
He nervously tore up his losing card under the table and with trembling
hands chose another

Turbin arose from the sofa and asked the Greek to give him his place next
the banker The Greek changed places and the count taking his chair and
not moving his eyes began to watch Lukhnofs hands attentively

Ilyin said he suddenly in his ordinary voice which entirely contrary
to his desire drowned out the others why do you stick to those routine
cards You dont know how to play

Supposing I dont its all the same

Youll lose that way surely Let me play against the bank for you

No excuse me I beg of you Im always this way Play for yourself if you
like

I have told you that I am not going to play But I should like to play for
you I hate to see you losing so

Ah well you see its my luck

The count said nothing more and leaning on his elbow began once more to
watch the bankers hand just as attentively as before

Shameful he suddenly cried in a loud voice dwelling on the word

Lukhnof glared at him

Shameful shameful he repeated still louder staring straight into
Lukhnofs eyes

The game continued

That is not right said Turbin again as Lukhnof trumped one of Ilyins
high cards

What displeases you count politely asked the banker with an air of
indifference

Because you give Ilyin a simplum and turn down your corners Thats what
is shameful

Lukhnof made a slight motion with his shoulders and brows signifying that
he was resigned to any fate and then he went on with the game

Blcher fiu cried the count rising over with him he added
quickly Blcher bumping against the sofa with his back and almost
knocking the garrison officer from his feet came leaping toward his
master looking at every one and wagging his tail as though he would ask
Who is misbehaving here hey

Lukhnof laid down the cards and moved his chair away This is no way to
play said he I detest dogs What kind of a game can you have if a whole
pack of hounds is to be brought in

Especially that kind of dog they are called bloodsuckers if I am not
mistaken suggested the garrison officer

Well are we to play or not Mikhlo Vaslyitch asked Lukhnof
addressing the uhlan

Dont bother us count I beg of you said Ilyin turning to Turbin

Come here for a moment said Turbin taking Ilyins arm and drawing him
into the next room

There the counts words were perfectly audible though he spoke in his
ordinary tone But his voice was so powerful that it could always be heard
three rooms off

Are you beside yourself Dont you see that that man with the glasses is a
cheat of the worst order

Hey Nonsense Be careful what you say

No nonsense but quit it I tell you It makes no difference to me
Another time I myself would have plucked you but now I am sorry to see you
ruining yourself Have you any public money left

No What makes you think so about him

Brother I have been over this same road and I know the ways of these
professional gamblers I tell you that the man in the glasses is a cheat
Quit please I ask you as a comrade

All right Ill have just one more hand and then have done with it

I know what that one more means very well we will see

They returned to the gamingtable In one deal he laid down so many cards
and they were trumped so badly that he lost a large amount

Turbin rested his hand in the middle of the table and said Thats
enough now let us be going

No I cant go yet leave me please said Ilyin in vexation shuffling
the bent cards and not looking at Turbin

All right the Devil be with you Lose all youve got if that please you
but its time for me to be goingCome Zavalshevsky let us go to the
marshals

And they went out No one spoke and Lukhnof did not make the bank until
the noise of their feet and of Blchers paws had died away down the
corridor

Thats a madcap said the proprietor smiling

Well now he wont bother us any more said the garrison officer in a
hurried whisper

And the game went on


IV

The band composed of the marshals domestic serfs were stationed in the
butlers pantry which had been put in order on account of the ball and
having turned up the sleeves of their coats had begun at the signal of
their leader to play the ancient polonaise Aleksandr Yelisavita and
under the soft brilliant light of the wax candles the couples began to
move in tripping measure through the great ballroom a governorgeneral of
Catherines time with a star taking out the gaunt wife of the marshal
the marshal with the governors wife and so on through all the hierarchy
of the government in various combinations and variationswhen
Zavalshevsky in a blue coat with a huge collar and epaulets on his
shoulders and wearing stockings and pumps and exhaling about him an odor
of jasmine with which he had plentifully drenched his mustaches the
facings of his coat and his handkerchief entered with the handsome count
who wore tightfitting blue trousers and a red pelisse embroidered with
gold and wearing on his breast the cross of Vladmir and a medal of 

The count was of medium height but had an extremely handsome figure His
clear blue eyes of remarkable brilliancy and dark hair which was rather
long and fell in thick ringlets gave his beauty a peculiar character

The counts presence at the ball was not unexpected The handsome young
man who had seen him at the hotel had already spoken of him to the marshal

The impressions made by this announcement were of various kinds but on the
whole were not altogether pleasant

I suppose this young man will turn us into ridicule was what the old
women and the men said to themselves

Suppose he should run off with me was what the wives and young ladies
thought with more or less apprehension

As soon as the polonaise was finished and the couples had made each other
low bows once more the women formed little groups by themselves and the
men by themselves Zavalshevsky proud and happy led the count up to the
hostess

The marshals wife conscious of a certain inward trepidation lest this
hussar should make her the cause of some scandal before everybody said
proudly and scornfully as she turned away Very glad to see you I hope
that you will dance And then she looked at the count mistrustfully with
an expression that seemed to say Now if you insult any woman then you
are a perfect scoundrel after this

The count however quickly overcame this prejudice by his amiability his
politeness and his handsome jovial appearance so that in five minutes the
expression on the face of the marshals wife plainly declared to all who
stood around her I know how to manage all these men He immediately
realized whom he was talking with And now he will be charming to me all
the rest of the evening

Moreover just then the governor who had known his father came up to the
count and very graciously drew him to one side and entered into
conversation with him which still more pleased the fashionable society of
the town and raised the count in their estimation

Then Zavalshevsky presented the count to his sister a plump young widow
who ever since the count entered the room had kept her big black eyes
fastened upon him

The count asked the little widow for the waltz which at that moment the
musicians had struck up and it was his artistic dancing that conquered the
last vestiges of the popular prejudice

Ah hes a master at dancing said a stout lady following the legs in
blue trousers which were flashing through the ballroom and mentally
counting One two three one two threehes a master

How gracefully he moves his feet how gracefully said another guest who
did not stand very high in the governmental society How does he manage to
not hit any one with his spurs Wonderful very skilful

The count by his skill in dancing eclipsed the three best dancers of the
city These were a governors aide a tall albino who was famous for his
rapid dancing and because he held the lady pressed very close to his
breast secondly the cavalryman who was famous for his graceful swaying
during the waltz and for his frequent but light tapping with his heels
and thirdly a civilian of whom everybody said that though he was not
very strongminded yet he was an admirable dancer and the life of all
balls

In point of fact this civilian from the beginning to the end of a ball
invariably invited all the ladies in the order in which they sat did not
cease for a moment to dance and only occasionally paused to wipe his
weary but still radiant face with his cambric handkerchief which would
become wet through

The count had surpassed them all and had danced with the three principal
ladieswith the stout one who was rich handsome and stupid with the
middlesized one who was lean and not particularly goodlooking but
handsomely dressed and with the little one who was not pretty but very
witty

He had danced also with otherswith all the pretty women and there were
many pretty women there

But the little widow Zavalshevskys sister pleased the count more than
all the rest with her he danced a quadrille and a schottische and a
mazurka

At first when they took their places for the quadrille he overwhelmed her
with compliments comparing her to Venus and Diana and to a rosebush and
to some other flower besides

To all these amenities the little widow only bent her white neck modestly
dropped her eyes and looking at her white muslin dress changed her fan
from one hand to the other

When at last she said This is too much count you are jesting etc
her voice which was rather guttural betrayed such nave simplicity of
heart and amusing naturalness that the count as he looked at her actually
compared her not to a flower or to a rosebush but to some kind of a
pinkishwhite wildflower exuberant and odorless growing alone on a
virgin snowdrift in some far fardistant land

Such a strange impression was made upon the count by this union of
navet and unconventionality together with fresh beauty that several
times in the pauses of the conversation when he looked silently into her
eyes or contemplated the loveliness of her arms and neck the desire came
over him with such vehemence to take her into his arms and kiss her again
and again that he was really obliged to restrain himself

The little widow was quite satisfied with the impression which she
perceived that she had made but there was something in the counts
behavior that began to disquiet her and fill her with apprehensions
though the young hussar was not only flatteringly amiable but even to an
extravagant degree deferential in his treatment of her

He ran to get orgeat for her picked up her handkerchief snatched a chair
from the hands of a scrofulous young proprietor who was also anxious to
pay her attention and who was not quick enough But perceiving that these
assiduities which were fashionable at that period had little effect in
making the lady welldisposed he began to amuse her by telling her
ridiculous anecdotes he assured her that he was ready at a moments notice
to stand on his head or to crow like a cock or to jump out of the window
or to fling himself into a hole in the ice

This procedure was a brilliant success the little widow became very gay
she rippled with laughter displaying her marvellous white teeth and
became entirely satisfied with her cavalier The count each moment grew
more and more enchanted with her so that at the end of the quadrille he
was really in love with her

After the quadrille when she was approached by her former admirer a young
man of eighteen the son of a very rich proprietor the same scrofulous
young man from whom Turbin had snatched away the chair she received him
with perfect coolness and not onetenth part of the constraint was
noticeable in her which she felt when she was with the count

You are very kind she said all the time gazing at Turbins back and
unconsciously reckoning how many yards of goldlace were used for his
whole jacket You are very kind you promised to come to take me for a
walk and to bring me some comfits

Footnote  arshins

Well I did come Anna Fedorovna but you werent at home and I left the
very best comfits for you said the young man in a voice that was very
thin considering his height

You always are provided with excuses I dont need your comfits Please do
not think

I begin to see Anna Fedorovna how you have changed toward me and I know
why But it is not right he added but without finishing his remark
evidently owing to some powerful interior emotion which caused his lips to
tremble strangely

Anna Fedorovna did not heed him and continued to follow Turbin with her
eyes The marshal at whose house the ball was givena big stout old
man who had lost his teethcame up to the count and taking him by the
arm invited him into his library to smoke and drink if he so desired

As soon as Turbin disappeared Anna Fedorovna felt that there was
absolutely nothing for her to do in the ballroom and slipping her hand
through the arm of a driedup old maid who was a friend of hers went with
her into the dressingroom

Well what do you think of him Is he nice asked the old maid

Only its terriblethe way he follows you up said Anna Fedorovna going
to the mirror and contemplating herself in it

Her face was aglow her eyes were full of mischief her color was
heightened then suddenly imitating one of the balletdancers whom she had
seen during election time she pirouetted round on one toe and laughing
her guttural but sweet laugh she leaped up in the air crossing her knees

What a man he is he even asked me for a souvenir she confided to her
friend But he will neever get one she said singing the last words
and lifting one finger in the lilaccolored glove that reached to her
elbow

In the library where Turbin was conducted by the marshal stood various
kinds of vodka liqueurs edibles and champagne In a cloud of
tobaccosmoke the nobility were sitting or walking up and down talking
about the elections

Footnote  zakuski

When the whole of the high nobility of our district has honored him with
an election exclaimed the newly elected isprvnik who was already
tolerably tipsy he certainly ought not to fail in his duties toward
society in general

The conversation was interrupted by the counts coming All were presented
to him and the isprvnik especially pressed his hand long between both of
his and asked him several times to go with him after the ball to the new
tavern where he would treat the gentlemen of the nobility and where they
would hear the gypsies sing

The count accepted his invitation and drank with him several glasses of
champagne

Why arent you dancing gentlemen he asked as he was about to leave the
library

We arent dancers replied the isprvnik laughing We prefer the wine
count and besides all these young ladies have grown up under my eyes
count But still I do sometimes take part in a schottische count I can
do it count

Come on then for a while said Turbin Let us have some sport before we
go to the gypsies

What say you gentlemen Let us come Let us delight our host

And the three gentlemen who since the beginning of the ball had been
drinking in the library and had very red faces began to draw on their
gloves some of black kid another of knit silk and were just going with
the count to the ballroom when they were detained by the scrofulous young
man who pale as a sheet and scarcely able to refrain from tears came
straight up to Turbin

You have an idea because you are a count you can run into people as if
you were at a fair said he with difficulty drawing his breath hence it
isnt fitting

Once more the stream of his speech was interrupted by the involuntary
trembling of his lips

What cried Turbin frowning suddenly what Youre a baby he
cried seizing him by the arm and squeezing it so that the blood rushed to
the young mans head not so much from vexation as from fright What is
it Do you want to fight If so I am at your service

Turbin had scarcely let go of his arm which he had squeezed so powerfully
when two nobles seized the young man by the sleeve and carried him off
through a back door

What have you lost your wits Youve surely been drinking too much We
shall have to tell your papa Whats the matter with you they asked

No I havent been drinking but he ran into me and did not apologize
Hes a hog thats what he is whined the young man now actually in
tears

Nevertheless they paid no attention to him but carried him off home

Never mind count said the isprvnik and Zavalshevsky assuringly Hes
a mere child They still whip him hes only sixteen years old Its hard
to tell what is to be done with him What fly stung him And his father is
such an honorable man Hes our candidate

Well the Devil take him if he refuses

And the count returned to the ballroom and as gayly as before danced the
schottische with the pretty little widow and laughed heartily when he saw
the antics of the gentlemen who had come with him out of the library There
was a general burst of merriment all through the ballroom when the
isprvnik tripped and measured his length on the floor in the midst of the
dancers


V

Anna Fedorovna while the count was in the library went to her brother
and for the very reason of her conviction that she ought to pretend to
feel very little interest in the count she began to question him

Who is this hussar that has been dancing with me Tell me brother

The cavalryman explained to the best of his ability what a great man this
hussar was and in addition he told his sister that the count had stopped
there simply because his money had been stolen on the route he himself had
loaned him a hundred rubles but that was not enough Couldnt his sister
let him have two hundred more Zavalshevsky asked her not to say any thing
about this to any one and above all not to the count

Anna Fedorovna promised to send the money the next day and to keep it a
secret but somehow or other during the schottische she had a terrible
desire to offer the count as much money as he needed

She deliberated blushed and at last mastering her confusion thus
addressed herself to the task

My brother told me count that you had met with a misfortune on the road
and hadnt any money Now if you need some wouldnt you take some of me
I should be terribly glad

But after she had thus spoken Anna Fedorovna suddenly was overcome with
fright and blushed All the gayety had instantly vanished from the
counts face

Your brother is a fool said he in a cutting tone You know when a man
insults a man then they fight a duel but when a woman insults a man then
what do they do Do you know

Poor Anna Fedorovna blushed to her ears with confusion She dropped her
eyes and made no reply

They kiss the woman in public said the count softly bending over to
whisper in her ear Permit me however to kiss your little hand he
added almost inaudibly after a long silence having some pity on his
ladys confusion

Ah only not quite yet urged Anna Fedorovna with a deep sigh

But when then Tomorrow I am going away early But really you owe it
to me

Well then of course it is impossible said Anna Fedorovna smiling

Only give me a chance to see you before tomorrow so that I may kiss your
hand I will find one

How will you find one

That is my affair I can do any thing to see you Is it agreed

Agreed

The schottische came to an end they danced through the mazurka and in it
the count did marvels purloining handkerchiefs bending on one knee and
clinking his spurs in an extraordinary manner after the Warsaw style so
that all the old men came from their boston to look into the ballroom
and the cavalryman who was the best dancer confessed himself outdone After
they had eaten supper they danced still the gross vater and began to
disperse

The count all this time did not take his eyes from the little widow He had
not been insincere when he declared his readiness to throw himself into a
hole in the ice

Whether it was caprice or love or stubbornness but that evening all the
strength of his mind had been concentrated into one desireto see and to
love her

As soon as he perceived that Anna Fedorovna was taking her farewell of the
hostess he hastened to the servants quarters and thence without his
shuba to the place where the carriages were drawn up

Anna Fedorovna Zatsovas equipage he cried

A high fourseated carriage with lanterns moved out and started to drive
up to the doorstep

Stop shouted the count to the coachman rushing up toward the carriage
through snow that was kneedeep

What is wanted called the driver

I want to get into the carriage replied the count opening the door as
the carriage moved and trying to climb in

Stop you devil stupid Vaska stop cried the coachman to the
postilion and reining in the horses What are you getting into another
persons carriage for This belongs to the Lady Anna Fedorovna and not to
your grace

Footnote  Diminutive of Vasili

Hush up blockhead Na theres a ruble for you now come down and shut
the door said the count

But as the coachman did not move he lifted the steps himself and
shutting the window managed to pull the door to

In this as in all ancient carriages especially those upholstered in
yellow galloon there was an odor of mustiness and burnt bristles

The counts legs were wet to the knees from melting snow and almost
freezing in his thin boots and trousers and his whole body was penetrated
by a cold like that of winter

The coachman was grumbling on his box and seemed to be getting ready to
get down But the count heard nothing and felt nothing His face was aglow
his heart was beating violently He convulsively clutched the yellow strap
thrust his head out of the sidewindow and his whole being was
concentrated in expectation

He was not doomed to wait long At the doorsteps they shouted
Zatsovas carriage The coachman shook his reins the carriage swung on
its high springs the lighted windows of the house passed one after another
by the carriagewindows

See here rogue if you tell the lackey that I am here said the count
thrusting his head through the front window and addressing the coachman
youll feel my whip but if you hold your tongue I will give you ten
rubles more

He had scarcely time to close the window when the carriage shook again
still more violently and then the wheels came to a stop

He drew back as far as possible into the corner he ceased to breathe he
even shut his eyes so apprehensive was he lest his passionate expectation
should be disappointed

The door was opened one after the other with a creak the steps were let
down a womans dress rustled and the close atmosphere of the carriage
was impregnated by the odor of jasmine a womans dainty feet hurried up
the steps and Anna Fedorovna brushing against the counts leg with the
skirt of her cloak which was loosely thrown about her silently and with
a deep sigh took her place on the cushioned seat next him

Whether she saw him or not no one could decide not even Anna Fedorovna
herself but when he took her hand and said Now I will kiss your little
hand anyway she evinced very little dismay She said nothing but let him
take her hand which he covered with kisses not stopping at the glove

The carriage rolled off

Tell me something You are not angry said he to her

She silently sank back into her corner but suddenly for some reason or
other burst into tears and let her head fall on his breast


VI

The newly elected isprvnik with his company the cavalryman and other
members of the nobility had already been listening for some time to the
gypsies and drinking at the new tavern when the count in a bluelined
bearskin shuba which had belonged to Anna Fedorovnas late husband joined
them

Little father your excellency we have almost given up expecting you
said a squinteyed black gypsy with brilliant teeth who met him in the
entry and divested him of his shuba We havent met since we were at
Lebedyan Stioshka has pined away on account of you

Stioshka a slender young gypsygirl with a cherry red bloom on her
cinnamoncolored cheeks with brilliant deep black eyes shaded by long
eyelashes also hurried to meet him

Ah dear little count my sweetheart This is a pleasure she
exclaimed through her teeth with a joyous smile

Footnote  tsiganotchka

Footnote  grafchik golubchik

Ilyushka himself came to greet Turbin pretending that he was very glad to
see him The old women the wives the young girls hastened to the spot
and surrounded the guest

One would have said that he was a relative or a godbrother to them

Turbin kissed all the young gypsy girls on the lips the old women and the
men kissed him on the shoulder or on the hand

The gentlemen were also very glad of the counts arrival the more because
the festivity having passed its apogee was now becoming tame every one
began to feel a sense of satiety The wine having lost its exhilarating
effect on the nerves only served to load the stomach Everybody had
discharged the last cannon of his wildness and was looking around moodily
All the songs had been sung and ran in the heads of each leaving a mere
impression of noise and confusion

Whatever any one did that was strange and wild the rest began to look upon
it as nothing very entertaining or amusing

The isprvnik stretched out on the floor in shameless fashion at the feet
of some old woman kicked his leg in the air and began to cry

Champagne The count has come Champagne He has come Now
give us champagne I will make a bath of champagne and swim in it
Gentlemen of the nobility I love your admirable society Stioshka sing
The Narrow Road

The cavalryman was also very gay but in a different fashion He was
sitting in a corner of a sofa with a tall handsome gypsy Liubasha and
with the consciousness that intoxication was beginning to cloud his eyes
he kept blinking them and swinging his head and repeating the same words
over and over again he was proposing in a whisper to the gypsy to fly with
him somewhere

Liubasha smiling listened to him as though what he said were very amusing
to her and at the same time rather melancholy Occasionally she cast her
glances at her husband the squinteyed Sashka who was standing behind a
chair near her In reply to the cavalrymans declaration of love she bent
over to his ear and begged him to buy her some perfume and a ribbon
without any one knowing it so that the others should not see it

Hurrah cried the cavalryman when the count came in

The handsome young man with an expression of anxiety was walking up and
down the room with solicitously steady steps and humming an air from the
Revolt in the Seraglio

An old paterfamilias dragged out to see the gypsies through the
irresistible entreaties of the gentlemen of the nobility who had told him
that if he staid away every thing would go to pieces and in that case they
had better not go was lying on a sofa where he had stretched himself out
immediately on his arrival and no one paid any attention to him

A chinovnik who had been there before had taken off his coat was sitting
with his legs on the table and was rumpling up his hair and thus proving
that he understood how to be dissipated

As soon as the count came in the official unbuttoned his shirtcollar and
lifted his legs still higher The counts arrival generally gave new life
to the festivities

The gypsy girls who had been scattered about the room again formed their
circle The count seated Stioshka the soloist on his knee and ordered
more champagne to be brought Ilyushka with his guitar stood in front of
the soloist and began the plyaska that is the gypsy song and dance
When I walk upon the Street Hey you Hussars Do you hear do you
understand and others of the usual order

Stioshka sang splendidly Her flexible sonorous contralto with its deep
chest notes her smiles while she was singing her mischievous passionate
eyes and her little foot which involuntarily kept time to the measure of
the song her despairing wail at the end of each coupletthis all touched
some resonant but tender chord It was evident that she lived only in the
song that she was singing

Ilyushka in his smile his back his legs his whole being carrying out
in pantomime the idea expressed in the song accompanied it on his guitar
and fixing his eyes upon her as though he were hearing her for the first
time attentively and carefully lifted and drooped his head with the rhythm
of the song

Then he suddenly straightened himself up as the singer sang the last note
and as though he felt himself superior to every one else in the world
with proud deliberation kicked the guitar turned it over stamped his
foot tossed back his locks and looked at the chorus with a frown

All his body from his neck to his toes began to dance in every sinew

And twenty powerful energetic voices each trying to outdo the other in
making strange and extraordinary noises were lifted in union

The old women sprang down from their chairs waving their handkerchiefs
and showing their teeth and crying in rhythmic measure each louder than
the other The bassos leaning their heads on one side and swelling their
necks bellowed from behind their chairs

When Stioshka emitted her high notes Ilyushka brought his guitar nearer to
her as though trying to aid her and the handsome young man in his
enthusiasm cried out that now they struck Bflat

When they came to the national dance the Plyasovaya and Duniasha with
shoulders and bosom shaking stepped in front of the count and was passing
on Turbin leaped from his place took off his uniform and remaining only
in his red shirt boldly joined her keeping up the same measure and
cutting with his feet such antics that the gypsies laughed and exchanged
glances of approval

The isprvnik who was sitting Turkish fashion pounded his chest with his
fist and cried Vivat and then seizing the count by the leg began to
tell him that out of two thousand rubles he had only five hundred left and
that he might do whatever he pleased if only the count would permit him

The old paterfamilias woke up and wanted to go home but they would not
let him The handsome young man asked a gypsy girl to waltz with him The
cavalryman anxious to exalt himself by his friendship with the count got
up from his corner and embraced Turbin Ah my turtledove he cried
Why must you leave us so soon ha The count said nothing being
evidently absorbed in thought Where did you go Ah you rascal I know
where you went

This familiarity somehow displeased the Count Turbin Without smiling he
looked in silence into the cavalrymans face and suddenly gave him such a
terrible and grievous affront that the cavalryman was mortified and for
some time did not know what to make of such an insult whether it were a
joke or not a joke At last he made up his mind that it was a joke he
smiled and returned to his gypsy assuring her that he would really marry
her after Easter

Another song was sung a third they danced again the round of gayety was
kept up and every one continued to feel gay There was no end to the
champagne

The count drank a great deal His eyes seemed to grow rather moist but he
did not grow dizzy he danced still better than the rest spoke without any
thickness and even joined in a chorus and supported Stioshka when she
sang The sweet emotion of friendship

In the midst of the dance and song the merchant who kept the hotel came
to beg the guests to go home as it was three oclock in the morning

The count took the landlord by the throat and ordered him to dance the
prisiadka The merchant refused The count snatched a bottle of
champagne and standing the merchant on his head ordered him to stay so
and then amid general hilarity poured the whole bottle over him

The dawn was already breaking All were pale and weary except the count

At all events I must go to Moscow said he suddenly rising Come with
me all of you to my room children See me off and let us have some
tea

All accompanied him with the exception of the sleeping proprietor who
still remained there they piled into three sledges that were waiting at
the door and drove off to the hotel


VII

Have the horses put in cried the count as he entered the sittingroom
of the hotel with all his friends including the gypsies

Sashkanot the gypsy Sashka but minetell the superintendent that if
the horses are poor I will flog him Now give us some tea Zavalshevsky
make some tea I am going to Ilyins I want to find how things have gone
with him added Turbin and he went out into the corridor and directed
his steps to the uhlans room

Ilyin was just through playing and having lost all his money down to his
last kopek had thrown himself face down on the wornout haircloth sofa
and was picking the hairs out one by one sticking them in his mouth
biting them into two and spitting them out again

Two tallow candles one of which was already burnt down to the paper stood
on the cardcluttered ombretable and mingled their feeble rays with the
morning light which was beginning to shine through the window

The uhlans mind was vacant of all thought that strange thick fog of the
gamblingpassion muffled all the capabilities of his mind so that there was
not even room for regret

Once he endeavored to think what was left for him to do how he should get
away without a kopek how he should pay back the fifteen thousand rubles
of public money that he had lost in gambling what his colonel would say
what his mother would say what his comrades would say and such fear came
over him and such disgust at himself that in his anxiety to rid himself
of the thought of it he arose and began to walk up and down through the
room trying only to walk on the cracks of the floor and then once more he
began to recall all the least details of the evening

He vividly imagined that he was winning the whole back again he takes a
nine and lays down a king of spades on two thousand rubles a queen lies
at the right at the left an ace at the right a king of diamondsand all
was lost but if he had had a six at the right and a king of diamonds at
the left then he would have won it all back he would have staked all
again on P and would have won back his fifteen thousand rubles then he
would have bought a good pacer of the colonel an extra pair of horses and
a phaton And what else besides Ah indeed it would have been a splendid
splendid thing

Again he threw himself down on the sofa and began to bite the hairs once
more

Why are they singing songs in No  he wondered It must be they are
having a jollification in Turbins room Im of a good mind to go there
and have a little drink

Just at this moment the count came in

Well have you been losing brother hey he cried

I will pretend to be asleep otherwise I shall have to talk with him and
I really want to sleep now

Nevertheless Turbin went up to him and laid his hand caressingly on his
head Well my dear little friend have you been losing have you had
bad luck Tell me

Ilyin made no reply

The count took him by the arm

I have been losing What is it to you muttered Ilyin in a sleepy voice
expressing indifference and vexation he did not change his position

Every thing

Well yes What harm is there in it All What is it to you

Listen tell me the truth as to a comrade said the count who under
the influence of the wine that he had been drinking was disposed to be
tender and continued to smooth the others hair You know I have taken a
fancy to you Tell me the truth If you have lost the public money I will
help you if you dont it will be too late Was it public money

Ilyin leaped up from the sofa

If you wish me to tell you dont speak to me so because  and I beg of
you dont speak to me I will blow my brains outthats the only thing
thats left for me now he exclaimed with genuine despair letting his
head sink into his hands and bursting into tears although but the moment
before he had been calmly thinking about his horses

Ekh youre a pretty young girl Well who might not have the same thing
happen to him It isnt as bad as it might be perhaps we can straighten
things out wait for me here

The count hastened from the room

Where is the pomyeshchik Lukhnofs room he demanded of the
hallboy

Footnote  Landed proprietor

The hallboy offered to show the count the way The count in spite of the
objections of the lackey who said that his master had only just come in
and was preparing to retire entered the room

Lukhnof in his dressinggown was sitting in front of a table counting over
a number of packages of banknotes piled up before him On the table was a
bottle of Rheinwein of which he was very fond He had procured himself
this pleasure from his winnings

Coldly sternly Lukhnof looked at the count over his glasses affecting
not to recognize him

It seems that you do not know me said the count proceeding toward the
table with resolute steps

Lukhnof recognized the count and asked

What is your pleasure

I wish to play with you said Turbin sitting down on the sofa

Now

Yes

Another time I should be most happy count but now I am tired and am
getting ready to go to bed Wont you have some wine It is excellent
wine

But I wish to play with you for a little while now

I am not prepared to play any more Maybe some of the other guests will
I will not count I beg of you to excuse me

Then you will not

Lukhnof shrugged his shoulders as though to express his regret at not being
able to fulfil the counts desires

Will you not play under any consideration

The same gesture

I am very desirous of playing with you Say will you play or not

Silence

Will you play asked the count a second time

The same silence and a quick glance over his glasses at the counts face
which was beginning to grow sinister

Will you play cried the count in a loud voice striking his hand on the
table so violently that the bottle of Rheinwein toppled over and the wine
ran out You have been cheating have you not Will you play I ask you
the third time

I have told you no This is truly strange count  perfectly
unjustifiable to come this way and put your knife at a mans throat
remarked Lukhnof not lifting his eyes

A brief silence followed during which the counts face grew paler and
paler Suddenly Lukhnof received a terrible blow on the head which stunned
him He fell back on the divan trying to grasp the money and screamed in
a penetratingly despairing tone such as was scarcely to be expected from
him he was always so calm and imposing in his deportment

Turbin gathered up the remaining banknotes that were lying on the table
pushed away the servant who had come to his masters assistance and with
quick steps left the room

If you wish satisfaction I am at your service I shall be in my room for
half an hour yetNo  added the count turning back as he reached the
door

Villain thief cried a voice from within the room I will have
satisfaction at law

Ilyin who had not paid any heed to the counts promise to help him was
still lying on the sofa in his room drowned in tears of despair

The counts caresses and sympathy had awakened him to a consciousness of
the reality and now amidst the fog of strange thoughts and recollections
which filled his mind it made itself more and more felt

His youth rich in hopes honor his social position the dreams of love
and friendship were all destroyed forever The fountain of his tears began
to run dry a too calm feeling of hopelessness took possession of him and
the thought of suicide now bringing no sense of repulsion or terror more
and more frequently recurred to him

At this moment the counts firm steps were heard

On Turbins face were still visible the last traces of his recent wrath
his hands trembled slightly but in his eyes shone a kindly gayety and
selfsatisfaction

There It has been won back for you he cried tossing upon the table
several packages of banknotes Count them are they all there Then come
as soon as possible to the sittingroom I am going off right away he
added as though he did not perceive the tremendous revulsion of joy and
gratefulness which rushed over the uhlans face Then humming a gypsy
song he left the room


VIII

Sashka tightening his girdle was waiting for the horses to be harnessed
but was anxious to go first and get the counts cloak which with the
collar must have been worth three hundred rubles and return that
miserable bluelined shuba to that rascally man who had exchanged with the
count at the marshals But Turbin said that it was not necessary and went
to his room to change his clothes

The cavalryman kept hiccoughing as he sat silently by his gypsy maiden The
isprvnik called for vodka and invited all the gentlemen to come and
breakfast with him promising them that his wife would without fail dance
the national dance with the gypsies

The handsome young man was earnestly arguing with Ilyushka that there was
more soul in the pianoforte and that it was impossible to take Bflat on
the guitar The chinovnik was gloomily drinking tea in one corner and
apparently the daylight made him feel ashamed of his dissipation

The gypsies were conversing together in Romany and urging that they should
once more enliven the gentlemen to which Stioshka objected declaring that
it would only vex the baroraithat is in Romany count or prince or
rather great brin

For the most part the last spark of the orgy was dying out

Well then one more song for a farewell and then home with you
exclaimed the count fresh gay and radiant above all the others as he
came into the room ready dressed in his travelling suit

The gypsies had again formed their circle and were just getting ready to
sing when Ilyin came in with a package of banknotes in his hand and drew
the count to one side

I had only fifteen thousand rubles of public money but you gave me
sixteen thousand three hundred said the uhlan this is yours of
course

Thats a fine arrangement Let me have it

Ilyin handed him the money looking timidly at the count and opened his
mouth to say something but then he reddened so painfully that the tears
came into his eyes and he seized the counts hand and began to squeeze
it

Away with you Ilyushka  listen to me Now heres your money but you
must accompany me with your songs to the city limits And he threw on his
guitar the thirteen hundred rubles which Ilyin had brought him But the
count had forgotten to repay the cavalryman the one hundred rubles which he
had borrowed of him the evening before

It was now ten oclock in the morning The little sun was rising above the
housetops the streets were beginning to fill with people the merchants
had long ago opened their shops nobles and chinovniks were riding up and
down through the streets and ladies were out shopping when the band of
gypsies the isprvnik the cavalryman the handsome young fellow Ilyin
and the count who was wrapped up in his bluelined bearskin shuba came
out on the doorsteps of the hotel

It was a sunny day and it thawed Three hired trkas with their tails
knotted and splashing through the liquid mud pranced up to the steps and
the whole jolly company prepared to take their places The count Ilyin
Stioshka Ilyushka and Sashka the counts man mounted the first
sledge

Footnote  denshchik

Blcher was beside himself with delight and wagging his tail barked at
the shafthorse

The other gentlemen together with the gypsies men and women climbed into
the other sledges From the very hotel the sledges flew off side by side
and the gypsies set up a merry chorus and song

The trkas with the songs and jingling bells dashed through the whole
length of the city to the gates compelling all the equipages which they
met to rein up on the very sidewalks

Merchants and passersby who did not know them and especially those who
did were filled with astonishment to see nobles of high rank in the midst
of the white day dashing through the streets with intoxicated gypsies
singing at the tops of their voices

When they reached the city limits the trkas stopped and all the party
took farewell of the count

Ilyin who had drunk considerable at the leavetaking and had all the time
been driving the horses suddenly became melancholy and began to urge the
count to stay just one day more but when he was assured that this was
impossible quite unexpectedly threw himself into his arms and began to
kiss his new friend and promised him that as soon as he got to camp he
would petition to be transferred into the regiment of hussars in which
Count Turbin served

The count was extraordinarily hilarious he tipped into a snowdrift the
cavalryman who since morning had definitely taken to saying thou to
him he set Blcher on the isprvnik he took Stioshka into his arms and
threatened to carry her off with him to Moscow but at last he tucked
himself into the sledge and stationed Blcher by his side who was always
ready to ride Sashka took his place on the box after once more asking the
cavalryman to secure the counts cloak from them and to send it to him
The count cried Go on took off his cap waved it over his head and
whistled in postboy fashion to the horses The trkas parted company

Footnote  prshol

As far as the eye could see stretched a monotonous snowcovered plain
over which wound the yellowish muddy ribbon of the road

The bright sunlight dancing glistened on the melting snow which was
covered with a thin crust of transparent ice and pleasantly warmed the
face and back

The steam arose from the sweaty horses The bells jingled

A peasant with a creaking sledge heavily loaded slowly turned out
into the slushy snow twitching his hempen reins and tramping with his
wellsoaked sabots

Footnote  muzhk

Footnote  lapti

A stout handsome peasant woman with a child wrapped in a sheepskin on
her lap who was seated on another load used the end of her reins to whip
up a white mangytailed old nag

Suddenly the count remembered Anna Fedorovna

Turn round he cried

The driver did not understand

Turn round and drive back back to the city Be quick about it The
trka again passed the city gate and quickly drew up in front of the
boarded steps of the Zatsova dwelling

The count briskly mounted the steps passed through the vestibule and the
parlor and finding the widow still asleep he took her in his arms lifting
her from her bed and kissed her sleeping eyes again and again and then
darted back to the sledge

Anna Fedorovna awoke from her slumber and demanded What has happened

The count took his seat in his sledge shouted to the driver and now no
longer delaying and thinking not of Lukhnof nor of the little widow nor
of Stioshka but only of what was awaiting him in Moscow rapidly left the
city of K behind him


IX

A score of years have passed Much water has run since then many men have
died many children have been born many have grown up and become old
still more thoughts have been born and perished Much that was beautiful
and much that was ugly in the past have disappeared much that is beautiful
in the new has been brought forth and still more that is incomplete and
abortive of the new has appeared in Gods world

Count Fedor Turbin was long ago killed in a duel with some foreigner whom
he struck on the street with his long whip His son who was as like him as
two drops of water had already reached the age of two or three and twenty
and was a lovely fellow already serving in the cavalry

Morally the young Count Turbin was entirely different from his father
There was not a shadow of those fiery passionate and in truth be it said
corrupt inclinations peculiar to the last century

Together with intelligence cultivation and inherited natural gifts a
love for the proprieties and amenities of life a practical view of men and
circumstances wisdom and forethought were his chief characteristics

The young count made admirable progress in his profession at twentythree
he was already lieutenant When war broke out he came to the conclusion
that it would be more for his interests to enter the regular army and he
joined a regiment of hussars as captain of cavalry where he soon was given
command of a battalion

In the month of May  the S regiment of hussars was on its way
through the government of K and the very battalion which the young Count
Turbin commanded was obliged to be quartered for one night at Morozovka
Anna Fedorovnas village Anna Fedorovna was still alive but was now so
far from being young that she no longer called herself young which for a
woman means much

She had grown very stout and this it is said restores youth in a woman
But that was not the worst of it over her pale stout flesh was a network
of coarse flabby wrinkles She no longer went to the city she even found
it hard to mount into her carriage but still she was just as goodnatured
and as completely vacantminded as everthe truth might safely be told
now that it was no longer palliated by her beauty

Under her roof lived her daughter Liza a rustic Russian belle of
twentythree summers and her brother our acquaintance the cavalryman who
had spent all his patrimony in behalf of others and now in his old age
had taken refuge with Anna Fedorovna

The hair on his head had become perfectly gray his upper lip was sunken
but the mustache that it wore was carefully dyed Wrinkles covered not only
his brow and cheeks but also his nose and neck and yet his weak bowlegs
gave evidence of the old cavalryman

Anna Fedorovnas whole family and household were gathered in the small
parlor of the ancient house The balcony door and windows looking out into
a starshaped garden shaded by lindens were open Anna Fedorovna in her
gray hair and a lilaccolored gown was sitting on the sofa before a
small round mahogany table shuffling cards The old brother dressed in
spruce white pantaloons and a blue coat had taken up his position near the
window knitting strips of white cotton on a fork an occupation which his
niece had taught him and which gave him great enjoyment as he had nothing
else to do his eyes not being strong enough to enable him to read
newspapers which was his favorite occupation Near him Pmotchka a
protge of Anna Fedorovna was studying her lessons under the guidance
of Liza who with wooden knittingneedles was knitting stockings of
goatwool for her uncle

Footnote  katsavka

The last rays of the setting sun as always at this time threw under the
linden alley their soft reflections on the last windowpanes and the little
tagre which stood near it

In the garden it was so still that one could hear the swift rush of a
swallows wings and so quiet in the room that Anna Fedorovnas gentle
sigh or the old mans cough as he kept changing the position of his legs
was the only sound

How does this go Lzanka show me please I keep forgetting said Anna
Fedorovna pausing in the midst of her game of patience Liza without
stopping her work went over to her mother and glancing at the cards
Ah says she You have mixed them all up dear mamasha said she
arranging the cards That is the way they should be placed Now they come
as you desired she added secretly withdrawing one card

Now you are always managing to deceive me You said that it would go

No truly it goes I assure you It has come out right

Very well then very well you rogue But isnt it time for tea

I have just ordered the samovr heated I will go and see about it
immediately Shall we have it brought here Now Pmotchka hasten and
finish your lessons and we will go and take a run

And Liza started for the door

Lzotchka Lzanka cried her uncle steadfastly regarding his fork
again it seems to me I have dropped a stitch Arrange it for me my
darling

Footnote  golbchik

In a moment in a moment First I must have the sugar broken up

And in point of fact within three minutes she came running into the room
went up to her uncle and took him by the ear

Thats to pay you for dropping stitches said she laughing You have not
been knitting as I taught you

Now thatll do thatll do adjust it for me there seems to be some sort
of a knot

Liza took the fork pulled out a pin from her kerchief which was blown
back a little by the breeze coming through the window picked it out a
couple of times and handed it back to her uncle

Now you must kiss me for that said she putting up her rosy cheek toward
him and readjusting her kerchief You shall have rum in your tea today
Today is Friday you see

And again she went to the tearoom

Uncle dear come and look some hussars are riding up toward the house
her ringing voice was heard to say Anna Fedorovna and her brother hastened
into the tearoom the windows of which faced the village and looked at
the hussars Very little was to be seen through the cloud of dust it could
be judged only that a body of men was advancing

What a pity sister remarked the uncle to Anna Fedorovna what a pity
that we are so cramped and the wing is not built yet so that we might
invite the officers here Officers of the hussars they are such glorious
gay young fellows I should like to have a glimpse at them

Well I should be heartily glad but you know yourself that there is
nowhere to put them my sleepingroom Lizas room the parlor and then
your roomjudge for yourself Mikhlo Matveef has put the
strostas house in order for them he says it will be nice there

Footnote  Village elder

But we must find you a husband Lzotchka among thema glorious
hussar said the uncle

No I do not want a hussar I want an uhlan Let me see you served among
the uhlans didnt you uncle I dont care to know these hussars They
say they are desperate fellows

And Liza blushed a little and then once more her ringing laugh was heard
Theres Ustiushka running we must ask her what she saw said she Anna
Fedorovna sent to have Ustiushka brought in

She has no idea of sticking to her work she must always be running off to
look at the soldiers said Anna Fedorovna Now where have they lodged
the officers

With the Yeremkins your ladyship There are two of them such lovely men
One of them is a count they tell me

Whats his name

Kazrof or Turbnof I dont remember excuse me

There now youre a goose you dont know how to tell any thing at all
You might have remembered his name

Well Ill run and find out

I know that you are quite able to do that But no let Danlo
goBrother go and tell him to go have him ask if there is not something
which the officers may need every thing must be done in good form have
them understand that it is the lady of the house who has sent to find out

The old people sat down again in the tearoom and Liza went to the
servants room to put the lumps of sugar in the sugarbowl Ustiushka was
telling them there about the hussars

O my dear young lady what a handsome man he is that count she said
absolutely a little cherubim with black eyebrows You ought to have
such a husband as that what a lovely little couple you would make The
other maids smiled approvingly the old nurse sitting by the window with
her stocking sighed and drawing a long breath murmured a prayer

Footnote  kherubimchik

It seems to me that the hussars have given you a great deal of pleasure
said Liza You are a master hand at description Bring me the mors
Ustiushka please we must give the officers something sour to drink And
Liza laughing went out with the sugarbowl

Footnote  A sour beverage made of cranberries

But I should like to see what sort of a man this hussar iswhether he is
brunet or blondin And I imagine he would not object to making our
acquaintance But he will go away and never know that I was here and was
thinking about him And how many have passed by me in this way No one ever
sees me except uncle and Ustiushka How many times I have arranged my hair
how many pairs of cuffs I have put on and yet no one ever sees me or falls
in love with me she thought with a sigh contemplating her white plump
hand

He must be tall and have big eyes and a nice little black mustache
No I am already over twentytwo and no one has ever fallen in love with
me except the pockmarked Ivn Iptuitch And four years ago I was still
betterlooking and so my girlhood has gone and no one is the better for
it Ah I am an unhappy country maiden

Her mothers voice calling her to bring the tea aroused the country
maiden from this momentary revery

She shook her little head and went into the tearoom

The best things always happen unexpectedly and the more you try to force
them the worse they come out In the country it is rare that any attempt
is made to impart education and therefore when a good one is found it is
generally a surprise And thus it happened in a notable degree in the
case of Liza Anna Fedorovna through her own lack of intelligence and
natural laziness had not given Liza any education at all had not taught
her music nor the French language which is so indispensable But the girl
had fortunately been a healthy bright little child she had intrusted her
to a wetnurse and a daynurse she had fed her and dressed her in print
dresses and goatskin shoes and let her run wild and gather mushrooms and
berries had her taught reading and arithmetic by a resident seminarist
And thus as fate would have it at the age of sixteen she found in her
daughter a companion a soul who was always cheerful and goodnatured and
the actual mistress of the house

Through her goodness of heart Anna Fedorovna always had in her house some
protge either a serf or some foundling Liza from the time she was
ten years old had begun to take care of them to teach them clothe them
take them to church and keep them still when they were inclined to be
mischievous

Then her old brokendown but goodnatured uncle made his appearance and he
had to be taken care of like a child Then the domestic servants and the
peasants began to come to the young mistress with their desires and their
ailments and she treated them with elderberry mint and spirits of
camphor Then the domestic management of the house fell into her hands
entirely Then came the unsatisfied craving for love which found
expression only in nature and religion

Thus Liza by chance grew into an active goodnaturedly cheerful
selfpoised pure and deeply religious young woman

To be sure she had her little fits of jealousy and envy when she saw all
around her in church her neighbors dressed in new fashionable hats that
came from K she was sometimes vexed to tears by her old irritable
mother and her caprices she had her dreams of love in the most absurd and
even the crudest forms but her healthy activity which she could not
shirk drove them away and now at twentytwo not a single spot not a
single compunction had touched the fresh calm soul of this maiden now
developed into the fulness of perfect physical and moral beauty

Liza was of medium height rather plump than lean her eyes were brown
small with a soft dark shade on the lower lid she wore her flaxen hair in
a long braid

In walking she took long steps and swayed like a duck as the saying is

The expression of her face when she was occupied with her duties and
nothing especially disturbed her seemed to say to all who looked into it
Life in this world is good and pleasant to one who has a heart full of
love and a pure conscience

Even in moments of vexation of trouble of unrest or of melancholy in
spite of her tears of the drawingdown of the left brow of the compressed
lips of the petulance of her desires even then in the dimples of her
cheeks in the corners of her mouth and in her brilliant eyes so used to
smile and rejoice in lifeeven then there shone a heart good and upright
and unspoiled by knowledge

It was still rather warm though the sun was already set when the
battalion arrived at Morozovka In front of them along the dusty village
street trotted a brindled cow separated from the herd bellowing and
occasionally stopping to look round and never once perceiving that all she
had to do was to turn out and let the battalion pass

Peasants old men women children and domestic serfs crowding both sides
of the road gazed curiously at the hussars

Through a thick cloud of dust the hussars rode along on ravenblack horses
curvetting and occasionally snorting

At the right of the battalion gracefully mounted on beautiful black
steeds rode two officers One was the commander Count Turbin the other a
very young man who had recently been promoted from the yunkers his name
was Polzof

A hussar in a white kittel came from the best of the cottages and
taking off his cap approached the officers

What quarters have been assigned to us asked the count

For your excellency replied the quartermaster his whole body
shuddering Here at the strostas he has put his cottage in order I
tried to get a room at the mansion but they said no the proprietress
is so illtempered

Footnote  barsky dvor

Well all right said the count dismounting and stretching his legs as
he reached the strostas cottage Tell me has my carriage come

It has deigned to arrive your excellency replied the quartermaster
indicating with his cap the leathern carriagetop which was to be seen
inside the gate and then hastening ahead into the entry of the cottage
which was crowded with the family of serfs gathered to have a look at the
officer

He even tripped over an old woman as he hastily opened the door of the
neatly cleaned cottage and stood aside to let the count pass

The cottage was large and commodious but not perfectly clean The German
bodyservant dressed like a brin was standing in the cottage and
having just finished setting up the iron bed was taking out clean linen
from a trunk

Footnote  kammerdiener

Phu what a nasty lodging exclaimed the count in vexation Didenko
Is it impossible to find me better quarters at the proprietors or
somewhere

If your excellency command I will go up to the mansion replied
Didenko but the house is small and wretched and seems not much better
than the cottage

Well thats all now You can go

And the count threw himself down on the bed supporting his head with his
hands

Johann he cried to his bodyservant again you have made a hump in the
middle Why cant you learn to make a bed decently

Johann was anxious to make it over again

No you need not trouble about it now Wheres my dressinggown he
proceeded to ask in a petulant voice The servant gave him the
dressinggown

The count before he put it on examined the skirt There it is You have
not taken that spot out Could it be possible for any one to be a worse
servant than you are he added snatching the garment from the servants
hands and putting it on Now tell me do you do this way on purpose Is
tea ready

I havent had time to make it replied Johann

Fool

After this the count took a French novel which was at hand and read for
some time without speaking but Johann went out into the entry to blow up
the coals in the samovr

It was plain to see that the count was in a bad humor it must have been
owing to weariness to the dust on his face to his tightlyfitting
clothes and to his empty stomach Johann he cried again give me an
account of those ten rubles What did you get in town

The count looked over the account which the servant handed him and made
some dissatisfied remarks about the high prices paid

Give me the rum for the tea

I did not get any rum said Johann

Delightful How many times have I told you always to have rum

I didnt have money enough

Why didnt Polzof buy it You might have got some from his man

The cornet Polzof I do not know He bought tea and sugar

Beast Get you gone You are the only man who has the power to exhaust my
patience You know that I always take rum in my tea when I am on the
march

Here are two letters one of the staff brought for you said the
bodyservant

The count as he lay on the bed tore open the letters and began to read
them At this moment the cornet came in with gay countenance having
quartered the battalion

Well how is it Turbin Its firstrate here seems to me I am tired
out I confess it It has been a warm day

Firstrate I should think so A dirty stinking hut and no rum thanks
to you Your stupid did not buy any nor this one either You might have
said something anyway

And he went on with his reading After he had read the letter through he
crumpled it up and threw it on the floor

Why didnt you buy some rum the cornet in a whisper demanded of his
servant in the entry Didnt you have any money

Well why should we be always the ones to spend the money I have enough
to spend for without that and his German does nothing but smoke his
pipethats all

The second letter was evidently not disagreeable because the count smiled
as he read it

Whos that from asked Polzof returning to the room and trying to
arrange for himself a couch on the floor near the oven

From Mina replied the count gayly handing him the letter Would you
like to read it What a lovely woman she is Now shes better than our
young ladies thats a fact Just see what feeling and what wit in that
letter Theres only one thing that I dont likeshe asks me for money

No thats not pleasant replied the cornet

Well its true I promised to give her some but this expeditionAnd
besides if I am commander of the battalion at the end of three months I
will send some to her I should not regret it shes really a lovely woman
Isnt she he asked with a smile following with his eyes Polzofs
expression as he read the letter

Horribly misspelled but sweet it seems to me she really loves you
replied the cornet

Hm I should think so Only these women truly love when they do love

But who was that other letter from asked the cornet pointing to the one
which he had read

That Oh thats from a certain man very ugly to whom I owe a gambling
debt and this is the third time that he has reminded me of it I cant pay
it to him now Its a stupid letter replied the count evidently nettled
by the recollection of it

The two officers remained silent for some little time The cornet who it
seemed had come under Turbins influence drank his tea without speaking
though he occasionally cast a glance at the clouded face of the handsome
count who gazed steadily out of the window He did not venture to renew
the conversation

Well then I think it can be accomplished without difficulty suddenly
exclaimed the count turning to Polzof and gayly nodding his head If we
who are in the line get promoted this year yes and if we take part in
some engagement then I can overtake my former captains of the guard

They were drinking their second cup of tea and the conversation was still
dwelling on this theme when the old Danlo came with the message from Anna
Fedorovna

And she would also like to know whether you are not pleased to be the son
of Fedor Ivnovitch Turbin he added on his own responsibility as he
had found out the officers name and still remembered the late counts
visit to the city of K Our mistress Anna Fedorovna used to be very
well acquainted with him

Footnote  bruinya

He was my father Now tell the lady that I am very much obliged but that
I need nothing only if it would not be possible to give me a cleaner room
in the mansion say or somewhere

Now why did you do that asked Polzof after Danlo had gone Isnt it
just the same thing For one night isnt it just as well here And it will
put them to inconvenience

There it is again It seems to me we have had enough of being sent round
among these smoky hovels Its easy enough to see that you are not a
practical man Why shouldnt we seize the opportunity when we can of
sleeping even if its for only one night like decent men And they
contrary to what you think will be mighty glad Theres only one thing
objectionable If this lady used to know my father continued the count
with a smile that discovered his white gleaming teethsomehow I always
feel a little ashamed of my late papasha theres always some scandalous
story or some debt or other And so I cant endure to meet any of my
fathers acquaintances However that was an entirely different age he
added seriously

Footnote  krnaya izb a peasants hut without chimney

Oh I did not tell you rejoined Polzof I recently met Ilyin the
brigade commander of uhlans He is very anxious to see you he is
passionately fond of your father

I think that he is terrible trash that Ilyin But the worst is that all
these gentlemen who imagine that they knew my father in order to make
friends with me insist upon telling me as though it were very pleasant
for me to hear about escapades of his that make me blush It is true I am
not impulsive and I look upon things dispassionately while he was too
hotspirited a man and sometimes he played exceedingly reprehensible
tricks However that was all due to his time In our day and generation
maybe he would have been a very sensible man for he had tremendous
abilities one must give him credit for that

In a quarter of an hour the servant returned and brought an invitation for
them to come and spend the night at the mansion


XI

As soon as Anna Fedorovna learned that the officer of hussars was the son
of Count Fedor Turbin she was thrown into a great state of excitement

Oh great heavens he is my darling Danlo run hurry tell them the
lady invites them to stay at her house she cried in great agitation and
hastening to the servants room Lzanka Ustiushka You must have your
room put in order Liza You can go into your uncles room and you
brotherbrother you can sleep tonight in the parlor Its for only one
night

Footnote  btiuzhki mo

Thats nothing sister I would sleep on the floor

He must be a handsome fellow I think if hes like his father Only let
me see him the turtledove You shall see for yourself Liza Ah his
father was handsome Where shall we put the table Let it go there said
Anna Fedorovna running about here and there There now bring in two
beds get one from the overseer and get from the tagre the glass
candlestick which my brother gave me for my birthday and put in a wax
candle

At last all was ready Liza in spite of her mothers interference
arranged her room in her own way for the two officers

She brought out clean linen sheets fragrant of mignonnette and had the
beds made she ordered a carafe of water and candles near it on the little
table She burned scented paper in the girls room and moved her own
little bed into her uncles chamber

Anna Fedorovna gradually became calm and sat down again in her usual
place she even took out her cards but instead of shuffling them she
leaned on her fat elbow and gave herself up to her thoughts

How time has gone how time has gone she exclaimed in a whisper It is
long long isnt it I seem to see him now Akh he was a scamp

And the tears came into her eyes Now here is Lzanka but she isnt at
all what I was at her age She is a nice girl but no not quite

Lzanka you had better wear your mousselindelaine dress this evening

But are you going to invite them downstairs mamasha You had better not
do it rejoined Liza with a feeling of invincible agitation at the
thought of seeing the officers You had better not mamasha

In point of fact she did not so much desire to see them as she felt
apprehensive of some painful pleasure awaiting her as it seemed to her

Perhaps they themselves would like to make our acquaintance Lzotchka
said Anna Fedorovna glancing at her daughters hair and at the same time
thinking No not such hair as I had at her age No Lzotchka how much I
could wish for you And she really wished something very excellent for her
daughter but she could scarcely look forward to a match with the count
she could not desire such a relationship as she herself had formed with his
father but that something good would come of it she wished very very
much for her daughter She possibly had the desire to live over again in
her daughters happiness all the life which she lived with the late count

The old cavalryman was also somewhat excited by the counts coming He went
to his room and shut himself up in it At the end of a quarter of an hour
he reappeared dressed in a Hungarian coat and blue pantaloons and with a
troubledhappy expression of countenance such as a girl wears when she
puts on her first balldress he started for the room assigned to the
guests

We shall have a glimpse of some of the hussars of today sister The late
count was indeed a genuine hussar We shall see we shall see

The officers had by this time come in by the back entrance and were in the
room that had been put at their service

There now said the count stretching himself out in his dusty boots on
the bed which had just been made for him if we arent better off here
than we were there in that hovel with the cockroaches

Better of course but think what obligations we are putting ourselves
under to the people here

What rubbish You must always be a practical man They are mighty glad to
have us of course Fellow cried the count ask some one to put a
curtain up at this window else therell be a draught in the night

At this moment the old man came in to make the acquaintance of the
officers Though he was somewhat confused he did not fail to tell how he
had been a comrade of the late counts who had been very congenial to him
and he even went so far as to say that more than once he had been under
obligations to the late count Whether he meant in speaking of the
obligations to the late count a reference to the hundred rubles which the
count had borrowed and never returned or to his throwing him into the
snowdrift or to the slap in the face the old man failed to explain

However the count was very urbane with the old cavalryman and thanked him
for his hospitality

You must excuse us if it is not very luxurious counthe almost said
your excellency as he had got out of the habit of meeting with men of
rank My sisters house is rather small As for the window here we will
find something to serve as a curtain right away and it will be
firstrate added the little old man and under the pretext of going for a
curtain but really because he wanted to give his report about the officers
as quickly as possible he left the room The pretty little Ustiushka came
bringing her mistresss shawl to serve as a curtain She was also
commissioned to ask if the gentlemen would not like some tea

The cheerful hospitality had had a manifestly beneficent influence upon the
counts spirits He laughed and jested with Ustiushka gayly and went to
such lengths that she even called him a bad man he asked her if her
mistress was pretty and in reply to her question whether he would like
some tea replied that she might please bring him some but above all as
his supper was not ready he would like some vodka now and a little lunch
and some sherry if there was any

The old uncle was in raptures over the young counts politeness and
praised to the skies the young generation of officers saying that the men
of the present day were far preferable to those of the past

Anna Fedorovna could not agree to thatno one could be any better than
Count Fedor Ivnovitchand she was beginning to grow seriously angry
and remarked dryly For you brother the one who flatters you last is the
best Without any question the men of our time are better educated but
still Fedor Ivnovitch could dance the schottische and was so amiable
that everybody in his day you might say was stupid compared to him only
he did not care for any one else beside me Oh certainly there were fine
men in the old time

At this moment came the message requesting the vodka the lunch and the
sherry

There now just like you brother You never do things right We ought to
have had supper prepared Liza attend to it thats my darling

Liza hastened to the storeroom for mushrooms and fresh cream butter and
told the cook to prepare beef cutlets

How much sherry is there Havent you any left brother

No sister I never have had any

What no sherry but what is it you drink in your tea

That is rum Anna Fedorovna

Isnt that the same thing Give them some of that It is all the same
itll make no difference Or would it not be better to invite them down
here brother You know all about it They would not be offended I
imagine would they

The cavalryman assured her that he would answer for it that the count in
his goodness of heart would not decline and that he would certainly bring
them

Anna Fedorovna went off to put on for some reason or other her grosgrain
dress and a new cap but Liza was so busy that she had no time to take off
her pink gingham dress with wide sleeves Moreover she was terribly
wrought up it seemed to her that something astonishing like a very low
black cloud was sweeping down upon her soul

This counthussar this handsome fellow seemed to her an absolutely novel
and unexpected but beautiful creature His character his habits his
words it seemed to her must be something extraordinary such as had never
come into the range of her experience All that he thought and said must be
bright and true all that he did must be honorable his whole appearance
must be beautiful She could have no doubt of that If he had demanded not
merely a lunch and sherry but even a bath in spirits of salvia she would
not have been surprised she would not have blamed him and she would have
been convinced that this was just and reasonable

The count immediately accepted when the cavalryman brought him his sisters
invitation he combed his hair put on his coat and took his cigarcase

Will you come he asked of Polzof

Indeed we had better not go replied the cornet ils feront des frais
pour nous recevoir

Rubbish it will make them happy Besides I have been making
inquiries  theres a pretty daughter here Come along said the
count in French

Je vous en prie messieurs said the cavalryman merely for the sake of
giving them to understand that he also could speak French and understood
what the officers were saying


XII

Liza red in the face and with downcast eyes was ostensibly occupied with
filling up the teapot and did not dare to look at the officers as they
entered the room

Anna Fedorovna on the contrary briskly jumped up and bowed and without
taking her eyes from the counts face began to talk to him now finding an
extraordinary resemblance to his father now presenting her daughter now
offering him tea meats or jellycakes

No one paid any attention to the cornet thanks to his modest behavior and
he was very glad of it because it gave him a chance within the limits of
propriety to observe and study the details of Lizas beauty which had
evidently come over him with the force of a surprise

The uncle listening to his sisters conversation had a speech ready on his
lips and was waiting for a chance to relate his cavalry experiences

The count smoked his cigar over his tea so that Liza had great difficulty
in refraining from coughing but he was very talkative and amiable at
first in the infrequent pauses of Anna Fedorovnas conversation he
introduced his own stories and finally he took the conversation into his
own hands

One thing struck his listeners as rather strange in his talk he often used
words which though not considered reprehensible in his own set were
here rather audacious so that Anna Fedorovna was a little abashed and
Liza blushed to the roots of her hair But this the count did not notice
and continued to be just as natural and amiable as ever

Liza filled the glasses in silence not putting them into the hands of the
guests but pushing them toward them she had not entirely recovered from
her agitation but listened eagerly to the counts anecdotes

The counts pointless tales and the pauses in the conversation gradually
reassured her The bright things that she had expected from him were not
forthcoming nor did she find in him that surpassing elegance for which she
had confusedly hoped Even as soon as the third glass of tea when her
timid eyes once encountered his and he did not avoid them but continued
almost too boldly to stare at her with a lurking smile she became
conscious of a certain feeling of hostility against him and she soon
discovered that there was not only nothing out of the ordinary in him but
that he was very little different from those whom she had already seen in
fact that there was no reason to be afraid of him She noticed that he had
long and neat fingernails but otherwise there was no mark of special
beauty about him

Liza suddenly not without some inward sorrow renouncing her dream
regained her selfpossession and only the undemonstrative cornets glance
which she felt fixed upon her disquieted her

Perhaps it is not the count but the other she said to herself


XIII

After tea the old lady invited her guests into the other room and again
sat down in her usual place But perhaps you would like to rest count
she asked Well then what would you like to amuse yourselves with my
dear guests she proceeded to ask after she had been assured to the
contrary You play cards do you not countHere brother you might
take a hand in some game or other

Why you yourself can play prfrence replied the cavalryman You had
better take a hand then The count will play will he not And you

The officers were agreeable to every thing that might satisfy their amiable
hosts

Liza brought from her room her old cards which she used for divining
whether her mother would speedily recover of a cold or whether her uncle
would return on such and such a day from the city if he chanced to have
gone there or whether her neighbor would be in during the day and other
like things These cards though they had been in use for two months were
less soiled than those which Anna Fedorovna used for the same purpose

Perhaps you are not accustomed to playing for small stakes suggested the
uncle Anna Fedorovna and I play for halfkopeks and then she always gets
the better of all of us

Ah make your own arrangements I shall be perfectly satisfied said the
count

Well then be it in paper kopeks for the sake of our dear guests only
let me gain as I am old said Anna Fedorovna settling herself in her
chair and adjusting her mantilla Maybe I shall win a ruble of them
thought Anna Fedorovna who in her old age felt a little passion for cards

If you would like I will teach you to play with tablets said the count
and with the misries It is very jolly

Everybody was delighted with this new Petersburg fashion The uncle went so
far as to assert that he knew it and that it was just the same thing as
boston but that he had forgotten somewhat about it

Anna Fedorovna did not comprehend it at all and it took her so long to get
into it that she felt under the necessity of smiling and nodding her head
assuringly to give the impression that she now understood and that now it
was all perfectly clear to her But there was no little amusement created
when in the midst of the game Anna Fedorovna with ace and king blank
called misrie and remained with the six She even began to grow
confused smiled timidly and hastened to assure them that she had not as
yet become accustomed to the new way

Nevertheless they put down the points against her and many of them too
the more because the count through his practice of playing on large
stakes played carefully led very prudently and never at all understood
what the cornet meant by sundry raps with his foot under the table or why
he made such stupid blunders in playing

Liza brought in more jellycakes three kinds of preserves and apples
cooked in some manner with portwine and then standing behind her
mothers chair she looked on at the game and occasionally watched the
officers and especially the counts white hands with their delicate long
fingernails as he with such skill assurance and grace threw the cards
and took the tricks

Once more Anna Fedorovna with some show of temper going beyond the others
bid as high as seven and lost three points and when at her brothers
instigation she tried to make some calculation she found herself utterly
confused and off the track

Its nothing mamasha youll win it back again said Liza with a smile
anxious to rescue her mother from her ridiculous position Some time
youll put a fine on uncle then he will be caught

But you might help me Lzotchka cried Anna Fedorovna looking with an
expression of dismay at her daughter I dont know how this

But I dont know how to play this either rejoined Liza carefully
calculating her mothers losses But if you go on at this rate mamasha
you will lose a good deal and Pmotchka will not have her new dress she
added in jest

Yes in this way it is quite possible to lose ten silver rubles said the
cornet looking at Liza and anxious to draw her into conversation

Arent we playing for paper money asked Anna Fedorovna gazing round at
the rest

I dont know I am sure replied the count But I dont know how to
reckon in banknotes What are they what do you mean by banknotes

Footnote  Assignatsii

Why no one nowadays reckons in banknotes explained the cavalryman who
was playing like a hero and was on the winning side

The old lady ordered some sparkling wine drank two glasses herself grew
quite flushed and seemed to abandon all hope One braid of her gray hair
escaped from under her cap and she did not even put it up It was evident
that she thought herself losing millions and that she was entirely ruined
The cornet kept nudging the counts leg more and more emphatically The
count was noting down the old ladys losses

At last the game came to an end In spite of Anna Fedorovnas efforts to
bring her reckoning higher than it should be and to pretend that she had
been cheated in her account and that it could not be correct in spite of
her dismay at the magnitude of her losses at last the account was made
out and she was found to have lost nine hundred and twenty points

Isnt that equal to nine paper rubles she asked again and again and she
did not begin to realize how great her forfeit was until her brother to
her horror explained that she was out thirtytwo and a half paper
rubles and that it was absolutely necessary for her to pay it

The count did not even sum up his gains but as soon as the game was over
arose and went over to the window where Liza was arranging the lunch and
putting potted mushrooms on a plate There he did with perfect calmness and
naturalness what the cornet had been anxious and yet unable to effect all
the eveninghe engaged her in conversation about the weather

The cornet at this time was brought into a thoroughly unpleasant
predicament Anna Fedorovna in the absence of the count and Liza who had
managed to keep her in a jovial frame of mind became really angry

Indeed it is too bad that we have caused you to lose so heavily said
Polzof in order to say something It is simply shameful

I should think these tablets and misries were something of your own
invention I dont know any thing about them How many paper rubles does
the whole amount to she demanded

Thirtytwo rubles thirtytwo and a half insisted the cavalryman who
from the effect of having been on the winning side was in a very waggish
frame of mind Give him the money sister Give it to him

I will give all I owe only you must not ask for any more No I shall
never win it back in my life

And Anna Fedorovna went to her room all in excitement hurried back and
brought nine paper rubles Only on the old mans strenuous insistence she
was induced to pay the whole sum Polzof had some fear that the old lady
would pour out on him the vials of her wrath if he entered into
conversation with her He silently without attracting attention turned
away and rejoined the count and Liza who were talking at the open window

On the table which was now spread for the supper stood two tallow
candles whose flame occasionally flickered in the gentle breeze of the
mild May night Through the window opening into the garden came a very
different light from that which filled the room The moon almost at its
full already beginning to lose its golden radiance was pouring over the
tops of the lofty lindens and making brighter and brighter the delicate
fleecy clouds that occasionally overcast it

From the pond the surface of which silvered in one place by the moon
could be seen through the trees came the voices of the frogs In the
sweetscented lilacbush under the very window which from time to time
slowly shook its heavyladen blossoms birds were darting and fluttering

What marvellous weather said the count as he joined Liza and sat down
in the low windowseat I suppose you go to walk a good deal dont you

Yes rejoined Liza not experiencing the slightest embarrassment in the
counts company Every morning at seven oclock I make the tour of the
estate and sometimes I take a walk with Pmotchkamammas protge

Its pleasant living in the country cried the count putting his monocle
to his eye and gazing first at the garden and then at Liza But dont
you like to take a walk on moonlight nights

No Three years ago my uncle and I used to go out walking every moonlight
night He had some sort of strange illnessinsomnia Whenever there was a
full moon he could not sleep His room like this opens into the garden
and the window is low The moon shines right into it

Strange remarked the count Then this is your room

No I only sleep there for this one night You occupy my room

Is it possible  oh good heavens I shall never in the world
forgive myself for the trouble that I have caused said the count casting
the monocle from his eye as a sign of sincerity If I had only known
that I was going to

Footnote  Akh Bozhe mo

How much trouble was it On the contrary I am very glad My uncles room
is so nice and jolly theres a low window there I shall sit down in it
before I go to bed or perhaps I shall go down out into the garden and
take a little walk

What a glorious girl said the count to himself replacing the monocle
and staring at her and while pretending to change his seat in the window
trying to touch her foot with his And how shrewdly she gave me to
understand that I might meet her in the garden at the window if I would
come down

Liza even lost in the counts eyes a large share of her charm so easy did
the conquest of her seem to him

And how blissful it must be said the count dreamily gazing into the
shadowhaunted alley to spend such a night in the garden with the object
of ones love

Liza was somewhat abashed by these words and by a second evidently
deliberate pressure upon her foot Before she thought she made some reply
for the sake of dissimulating her embarrassment

She said Yes it is splendid to walk in the moonlight

There was something disagreeable about the whole conversation She put the
cover on the jar from which she had been taking the mushrooms and was just
turning from the window when the cornet came toward her and she felt a
curiosity to know what kind of a man he was

What a lovely night said he

They can only talk about the weather thought Liza

What a wonderful view continued the cornet only I should think it
would be tiresome he added through a strange propensity peculiar to him
of saying things sure to offend the people who pleased him very much

Why should you think so Always the same cooking and always the same dress
might become tiresome but a lovely garden can never be tiresome when you
enjoy walking and especially when theres a moon rising higher and higher
From my uncles room you can see the whole pond I shall see it from there
tonight

And you havent any nightingales at all have you asked the count
greatly put out because Polzof had come and prevented him from learning
the exact conditions of the rendezvous

Oh yes we always have them last year the hunters caught one and last
week there was one that sang beautifully but the district inspector
came along with his bells and scared him away Three years ago my uncle
and I used to sit out in the covered alley and listen to one for two hours
at a time

Footnote  stanovi

What is this chatterbox telling you about inquired the old uncle
joining the trio Arent you ready for something to eat

At supper the count by his reiterated praise of the viands and his
appetite succeeded somewhat in pacifying Anna Fedorovnas unhappy state of
mind Afterwards the officers made their adieux and went to their room
The count shook hands with the old cavalier and to Anna Fedorovnas
surprise with her without offering to kiss her hand and he also squeezed
Lizas hand at the same time looking straight into her eyes and craftily
smiling his pleasing smile This glance again somewhat disconcerted the
maiden He is very handsome she said to herself only he is quite too
conceited


XIV

Well now arent you ashamed exclaimed Polzof when the two officers
had reached the privacy of their chamber I tried to lose and I kept
nudging you under the table Now arent you really ashamed The poor old
lady was quite beside herself

The count burst into a terrible fit of laughter

A most amusing dame How abused she felt

And again he began to laugh so heartily that even Johann who was standing
in front of him cast down his eyes to conceal a smile And here is the
son of an old family friend Ha ha ha continued the count in a gale of
laughter

No indeed it is not right I felt really sorry for her said the
cornet

What rubbish How young you are What did you think that I was going to
lose Why should I lose I only lose when I dont know any better Ten
rubles brother will come in handy You must look on life in a practical
way or else you will always be a fool

Polzof made no answer in the first place he wanted to think by himself
about Liza who seemed to him to be an extraordinarily pure and beautiful
creature

He undressed and lay down on the clean soft bed which had been made ready
for him

How absurd all these honors and the glory of war he thought to himself
gazing at the window shaded by the shawl through the interstices of which
crept the pale rays of the moon Here is happinessto live in a quiet
nook with a gentle bright simplehearted wife that is enduring true
happiness

But somehow he did not communicate these imaginations to his friend and he
did not even speak of the rustic maiden though he felt sure that the count
was also thinking about her

Why dont you undress he demanded of the count who was walking up and
down the room

Oh I dont feel like sleeping Put out the candle if you like said he
I can undress in the dark

And he continued to walk up and down

He does not feel sleepy repeated Polzof who after the evenings
experiences felt more than ever dissatisfied with the counts influence
upon him and disposed to revolt against it I imagine he reasoned
mentally addressing Turbin what thoughts are now trooping through that
wellcombed head of yours And I saw how she pleased you But you are not
the kind to appreciate that simplehearted pureminded creature Mina is
the one for you you want the epaulets of a colonelIndeed I have a mind
to ask him how he liked her

And Polzof was about to address him but he deliberated he felt that not
only he was not in the right frame of mind to discuss with him if the
counts glance at Liza was what he interpreted it to be but that he should
not have the force of mind necessary for him to disagree with him so
accustomed was he to submit to an influence which for him grew each day
more burdensome and unrighteous

Where are you going he asked as the count took his cap and went to the
door

I am going to the stable I wish to see if every thing is all right

Strange thought the cornet but he blew out the candle and trying to
dispel the absurdly jealous and hostile thoughts that arose against his
former friend he turned over on the other side

Anna Fedorovna meantime having crossed herself and kissed her brother
her daughter and her protge as affectionately as usual also retired
to her room

Long had it been since the old lady had experienced in a single day so many
powerful sensations She could not even say her prayers in tranquillity
all the melancholy but vivid remembrances of the late count and of this
young dandy who had so ruthlessly taken advantage of her kept coming up in
her mind

Nevertheless she undressed as usual and drank a half glass of kvas which
stood ready on the little table near the bed and lay down Her beloved cat
came softly into the room Anna Fedorovna called her and began to stroke
her fur and listen to her purring but still she could not go to sleep

It is the cat that disturbs me she said to herself and pushed her away
The cat fell to the floor softly and slowly waving her bushy tail got
upon the oven and then the maid who slept in the room on the floor
brought her felt and put out the candle after lighting the nightlamp

Footnote  The lezhanka a part of the oven built out as a sort of
couch

At last the maid began to snore but sleep still refused to come to Anna
Fedorovna and calm her excited imagination The face of the hussar
constantly arose before her mental vision when she shut her eyes and it
seemed to her that it appeared in various strange guises in her room when
she opened her eyes and looked at the commode at the table and her white
raiment hanging up in the feeble light of the nightlamp Then it seemed
hot to her in the featherbed and the ticking of the watch on the table
seemed unendurable exasperating to the last degree the snoring of the
maid She wakened her and bade her cease snoring

Again the thoughts of the old count and of the young count and of the game
of prfrence became strangely mixed in her mind Now she seemed to see
herself waltzing with the former count she saw her own round white
shoulders she felt on them some ones kisses and then she saw her
daughter in the young counts embrace

Once more Ustiushka began to snore

No its somehow different now the men arent the same He was ready to
fling himself into the fire for my sake Yes I was worth doing it for But
this one have no fear is sound asleep like a goose instead of wooing
How his father fell on his knees and said Whatever you desire I will do
I could kill myself in a moment what do you desire And he would have
killed himself if I had bade him

Suddenly the sound of bare feet was heard in the corridor and Liza with a
shawl thrown over her came in pale and trembling and almost fell on her
mothers bed

After saying goodnight to her mother Liza had gone alone to the room that
had been her uncles Putting on a white jacket throwing a handkerchief
round her thick long braids she put out the light opened the window and
curled up in a chair turning her dreamy eyes to the pond which was now all
shining with silver brilliancy

All her ordinary occupations and interests came up before her now in an
entirely different light Her capricious old mother unreasoning love for
whom had become a part of her very soul her feeble but amiable old uncle
the domestics the peasants who worshipped their young mistress the milch
cows and the calves all this nature which was forever the same in its
continual death and resurrection amid which she had grown up with love
for others and with the love of others for herall this that gave her
that gentle agreeable peace of mindsuddenly seemed to her something
different it all seemed to her dismal superfluous

It was as though some one said to her Fool fool For twenty years you
have been occupied in trivialities you have been serving others without
reason and you have not known what life what happiness were

This was what she thought now as she gazed down into the depths of the
motionless moonlit garden and the thought came over her with vastly more
force than ever before And what was it that induced this train of thought
It was not in the least a sudden love for the count as might easily be
supposed On the contrary he did not please her It might rather have been
the cornet of whom she was thinking but he was homely poor and taciturn

No it isnt that she said to herself

Her ideal was so charming It was an ideal which might have been loved in
the midst of this night in the midst of this nature without infringing
its supernal beauty an ideal not in the least circumscribed by the
necessity of reducing it to coarse reality

In days gone by her lonely situation and the absence of people who might
have attracted her caused that all the strength of the love which
Providence has implanted impartially in the hearts of each one of us was
still intact and potential in her soul But now she had been living too
long with the pathetic happiness of feeling that she possessed in her heart
this something and occasionally opening the mysterious chalice of her
heart of rejoicing in the contemplation of its riches ready to pour out
without stint on some one all that it contained

God grant that she may not have to take this melancholy delight with her to
the tomb But who knows if there be any better and more powerful delight
or if it is not the only true and possible one

O Father in heaven she thought is it possible that I have lost my
youth and my happiness and that they will never return Will they never
return again is it really true

She gazed in the direction of the moon at the bright faroff sky studded
with white wavy clouds which as they swept on toward the moon blotted
out the little stars

If the moon should seize that little cloud above it then it means that it
is true she thought A thin smokelike strip of cloud passed over the
lower half of the brilliant orb and gradually the light grew fainter on
the turf on the linden tops on the pond the black shadows of the trees
grew less distinct And as though to harmonize with the gloomy shade which
was enveloping nature a gentle breeze stirred through the leaves and
brought to the window the dewy fragrance of the leaves the moist earth
and the blooming lilacs

No it is not true she said trying to console herself but if the
nightingale should sing this night then I should take it to mean that all
my forebodings are nonsense and that there is no need of losing hope

And long she sat in silence as though expecting some one while once more
all grew bright and full of life and then again and again the clouds
passed over the moon and all became sombre

She was even beginning to grow drowsy as she sat there by the window when
she was aroused by the nightingales melodious trills clearly echoing
across the pond The rustic maiden opened her eyes Once more with a new
enjoyment her whole soul was dedicated to that mysterious union with the
nature which so calmly and serenely spread out before her

She leaned on both elbows A certain haunting sensation of gentle
melancholy oppressed her heart and tears of pure deep love burning for
satisfaction good consoling tears sprang to her eyes

She leaned her arms on the windowsill and rested her head upon them Her
favorite prayer seemed of its own accord to arise in her soul and thus she
fell asleep with moist eyes

The pressure of some ones hand awakened her She started up But the touch
was gentle and pleasant The hand squeezed hers with a stronger pressure

Suddenly she realized the true state of things screamed tore herself
away and trying to make herself believe that it was not the count who
bathed in the brilliant moonlight was standing in front of her window she
hastened from the room


XV

It was indeed the count When he heard the maidens cry and the cough of
the watchman who was coming from the other side of the fence in reply to
the shriek he had the sensation of being a thief caught in the act and
started to run across the dewdrenched grass so as to hide in the depths
of the garden

Oh what a fool I was he said instinctively I frightened her I ought
to have been more gentle to have wakened her by gentle words Oh I am a
beast a blundering beast

He paused and listened The watchman had come through the wicketgate into
the garden dragging his cane along the sanded walk

He must hide He went toward the pond The frogs made him tremble as they
hastily sprang from under his very feet into the water There
notwithstanding his wet feet he crouched down on his heels and began to
recall all he had donehow he had crept through the hedge found her
window and at last caught a glimpse of a white shadow how several times
while on the watch for the least noise he had hastened away from the
window how at one moment it seemed to him that doubtless she was waiting
for him with vexation in her heart that he was so dilatory and the next
how impossible it seemed that she would make an appointment with him so
easily and how finally coming to the conclusion that through the
embarrassment naturally felt by a country maiden she was only pretending
to be asleep he had resolutely gone up to the window and seen clearly her
position and then suddenly for some occult reason had run away again
and only after a powerful effort of selfcontrol being ashamed of his
cowardice he had gone boldly up to her and touched her on the hand

The watchman again coughed and shutting the squeaky gate went out of the
garden The window in the young girls room was shut and the wooden
shutters inside were drawn

The count was terribly disappointed to see this He would have given a good
deal to have a chance to begin it all over again he would not have acted
so stupidly

A marvellous girl what freshness simply charming And so I lost her
Stupid beast that I was

However as he was not in the mood to go to sleep yet he walked as chance
should lead along the path through the linden alley with the resolute
steps of a man who has been angry And now for him also this night brought
as its gifts of reconciliation a strange calming melancholy and a
craving for love

The clay path here and there dotted with sprouting grass or dry twigs was
lighted by patches of pale light where the moon sent its rays straight
through the thick foliage of the lindens Here and there a bending bough
apparently overgrown with gray moss gleamed on one side The silvered
foliage occasionally rustled

At the house there was no light in the windows all sounds were hushed
only the nightingale filled with his song all the immensity of silent and
glorious space

My God what a night what a marvellous night thought the count
breathing in the fresh fragrance of the garden Something makes me feel
blue as though I were dissatisfied with myself and with others and
dissatisfied with my whole life But what a splendid dear girl Perhaps
she was really offended Here his fancies changed He imagined himself
there in the garden with this district maiden in various and most
remarkable situations then his mistress Mina supplanted the maidens
place

What a fool I am I ought simply to have put my arm around her waist and
kissed her

And with this regret the count returned to his room The cornet was not yet
asleep He immediately turned over in bed and looked at the count

Arent you asleep asked the count

No

Shall I tell you what happened

Well

No Id better not tell you Yes I will too Move your legs over a
little

And the count who had already given up vain regret for his unsuccessful
intrigue sat down with a gay smile on his comrades bed Could you
imagine that the young lady of the house gave me a rendezvous

What is that you say screamed Polzof leaping up in bed

Well now listen

But how When It cant be

See here while you were making out your accounts in prfrence she
told me that she would this night be sitting at the window and that it was
possible to get in at that window Now this is what it means to be a
practical man while you were there reckoning up with the old woman I was
arranging this little affair You yourself heard her say right out in your
presence that she was going to sit at the window tonight and look at
the pond

Yes but she said that without any meaning in it

I am not so sure whether she said it purposely or otherwise Maybe she did
not wish to come at it all at once only it looked like that But a
wretched piece of work came out of it Like a perfect fool I spoilt the
whole thing he added scornfully smiling at himself

Well what is it Where have you been

The count told him the whole story with the exception of his irresolute
and repeated advances I spoilt it myself I ought to have been bolder
She screamed and ran away from the window

Then she screamed and ran away repeated the cornet replying with a
constrained smile to the counts smile which had such a long and powerful
influence upon him

Yes but now its time to go to sleep

Polzof again turned his back to the door and lay in silence for ten
minutes God knows what was going on in his soul but when he turned over
again his face was full of passion and resolution

Count Turbin said he in a broken voice

Are you dreaming or not replied the count calmly What is it cornet
Polzof

Count Turbin you are a scoundrel cried Polzof and he sprang from the
bed


XVI

The next day the battalion departed The officers did not see any of the
household or bid them farewell Neither did they speak together

It was understood that they were to fight their duel when they came to the
next haltingplace But Captain Schultz a good comrade an admirable
horseman who was loved by everybody in the regiment and had been chosen
by the count for his second succeeded in arranging the affair in such a
manner that not only they did not fight but that no one in the regiment
knew about the matter and Turbin and Polzof though their old relations
of friendship were never restored still said thou and met at meals and
at the gamingtable




THREE DEATHS

A TALE




I

It was autumn

Along the highway came two equipages at a brisk pace In the first carriage
sat two women One was a lady thin and pale The other her maid with a
brilliant red complexion and plump Her short dry locks escaped from
under a faded cap her red hand in a torn glove put them back with a
jerk Her full bosom incased in a tapestry shawl breathed of health her
restless black eyes now gazed through the window at the fields hurrying by
them now rested on her mistress now peered solicitously into the corners
of the coach

Before the maids face swung the ladys bonnet on the rack on her knees
lay a puppy her feet were raised by packages lying on the floor and could
almost be heard drumming upon them above the noise of the creaking of the
springs and the rattling of the windows

The lady with her hands resting in her lap and her eyes shut feebly
swayed on the cushions which supported her back and slightly frowning
struggled with a cough

She wore a white nightcap and a blue neckerchief twisted around her
delicate pale neck A straight line disappearing under the cap parted her
blonde hair which was smoothly pomaded and there was a dry deathly
appearance about the whiteness of the skin in this simple parting The
withered and rather sallow skin was loosely drawn over her delicate and
pretty features and there was a hectic flush on the cheeks and
cheekbones Her lips were dry and restless her thin eyelashes had lost
their curve and a cloth travelling capote made straight folds over her
sunken chest Although her eyes were closed her face gave the impression
of weariness irascibility and habitual suffering

The lackey leaning back was napping on the coachbox The hired
driver shouting in a clear voice urged on his four powerful and
sweaty horses occasionally looking back at the other driver who was
shouting just behind them in an open barouche The tires of the wheels in
their even and rapid course left wide parallel tracks on the limy mud of
the highway

Footnote  yamshchik

The sky was gray and cold a moist mist was falling over the fields and the
road It was suffocating in the carriage and smelt of eaudecologne and
dust The invalid leaned back her head and slowly opened her eyes Her
great eyes were brilliant and of a beautiful dark color Again said
she nervously pushing away with her beautiful attenuated hand the end of
her maids cloak which occasionally hit against her knee Her mouth
contracted painfully

Matrisha raised her cloak in both hands lifting herself up on her strong
legs and then sat down again farther away Her fresh face was suffused
with a brilliant scarlet

The invalids handsome dark eyes eagerly followed the maids motions and
then with both hands she took hold of the seat and did her best to raise
herself a little higher but her strength was not sufficient

Again her mouth became contracted and her whole face took on an expression
of unavailing angry irony

If you would only help me Ah Its not necessary I can do it myself
Only have the goodness not to put those pillows behind me On the whole
you had better not touch them if you dont understand

The lady closed her eyes and then again quickly raising the lids gazed
at her maid

Matrisha looked at her and gnawed her red lower lip A heavy sigh escaped
from the sick womans breast but the sigh was not ended but was merged in
a fit of coughing She scowled and turned her face away clutching her
chest with both hands When the coughing fit was over she once more shut
her eyes and continued to sit motionless The coach and the barouche
rolled into the village Matrisha drew her fat hand from under her shawl
and made the sign of the cross

What is this demanded the lady

A poststation madame

Why did you cross yourself I should like to know

The church madame

The lady looked out of the window and began slowly to cross herself
gazing with all her eyes at the great village church in front of which the
invalids carriage was now passing

The two vehicles came to a stop together at the posthouse The sick
womans husband and the doctor dismounted from the barouche and came to
the coach

How are you feeling asked the doctor taking her pulse

Well my dear arent you fatigued asked the husband in French
Wouldnt you like to go out

Matrisha gathering up the bundles squeezed herself into the corner so
as not to interfere with the conversation

No matter its all the same thing replied the invalid I will not get
out

The husband after standing there a little while went into the posthouse
Matrisha jumping from the carriage tiptoed across the muddy road into
the enclosure

If I am miserable there is no reason why the rest of you should not have
breakfast said the sick woman smiling faintly to the doctor who was
standing by her window

It makes no difference to them how I am she remarked to herself as the
doctor turning from her with slow step started to run up the steps of the
stationhouse They are well and its all the same to them O my God

How now Eduard Ivnovitch said the husband as he met the doctor and
rubbing his hands with a gay smile I have ordered my travellingcase
brought what do you say to that

Thats worth while replied the doctor

Well now how about her asked the husband with a sigh lowering his
voice and raising his brows

I have told you that she cannot reach Moscow much less Italy especially
in such weather

What is to be done then Oh my God my God

The husband covered his eyes with his hand Give it here he added
addressing his man who came bringing the travellingcase

Youll have to stop somewhere on the route replied the doctor shrugging
his shoulders

But tell me how can that be done rejoined the husband I have done
every thing to keep her from going I have spoken to her of our means and
of our children whom we should have to leave behind and of my business
She would not hear a word She has made her plans for living abroad as
though she were well But if I should tell her what her real condition is
it would kill her

Well she is a dead woman now you may as well know it Vasli Dmtritch
A person cannot live without lungs and there is no way of making lungs
grow again It is melancholy it is hard but what is to be done about it
It is my business and yours to make her last days as easy as possible It
is the confessor that is needed here

Oh my God Now just perceive how I am situated in speaking to her of her
last will Let come whatever may yet I cannot speak of that And yet you
know how good she is

Try at least to persuade her to wait until the roads are frozen said the
doctor shaking his head significantly something might happen during the
journey

                                   

Aksisha oh Aksisha cried the superintendents daughter throwing a
cloak over her head and tiptoeing down the muddy back steps Come along
Let us have a look at the Shirknskaya lady they say shes got
lungtrouble and theyre taking her abroad I never saw how any one looked
in consumption

Aksisha jumped down from the doorsill and the two girls hand in hand
hurried out of the gates Shortening their steps they walked by the coach
and stared in at the lowered window The invalid bent her head toward them
but when she saw their inquisitiveness she frowned and turned away

Oh deear said the superintendents daughter vigorously shaking her
head How wonderfully pretty she used to be and how she has changed
It is terrible Did you see Did you see Aksisha

Yes but how thin she is assented Aksisha Let us go by and look
again well make believe go to the well Did you see she turned away from
us still I got a good view of her Isnt it too bad Masha

Yes but what terrible mud replied Masha and both of them started to
run back within the gates

Its evident that I have become a fright thought the sick woman But
we must hurry hurry and get abroad and there I shall soon get well

Well and how are you my dear inquired the husband coming to the
carriage with still a morsel of something in his mouth

Always one and the same question thought the sick woman and hes even
eating

Its no consequence she murmured between her teeth

Do you know my dear I am afraid that this journey in such weather will
only make you worse Eduard Ivnovitch says the same thing Hadnt we
better turn back

She maintained an angry silence

The weather will improve maybe the roads will become good and that would
be better for you then at least we could start all together

Pardon me If I had not listened to you so long I should at this moment
be at Berlin and have entirely recovered

Whats to be done my angel it was impossible as you know But now if
you would wait a month you would be ever so much better I could finish up
my business and we could take the children with us

The children are well and I am ill

But just see here my love if in this weather you should grow worse on
the road At least we should be at home

What is the use of being at home Die at home replied the invalid
peevishly

But the word die evidently startled her and she turned upon her husband
a supplicating and inquiring look He dropped his eyes and said nothing

The sick womans mouth suddenly contracted in a childish fashion and the
tears sprang to her eyes Her husband covered his face with his
handkerchief and silently turned from the carriage

No I will go cried the invalid and lifting her eyes to the sky she
clasped her hands and began to whisper incoherent words My God why must
it be she said and the tears flowed more violently She prayed long and
fervently but still there was just the same sense of constriction and pain
in her chest just the same gray melancholy in the sky and the fields and
the road just the same autumnal mist neither thicker nor more tenuous
but ever the same in its monotony falling on the muddy highway on the
roofs on the carriage and on the sheepskin coats of the drivers who
were talking in strong gay voices as they were oiling and adjusting the
carriage


II

The coach was ready but the driver loitered He had gone into the drivers
cottage where it was warm close dark and suffocating smelling of
human occupation of cooking bread of cabbage and of sheepskin garments

Footnote  izb

Several drivers were in the room the cook was engaged near the oven on
top of which lay a sick man wrapped up in pelts

Uncle Khvedor hey Uncle Khvedor called a young man the driver in a
tulup and with his knout in his belt coming into the room and addressing
the sick man

What do you want rattlepate What are you calling to Fydka for
demanded one of the drivers Theres your carriage waiting for you

Footnote  Fydka and Fydya are diminutives of Fedor Theodore

I want to borrow his boots Mine are worn out replied the young fellow
tossing back his curls and straightening his mittens in his belt Why is
he asleep Say Uncle Khvedor he insisted going to the oven

What is it a weak voice was heard saying and a blowsy emaciated face
was lifted up from the oven

A broad gaunt hand bloodless and covered with hairs pulled up his
overcoat over the dirty shirt that covered his bony shoulder Give me
something to drink brother what is it you want

The young fellow handed him a small dish of water

I say Fydya said he hesitating I reckon you wont want your new
boots now let me have them Probably you wont need them any more

The sick man dropping his weary head down to the lacquered bowl and
dipping his thin hanging mustache in the brown water drank feebly and
eagerly

His tangled beard was unclean his sunken clouded eyes were with
difficulty raised to the young mans face When he had finished drinking
he tried to raise his hand to wipe his wet lips but his strength failed
him and he wiped them on the sleeve of his overcoat Silently and
breathing with difficulty through his nose he looked straight into the
young mans eyes and tried to collect his strength

Maybe you have promised them to some one else said the young driver If
thats so all right The worst of it is it is wet outside and I have to
go out to my work and so I said to myself I reckon Ill ask Fydka for
his boots I reckon he wont be needing them But maybe you will need
themjust say

Something began to bubble up and rumble in the sick mans chest he bent
over and began to strangle with a cough that rattled in his throat

Now I should like to know where he would need them unexpectedly snapped
out the cook angrily addressing the whole hovel This is the second month
that he has not crept down from the oven Just see how he is all broken up
and you can hear how it must hurt him inside Where would he need boots
They would not think of burying him in new ones And it was time long ago
God pardon me the sin of saying so Just see how he chokes He ought to be
taken from this hovel to another or somewhere They say theres hospitals
in the city but whats you going to do he takes up the whole room and
thats too much There isnt any room at all And yet you are expected to
keep neat

Hey Seryha come along take your place the people are waiting cried
the head man of the station coming to the door

Seryha started to go without waiting for his reply but the sick man
during his cough intimated by his eyes that he was going to speak

You can take the boots Seryha said he conquering the cough and
getting his breath a little Only do you hear buy me a stone when I am
dead he added hoarsely

Thank you uncle then I will take them and as for the
stoneI will buy you one

There children you are witnesses the sick man was able to articulate
and then once more he bent over and began to choke

All right we have heard said one of the drivers But run Seryha or
else the strosta will be after you again You know Lady Shirknskaya is
sick

Seryha quickly pulled off his ragged unwieldy boots and flung them under
the bench Uncle Fedors fitted his feet exactly and the young driver
could not keep his eyes off them as he went to the carriage

Ek what splendid boots Heres some grease called another driver with
the greasepot in his hand as Seryha mounted to his box and gathered up
the reins Get them for nothing

So youre jealous are you cried Seryha lifting up and tucking around
his legs the tails of his overcoat Off with you my darlings he cried
to the horses cracking his knout and the coach and barouche with their
occupants trunks and other belongings were hidden in the thick autumnal
mist and rapidly whirled away over the wet road

The sick driver remained on the oven in the stifling hovel and not being
able to throw off the phlegm by a supreme effort turned over on the
otherside and stopped coughing

Till evening there was a continual coming and going and eating of meals in
the hovel and the sick man was not noticed Before night came on the cook
climbed upon the oven and pulled off the sheepskin from his legs

Dont be angry with me Nastsya murmured the sick man I shall soon
leave you your room

All right all right its of no consequence But what is the matter with
you uncle Tell me

All my innards are gnawed out God knows what it is

And I dont doubt your gullet hurts you when you cough so

It hurts me all over My death is at hand thats what it is Okh Okh
Okh groaned the sick man

Now cover up your legs this way said Nastsya comfortably arranging the
overcoat so that it would cover him and then getting down from the oven

During the night the hovel was faintly lighted by a single taper Nastsya
and a dozen drivers were sleeping snoring loudly on the floor and the
benches Only the sick man feebly choked and coughed and tossed on the
oven

In the morning no sound was heard from him

I saw something wonderful in my sleep said the cook as she stretched
herself in the early twilight the next morning I seemed to see Uncle
Khvedor get down from the oven and go out to cut wood Look here says
he Im going to help you Nsya and I says to him How can you split
wood but he seizes the hatchet and begins to cut so fast so fast that
nothing but chips fly Why says I aint you been sickNo says
he I am well and he kind of lifted up the axe and I was scared and I
screamed and woke up He cant be dead can heUncle Khvedor hey
uncle

Fedor did not move

Now he cant be dead can he Go and see said one of the drivers who had
just waked up The emaciated hand covered with reddish hair that hung
down from the oven was cold and pale

Go tell the superintendent it seems he is dead said the driver

Fedor had no relatives He was a stranger On the next day they buried him
in the new buryingground behind the grove and Nastsya for many days had
to tell everybody of the dream which she had seen and how she had been the
first to discover that Uncle Fedor was dead

Spring had come

Along the wet streets of the city swift streamlets ran purling between bits
of ice bright were the colors of peoples dresses and the tones of their
voices as they hurried along In the walled gardens the buds on the trees
were bourgeoning and the fresh breeze swayed their branches with a soft
gentle murmur Everywhere transparent drops were forming and falling

The sparrows chattered incoherently and fluttered about on their little
wings On the sunny side on the walls houses and trees all was full of
life and brilliancy The sky and the earth and the heart of man
overflowed with youth and joy

In front of a great seignorial mansion in one of the principal streets
fresh straw was laid in the house lay that same invalid whom we saw
hastening abroad

Near the closed doors of the house stood the sick ladys husband and a
lady well along in years On a sofa sat the confessor with castdown eyes
holding something wrapped up under his stole In one corner in a
Voltaire easychair reclined an old lady the sick womans mother weeping
violently

Footnote  Called epitrachilion in the Greek Church

Near her the maid stood holding a clean handkerchief ready for the old
ladys use when she should ask for it Another maid was rubbing the old
ladys temples and blowing on her gray head underneath her cap

Well Christ be with you my dear said the husband to the elderly lady
who was standing with him near the door she has such confidence in you
you know how to talk with her go and speak with her a little while my
darling please go

He was about to open the door for her but his cousin held him back
putting her handkerchief several times to her eyes and shaking her head

There now she will not see that I have been weeping said she and
opening the door herself went to the invalid

The husband was in the greatest excitement and seemed quite beside
himself He started to go over to the old mother but after taking a few
steps he turned around walked the length of the room and approached the
priest

The priest looked at him raised his brows toward heaven and sighed The
thick gray beard also was lifted and fell again

My God my God said the husband

What can you do exclaimed the confessor sighing and again lifting up
his brows and beard and letting them drop

And the old mother there exclaimed the husband almost in despair She
will not be able to endure it You see she loved her so she loved her so
that she I dont know You might try holy father to calm her a
little and persuade her to go away

Footnote  btiushka

The confessor arose and went over to the old lady

It is true no one can appreciate a mothers heart said he but God is
compassionate

The old ladys face was suddenly convulsed and a hysterical sob shook her
frame

God is compassionate repeated the priest when she had grown a little
calmer I will tell you in my parish there was a sick man and much worse
than Mrya Dmtrievna and he though he was only a shopkeeper was
cured in a very short time by means of herbs And this very same
shopkeeper is now in Moscow I have told Vasli Dmtrievitch about him it
might be tried you know At all events it would satisfy the invalid With
God all things are possible

Footnote  meshchnin

No she wont get well persisted the old lady Why should God have
taken her and not me

And again the hysterical sobbing overcame her so violently that she fainted
away

The invalids husband hid his face in his hands and rushed from the room

In the corridor the first person whom he met was a sixyearold boy who
was chasing his little sister with all his might and main

Do you bid me take the children to their mamma inquired the nurse

No she is not able to see them They distract her

The lad stopped for a moment and after looking eagerly into his fathers
face he cut a dido with his leg and with merry shouts ran on Im
playing shes a horse papsha cried the little fellow pointing to his
sister

Meantime in the next room the cousin had taken her seat near the sick
woman and was skilfully bringing the conversation by degrees round so as
to prepare her for the thought of death The doctor stood by the window
mixing some draught

The invalid in a white dressinggown all surrounded by cushions was
sitting up in bed and gazed silently at her cousin

Ah my dear she exclaimed unexpectedly interrupting her dont try to
prepare me dont treat me like a little child I am a Christian woman I
know all about it I know that I have not long to live I know that if my
husband had heeded me sooner I should have been in Italy and possibly
yes probably should have been well by this time They all told him so But
what is to be done its as God saw fit We all of us have sinned I know
that but I hope in the mercy of God that all will be pardoned ought to
be pardoned I am trying to sound my own heart I also have committed many
sins my love But how much I have suffered in atonement I have tried to
bear my sufferings patiently

Then shall I have the confessor come in my love It will be all the
easier for you after you have been absolved said the cousin

The sick woman dropped her head in token of assent O God pardon me a
sinner she whispered

The cousin went out and beckoned to the confessor She is an angel she
said to the husband with tears in her eyes The husband wept The priest
went into the sickroom the old lady still remained unconscious and in
the room beyond all was perfectly quiet At the end of five minutes the
confessor came out and taking off his stole arranged his hair

Thanks be to the Lord she is calmer now said he She wishes to see
you

The cousin and the husband went to the sickroom The invalid gently
weeping was gazing at the images

I congratulate you my love said the husband

Thank you How well I feel now what ineffable joy I experience said the
sick woman and a faint smile played over her thin lips How merciful God
is Is it not so He is merciful and omnipotent And again with an eager
prayer she turned her tearful eyes towards the holy images

Then suddenly something seemed to occur to her mind She beckoned to her
husband

You are never willing to do what I desire said she in a weak and
querulous voice

The husband stretching his neck listened to her submissively

What is it my love

How many times I have told you that these doctors dont know any thing
There are uneducated women doctors they make cures Thats what the good
father said A shopkeeper send for him

For whom my love

Good heavens you can never understand me And the dying woman frowned
and closed her eyes

The doctor came to her and took her hand Her pulse was evidently growing
feebler and feebler He made a sign to the husband The sick woman remarked
this gesture and looked around in fright The cousin turned away to hide
her tears

Dont weep dont torment yourselves on my account said the invalid
That takes away from me my last comfort

You are an angel exclaimed the cousin kissing her hand

No kiss me here They only kiss the hands of those who are dead My God
my God

That same evening the sick woman was a corpse and the corpse in the
coffin lay in the parlor of the great mansion In the immense room the
doors of which were closed sat the clerk and with a monotonous voice
read the Psalms of David through his nose

Footnote  diachk

The bright glare from the wax candles in the lofty silver candelabra fell
on the white brow of the dead on the heavy waxen hands on the stiff folds
of the cerement which brought out into awful relief the knees and the feet

The clerk not varying his tones continued to read on steadily and in the
silence of the chamber of death his words rang out and died away
Occasionally from distant rooms came the voice of children and their
romping

Thou hidest thy face they are troubled thou takest away their breath
they die and return to their dust

Thou sendest forth thy Spirit they are created and thou renewest the
face of the earth

The glory of the Lord shall endure forever the Lord shall rejoice in his
works

The face of the dead was stern and majestic But there was no motion either
on the pure cold brow or the firmly closed lips She was all attention
But did she perhaps now understand these grand words


IV

At the end of a month over the grave of the dead a stone chapel was
erected Over the drivers there was as yet no stone and only the fresh
green grass sprouted over the mound that served as the sole record of the
past existence of a man

It will be a sin and a shame Seryha said the cook at the stationhouse
one day if you dont buy a gravestone for Khvedor You kept saying
Its winter winter but now why dont you keep your word I heard it
all He has already come back once to ask why you dont do it if you dont
buy him one he will come again he will choke you

Well now have I denied it urged Seryha I am going to buy him a
stone as I said I would I can get one for a ruble and a half I have not
forgotten about it Ill have to get it As soon as I happen to be in town
then Ill buy him one

You ought at least to put up a cross thats what you ought to do said
an old driver It isnt right at all Youre wearing those boots now

Yes But where could I get him a cross You wouldnt want to make one out
of an old piece of stick would you

What is that you say Make one out of an old piece of stick No take your
axe go out to the wood a little earlier than usual and you can hew him
out one Take a little ashtree and you can make one You can have a
covered cross If you go then you wont have to give the watchman a little
drink of vodka One doesnt want to give vodka for every trifle Now
yesterday I broke my axletree and I go and hew out a new one of green
wood No one said a word

Early the next morning almost before dawn Seryha took his axe and went
to the wood

Over all things hung a cold dead veil of falling mist as yet untouched by
the rays of the sun

The cast gradually grew brighter reflecting its pale light over the vault
of heaven still covered by light clouds Not a single grassblade below
not a single leaf on the topmost branches of the treetop waved Only from
time to time could be heard the sounds of fluttering wings in the thicket
or a rustling on the ground broke in upon the silence of the forest

Suddenly a strange sound foreign to this nature resounded and died away
at the edge of the forest Again the noise sounded and was monotonously
repeated again and again at the foot of one of the ancient immovable
trees A treetop began to shake in an extraordinary manner the juicy
leaves whispered something and the warbler sitting on one of the
branches flew off a couple of times with a shrill cry and wagging its
tail finally perched on another tree

The axe rang more and more frequently the white chips full of sap were
scattered upon the dewy grass and a slight cracking was heard beneath the
blows

The tree trembled with all its body leaned over and quickly straightened
itself with a fearful shudder on its base

For an instant all was still then once more the tree bent over a crash
was heard in its trunk and tearing the thicket and dragging down the
branches it plunged toward the damp earth

The noise of the axe and of footsteps ceased

The warbler uttered a cry and flew higher The branch which she grazed
with her wings shook for an instant and then came to rest like all the
others with their foliage

The trees more joyously than ever extended their branches over the new
space that had been made in their midst

The first sunbeams breaking through the cloud gleamed in the sky and
shone along the earth and heavens

The mist in billows began to float along the hollows the dew gleaming
played on the green foliage translucent white clouds hurried along their
azure path

The birds hopped about in the thicket and as though beside themselves
voiced their happiness the juicy leaves joyfully and contentedly whispered
on the treetops and the branches of the living trees slowly and
majestically waved over the dead and fallen tree




A PRISONER IN THE CAUCASUS


I

A Russian of rank was serving as an officer in the army of the Caucasus
His name was Zhilin

There came to him one day a letter from his home His aged mother wrote
him I am now getting along in years and before I die I should like to
see my beloved son Come and bid me farewell lay me in the ground and
then with my blessing return again to your service And I have been finding
a bride for you and she is intelligent and handsome and has property If
you like you can marry and settle down together

Zhilin cogitated It is very true the old lady has been growing feeble
maybe I shall not have a chance to see her again Let us go and if the
bride is prettythen I might marry

He went to his colonel got his leave of absence took his farewell of his
comrades gave the soldiers of his command nine gallons of vodka as a
farewell treat and made his arrangements to depart

Footnote  Four vedros equivalent exactly to  gallons

There was war at that time in the Caucasus The roads were not open for
travel either by day or night If any of the Russians rode or walked
outside of the fortress the Tatars were likely either to kill him or
carry him off to the mountains And it was arranged that twice a week an
escort of soldiers should go from fortress to fortress In front and behind
marched the soldiers and the travellers rode in the middle

It was now summertime At sunrise the baggagetrain was made up behind the
fortification the guard of soldiery marched ahead and the procession
moved along the road

Zhilin was on horseback and his effects were on a cart that formed part of
the train

They had twentyfive versts to travel The train marched slowly
sometimes the soldiers halted sometimes a wagonwheel came off or a horse
balked and all had to stop and wait

Footnote  Sixteen and a half miles

The sun was already past the zenith but the train had only gone half way
so great were the dust and heat The sun was baking hot and nowhere was
there shelter A bald steppe not a tree or a shrub on the road

Zhilin rode on ahead occasionally stopping and waiting till the train
caught up with him He would listen and hear the signal on the horn to
halt again And Zhilin thought Would I better go on alone without the
soldiers I have a good horse under me if I fall in with the Tatars I can
escape Or shall I wait

He kept stopping and pondering And just then another officer also on
horseback rode up to him his name was Kostuilin and he had a musket

He said Zhilin let us ride on ahead together I am so hungry that I
cannot stand it any longer and the heat tooyou could wring my shirt
out Kostuilin was a heavy stout ruddy man and the sweat was dripping
from him

Zhilin reflected and said And your musket is loaded

It is

All right let us go Only one condition not to separate

And they started on up the road They rode along the steppe talking and
looking on each side There was a wide sweep of view As soon as the steppe
came to an end the road went into a pass between two mountains

And Zhilin said I must ride up on that mountain and reconnoitre
otherwise you see they might come down from the mountain and surprise us

But Kostuilin said What is there to reconnoitre Let us go ahead

Zhilin did not heed him

No says he you wait for me here below Ill just glance around

And he spurred his horse up the mountain to the left

The horse that Zhilin rode was a hunter he had bought him out of a drove
of colts paying a hundred rubles for him and he had himself trained him
He bore him up the steep slope as on wings He had hardly reached the
summit when before him less than seven hundred feet distant mounted Tatars
were standingthirty men

He saw them and started to turn back but the Tatars had caught sight of
him they set out in pursuit of him unstrapping their weapons as they
gallop Zhilin dashes down the precipice with all the speed of his horse
and cries to Kostuilin Fire your gun and to his horse he says though
not aloud Little mother carry me safely dont stumble if you trip I
am lost If we get back to the gun we wont fall into their hands

But Kostuilin instead of waiting for him as soon as he saw the Tatars
galloped on with all his might toward the fortress With his whip he
belabored his horse first on one side then on the other all that could
be seen through the dust was the horse switching her tail

Zhilin saw that his case was desperate The gun was gone nothing was to be
done with a sabre alone He turned his horse back toward the train he
thought he might escape that way

But in front of him he sees that six are galloping down the steep His
horse is good but theirs are better and besides they have got the start
of him He started to wheel about and was going to dash ahead again but
his horse had got momentum and could not be held back he flew straight
down toward them

He sees a redbearded Tatar approaching him on a gray mare He is gaining
on him he gnashes his teeth he is getting his gun ready

Well thinks Zhilin I know you devils if you should take me prisoner
you would put me in a hole and flog me with a whip I wont give myself up
alive

Now Zhilin was not of great size but he was an uhlan He drew his sabre
spurred his horse straight at the redbearded Tatar He says to himself
Either I will crush him with my horse or I will hack him down with my
sabre

Zhilin however did not reach the place on horseback suddenly behind him
gunshots were fired at the horse The horse fell headlong and pinned
Zhilins leg to the ground

He tried to arise but already illsmelling Tatars were sitting on him and
pinioning his hands behind his back

He burst from them knocking the Tatars over but three others had
dismounted from their horses and began to beat him on the head with their
gunstocks

His sight failed him and he staggered

The Tatars seized him took from their saddles extra saddlegirths bent
his arms behind his back fastened them with a Tatar knot and lifted him
up

They took his sabre from him pulled off his boots made a thorough search
of him pulled out his money and his watch tore his clothes all to pieces

Zhilin glanced at his horse The poor beast lay as he had fallen on his
side and was kicking vainly trying to rise In his head was a hole and
from the hole the black blood was pouring the dust for an arshin around
was wet with it

A Tatar went to the horse to remove the saddle He was still kicking so
the man took out his dagger and cut his throat The throat gave a
whistling sound a trembling ran over the body and all was over

The Tatars took off the saddle and the other trappings The one with the
red beard mounted his horse and the others lifted Zhilin behind him to
keep him from falling they fastened him with the reins to the Tatars
belt and thus they carried him off to the mountains

Zhilin sat behind swaying and bumping his face against the stinking
Tatars back

All that he could see before him was the healthy Tatar back and the sinewy
neck and a smoothshaven nape showing blue beneath the cap

Zhilins head ached the blood trickled into his eyes And it was
impossible for him to get a more comfortable position on the horse or wipe
away the blood His arms were so tightly bound that his collarbones ached
They rode long from mountain to mountain they forded a river then they
entered a highway and rode along a valley Zhilin tried to follow the
route that they took him but his eyes were glued together with blood and
it was impossible for him to turn round

It began to grow dark they crossed still another river and began to climb
a rocky mountain There was an odor of smoke The barking of dogs was
heard

They had reached an aul

Footnote  Aul  Tatars villageAuthors note

The Tatars dismounted The Tatar children came running up and surrounded
Zhilin whistling and exulting Finally they began to fling stones at him

The Tatar drove away the children lifted Zhilin from the horse and called
a servant

A Nog with prominent cheekbones came at the call He wore only a
shirt The shirt was torn his whole breast was bare The Tatar said
something to him The servant brought a footstock It consisted of two
oaken blocks provided with iron rings and in one of the rings was a clamp
with a lock They unfastened Zhilins arms put on the stock and took him
to a barn pushed him in and shut the door

Zhilin fell on the manure As he lay there he felt round in the darkness
and when he had found a place that was less foul he stretched himself out


II

Zhilin scarcely slept that night The nights were short He saw through a
crack that it was growing light Zhilin got up widened the crack and
managed to look out

Through the crack he could see a road leading down from the mountain at
the right a Tatar saklia with two trees near it A black dog was
lying on the road a shegoat with her kids was walking by all of them
shaking their tails

Footnote  A mountainhut in the Caucasus

He saw coming down the mountain a young Tatar girl in a variegated shirt
ungirdled in pantalettes and boots her head was covered with a kaftan
and on it she bore a great tin waterjug

She walked along swaying and bending her back and holding by the hand a
little Tatar urchin with shaven head who wore a single shirt

After the Tatar maiden had passed with her waterjug the redbearded Tatar
of the evening before came out wearing a silk beshmet a silver dagger in
his belt and sandals on his bare feet On his head was a high cap of
sheepskin dyed black and with the point hanging down He came out
stretched himself stroked his red beard He paused gave some order to the
servant and went off somewhere

Then two children on horseback came along on their way to the
wateringtrough The hindquarters of the horses were wet

Other shavenheaded youngsters with nothing but shirts on and nothing on
their legs formed a little band and came to the barn they got a dry
stick and stuck it through the crack

Zhilin growled ukh at them The children began to cry and scatter in
every direction as fast as their legs would carry them only their bare
knees glistened But Zhilin began to be thirsty his throat was parched He
said to himself I wonder if they wont come to look after me

Suddenly the barndoors are thrown open

The red Tatar came in and with him another of slighter stature and of
dark complexion His eyes were bright and black his cheeks ruddy his
little beard well trimmed his face jolly and always enlivened with a grin

The dark mans clothing was still richer a silk beshmet of blue silk
embroidered with gold lace In his belt a great silver dagger handsome
morocco slippers embroidered with silver and over the fine slippers he
wore a larger pair of stout ones His cap was tall of white lambs wool

The red Tatar came in muttered something gave vent to some abusive
language and then stood leaning against the wall fingering his dagger
and scowling under his brows at Zhilin like a wolf

But the dark Tatar nervous and active and always on the go as though he
were made of springs came straight up to Zhilin squatted down on his
heels showed his teeth tapped him on the shoulder began to gabble
something in his own language winked his eyes and clucking his tongue
kept saying A fine Russ a fine Russ

Footnote  Urus in Tatar

Zhilin did not understand him and said Drink give me some water

The dark one grinned

A fine Russ and all the time he kept babbling

Zhilin signified by his hands and lips that they should give him water

The dark one understood grinned put his head out of the door and cried
Dina

A young girl came running ina slender lean creature of thirteen with a
face like the dark mans Evidently she was his daughter

She was dressed in a long blue shirt with wide sleeves and without a belt
On the bottom on the breast and on the cuffs it was relieved with red
trimmings She wore on her legs pantalettes and slippers and over the
slippers another pair with high heels On her neck was a necklace wholly
composed of halfruble pieces Her head was uncovered she had her hair in
a black braid and on the braid was a ribbon and to the ribbon were
attached various ornaments and a silver ruble

Her father gave her some command She ran out and quickly returned
bringing a little tin pitcher After she had handed him the water she also
squatted on her heels in such a way that her knees were higher than her
shoulders

She sits that way and opens her eyes and stares at Zhilin while he
drinks as though he were some wild beast

Zhilin offered to return the pitcher to her She darted away like a wild
goat Even her father laughed

He sent her after something else She took the pitcher ran out and
brought back some unleavened bread on a small round board and again
squatted down and stared without taking her eyes from him

The Tatars went out and again bolted the door

After a while the Nog also comes to Zhilin and says Ada khozyn
ada

But he does not know Russian either Zhilin however perceived that he
wished him to go somewhere

Zhilin hobbled out with his clog it was impossible to walk so he had to
drag one leg The Nog led the way for him

He sees before him a Tatar village of half a score of houses and the
native mosque with its minaret

In front of one house stood three horses saddled Lads held them by the
bridle From this house came the dark Tatar and waved his hand signifying
that Zhilin was to come to him He grinned and kept saying something in
his own tongue and went into the house

Zhilin followed him

The room was decent the walls were smoothly plastered with clay Against
the front wall were placed featherbeds on the sides hung costly rugs on
the rugs were guns pistols and sabres all silvermounted

On one side a little oven was set in on a level with the floor

The floor was of earth clean as a threshingfloor and the whole of the
front portion was covered with felt rugs were distributed over the felt
and on the rugs were down pillows

On the rugs were sitting some Tatars in slippers onlythe dark Tatar the
redbearded one and three guests Behind their backs down cushions were
placed and before them on wooden plates were pancakes of milletflour and
melted butter in a cup and the Tatar beer called buza in a pitcher
They ate with their fingers and all dipped into the butter

The dark man leaped up bade Zhilin sit on one side not on a rug but on
the bare floor going back again to his rug he handed his guests cakes and
buza

The servant showed Zhilin his place he himself took off his shoes placed
them by the door in a row with the slippers of the other guests and took
his seat on the felt as near as possible to his masters and while they eat
he looks at them and his mouth waters

After the Tatars had finished eating a Tatar woman entered dressed in the
same sort of shirt as the girl wore and in pantalettes her head was
covered with a handkerchief She carried out the butter and the cakes and
brought a handsome fingerbowl and a pitcher with a narrow nose

The Tatars finished washing their hands then they folded their arms knelt
down and puffed on all sides and said their prayers They talked in their
own tongue

Then one of the guests a Tatar approached Zhilin and began to speak to
him in Russian Kazi Muhamet made you prisoner said he pointing to the
redbearded Tatar and he has given you to Abdul Murat indicating the
dark one Abdul Murat is now your master

Footnote  khozyn

Zhilin said nothing

Abdul Murat began to talk all the time pointing toward Zhilin and grinned
as he talked soldat Urus korosho Urus

The interpreter went on to say He commands you to write a letter home
and have them send money to ransom you As soon as money is sent he will
set you free

Zhilin pondered a little and then said Does he wish a large ransom

The Tatars took counsel together and then the interpreter said

Three thousand silver rubles

No replied Zhilin I cant pay that

Abdul leaped up began to gesticulate and talk to Zhilin he seemed all the
time to think that Zhilin understood him

The interpreter translated his words He means says he how much will
you give

Zhilin after pondering a little said Five hundred rubles

Then the Tatars all began to talk at once Abdul began to scream at the
redbearded Tatar He grew so excited as he talked that the spittle flew
from his mouth

But the redbearded Tatar only frowned and clucked with his tongue

When all became silent again the interpreter said Five hundred rubles is
not enough to buy you of your master He himself has paid two hundred for
you Kazi Muhamet was in debt to him He took you for the debt Three
thousand rubles it is no use to send less But if you dont write they
will put you in a hole and flog you with a whip

Ekh thinks Zhilin the more cowardly one is the worse it is for
him He leaped to his feet and said

Now you tell him dog that he is that if he thinks he is going to
frighten me then I will not give him a single kopek nor will I write I am
not afraid of you and you will never make me afraid of you you dog The
interpreter translated this and again they all began to talk at once

They gabbled a long time then the dark one got up and came to Zhilin

Urus says he jigit jigit Urus

The word jigit among them signifies a brave young man And he grinned
said something to the interpreter and the interpreter said Give a
thousand rubles Zhilin would not give in I will not pay more than five
hundred But if you kill me you will get nothing at all

The Tatars consulted together sent out the servant and they themselves
looked first at the door then at Zhilin

The servant returned followed by a rather stout man in bare feet and
almost stripped His feet also were in stocks

Zhilin made an exclamation he recognized Kostuilin

And they brought him in and placed him next his comrade the two began to
talk together and the Tatars looked on and listened in silence

Zhilin told how it had gone with him Kostuilin told how his horse had
stood stock still and his gun had missed fire and that this same Abdul
had overtaken him and captured him

Abdul listened pointed to Kostuilin and muttered something The
interpreter translated his words to mean that they now both belonged to the
same master and that the one who paid the ransom first would be freed
first Now says he to Zhilin you lose your temper so easily but your
comrade is calm he has written a letter home they will send five
thousand silver rubles And so he will be well fed and he wont be hurt

And Zhilin said Let my comrade do as he pleases Maybe he is rich But I
am not rich I will do as I have already told you Kill me if you wish but
it would not do you any good and I will not pay you more than five hundred
rubles

They were silent

Suddenly Abdul leaped up brought a little chest took out a pen a sheet
of paper and ink and pushed them into Zhilins hands then tapped him on
the shoulder and said by signs Write He had agreed to take the five
hundred rubles

Wait a moment said Zhilin to the interpreter Tell him that he must
feed us well clothe us and give us good decent footwear and let us stay
together We want to have a good time And lastly that he take off these
clogs

He looked at his Tatar master and smiled The master also smiled and when
he learned what was wanted said

I will give you the very best clothes a cherkeska and boots fit for
a wedding And I will feed you like princes And if you want to live
together why you can live in the barn But it wont do to take away the
clogs you would run away Only at night will I have them taken off Then
he jumped up tapped him on the shoulder You good me good

Footnote  A sort of long Circassian cloak

Zhilin wrote his letter but he put on it the wrong address so that it
might never reach its destination He said to himself I shall run away

They took Zhilin and Kostuilin to the barn strewed cornstalks gave them
water in a pitcher and bread two old cherkeski and some wornout
military boots It was evident that they had been stolen from some dead
soldier When night came they took off their clogs and locked them up in
the barn

Thus Zhilin and his comrade lived a whole month Their master was always on
the grin

You Ivn goodme Abdul good

But he gave them wretched food unleavened bread made of milletflour
cooked in the form of cakes but often not heated through

Kostuilin wrote home again and was anxiously awaiting the arrival of the
money and lost his spirits Whole days at a time he sat in the barn and
counted the days till his money should arrive or else he slept

But Zhilin had no expectation that his letter would reach its destination
and he did not write another

Where he asked himselfwhere would my mother get the money for my
ransom And besides she lived for the most part on what I used to send
her If she made out to raise five hundred rubles she would be in want
till the end of her days If God wills it I may escape

And all the time he kept his eyes open and made plans to elude his
captors

He walked about the aul he amused himself by whistling or else he sat
down and fashioned things either modelling dolls out of clay or plaiting
baskets of osiers for Zhilin was a master at all sorts of handiwork

One time he had made a doll with nose and hands and feet and dressed in a
Tatar shirt and he set the doll on the roof The Tatar women were going
for water Dina the masters daughter caught sight of the doll She
called the Tatar girls They set down their jugs and looked and laughed

Zhilin took the doll and offered it to them They keep laughing but dont
dare to take it

He left the doll went to the barn and watched what would take place

Dina ran up to the doll looked around seized the doll and fled

The next morning at dawn he sees Dina come out on the doorstep with the
doll And she has already dressed it up in red rags and was rocking it
like a little child and singing a lullaby in her own language

An old woman came out gave her a scolding snatched the doll away broke
it in pieces and sent Dina to her work

Zhilin made another doll a still better one and gave it to Dina

One time Dina brought a little jug put it down took a seat and looked at
him Then she laughed and pointed to the jug

What is she so gay about thinks Zhilin

He took the jug and began to drink He supposed that it was water but it
was milk

He drank up the milk

Good says he How delighted Dina was Good Ivn good

And she jumped up clapped her hands snatched the jug and ran away And
from that time she began to bring him secretly fresh milk every day

Now sometimes the Tatars would make cheesecakes out of goats milk and
dry them on their roofs Then she used to carry some of these cakes
secretly to him And another time when her father had killed a sheep she
brought him a piece of mutton in her sleeve She threw it down and ran
away

One time there was a tremendous shower and for a whole hour the rain
poured as from buckets and all the brooks grew roily Wherever there had
been a ford the depth of the water increased to seven feet and bowlders
were rolled along by it Everywhere torrents were rushing the mountains
were full of the roaring

Now when the shower was over streams were pouring all through the
village Zhilin asked his master for a knife whittled out a cylinder and
some paddles and made a waterwheel and fastened manikins at the two
ends

The little girls brought him some rags and he dressed up the manikins one
like a man the other like a woman He fastened them on and put the wheel
in a brook The wheel revolved and the dolls danced

The whole village collected the little boys and the little girls the
women and even the Tatars came and clucked with their tongues A
Urus a Ivn

Abdul had a Russian watch which had been broken He took it and showed it
to Zhilin and clucked with his tongue Zhilin said

Let me have it I will fix it

He took it opened the penknife took it apart Then he put it together
again and gave it back The watch ran

The Tatar was delighted brought him his old beshmet which was all in rags
and gave it to him Nothing else to be donehe took it and used it as a
covering at night

From that time Zhilins fame went abroad that he was a master Even
from distant villages they came to him One brought him a gunlock or a
pistol to repair another a watch

His master furnished him with toolsa pair of pincers and gimlets and a
little file

One time a Tatar fell ill they came to Zhilin Come cure him

Zhilin knew nothing of medicine He went looked at the sick man said to
himself Perhaps he will get well anyway He went into the barn took
water and sand and shook them up together He whispered a few words to the
water in presence of the Tatars and gave it to the sick man to drink

Fortunately for him the Tatar got well

Zhilin had by this time learned something of their language And some of
the Tatars became accustomed to him when they wanted him they called him
by name Ivn Ivn but others always looked at him as though he was a
wild beast

The redbearded Tatar did not like Zhilin when he saw him he scowled and
turned away or else insulted him

There was another old man among them he did not live in the aul but came
down from the mountain Zhilin never saw him except when he came to the
mosque to prayer He was of small stature on his cap he wore a white
handkerchief as an ornament His beard and mustaches were trimmed they
were white as wool and his face was wrinkled and brickred His nose was
hooked like a hawks and his eyes were gray and cruel and he had no teeth
except two tusks

He used to come in his turban leaning on his staff and glare like a
wolf whenever he saw Zhilin he would snort and turn his back

One time Zhilin went to the mountain to see where the old man lived He
descended a narrow path and sees a little stonewalled garden On the
other side of the wall are cherrytrees peachtrees and a little hut with
a flat roof

He went nearer he sees beehives made of straw and bees flying and
humming around them And the old man is on his knees before the hives
hammering something

Zhilin raised himself up so as to get a better view and his clog made a
noise

The old man looked upsquealed he pulled his pistol from his belt and
fired at Zhilin who had barely time to hide behind the wall

The old man came to make his complaint to Zhilins master Abdul called him
in grinned and asked him

Why did you go to the old mans

I didnt do him any harm I wanted to see how he lived

Abdul explained it to the old man but he was angry hissed mumbled
something showed his tusks and threatened Zhilin with his hands

Zhilin did not understand it all but he made out that the old man wished
Abdul to kill the two Russians and not have them in the aul

The old man went off

Zhilin began to ask his master Who is that old man And the master
replied

He is a great man He used to be our first jigit he has killed many
Russians He used to be rich He had three wives and eight sons All lived
in one village The Russians came destroyed his village and killed seven
of his sons One son was left and surrendered to the Russians The old man
went and gave himself up to the Russians also He lived among them three
months found his son killed him with his own hand and escaped Since
that time he has stopped fighting He went to Mecca to pray to God and
thats why he wears a turban Whoever has been to Mecca is called a
hadji and wears a chalma But he does not love you Russians He has
bade me kill you but I dont intend to kill you I have paid out money for
you and besides Ivn I have come to like you And so far from wishing to
kill you I would rather not let you go from me at all if I had not given
my word

He laughed and began to repeat in Russian Tvoy Ivn khorsh moy
Abdul khorsh


IV

Thus Zhilin lived a month In the daytime he walked about the aul or did
some handiwork but when night came and it grew quiet in the aul he
burrowed in his barn It was hard work digging because of the stones and
he sometimes had to use his file on them and thus he dug a hole under the
wall big enough to crawl through

Only he thought I must know the region a little first so as to escape
in the right direction And the Tatars wouldnt tell me any thing

He waited till one time when his master was absent then he went after
dinner behind the aul to a mountain His idea was to reconnoitre the
country

But when Abdul returned he commanded a small boy to follow Zhilin and not
take his eyes from him The little fellow tagged after Zhilin and kept
crying

Dont go there Father wont allow it I will call the men if you go

Zhilin began to reason with him I am not going far says heonly to
that hill I must get some herbs Come with me I cant run away with this
clog Tomorrow I will make you a bow and arrows

He persuaded the lad they went together To look at the mountain is not
far but it was hard work with the clog he went a little distance at a
time pulling himself up by main strength

Zhilin sat down on the summit and began to survey the ground

To the south behind the barn lay a valley through which a herd was grazing
and another aul was in sight at the foot of it Back of the village was
another hill still steeper and back of that still another Between the
mountains lay a further stretch of forest and then still other mountains
constantly rising higher and higher And higher than all stood snowcapped
peaks white as sugar and one snowy peak rose like a dome above them all

To the east and west also were mountains In every direction the smoke of
auls was to be seen in the ravines

Well he said to himself this is all their country

He began to look in the direction of the Russian possessions At his very
feet was a little river his village surrounded by gardens By the river
some women no larger in appearance than little dolls were standing and
washing Behind the aul was a lower mountain and beyond it two other
mountains covered with forests And between the two mountains a plain
stretched far far away in the blue distance and on the plain lay what
seemed like smoke

Zhilin tried to remember in what direction when he lived at home in the
fortress the sun used to rise and where it set He looked Just about
there says he in that valley our fortress ought to be There between
those two mountains I must make my escape

The little sun began to slope toward the west The snowy mountains changed
from white to purple the wooded mountains grew dark a mist arose from
the valley and the valley itself where the Russian fortress must be
glowed in the sunset as though it were on fire Zhilin strained his gaze
Something seemed to hang waving in the air like smoke arising from
chimneys

And so it seemed to him that it must be from the fortress itselfthe
Russian fortress

It was already growing late The voice of the mulla calling to prayer was
heard The herds began to return the kine were lowing The little lad kept
repeating Let us go but Zhilin could not tear himself away

They returned home

Well thinks Zhilin now I know the place I must make my escape

He proposed to make his escape that very night The nights were dark it
was the wane of the moon

Unfortunately the Tatars returned in the evening Usually they came in
driving the cattle with them and came in hilarious But this time they had
no cattle but they brought a Tatar dead on his saddle It was Kazi
Muhamets brother They rode in solemnly and collected for the burial

Zhilin also went out to look

They did not put the dead body in a coffin but wrapped it in linen and
placed it under a planetree in the village where it lay on the sward

The mulla came the old men gathered together their caps bound around with
handkerchiefs They took off their shoes and sat in rows on their heels
before the dead

In front was the mulla behind him three old men in turbans and behind
them the rest of the Tatars The mulla lifted the dead mans head and
said Allah That means God He said this one word and let the head
fall back All were silent they sat motionless

Again the mulla lifted the head saying Allah and all repeated it after
him

Allah

Then silence again

The dead man lay on the sward he was motionless and they sat as though
they were dead Not one made a motion The only sound was the rustling of
the foliage of the planetree stirred by the breeze

Then the mulla offered a prayer All got to their feet they took the dead
body in their arms and carried it away

They brought it to a pit The pit was not a mere hole but was hollowed out
under the earth like a cellar

They took the body under the armpits and by the legs doubled it up and
let it down gently shoved it forcibly under the ground and laid the arms
along the belly The Nog brought a green osier They laid it in the pit
then they quickly filled it up with earth and over the dead mans head
they placed a gravestone They smoothed the earth over and again sat
around the grave in rows There was a long silence

Allah Allah Allah

They sighed and got up The redbearded Tatar gave money to the old men
then he got up struck his forehead three times with a whip and went home

The next morning Zhilin sees the redhaired Tatar leading a mare through
the village and three Tatars following him They went behind the village
Kazi Muhamet took off his beshmet rolled up his sleeveshis hands were
powerfultook out his dagger and sharpened it on a whetstone The Tatars
held back the mares head Kazi Muhamet approached and cut the throat
then he turned the animal over and began to flay it pulling away the hide
with his mighty fists

The women and maidens came and began to wash the intestines and the
lights Then they cut up the mare and carried the meat to the hut And the
whole village collected at the Kazi Muhamets to celebrate the dead

For three days they feasted on the mare and drank buza Thus they
celebrated the dead All the Tatars were at home

On the fourth day about noon Zhilin sees that they are collecting for some
expedition Their horses are brought out They put on their gear and
started off ten men of them under the command of the Kazi Muhamet only
Abdul staid at home There was a new moon but the nights were still dark

Now thinks Zhilin today we must escape And he tells Kostuilin

But Kostuilin was afraid How can we escape We dont know the way

I know the way

But we should not get there during the night

Well if we dont get there we will spend the night in the woods I have
some cakes What are you going to do It will be all right if they send you
the money but you see your friends may not collect so much And the
Tatars are now angry because the Russians have killed one of their men
They say they are thinking of killing us

Kostuilin thought and thought All right let us go


V

Zhilin crept down into his hole and widened it so that Kostuilin also
could get through and then they sat and waited till all should be quiet in
the aul

As soon as the people were quiet in the aul Zhilin crept under the wall
and came out on the other side He whispers to Kostuilin Crawl under

Kostuilin also crept under but in doing so he hit a stone with his leg
and it made a noise

Now the master had a brindled dog as a watcha most ferocious animal
they called him Ulyashin

Zhilin had been in the habit of feeding him Ulyashin heard the noise and
began to bark and jump about and the other dogs joined in

Zhilin gave a little whistle threw him a piece of cake Ulyashin
recognized him began to wag his tail and ceased barking

Abdul had heard the disturbance and cried from within the hut

Ht ht Ulyashin

But Zhilin scratched the dog behind the ears The dog makes no more sound
rubs against his legs and wags his tail

They wait behind the corner

All became silent again the only sound was the bleating of a sheep in the
fold and far below them the water roaring over the pebbles

It is dark but the sky is studded with stars Over the mountain the young
moon hung red with its horns turned upward

In the valleys a mist was rising white as milk Zhilin started up and
said to his comrade in Tatar Well brother ada

They set out again

But as they get under way they hear the call of the mulla on the
minaret

Allah Bism Allah el Rakhman

That means the people will be going to the mosque

Again they sat down and hid under the wall

They sat there long waiting until the people should pass Again it grew
still

Now for our fate

They crossed themselves and started

They went across the dvor and down the steep bank to the stream crossed
the stream proceeded along the valley The mist was thick and closed in
all around them but above their heads the stars could still be seen

Zhilin used the stars to guide him which way to go It was cool in the
mist it was easy walking only their boots were troublesomethey were
worn at the heels Zhilin took his off threw them away and walked
barefoot He sprang from stone to stone and kept glancing at the stars

Kostuilin began to grow weary Go slower says he my boots chafe me my
whole foot is raw

Then take them off it will be easier

Kostuilin began to go barefoot but that was still worse he kept scraping
his feet on the stones and having to stop

Zhilin said to him You may cut your feet but you will save your life
but if you are caught they will kill you which would be worse

Kostuilin said nothing but crept along groaning For a long time they
went down the valley Suddenly they hear dogs barking at the right Zhilin
halted looked around climbed up the bank and felt about with his hands

Ekh says he we have made a mistake we have gone too far to the
right Here is one of the enemys villages I could see it from the hill
We must go back to the left up the mountain There must be a forest
there

But Kostuilin objected Just wait a little while let us get breath My
feet are all blood

Eh brother they will get well You should walk more lightly This way

And Zhilin turned back toward the left and up hill toward the forest

Kostuilin kept halting and groaning Zhilin tried to hush him up and still
hastened on

They climbed the mountain And there they found the forest They entered
it their clothes were all torn to pieces on the thorns They found a
little path through the woods They walked along it

Halt

There was the sound of hoofs on the path They stopped to listen It
sounded like the tramping of a horse then it also stopped They set out
once more again the tramping hoofs When they stopped it stopped

Zhilin crept ahead and investigated a light spot on the path

Something is standing there It may be a horse or it may not but on it
there is something strange not at all like a man

It snortedplainly What a strange thing

Zhilin gave a slight whistle There was a dash of feet from the path into
the forest a crackling in the underbrush and something rushed along like
a hurricane with a crashing of dry boughs

Kostuilin almost fell to the ground in fright But Zhilin laughed and
said

That was a stag Do you hear how it crashes through the woods with its
horns We frightened him and he frightened us

They went on their way Already the Great Bear was beginning to set the
dawn was not distant And they were in doubt whether they should come out
right or not Zhilin was inclined to think that they were on the right
track and that it would be about ten versts farther before they reached
the Russian fortress but there is no certain guide you could not tell in
the night

They came to a little clearing Kostuilin sat down and said

Do as you please but I will not go any farther my legs wont carry me

Zhilin tried to persuade him

No says he I wont go I cant go

Zhilin grew angry he threatens him he scolds him

Then I will go on without you Goodby

Kostuilin jumped up and followed They went four versts farther The fog
began to grow thicker in the forest Nothing could be seen before them the
stars were barely visible

Suddenly they hear the tramping of a horse just in front of them they can
hear his shoes striking on the stones

Zhilin threw himself down on his belly and tried to listen by laying his
ear to the ground

Yes it isit is some one on horseback coming in our direction

They slipped off to one side of the road crouched down in the bushes and
waited Zhilin crept close to the path and looked

He sees a mounted Tatar riding along driving a cow The man is muttering
to himself When the Tatar had ridden by Zhilin returned to Kostuilin

Well God has saved us Up with you Come along

Kostuilin tried to rise and fell back

I cant by God I cant My strength is all gone

The man was as though he were drunk He was all of a sweat and as they
were surrounded by the cold fog and his feet were torn he was quite used
up Zhilin tried to lift him by main force Then Kostuilin cried A it
hurt

Zhilin was frightened to death

What are you screaming for Dont you know that Tatar is near He will
hear you But he said to himself Now he is really played out what can I
do with him I cant abandon a comrade Now says he get up climb on my
back I will carry you if you cant walk any longer He took Kostuilin on
his shoulders holding him by the thighs and went along the path with his
burden Only says he dont put your hands on my throat for Christs
sake Lean on my shoulders

It was hard for Zhilin His feet were also bloody and he was weary He
stopped and made it a little easier for himself by setting Kostuilin down
and getting him better mounted Then he went on again

Evidently the Tatar had heard them when Kostuilin screamed Zhilin caught
the sound of some one following them and shouting in his language Zhilin
put into the bushes The Tatar aimed his gun he fired it off but missed
began to whine in his native tongue and galloped up the path

Well says Zhilin we are lost brother The doghe will be right back
with a band of Tatars on our track If we dont succeed in putting three
versts between us we are lost And he thinks to himself The devil take
it that I had to bring this clod along with me Alone I should have got
there long ago

Kostuilin said Go alone Why should you be lost on my account

No I will not go it would not do to abandon a comrade He lifted him
again on his shoulder and started on Thus he made a verst It was forest
all the way and no sign of outlet But the fog was now beginning to lift
and seemed to be floating away in little clouds not a star could be seen
Zhilin was tired out

A little spring gushed out by the road it was walled in with stones There
he stopped and dropped Kostuilin

Let me rest a little says he and get a drink We will eat our cakes
It cant be very far now

He had just stretched himself out to drink when the sound of hoofs was
heard behind them Again they hid in the bushes at the right under the
crest and crouched down

They heard Tatar voices The Tatars stopped at the very spot where they had
turned in from the road After discussing a while they seemed to be
setting dogs on the scent

The refugees hear the sound of a crashing through the bushes a strange dog
comes directly to them He stops and barks

The Tatars followed on their track They are also strangers

They seized them bound them lifted them on horses and carried them off

After they had ridden three versts Abdul with two Tatars met them He
said something to their new captors They were transferred to Abduls
horses and were brought back to the aul

Abdul was no longer grinning and he said not a word to them

They reached the village at daybreak the prisoners were left in the
street The children gathered around them tormenting them with stones and
whips and howling

The Tatars gathered around them in a circle and the old man from the
mountain was among them They began to discuss Zhilin made out that they
were deciding on what should be done with them Some said that they ought
to be sent farther into the mountains but the old man declared that they
must be killed Abdul argued against it Says he I have paid out money
for them I shall get a ransom for them

But the old man said They wont pay any thing it will only be an injury
to us And it is a sin to keep Russians alive Kill them and that is the
end of it

They separated Abdul came to Zhilin and reported the decision

If says he the ransom is not sent in two weeks you will be flogged
And if you try to run away again I will kill you like a dog Write your
letter and write it good

Paper was brought them they wrote their letters Clogs were put on their
feet again they were taken behind the mosque There was a pit twelve
feet deep and they were thrust down into this pit

Footnote  Five arshins  feet


VI

Life was made utterly wretched for them Their clogs were not taken off
even at night and they were not let out at all

Unbaked dough was thrown down to them as though they were dogs and water
was let down in a jug In the pit it was damp and suffocating

Kostuilin became ill and swelled up and had rheumatism all over his body
and he groaned or slept all the time

Even Zhilin lost his spirits he sees that they are in desperate straits
And he does not know how to get out

He had begun to make an excavation but there was nowhere to hide the
earth Abdul discovered it and threatened to kill him

He was squatting down one time in the pit and thinking about life and
liberty and he grew sad

Suddenly a cake fell directly into his lap then another and some
cherries followed He looked up and there was Dina She peered down at
him laughed and then ran away And Zhilin began to conjecture Couldnt
Dina help me

Footnote  lepyshka

He cleared out a little place in the pit picked up some clay and made
some dolls He made men and women horses and dogs he said to himself
When Dina comes I will give them to her

But Dina did not make her appearance on the next day And Zhilin hears the
trampling of horses hoofs men came riding up the Tatars collected at the
mosque arguing shouting and talking about the Russians

The voice of the old man was heard Zhilin could not understand very well
but he made out that the Russians were somewhere near and the Tatars were
afraid that they would attack the aul and they did not know what to do
with the prisoners

They talked a while and went away Suddenly Zhilin heard a rustling at the
edge of the pit

He sees Dina squatting on her heels with her knees higher than her head
she leaned over her necklace hung down and swung over the pit And her
little eyes twinkled like stars She took from her sleeve two cheesecakes
and threw them down to him Zhilin accepted them and said Why did you
stay away so long I have been making you some dolls Here they are He
began to toss them up to her one at a time

But she shook her head and would not look at them I cant take them
said she She said nothing more for a time but sat there then she said
Ivn they want to kill you

She made a significant motion across her throat

Who wants to kill me

Father The old man has ordered him to But I am sorry for you

And Zhilin said Well then if you are sorry for me bring me a long
stick She shook her head meaning that it was impossible

He clasped his hands in supplication to her Dina please Bring one to
me Dnushka

I cant said she They would see me they are all at home And she ran
away

Afterwards Zhilin was sitting there in the evening and wondering what he
should do He kept raising his eyes He could see the stars but the moon
was not yet up The mulla uttered his call then all became silent

Zhilin began already to doze thinking to himself The little maid is
afraid

Suddenly a piece of clay fell on his head he glanced up a long pole was
sliding over the edge of the pit it slid out began to descend toward him
it reached the bottom of the pit Zhilin was delighted He seized it
pulled it alongit was a strong pole He had noticed it before on Abduls
roof

He gazed up the stars were shining high in the heavens and Dinas eyes
at the edge of the pit gleamed in the darkness like a cats

She craned her head over and whispered Ivn Ivn And she waved her
hands before her face meaning Softly please

What is it said Zhilin

All have gone there are only two at home

And Zhilin said Well Kostuilin let us go let us make our last attempt
I will help you

Kostuilin however would not hear to it

No says he it is not meant for me to get away from here How could I
go when I havent even strength to turn over

All right then Goodby Dont think me unkind

Footnote  proshcha

He kissed Kostuilin

He clasped the pole told Dina to hold it firmly and tried to climb up
Twice he fell backhis clog so impeded him Kostuilin boosted him he
managed to get to the top Dina pulled on the sleeves of his shirt with all
her might laughing heartily

Zhilin pulled up the pole and said Carry it back to its place Dina for
if they found it they would flog you

She dragged off the pole and Zhilin began to go down the mountain When he
had reached the bottom of the cliff he took a sharp stone and tried to
break the padlock of his clog But the lock was strong he could not strike
it fairly

He hears some one hurrying down the hill with light skipping steps He
thinks That is probably Dina again

Dina ran to him took a stone and says Let me try it

She knelt down and began to work with all her might But her hands were as
delicate as osiers She had no strength She threw down the stone and
burst into tears

Zhilin again tried to break the lock and Dina squatted by his side and
leaned against his shoulder Zhilin glanced up and saw at the left behind
the mountain a red glow like a fire it was the moon just rising

Well he says to himself I must cross the valley and get into the woods
before the moon rises He stood up and threw away the stone No matter
for the cloghe must take it with him

Goodby says he Dnushka I shall always remember you

Dina clung to him reached with her hands for a place to stow away some
cakes He took the cakes

Thank you said he you are a thoughtful darling Who will make you
dolls after I am gone and he stroked her hair

Dina burst into tears hid her face in her hands and scrambled up the
hillside like a kid He could hear in the darkness the jingling of the
coins on her braids

Zhilin crossed himself picked up the lock of his clog so that it might not
make a noise and started on his way dragging his leg all the time and
keeping his eyes constantly on the glow where the moon was rising

He knew the way He had eight versts to go in a direct course but he would
have to strike into the forest before the moon came entirely up He crossed
the stream and now the light was increasing behind the mountain

He proceeded along the valley it was growing light He walks along
constantly glancing around but still the moon was not visible The glow
was now changing to white light and one side of the valley grew brighter
and brighter The shadow crept away from the mountain till it reached its
very foot

Zhilin still hurried along all the time keeping to the shadow

He hurries as fast as he can but the moon rises still faster and now at
the right the mountaintops are illuminated

He struck into the forest just as the moon rose above the mountains It
became as light and white as day On the trees all the leaves were visible
It was warm and bright on the mountainside every thing seemed as though
it were dead The only sound was the roaring of a torrent far below He
walked along in the forest he had met no one Zhilin found a little spot
in the forest where it was still darker and began to rest

While he rested he ate one of his cakes He procured a stone and once more
tried to break the padlock but he only bruised his hands and failed to
break the lock

He arose and went on his way When he had gone a verst his strength gave
out his feet were sore He had to walk ten steps at a time and then rest

Theres nothing to be done for it says he to himself I will push on as
long as my strength holds out for if I sit down then I shall not get up
again If I do not reach the fortress before it is daylight then I will
lie down in the woods and spend the day and start on tomorrow night
again

He walked all night Once he passed two Tatars on horseback but he heard
them at some distance and hid behind a tree

Already the moon was beginning to pale the dew had fallen it was near
dawn and Zhilin had not reached the end of the forest

Well says he to himself I will go thirty steps farther strike into
the forest and sit down

He went thirty steps and sees the end of the forest He went to the edge
it was broad daylight Before him as on the palm of his hand were the
steppe and the fortress and on the left not far away on the
mountainside fires were burning or dying out the smoke rose and men
were moving around the watchfires

He looks and sees the gleaming of firearms Cossacks soldiers

Zhilin was overjoyed

He gathered his remaining strength and walked down the mountain And he
says to himself God help me if a mounted Tatar should get sight of me on
this bare field I should not escape him even though I am so near Even
while these thoughts are passing through his mind he sees at the left on
a hillock not fourteen hundred feet away three Tatars on the watch They
caught sight of himbore down upon him Then his heart failed within him
Waving his arms he shouted at the top of his voice Brothers help
brothers

Our men heard himmounted Cossacks dashed out toward him The Cossacks
were far off the Tatars near And now Zhilin collected his last remaining
energies seized his clog with his hand ran toward the Cossacks and
without any consciousness of feeling crossed himself and cried Brothers
brothers brothers

The Cossacks were fifteen in number

The Tatars were dismayed Before they reached him they stopped short And
Zhilin reached the Cossacks

The Cossacks surrounded him and questioned him Who are you What is
your name Where did you come from

But Zhilin was almost beside himself he wept and kept on shouting
Brothers brothers

The soldiers hastened up and gathered around him one brought him bread
another kashagruel another vodka another threw a cloak around him still
another broke his chains

The officers recognized him they brought him into the fortress The
soldiers were delighted his comrades pressed into Zhilins room

Zhilin told them what had happened to him and he ended his tale with the
words

Thats the way I went home and got married No I see that such is not to
be my fate

And he remained in the service in the Caucasus

At the end of a month Kostuilin was ransomed for five thousand rubles

He was brought home scarcely alive

     No living author surpasses him and only one or two
     approach him in the power of picturing not merely places
     but persons with minute and fairly startling
     fidelityCongregationalist

     Both the personal character and the literary art of Tolstoi
     are manifested with simpler and clearer power in these
     writings than in his novels and the book becomes necessary
     to an adequate understanding of Tolstois mission and
     workGlobe


     CHILDHOOD BOYHOOD YOUTH With Portrait of the Author

     A series of reminiscences and traditions of the authors

     An autobiographical account of the changes in the authors
     religious opinions and the various causes by which it was
     brought about all of which is told in the most delightful
     manner and will enable the reader to understand more
     clearly his My Religion which is the sequel to this
     volume

     Like the writings of Bunyan and Thomas  Kempis Tolstois

Count Tolstos Greatest Work of Fiction

ANNA KARNINA

Translated from the Russian by NATHAN HASKELL DOLE

Royal mo  pp 


     As you read on you say not This is like life but
     This is life It has not only the complexion the very
     hue of life but its movement its advances its strange
     pauses its seeming reversions to former conditions and its
     perpetual change its apparent isolations its essential
     solidarity It is a world and you live in it while you
     read and long afterward but at no step have you been
     betrayed not because your guide has warned or exhorted you
     but because he has been true and has shown you all things
     as they areW D Howells in Harpers Monthly

     The power of this book lies in the authors supreme control
     of the influences which affect human action in his vivid
     apprehension of the operation of inexorable law in his
     intuitive knowledge of the action and reaction of spiritual
     conditions With a noble art he throws against the shadow
     that deepens ever to the end a radiant soul development
     that serenely grows brighter till we know it is Tolsto
     himself his experience his best It is a great book and
     of such creations the most sincere admiration falls sadly
     short of fitting expressionWashington Post

     The effect of the whole is stimulating and elevating The
     book is certainly one of decided geniusNew York

     incurring the suspicion of extravaganceNew York

     It is not undue praise to say that since the publication

Section   Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment  Many small donations
 to  are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all  states of the United
States  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States  US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section   General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone  For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included  Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
