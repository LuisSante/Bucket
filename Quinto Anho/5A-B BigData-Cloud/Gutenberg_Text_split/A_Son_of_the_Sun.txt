Chapter OneA SON OF THE SUN




I

The WilliWaw lay in the passage between the shorereef and the
outerreef From the latter came the low murmur of a lazy surf but the
sheltered stretch of water not more than a hundred yards across to the
white beach of pounded coral sand was of glasslike smoothness Narrow
as was the passage and anchored as she was in the shoalest place that
gave room to swing the WilliWaws chain rode upanddown a clean
hundred feet Its course could be traced over the bottom of living
coral Like some monstrous snake the rusty chains slack wandered
over the ocean floor crossing and recrossing itself several times and
fetching up finally at the idle anchor Big rockcod dun and mottled
played warily in and out of the coral Other fish grotesque of form and
colour were brazenly indifferent even when a big fishshark drifted
sluggishly along and sent the rockcod scuttling for their favourite
crevices

On deck forard a dozen blacks pottered clumsily at scraping the teak
rail They were as inexpert at their work as so many monkeys In fact
they looked very much like monkeys of some enlarged and prehistoric
type Their eyes had in them the querulous plaintiveness of the monkey
their faces were even less symmetrical than the monkeys and hairless
of body they were far more ungarmented than any monkey for clothes
they had none Decorated they were as no monkey ever was In holes in
their ears they carried short clay pipes rings of turtle shell huge
plugs of wood rusty wire nails and empty rifle cartridges The calibre
of a Winchester rifle was the smallest hole an ear bore some of the
largest holes were inches in diameter and any single ear averaged from
three to half a dozen holes Spikes and bodkins of polished bone or
petrified shell were thrust through their noses On the chest of one
hung a white doorknob on the chest of another the handle of a china
cup on the chest of a third the brass cogwheel of an alarm clock They
chattered in queer falsetto voices and combined did no more work
than a single white sailor

Aft under an awning were two white men Each was clad in a sixpenny
undershirt and wrapped about the loins with a strip of cloth Belted
about the middle of each was a revolver and tobacco pouch The sweat
stood out on their skin in myriads of globules Here and there the
globules coalesced in tiny streams that dripped to the heated deck and
almost immediately evaporated The lean darkeyed man wiped his fingers
wet with a stinging stream from his forehead and flung it from him with
a weary curse Wearily and without hope he gazed seaward across the
outerreef and at the tops of the palms along the beach

Eight oclock an hell dont get hot till noon he complained Wisht
to God for a breeze Aint we never goin to get away

The other man a slender German of five and twenty with the massive
forehead of a scholar and the tumblehome chin of a degenerate did not
trouble to reply He was busy emptying powdered quinine into a cigarette
paper Rolling what was approximately fifty grains of the drug into a
tight wad he tossed it into his mouth and gulped it down without the
aid of water

Wisht I had some whiskey the first man panted after a fifteenminute
interval of silence

Another equal period elapsed ere the German enounced relevant of
nothing

Im rotten with fever Im going to quit you Griffiths when we get to
Sydney No more tropics for me I ought to known better when I signed on
with you

You aint been much of a mate Griffiths replied too hot himself to
speak heatedly When the beach at Guvutu heard Id shipped you they
all laughed What Jacobsen they said You cant hide a square
face of trade gin or sulphuric acid that he wont smell out Youve
certainly lived up to your reputation I aint had a drink for a
fortnight what of your snoopin my supply

If the fever was as rotten in you as me youd understand the mate
whimpered

I aint kickin Griffiths answered I only wisht Godd send me a
drink or a breeze of wind or something Im ripe for my next chill
tomorrow

The mate proffered him the quinine Rolling a fiftygrain dose he
popped the wad into his mouth and swallowed it dry

God God he moaned I dream of a land somewheres where they aint no
quinine Damned stuff of hell Ive scoffed tons of it in my time

Again he quested seaward for signs of wind The usual tradewind clouds
were absent and the sun still low in its climb to meridian turned all
the sky to heated brass One seemed to see as well as feel this heat
and Griffiths sought vain relief by gazing shoreward The white beach
was a searing ache to his eyeballs The palm trees absolutely still
outlined flatly against the unrefreshing green of the packed jungle
seemed so much cardboard scenery The little black boys playing
naked in the dazzle of sand and sun were an affront and a hurt to the
sunsick man He felt a sort of relief when one running tripped and
fell on allfours in the tepid seawater

An exclamation from the blacks forard sent both men glancing seaward
Around the near point of land a quarter of a mile away and skirting the
reef a long black canoe paddled into sight

Gooma boys from the next bight was the mates verdict

One of the blacks came aft treading the hot deck with the unconcern of
one whose bare feet felt no heat This too was a hurt to Griffiths
and he closed his eyes But the next moment they were open wide

White fella marster stop along Gooma boy the black said

Both men were on their feet and gazing at the canoe Aft could be seen
the unmistakable sombrero of a white man Quick alarm showed itself on
the face of the mate

Its Grief he said

Griffiths satisfied himself by a long look then ripped out a wrathful
oath

Whats he doing up here he demanded of the mate of the aching sea
and sky of the merciless blaze of sun and of the whole superheated and
implacable universe with which his fate was entangled

The mate began to chuckle

I told you you couldnt get away with it he said

But Griffiths was not listening

With all his money coming around like a rent collector he chanted
his outrage almost in an ecstasy of anger Hes loaded with money
hes stuffed with money hes busting with money I know for a fact he
sold his Yringa plantations for three hundred thousand pounds Bell
told me so himself last time we were drunk at Guvutu Worth millions and
millions and Shylocking me for what he wouldnt light his pipe with
 He whirled on the mate Of course you told me so Go on and say it and
keep on saying it Now just what was it you did tell me so

I told you you didnt know him if you thought you could clear the
Solomons without paying him That man Grief is a devil but hes
straight I know I told you hed throw a thousand quid away for the fun
of it and for sixpence fight like a shark for a rusty tin I tell you I
know Didnt he give his Balakula to the Queensland Mission when they
lost their Evening Star on San Cristobaland the Balakula worth
three thousand pounds if she was worth a penny And didnt he beat up
Strothers till he lay abed a fortnight all because of a difference of
two pound ten in the account and because Strothers got fresh and tried
to make the gouge go through

God strike me blind Griffiths cried in impotency of rage

The mate went on with his exposition

I tell you only a straight man can buck a straight man like him and
the mans never hit the Solomons that could do it Men like you and me
cant buck him Were too rotten too rotten all the way through Youve
got plenty more than twelve hundred quid below Pay him and get it over
with

But Griffiths gritted his teeth and drew his thin lips tightly across
them

Ill buck him he mutteredmore to himself and the brazen ball of sun
than to the mate He turned and half started to go below then turned
back again Look here Jacobsen He wont be here for quarter of an
hour Are you with me Will you stand by me

Of course Ill stand by you Ive drunk all your whiskey havent I
What are you going to do

Im not going to kill him if I can help it But Im not going to pay
Take that flat

Jacobsen shrugged his shoulders in calm acquiescence to fate and
Griffiths stepped to the companionway and went below




II

Jacobsen watched the canoe across the low reef as it came abreast and
passed on to the entrance of the passage Griffiths with inkmarks on
right thumb and forefinger returned on deck Fifteen minutes later the
canoe came alongside The man with the sombrero stood up

Hello Griffiths he said Hello Jacobsen With his hand on the
rail he turned to his dusky crew You fella boy stop along canoe
altogether

As he swung over the rail and stepped on deck a hint of catlike
litheness showed in the apparently heavy body Like the other two he
was scantily clad The cheap undershirt and white loincloth did not
serve to hide the well put up body Heavy muscled he was but he was
not lumped and hummocked by muscles They were softly rounded and when
they did move slid softly and silkily under the smooth tanned skin
Ardent suns had likewise tanned his face till it was swarthy as a
Spaniards The yellow mustache appeared incongruous in the midst of
such swarthiness while the clear blue of the eyes produced a feeling of
shock on the beholder It was difficult to realize that the skin of this
man had once been fair

Where did you blow in from Griffiths asked as they shook hands I
thought you were over in the Santa Cruz

I was the newcomer answered But we made a quick passage The
Wonders just around in the bight at Gooma waiting for wind Some
of the bushmen reported a ketch here and I just dropped around to see
Well how goes it

Nothing much Copra sheds mostly empty and not half a dozen tons of
ivory nuts The women all got rotten with fever and quit and the men
cant chase them back into the swamps Theyre a sick crowd Id ask you
to have a drink but the mate finished off my last bottle I wisht to
God for a breeze of wind

Grief glancing with keen carelessness from one to the other laughed

Im glad the calm held he said It enabled me to get around to see
you My supercargo dug up that little note of yours and I brought it
along

The mate edged politely away leaving his skipper to face his trouble

Im sorry Grief damned sorry Griffiths said but I aint got it
Youll have to give me a little more time

Grief leaned up against the companionway surprise and pain depicted on
his face

It does beat hell he communed how men learn to lie in the Solomons
The truths not in them Now take Captain Jensen Id sworn by his
truthfulness Why he told me only five days agodo you want to know
what he told me

Griffiths licked his lips

Go on

Why he told me that youd sold outsold out everything cleaned up
and was pulling out for the New Hebrides

Hes a damned liar Griffiths cried hotly

Grief nodded

I should say so He even had the nerve to tell me that hed bought two
of your stations from youMauri and Kahula Said he paid you seventeen
hundred gold sovereigns lock stock and barrel good will tradegoods
credit and copra

Griffithss eyes narrowed and glinted The action was involuntary and
Grief noted it with a lazy sweep of his eyes

And Parsons your trader at Hickimavi told me that the Fulcrum Company
had bought that station from you Now what did he want to lie for

Griffiths overwrought by sun and sickness exploded All his bitterness
of spirit rose up in his face and twisted his mouth into a snarl

Look here Grief whats the good of playing with me that way You
know and I know you know Let it go at that I have sold out and I
am getting away And what are you going to do about it

Grief shrugged his shoulders and no hint of resolve shadowed itself in
his own face His expression was as of one in a quandary

Theres no law here Griffiths pressed home his advantage Tulagi is
a hundred and fifty miles away Ive got my clearance papers and Im
on my own boat Theres nothing to stop me from sailing Youve got no
right to stop me just because I owe you a little money And by God you
cant stop me Put that in your pipe

The look of pained surprise on Griefs face deepened

You mean youre going to cheat me out of that twelve hundred
Griffiths

Thats just about the size of it old man And calling hard names wont
help any Theres the wind coming Youd better get overside before I
pull out or Ill tow your canoe under

Really Griffiths you sound almost right I cant stop you Grief
fumbled in the pouch that hung on his revolverbelt and pulled out a
crumpled officiallooking paper But maybe this will stop you And its
something for your pipe Smoke up

What is it

An admiralty warrant Running to the New Hebrides wont save you It
can be served anywhere

Griffiths hesitated and swallowed when he had finished glancing at the
document With knit brows he pondered this new phase of the situation
Then abruptly as he looked up his face relaxed into all frankness

You were cleverer than I thought old man he said Youve got me
hip and thigh I ought to have known better than to try and beat you
Jacobsen told me I couldnt and I wouldnt listen to him But he was
right and so are you Ive got the money below Come on down and well
settle

He started to go down then stepped aside to let his visitor precede
him at the same time glancing seaward to where the dark flaw of wind
was quickening the water

Heave short he told the mate Get up sail and stand ready to break
out

As Grief sat down on the edge of the mates bunk close against and
facing the tiny table he noticed the butt of a revolver just projecting
from under the pillow On the table which hung on hinges from the
forard bulkhead were pen and ink also a battered logbook

Oh I dont mind being caught in a dirty trick Griffiths was saying
defiantly Ive been in the tropics too long Im a sick man a damn
sick man And the whiskey and the sun and the fever have made me sick
in morals too Nothings too mean and low for me now and I can
understand why the niggers eat each other and take heads and such
things I could do it myself So I call trying to do you out of that
small account a pretty mild trick Wisht I could offer you a drink

Grief made no reply and the other busied himself in attempting to
unlock a large and muchdented cashbox From on deck came falsetto
cries and the creak and rattle of blocks as the black crew swung up
mainsail and driver Grief watched a large cockroach crawling over the
greasy paintwork Griffiths with an oath of irritation carried the
cashbox to the companionsteps for better light Here on his feet and
bending over the box his back to his visitor his hands shot out to
the rifle that stood beside the steps and at the same moment he whirled
about

Now dont you move a muscle he commanded

Grief smiled elevated his eyebrows quizzically and obeyed His left
hand rested on the bunk beside him his right hand lay on the table

His revolver hung on his right hip in plain sight But in his mind was
recollection of the other revolver under the pillow

Huh Griffiths sneered Youve got everybody in the Solomons
hypnotized but let me tell you you aint got me Now Im going to throw
you off my vessel along with your admiralty warrant but first youve
got to do something Lift up that logbook

The other glanced curiously at the logbook but did not move

I tell you Im a sick man Grief and Id as soon shoot you as smash a
cockroach Lift up that logbook I say

Sick he did look his lean face working nervously with the rage that
possessed him Grief lifted the book and set it aside Beneath lay a
written sheet of tablet paper

Read it Griffiths commanded Read it aloud

Grief obeyed but while he read the fingers of his left hand began an
infinitely slow and patient crawl toward the butt of the weapon under
the pillow

On board the ketch WilliWaw Bombi Bight Island of Anna Solomon
Islands he read Know all men by these presents that I do hereby sign
off and release in full for due value received all debts whatsoever
owing to me by Harrison J Griffiths who has this day paid to me twelve
hundred pounds sterling

With that receipt in my hands Griffiths grinned your admiralty
warrants not worth the paper its written on Sign it

It wont do any good Griffiths Grief said A document signed under
compulsion wont hold before the law

In that case what objection have you to signing it then

Oh none at all only that I might save you heaps of trouble by not
signing it

Griefs fingers had gained the revolver and while he talked with his
right hand he played with the pen and with his left began slowly and
imperceptibly drawing the weapon to his side As his hand finally closed
upon it second finger on trigger and forefinger laid past the cylinder
and along the barrel he wondered what luck he would have at lefthanded
snapshooting

Dont consider me Griffiths gibed And just remember Jacobsen will
testify that he saw me pay the money over Now sign sign in full at
the bottom David Grief and date it

From on deck came the jar of sheetblocks and the rattattat of
the reefpoints against the canvas In the cabin they could feel the
WilliWaw heel swing into the wind and right David Grief still
hesitated From forard came the jerking rattle of headsail halyards
through the sheaves The little vessel heeled and through the cabin
walls came the gurgle and wash of water

Get a move on Griffiths cried The anchors out

The muzzle of the rifle four feet away was bearing directly on him
when Grief resolved to act The rifle wavered as Griffiths kept his
balance in the uncertain puffs of the first of the wind Grief took
advantage of the wavering made as if to sign the paper and at the same
instant like a cat exploded into swift and intricate action As he
ducked low and leaped forward with his body his left hand flashed from
under the screen of the table and so accuratelytimed was the single
stiff pull on the selfcocking trigger that the cartridge discharged as
the muzzle came forward Not a whit behind was Griffiths The muzzle
of his weapon dropped to meet the ducking body and shot at snap
direction rifle and revolver went off simultaneously

Grief felt the sting and sear of a bullet across the skin of his
shoulder and knew that his own shot had missed His forward rush
carried him to Griffiths before another shot could be fired both of
whose arms still holding the rifle he locked with a low tackle about
the body He shoved the revolver muzzle still in his left hand deep
into the others abdomen Under the press of his anger and the sting of
his abraded skin Griefs finger was lifting the hammer when the wave
of anger passed and he recollected himself Down the companionway came
indignant cries from the Gooma boys in his canoe

Everything was happening in seconds There was apparently no pause in
his actions as he gathered Griffiths in his arms and carried him up the
steep steps in a sweeping rush Out into the blinding glare of sunshine
he came A black stood grinning at the wheel and the WilliWaw
heeled over from the wind was foaming along Rapidly dropping astern
was his Gooma canoe Grief turned his head From amidships revolver in
hand the mate was springing toward him With two jumps still holding
the helpless Griffiths Grief leaped to the rail and overboard

Both men were grappled together as they went down but Grief with
a quick updraw of his knees to the others chest broke the grip and
forced him down With both feet on Griffithss shoulder he forced him
still deeper at the same time driving himself to the surface Scarcely
had his head broken into the sunshine when two splashes of water in
quick succession and within a foot of his face advertised that Jacobsen
knew how to handle a revolver There was a chance for no third shot for
Grief filling his lungs with air sank down Under water he struck
out nor did he come up till he saw the canoe and the bubbling paddles
overhead As he climbed aboard the WlliWaw went into the wind to
come about

Washeewashee Grief cried to his boys You fella makeum beach quick
fella time

In all shamelessness he turned his back on the battle and ran for
cover The WilliWaw compelled to deaden way in order to pick up its
captain gave Grief his chance for a lead The canoe struck the beach
fulltilt with every paddle driving and they leaped out and ran across
the sand for the trees But before they gained the shelter three times
the sand kicked into puffs ahead of them Then they dove into the green
safety of the jungle

Grief watched the WilliWaw haul up close go out the passage then
slack its sheets as it headed south with the wind abeam As it went out
of sight past the point he could see the topsail being broken out One
of the Gooma boys a black nearly fifty years of age hideously marred
and scarred by skin diseases and old wounds looked up into his face and
grinned

My word the boy commented that fella skipper too much cross along
you

Grief laughed and led the way back across the sand to the canoe




III

How many millions David Grief was worth no man in the Solomons knew for
his holdings and ventures were everywhere in the great South Pacific
From Samoa to New Guinea and even to the north of the Line his
plantations were scattered He possessed pearling concessions in the
Paumotus Though his name did not appear he was in truth the German
company that traded in the French Marquesas His trading stations were
in strings in all the groups and his vessels that operated them were
many He owned atolls so remote and tiny that his smallest schooners and
ketches visited the solitary agents but once a year

In Sydney on Castlereagh Street his offices occupied three floors
But he was rarely in those offices He preferred always to be on the go
amongst the islands nosing out new investments inspecting and shaking
up old ones and rubbing shoulders with fun and adventure in a thousand
strange guises He bought the wreck of the great steamship Gavonne
for a song and in salving it achieved the impossible and cleaned up a
quarter of a million In the Louisiades he planted the first commercial
rubber and in BoraBora he ripped out the South Sea cotton and put the
jolly islanders at the work of planting cacao It was he who took the
deserted island of LalluKa colonized it with Polynesians from the
OntongJava Atoll and planted four thousand acres to cocoanuts And it
was he who reconciled the warring chiefstocks of Tahiti and swung the
great deal of the phosphate island of Hikihu

His own vessels recruited his contract labour They brought Santa
Cruz boys to the New Hebrides New Hebrides boys to the Banks and the
headhunting cannibals of Malaita to the plantations of New Georgia
From Tonga to the Gilberts and on to the far Louisiades his recruiters
combed the islands for labour His keels plowed all ocean stretches He
owned three steamers on regular island runs though he rarely elected to
travel in them preferring the wilder and more primitive way of wind and
sail

At least forty years of age he looked no more than thirty Yet
beachcombers remembered his advent among the islands a score of years
before at which time the yellow mustache was already budding silkily on
his lip Unlike other white men in the tropics he was there because he
liked it His protective skin pigmentation was excellent He had
been born to the sun One he was in ten thousand in the matter of
sunresistance The invisible and highvelocity light waves failed to
bore into him Other white men were pervious The sun drove through
their skins ripping and smashing tissues and nerves till they became
sick in mind and body tossed most of the Decalogue overboard descended
to beastliness drank themselves into quick graves or survived so
savagely that war vessels were sometimes sent to curb their license

But David Grief was a true son of the sun and he flourished in all its
ways He merely became browner with the passing of the years though
in the brown was the hint of golden tint that glows in the skin of the
Polynesian Yet his blue eyes retained their blue his mustache its
yellow and the lines of his face were those which had persisted through
the centuries in his English race English he was in blood yet those
that thought they knew contended he was at least American born Unlike
them he had not come out to the South Seas seeking hearth and saddle of
his own In fact he had brought hearth and saddle with him His advent
had been in the Paumotus He arrived on board a tiny schooner yacht
master and owner a youth questing romance and adventure along the
sunwashed path of the tropics He also arrived in a hurricane the
giant waves of which deposited him and yacht and all in the thick of a
cocoanut grove three hundred yards beyond the surf Six months later he
was rescued by a pearling cutter But the sun had got into his blood
At Tahiti instead of taking a steamer home he bought a schooner
outfitted her with tradegoods and divers and went for a cruise through
the Dangerous Archipelago

As the golden tint burned into his face it poured molten out of the ends
of his fingers His was the golden touch but he played the game not
for the gold but for the games sake It was a mans game the rough
contacts and fierce give and take of the adventurers of his own blood
and of half the bloods of Europe and the rest of the world and it was a
good game but over and beyond was his love of all the other things
that go to make up a South Seas rovers lifethe smell of the reef
the infinite exquisiteness of the shoals of living coral in the
mirrorsurfaced lagoons the crashing sunrises of raw colours spread
with lawless cunning the palmtufted islets set in turquoise deeps
the tonic wine of the tradewinds the heave and send of the orderly
crested seas the moving deck beneath his feet the straining canvas
overhead the flowergarlanded goldenglowing men and maids of
Polynesia halfchildren and halfgods and even the howling savages of
Melanesia headhunters and maneaters halfdevil and all beast

And so favoured child of the sun out of munificence of energy and
sheer joy of living he the man of many millions forbore on his far
way to play the game with Harrison J Griffiths for a paltry sum It was
his whim his desire his expression of self and of the sunwarmth that
poured through him It was fun a joke a problem a bit of play on
which life was lightly hazarded for the joy of the playing




IV

The early morning found the Wonder laying closehauled along the coast
of Guadalcanal She moved lazily through the water under the dying breath
of the land breeze To the east heavy masses of clouds promised a
renewal of the southeast trades accompanied by sharp puffs and rain
squalls Ahead laying along the coast on the same course as the
Wonder and being slowly overtaken was a small ketch It was not the
WilliWaw however and Captain Ward on the Wonder putting down
his glasses named it the Kauri

Grief just on deck from below sighed regretfully

If it had only been the WilliWaw he said

You do hate to be beaten Denby the supercargo remarked
sympathetically

I certainly do Grief paused and laughed with genuine mirth Its my
firm conviction that Griffiths is a rogue and that he treated me quite
scurvily yesterday Sign he says sign in full at the bottom and
date it And Jacobsen the little rat stood in with him It was rank
piracy the days of Bully Hayes all over again

If you werent my employer Mr Grief Id like to give you a piece of
my mind Captain Ward broke in

Go on and spit it out Grief encouraged

Well then The captain hesitated and cleared his throat With all
the money youve got only a fool would take the risk you did with those
two curs What do you do it for

Honestly I dont know Captain I just want to I suppose And can you
give any better reason for anything you do

Youll get your bally head shot off some fine day Captain Ward
growled in answer as he stepped to the binnacle and took the bearing
of a peak which had just thrust its head through the clouds that covered
Guadalcanar

The land breeze strengthened in a last effort and the Wonder
slipping swiftly through the water ranged alongside the Kauri and
began to go by Greetings flew back and forth then David Grief called
out

Seen anything of the WilliWaw

The captain slouchhatted and barelegged with a rolling twist hitched
the faded blue lavalava tighter around his waist and spat tobacco
juice overside

Sure he answered Griffiths lay at Savo last night taking on pigs
and yams and filling his watertanks Looked like he was going for a
long cruise but he said no Why Did you want to see him

Yes but if you see him first dont tell him youve seen me

The captain nodded and considered and walked forard on his own deck to
keep abreast of the faster vessel

Say he called Jacobsen told me they were coming down this afternoon
to Gabera Said they were going to lay there tonight and take on sweet
potatoes

Gabera has the only leading lights in the Solomons Grief said when
his schooner had drawn well ahead Is that right Captain Ward

The captain nodded

And the little bight just around the point on this side its a rotten
anchorage isnt it

No anchorage All coral patches and shoals and a bad surf Thats
where the Molly went to pieces three years ago

Grief stared straight before him with lustreless eyes for a full minute
as if summoning some vision to his inner sight Then the corners of his
eyes wrinkled and the ends of his yellow mustache lifted in a smile

Well anchor at Gabera he said And run in close to the little bight
this side I want you to drop me in a whaleboat as you go by Also
give me six boys and serve out rifles Ill be back on board before
morning

The captains face took on an expression of suspicion which swiftly
slid into one of reproach

Oh just a little fun skipper Grief protested with the apologetic
air of a schoolboy caught in mischief by an elder

Captain Ward grunted but Denby was all alertness

Id like to go along Mr Grief he said

Grief nodded consent

Bring some axes and bushknives he said And oh by the way a
couple of bright lanterns See theyve got oil in them




V

An hour before sunset the Wonder tore by the little bight The wind
had freshened and a lively sea was beginning to make The shoals
toward the beach were already white with the churn of water while those
farther out as yet showed no more sign than of discoloured water As
the schooner went into the wind and backed her jib and staysail the
whaleboat was swung out Into it leaped six breechclouted Santa Cruz
boys each armed with a rifle Denby carrying the lanterns dropped
into the sternsheets Grief following paused on the rail

Pray for a dark night skipper he pleaded

Youll get it Captain Ward answered Theres no moon anyway and
there wont be any sky Shell be a bit squally too

The forecast sent a radiance into Griefs face making more pronounced
the golden tint of his sunburn He leaped down beside the supercargo

Cast off Captain Ward ordered Draw the headsails Put your wheel
over There Steady Take that course

The Wonder filled away and ran on around the point for Gabera while
the whaleboat pulling six oars and steered by Grief headed for the
beach With superb boatmanship he threaded the narrow tortuous channel
which no craft larger than a whaleboat could negotiate until the shoals
and patches showed seaward and they grounded on the quiet rippling
beach

The next hour was filled with work Moving about among the wild
cocoanuts and jungle brush Grief selected the trees

Chop this fella tree chop that fella tree he told his blacks No
chop that other fella he said with a shake of head

In the end a wedgeshaped segment of jungle was cleared Near to the
beach remained one long palm At the apex of the wedge stood another
Darkness was falling as the lanterns were lighted carried up the two
trees and made fast

That outer lantern is too high David Grief studied it critically
Put it down about ten feet Denby




VI

The WilliWaw was tearing through the water with a bone in her teeth
for the breath of the passing squall was still strong The blacks were
swinging up the big mainsail which had been lowered on the run when the
puff was at its height Jacobsen superintending the operation ordered
them to throw the halyards down on deck and stand by then went forard
on the leebow and joined Griffiths Both men stared with widestrained
eyes at the blank wall of darkness through which they were flying their
ears tense for the sound of surf on the invisible shore It was by this
sound that they were for the moment steering

The wind fell lighter the scud of clouds thinned and broke and in the
dim glimmer of starlight loomed the jungleclad coast Ahead and well
on the leebow appeared a jagged rockpoint Both men strained to it

Amboy Point Griffiths announced Plenty of water close up Take the
wheel Jacobsen till we set a course Get a move on

Running aft barefooted and barelegged the rainwater dripping from his
scant clothing the mate displaced the black at the wheel

Hows she heading Griffiths called

Southahalfwest

Let her come up southbywest Got it

Right on it

Griffiths considered the changed relation of Amboy Point to the
WilliWaws course

And ahalfwest he cried

And ahalfwest came the answer Right on it

Steady Thatll do

Steady she is Jacobsen turned the wheel over to the savage You
steer good fella savve he warned No good fella I knock your damn
black head off

Again he went forard and joined the other and again the cloudscud
thickened the starglimmer vanished and the wind rose and screamed in
another squall

Watch that mainsail Griffiths yelled in the mates ear at the same
time studying the ketchs behaviour

Over she pressed and leerail under while he measured the weight of
the wind and quested its easement The tepid seawater with here and
there tiny globules of phosphorescence washed about his ankles and
knees The wind screamed a higher note and every shroud and stay
sharply chorused an answer as the WilliWaw pressed farther over and
down

Down mainsail Griffiths yelled springing to the peakhalyards
thrusting away the black who held on and casting off the turn

Jacobsen at the throathalyards was performing the like office The
big sail rattled down and the blacks with shouts and yells threw
themselves on the battling canvas The mate finding one skulking in the
darkness flung his bunched knuckles into the creatures face and drove
him to his work

The squall held at its high pitch and under her small canvas the
WilliWaw still foamed along Again the two men stood forard and
vainly watched in the horizontal drive of rain

Were all right Griffiths said This rain wont last We can hold
this course till we pick up the lights Anchor in thirteen fathoms
Youd better overhaul fortyfive on a night like this After that get
the gaskets on the mainsail We wont need it

Half an hour afterward his weary eyes were rewarded by a glimpse of two
lights

There they are Jacobsen Ill take the wheel Run down the
forestaysail and stand by to let go Make the niggers jump

Aft the spokes of the wheel in his hands Griffiths held the course
till the two lights came in line when he abruptly altered and headed
directly in for them He heard the tumble and roar of the surf but
decided it was farther awayas it should be at Gabera

He heard the frightened cry of the mate and was grinding the wheel down
with all his might when the WilliWaw struck At the same instant
her mainmast crashed over the bow Five wild minutes followed All hands
held on while the hull upheaved and smashed down on the brittle
coral and the warm seas swept over them Grinding and crunching the
WilliWaw worked itself clear over the shoal patch and came solidly to
rest in the comparatively smooth and shallow channel beyond

Griffiths sat down on the edge of the cabin head bowed on chest in
silent wrath and bitterness Once he lifted his face to glare at the two
white lights one above the other and perfectly in line

There they are he said And this isnt Gabera Then what the hell is
it

Though the surf still roared and across the shoal flung its spray
and upper wash over them the wind died down and the stars came out
Shoreward came the sound of oars

What have you hadan earthquake Griffiths called out The bottoms
all changed Ive anchored here a hundred times in thirteen fathoms Is
that you Wilson

A whaleboat came alongside and a man climbed over the rail In the
faint light Griffiths found an automatic Colts thrust into his face
and looking up saw David Grief

No you never anchored here before Grief laughed Gaberas just
around the point where Ill be as soon as Ive collected that little
sum of twelve hundred pounds We wont bother for the receipt Ive your
note here and Ill just return it

You did this Griffiths cried springing to his feet in a sudden gust
of rage You faked those leading lights Youve wrecked me and by

Steady Steady Griefs voice was cool and menacing Ill trouble you
for that twelve hundred please

To Griffiths a vast impotence seemed to descend upon him He was
overwhelmed by a profound disgustdisgust for the sunlands and the
sunsickness for the futility of all his endeavour for this blueeyed
goldentinted superior man who defeated him on all his ways

Jacobsen he said will you open the cashbox and pay thisthis
bloodsuckertwelve hundred pounds





Chapter TwoTHE PROUD GOAT OF ALOYSIUS PANKBURN




I

Quick eye that he had for the promise of adventure prepared always for
the unexpected to leap out at him from behind the nearest cocoanut
tree nevertheless David Grief received no warning when he laid eyes on
Aloysius Pankburn It was on the little steamer Berthe Leaving his
schooner to follow Grief had taken passage for the short run across
from Raiatea to Papeete When he first saw Aloysius Pankburn that
somewhat fuddled gentleman was drinking a lonely cocktail at the tiny
bar between decks next to the barber shop And when Grief left the
barbers hands half an hour later Aloysius Pankburn was still hanging
over the bar still drinking by himself

Now it is not good for man to drink alone and Grief threw sharp
scrutiny into his passing glance He saw a wellbuilt young man of
thirty wellfeatured welldressed and evidently in the worlds
catalogue a gentleman But in the faint hint of slovenliness in
the shaking eager hand that spilled the liquor and in the nervous
vacillating eyes Grief read the unmistakable marks of the chronic
alcoholic

After dinner he chanced upon Pankburn again This time it was on deck
and the young man clinging to the rail and peering into the distance
at the dim forms of a man and woman in two steamer chairs drawn closely
together was crying drunkenly Grief noted that the mans arm was
around the womans waist Aloysius Pankburn looked on and cried

Nothing to weep about Grief said genially

Pankburn looked at him and gushed tears of profound selfpity

Its hard he sobbed Hard Hard That mans my business manager I
employ him I pay him a good screw And thats how he earns it

In that case why dont you put a stop to it Grief advised

I cant Shed shut off my whiskey Shes my trained nurse

Fire her then and drink your head off

I cant Hes got all my money If I did he wouldnt give me sixpence
to buy a drink with

This woful possibility brought a fresh wash of tears Grief was
interested Of all unique situations he could never have imagined such a
one as this

They were engaged to take care of me Pankburn was blubbering to
keep me away from the drink And thats the way they do it lollygagging
all about the ship and letting me drink myself to death It isnt right
I tell you It isnt right They were sent along with me for the express
purpose of not letting me drink and they let me drink to swinishness
as long as I leave them alone If I complain they threaten not to let me
have another drop What can a poor devil do My death will be on their
heads thats all Come on down and join me

He released his clutch on the rail and would have fallen had Grief
not caught his arm He seemed to undergo a transformation to stiffen
physically to thrust his chin forward aggressively and to glint
harshly in his eyes

I wont let them kill me And theyll be sorry Ive offered them fifty
thousandlater on of course They laughed They dont know But I
know He fumbled in his coat pocket and drew forth an object that
flashed in the faint light They dont know the meaning of that But I
do He looked at Grief with abrupt suspicion What do you make out of
it eh What do you make out of it

David Grief caught a swift vision of an alcoholic degenerate putting
a very loving young couple to death with a copper spike for a
copper spike was what he held in his hand an evident oldfashioned
shipfastening

My mother thinks Im up here to get cured of the booze habit She
doesnt know I bribed the doctor to prescribe a voyage When we get to
Papeete my manager is going to charter a schooner and away well sail
But they dont dream They think its the booze I know I only know
Good night sir Im going to bedunlesseryoull join me in a night
cap One last drink you know




II

In the week that followed at Papeete Grief caught numerous and bizarre
glimpses of Aloysius Pankburn So did everybody else in the little
island capital for neither the beach nor Lavinas boarding house
had been so scandalized in years In midday bareheaded clad only
in swimming trunks Aloysius Pankburn ran down the main street from
Lavinas to the water front He put on the gloves with a fireman from
the Berthe in a scheduled fourround bout at the Folies Bergres
and was knocked out in the second round He tried insanely to drown
himself in a twofoot pool of water dived drunkenly and splendidly from
fifty feet up in the rigging of the Mariposa lying at the wharf and
chartered the cutter Toerau at more than her purchase price and was
only saved by his managers refusal financially to ratify the agreement
He bought out the old blind leper at the market and sold breadfruit
plantains and sweet potatoes at such cutrates that the gendarmes
were called out to break the rush of bargainhunting natives For that
matter three times the gendarmes arrested him for riotous behaviour
and three times his manager ceased from lovemaking long enough to pay
the fines imposed by a needy colonial administration

Then the Mariposa sailed for San Francisco and in the bridal suite
were the manager and the trained nurse freshmarried Before departing
the manager had thoughtfully bestowed eight fivepound banknotes on
Aloysius with the foreseen result that Aloysius awoke several days
later to find himself broke and perilously near to delirium tremens
Lavina famed for her good heart even among the driftage of South
Pacific rogues and scamps nursed him around and never let it filter
into his returning intelligence that there was neither manager nor money
to pay his board

It was several evenings after this that David Grief lounging under
the after deck awning of the Kittiwake and idly scanning the meagre
columns of the Papeete AvantCoureur sat suddenly up and almost
rubbed his eyes It was unbelievable but there it was The old South
Seas Romance was not dead He read

     WANTEDTo exchange a half interest in buried treasure
     worth five million francs for transportation for one to an
     unknown island in the Pacific and facilities for carrying
     away the loot   Ask for FOLLY at Lavinas

Grief looked at his watch It was early yet only eight oclock

Mr Carlsen he called in the direction of a glowing pipe Get the
crew for the whaleboat Im going ashore

The husky voice of the Norwegian mate was raised forard and half a
dozen strapping Rapa Islanders ceased their singing and manned the boat

I came to see Folly Mr Folly I imagine David Grief told Lavina

He noted the quick interest in her eyes as she turned her head and flung
a command in native across two open rooms to the outstanding kitchen A
few minutes later a barefooted native girl padded in and shook her head

Lavinas disappointment was evident

Youre stopping aboard the Kittiwake arent you she said Ill
tell him you called

Then it is a he Grief queried

Lavina nodded

I hope you can do something for him Captain Grief Im only a
goodnatured woman I dont know But hes a likable man and he may be
telling the truth I dont know Youll know Youre not a softhearted
fool like me Cant I mix you a cocktail




III

Back on board his schooner and dozing in a deck chair under a
threemonthsold magazine David Grief was aroused by a sobbing
slubbering noise from overside He opened his eyes From the Chilian
cruiser a quarter of a mile away came the stroke of eight bells It
was midnight From overside came a splash and another slubbering noise
To him it seemed half amphibian half the sounds of a man crying to
himself and querulously chanting his sorrows to the general universe

A jump took David Grief to the low rail Beneath centred about the
slubbering noise was an area of agitated phosphorescence Leaning over
he locked his hand under the armpit of a man and with pull and heave
and quickchanging grips he drew on deck the naked form of Aloysius
Pankburn

I didnt have a soumarkee he complained I had to swim it and I
couldnt find your gangway It was very miserable Pardon me If you
have a towel to put about my middle and a good stiff drink Ill be
more myself Im Mr Folly and youre the Captain Grief I presume
who called on me when I was out No Im not drunk Nor am I cold This
isnt shivering Lavina allowed me only two drinks today Im on the
edge of the horrors thats all and I was beginning to see things
when I couldnt find the gangway If youll take me below Ill be very
grateful You are the only one that answered my advertisement

He was shaking pitiably in the warm night and down in the cabin before
he got his towel Grief saw to it that a halftumbler of whiskey was in
his hand

Now fire ahead Grief said when he had got his guest into a shirt
and a pair of duck trousers Whats this advertisement of yours Im
listening

Pankburn looked at the whiskey bottle but Grief shook his head

All right Captain though I tell you on whatever is left of my honour
that I am not drunknot in the least Also what I shall tell you is
true and I shall tell it briefly for it is clear to me that you are
a man of affairs and action Likewise your chemistry is good To you
alcohol has never been a million maggots gnawing at every cell of you
Youve never been to hell I am there now I am scorching Now listen

My mother is alive She is English I was born in Australia I
was educated at York and Yale I am a master of arts a doctor of
philosophy and I am no good Furthermore I am an alcoholic I have
been an athlete I used to swandive a hundred and ten feet in the
clear I hold several amateur records I am a fish I learned the
crawlstroke from the first of the Cavilles I have done thirty miles
in a rough sea I have another record I have punished more whiskey than
any man of my years I will steal sixpence from you for the price of a
drink Finally I will tell you the truth

My father was an Americanan Annapolis man He was a midshipman in the
War of the Rebellion In  he was a lieutenant on the Suwanee Her
captain was Paul Shirley In  the Suwanee coaled at an island in the
Pacific which I do not care to mention under a protectorate which did
not exist then and which shall be nameless Ashore behind the bar of a
public house my father saw three copper spikesships spikes

David Grief smiled quietly

And now I can tell you the name of the coaling station and of the
protectorate that came afterward he said

And of the three spikes Pankburn asked with equal quietness Go
ahead for they are in my possession now

Certainly They were behind German Oscars bar at PeenooPeenee Johnny
Black brought them there from off his schooner the night he died He was
just back from a long cruise to the westward fishing bechedemer and
sandalwood trading All the beach knows the tale

Pankburn shook his head

Go on he urged

It was before my time of course Grief explained I only tell what
Ive heard Next came the Ecuadoran cruiser of all directions in from
the westward and bound home Her officers recognized the spikes Johnny
Black was dead They got hold of his mate and logbook Away to the
westward went she Six months after again bound home she dropped in at
PeenooPeenee She had failed and the tale leaked out

When the revolutionists were marching on Guayaquil Pankburn took it
up the federal officers believing a defence of the city hopeless
salted down the government treasure chest something like a million
dollars gold but all in English coinage and put it on board the
American schooner Flirt They were going to run at daylight The
American captain skinned out in the middle of the night Go on

Its an old story Grief resumed There was no other vessel in the
harbour The federal leaders couldnt run They put their backs to the
wall and held the city Rohjas Salced making a forced march from Quito
raised the siege The revolution was broken and the one ancient steamer
that constituted the Ecuadoran navy was sent in pursuit of the Flirt
They caught her between the Banks Group and the New Hebrides hove
to and flying distress signals The captain had died the day
beforeblackwater fever

And the mate Pankburn challenged

The mate had been killed a week earlier by the natives on one of the
Banks when they sent a boat in for water There were no navigators
left The men were put to the torture It was beyond international law
They wanted to confess but couldnt They told of the three spikes in
the trees on the beach but where the island was they did not know To
the westward far to the westward was all they knew The tale now goes
two ways One is that they all died under the torture The other is that
the survivors were swung at the yardarm At any rate the Ecuadoran
cruiser went home without the treasure Johnny Black brought the three
spikes to PeenooPeenee and left them at German Oscars but how and
where he found them he never told

Pankburn looked hard at the whiskey bottle

Just two fingers he whimpered

Grief considered and poured a meagre drink Pankburns eyes sparkled
and he took new lease of life

And this is where I come in with the missing details he said Johnny
Black did tell He told my father Wrote him from Levuka before he came
on to die at PeenooPeenee My father had saved his life one roughhouse
night in Valparaiso A Chink pearler out of Thursday Island
prospecting for new grounds to the north of New Guinea traded for the
three spikes with a nigger Johnny Black bought them for copper weight
He didnt dream any more than the Chink but coming back he stopped for
hawksbill turtle at the very beach where you say the mate of the
Flirt was killed Only he wasnt killed The Banks Islanders held
him prisoner and he was dying of necrosis of the jawbone caused by an
arrow wound in the fight on the beach Before he died he told the yarn
to Johnny Black Johnny Black wrote my father from Levuka He was at the
end of his ropecancer My father ten years afterward when captain of
the Perry got the spikes from German Oscar And from my father last
will and testament you know came the spikes and the data I have the
island the latitude and longitude of the beach where the three spikes
were nailed in the trees The spikes are up at Lavinas now The
latitude and longitude are in my head Now what do you think

Fishy was Griefs instant judgment Why didnt your father go and
get it himself

Didnt need it An uncle died and left him a fortune He retired from
the navy ran foul of an epidemic of trained nurses in Boston and my
mother got a divorce Also she fell heir to an income of something like
thirty thousand dollars and went to live in New Zealand I was divided
between them halftime New Zealand halftime United States until my
fathers death last year Now my mother has me altogether He left me
his moneyoh a couple of millionsbut my mother has had guardians
appointed on account of the drink Im worth all kinds of money but I
cant touch a penny save what is doled out to me But the old man who
had got the tip on my drinking left me the three spikes and the data
thereunto pertaining Did it through his lawyers unknown to my mother
said it beat life insurance and that if I had the backbone to go and
get it I could drink my back teeth awash until I died Millions in the
hands of my guardians slathers of shekels of my mothers thatll be
mine if she beats me to the crematory another million waiting to be dug
up and in the meantime Im cadging on Lavina for two drinks a day Its
hell isnt itwhen you consider my thirst

Wheres the island

Its a long way from here

Name it

Not on your life Captain Grief Youre making an easy halfmillion out
of this You will sail under my directions and when were well to sea
and on our way Ill tell you and not before

Grief shrugged his shoulders dismissing the subject

When Ive given you another drink Ill send the boat ashore with you
 he said

Pankburn was taken aback For at least five minutes he debated with
himself then licked his lips and surrendered

If you promise to go Ill tell you now

Of course Im willing to go Thats why I asked you Name the island

Pankburn looked at the bottle

Ill take that drink now Captain

No you wont That drink was for you if you went ashore If you are
going to tell me the island you must do it in your sober senses

Francis Island if you will have it Bougainville named it Barbour
Island

Off there all by its lonely in the Little Coral Sea Grief said I
know it Lies between New Ireland and New Guinea A rotten hole now
though it was all right when the Flirt drove in the spikes and the
Chink pearler traded for them The steamship Castor recruiting labour
for the Upolu plantations was cut off there with all hands two years
ago I knew her captain well The Germans sent a cruiser shelled the
bush burned half a dozen villages killed a couple of niggers and a lot
of pigs andand that was all The niggers always were bad there but
they turned really bad forty years ago That was when they cut off a
whaler Let me see What was her name

He stepped to the bookshelf drew out the bulky South Pacific
Directory and ran through its pages

Yes Here it is Francis or Barbour he skimmed Natives warlike and
treacherousMelanesiancannibals Whaleship Western cut offthat
was her name Shoalspointsanchoragesah Redscar Owen Bay
Likikili Bay thats more like it deep indentation mangrove
swamps good holding in nine fathoms when white scar in bluff bears
westsouthwest Grief looked up Thats your beach Pankburn Ill
swear

Will you go the other demanded eagerly

Grief nodded

It sounds good to me Now if the story had been of a hundred millions
or some such crazy sum I wouldnt look at it for a moment Well sail
tomorrow but under one consideration You are to be absolutely under
my orders

His visitor nodded emphatically and joyously

And that means no drink

Thats pretty hard Pankburn whined

Its my terms Im enough of a doctor to see you dont come to harm
And you are to workhard work sailors work Youll stand regular
watches and everything though you eat and sleep aft with us

Its a go Pankburn put out his hand to ratify the agreement If it
doesnt kill me he added

David Grief poured a generous threefingers into the tumbler and
extended it

Then heres your last drink Take it

Pankburns hand went halfway out With a sudden spasm of resolution he
hesitated threw back his shoulders and straightened up his head

I guess I wont he began then feebly surrendering to the gnaw of
desire he reached hastily for the glass as if in fear that it would be
withdrawn




IV

It is a long traverse from Papeete in the Societies to the Little Coral
Seafrom  west longitude to  east longitudeas the crow flies
the equivalent to a voyage across the Atlantic But the Kittiwake did
not go as the crow flies David Griefs numerous interests diverted
her course many times He stopped to take a lookin at uninhabited Rose
Island with an eye to colonizing and planting cocoanuts Next he paid
his respects to Tui Manua of Eastern Samoa and opened an intrigue for
a share of the trade monopoly of that dying kings three islands From
Apia he carried several relief agents and a load of trade goods to the
Gilberts He peeped in at OntongJava Atoll inspected his plantations
on Ysabel and purchased lands from the saltwater chiefs of
northwestern Malaita And all along this devious way he made a man of
Aloysius Pankburn

That thirster though he lived aft was compelled to do the work of a
common sailor And not only did he take his wheel and lookout and heave
on sheets and tackles but the dirtiest and most arduous tasks were
appointed him Swung aloft in a bosuns chair he scraped the masts and
slushed down Holystoning the deck or scrubbing it with fresh limes
made his back ache and developed the wasted flabby muscles When
the Kittiwake lay at anchor and her copper bottom was scrubbed with
cocoanut husks by the native crew who dived and did it under water
Pankburn was sent down on his shift and as many times as any on the
shift

Look at yourself Grief said You are twice the man you were when you
came on board You havent had one drink you didnt die and the poison
is pretty well worked out of you Its the work It beats trained nurses
and business managers Here if youre thirsty Clap your lips to this

With several deft strokes of his heavybacked sheathknife Grief
clipped a triangular piece of shell from the end of a husked
drinkingcocoanut The thin cool liquid slightly milky and
effervescent bubbled to the brim With a bow Pankburn took the natural
cup threw his head back and held it back till the shell was empty He
drank many of these nuts each day The black steward a New Hebrides boy
sixty years of age and his assistant a Lark Islander of eleven saw to
it that he was continually supplied

Pankburn did not object to the hard work He devoured work never
shirking and always beating the native sailors in jumping to obey a
command But his sufferings during the period of driving the alcohol out
of his system were truly heroic Even when the last shred of the poison
was exuded the desire as an obsession remained in his head So it
was when on his honour he went ashore at Apia that he attempted to
put the public houses out of business by drinking up their stocks in
trade And so it was at two in the morning that David Grief found him
in front of the Tivoli out of which he had been disorderly thrown by
Charley Roberts Aloysius as of old was chanting his sorrows to the
stars Also and more concretely he was punctuating the rhythm with
cobbles of coral stone which he flung with amazing accuracy through
Charley Robertss windows

David Grief took him away but not till next morning did he take him
in hand It was on the deck of the Kittiwake and there was nothing
kindergarten about it Grief struck him with bare knuckles punched him
and punished himgave him the worst thrashing he had ever received

For the good of your soul Pankburn was the way he emphasized his
blows For the good of your mother For the progeny that will come
after For the good of the world and the universe and the whole race
of man yet to be And now to hammer the lesson home well do it all
over again That for the good of your soul and that for your mothers
sake and that for the little children undreamed of and unborn whose
mother youll love for their sakes and for loves sake in the lease
of manhood that will be yours when I am done with you Come on and take
your medicine Im not done with you yet Ive only begun There are
many other reasons which I shall now proceed to expound The brown
sailors and the black stewards and cook looked on and grinned Far from
them was the questioning of any of the mysterious and incomprehensible
ways of white men As for Carlsen the mate he was grimly in accord
with the treatment his employer was administering while Albright the
supercargo merely played with his mustache and smiled They were men
of the sea They lived life in the rough And alcohol in themselves as
well as in other men was a problem they had learned to handle in ways
not taught in doctors schools

Boy A bucket of fresh water and a towel Grief ordered when he had
finished Two buckets and two towels he added as he surveyed his own
hands

Youre a pretty one he said to Pankburn Youve spoiled everything
I had the poison completely out of you And now you are fairly reeking
with it Weve got to begin all over again Mr Albright You know that
pile of old chain on the beach at the boatlanding Find the owner buy
it and fetch it on board There must be a hundred and fifty fathoms of
it Pankburn Tomorrow morning you start in pounding the rust off of
it When youve done that youll sandpaper it Then youll paint it
And nothing else will you do till that chain is as smooth as new

Aloysius Pankburn shook his head

I quit Francis Island can go to hell for all of me Im done with your
slavedriving Kindly put me ashore at once Im a white man You cant
treat me this way

Mr Carlsen you will see that Mr Pankburn remains on board

Ill have you broken for this Aloysius screamed You cant stop me

I can give you another licking Grief answered And let me tell you
one thing you besotted whelp Ill keep on licking you as long as my
knuckles hold out or until you yearn to hammer chain rust Ive taken
you in hand and Im going to make a man out of you if I have to kill
you to do it Now go below and change your clothes Be ready to turn
to with a hammer this afternoon Mr Albright get that chain aboard
pronto Mr Carlsen send the boats ashore after it Also keep your eye
on Pankburn If he shows signs of keeling over or going into the shakes
give him a nipa small one He may need it after last night




V

For the rest of the time the Kittiwake lay in Apia Aloysius Pankburn
pounded chain rust Ten hours a day he pounded And on the long stretch
across to the Gilberts he still pounded

Then came the sandpapering One hundred and fifty fathoms is nine
hundred feet and every link of all that length was smoothed and
polished as no link ever was before And when the last link had received
its second coat of black paint he declared himself

Come on with more dirty work he told Grief Ill overhaul the other
chains if you say so And you neednt worry about me any more Im not
going to take another drop Im going to train up You got my proud
goat when you beat me but let me tell you you only got it temporarily
Train Im going to train till Im as hard all the way through and
clean all the way through as that chain is And some day Mister David
Grief somewhere somehow Im going to be in such shape that Ill lick
you as you licked me Im going to pulp your face till your own niggers
wont know you

Grief was jubilant

Now youre talking like a man he cried The only way youll ever
lick me is to become a man And then maybe

He paused in the hope that the other would catch the suggestion
Aloysius groped for it and abruptly something akin to illumination
shone in his eyes

And then I wont want to you mean

Grief nodded

And thats the curse of it Aloysius lamented I really believe I
wont want to I see the point But Im going to go right on and shape
myself up just the same

The warm sunburn glow in Griefs face seemed to grow warmer His hand
went out

Pankburn I love you right now for that

Aloysius grasped the hand and shook his head in sad sincerity

Grief he mourned youve got my goat youve got my proud goat and
youve got it permanently Im afraid




VI

On a sultry tropic day when the last flicker of the far southeast trade
was fading out and the seasonal change for the northwest monsoon was
coming on the Kittiwake lifted above the searim the jungleclad
coast of Francis Island

Grief with compass bearings and binoculars identified the volcano that
marked Redscar ran past Owen Bay and lost the last of the breeze at
the entrance to Likikili Bay With the two whaleboats out and towing
and with Carlsen heaving the lead the Kittiwake sluggishly entered a
deep and narrow indentation There were no beaches The mangroves began
at the waters edge and behind them rose steep jungle broken here and
there by jagged peaks of rock At the end of a mile when the white scar
on the bluff bore westsouthwest the lead vindicated the Directory
 and the anchor rumbled down in nine fathoms

For the rest of that day and until the afternoon of the day following
they remained on the Kittiwake and waited No canoes appeared There
were no signs of human life Save for the occasional splash of a fish or
the screaming of cockatoos there seemed no other life Once however a
huge butterfly twelve inches from tip to tip fluttered high over their
mastheads and drifted across to the opposing jungle

Theres no use in sending a boat in to be cut up Grief said

Pankburn was incredulous and volunteered to go in alone to swim it if
he couldnt borrow the dingey

They havent forgotten the German cruiser Grief explained And Ill
wager that bush is alive with men right now What do you think Mr
Carlsen

That veteran adventurer of the islands was emphatic in his agreement

In the late afternoon of the second day Grief ordered a whaleboat into
the water He took his place in the bow a live cigarette in his mouth
and a shortfused stick of dynamite in his hand for he was bent on
shooting a mess of fish Along the thwarts half a dozen Winchesters were
placed Albright who took the steeringsweep had a Mauser within reach
of hand They pulled in and along the green wall of vegetation At times
they rested on the oars in the midst of a profound silence

Two to one the bush is swarming with themin quids Albright
whispered

Pankburn listened a moment longer and took the bet Five minutes later
they sighted a school of mullet The brown rowers held their oars Grief
touched the short fuse to his cigarette and threw the stick So short
was the fuse that the stick exploded in the instant after it struck the
water And in that same instant the bush exploded into life There were
wild yells of defiance and black and naked bodies leaped forward like
apes through the mangroves

In the whaleboat every rifle was lifted Then came the wait A hundred
blacks some few armed with ancient Sniders but the greater portion
armed with tomahawks firehardened spears and bonetipped arrows
clustered on the roots that rose out of the bay No word was spoken
Each party watched the other across twenty feet of water An old
oneeyed black with a bristly face rested a Snider on his hip the
muzzle directed at Albright who in turn covered him back with the
Mauser A couple of minutes of this tableau endured The stricken fish
rose to the surface or struggled halfstunned in the clear depths

Its all right boys Grief said quietly Put down your guns and
over the side with you Mr Albright toss the tobacco to that oneeyed
brute

While the Rapa men dived for the fish Albright threw a bundle of
trade tobacco ashore The oneeyed man nodded his head and writhed his
features in an attempt at amiability Weapons were lowered bows unbent
and arrows put back in their quivers

They know tobacco Grief announced as they rowed back aboard Well
have visitors Youll break out a case of tobacco Mr Albright and a
few tradeknives Theres a canoe now

Old OneEye as befitted a chief and leader paddled out alone facing
peril for the rest of the tribe As Carlsen leaned over the rail to help
the visitor up he turned his head and remarked casually

Theyve dug up the money Mr Grief The old beggars loaded with it

OneEye floundered down on deck grinning appeasingly and failing to
hide the fear he had overcome but which still possessed him He was lame
of one leg and this was accounted for by a terrible scar inches deep
which ran down the thigh from hip to knee No clothes he wore whatever
not even a string but his nose perforated in a dozen places and each
perforation the setting for a carved spine of bone bristled like a
porcupine Around his neck and hanging down on his dirty chest was a
string of gold sovereigns His ears were hung with silver halfcrowns
and from the cartilage separating his nostrils depended a big English
penny tarnished and green but unmistakable

Hold on Grief Pankburn said with perfectly assumed carelessness
You say they know only beads and tobacco Very well You follow my
lead Theyve found the treasure and weve got to trade them out of it
Get the whole crew aside and lecture them that they are to be interested
only in the pennies Savve Gold coins must be beneath contempt and
silver coins merely tolerated Pennies are to be the only desirable
things

Pankburn took charge of the trading For the penny in OneEyes nose he
gave ten sticks of tobacco Since each stick cost David Grief a cent
the bargain was manifestly unfair But for the halfcrowns Pankburn gave
only one stick each The string of sovereigns he refused to consider
The more he refused the more OneEye insisted on a trade At last with
an appearance of irritation and anger and as a palpable concession
Pankburn gave two sticks for the string which was composed of ten
sovereigns

I take my hat off to you Grief said to Pankburn that night at dinner
The situation is patent Youve reversed the scale of value Theyll
figure the pennies as priceless possessions and the sovereigns as
beneath price Result theyll hang on to the pennies and force us to
trade for sovereigns Pankburn I drink your health Boyanother cup
of tea for Mr Pankburn




VII

Followed a golden week From dawn till dark a row of canoes rested
on their paddles two hundred feet away This was the deadline Rapa
sailors armed with rifles maintained it But one canoe at a time was
permitted alongside and but one black at a time was permitted to come
over the rail Here under the awning relieving one another in hourly
shifts the four white men carried on the trade The rate of exchange
was that established by Pankburn with OneEye Five sovereigns fetched
a stick of tobacco a hundred sovereigns twenty sticks Thus a
craftyeyed cannibal would deposit on the table a thousand dollars in
gold and go back over the rail hugelysatisfied with forty cents
worth of tobacco in his hand

Hope weve got enough tobacco to hold out Carlsen muttered dubiously
as another case was sawed in half

Albright laughed

Weve got fifty cases below he said and as I figure it three cases
buy a hundred thousand dollars There was only a million dollars buried
so thirty cases ought to get it Though of course weve got to allow
a margin for the silver and the pennies That Ecuadoran bunch must have
salted down all the coin in sight

Very few pennies and shillings appeared though Pankburn continually and
anxiously inquired for them Pennies were the one thing he seemed to
desire and he made his eyes flash covetously whenever one was produced
True to his theory the savages concluded that the gold being of slight
value must be disposed of first A penny worth fifty times as much as
a sovereign was something to retain and treasure Doubtless in their
junglelairs the wise old graybeards put their heads together and
agreed to raise the price on pennies when the worthless gold was all
worked off Who could tell Mayhap the strange white men could be made
to give even twenty sticks for a priceless copper

By the end of the week the trade went slack There was only the
slightest dribble of gold An occasional penny was reluctantly disposed
of for ten sticks while several thousand dollars in silver came in

On the morning of the eighth day no trading was done The graybeards
had matured their plan and were demanding twenty sticks for a penny
OneEye delivered the new rate of exchange The white men appeared to
take it with great seriousness for they stood together debating in low
voices Had OneEye understood English he would have been enlightened

Weve got just a little over eight hundred thousand not counting the
silver Grief said And thats about all there is The bush tribes
behind have most probably got the other two hundred thousand Return
in three months and the saltwater crowd will have traded back for it
also they will be out of tobacco by that time

It would be a sin to buy pennies Albright grinned It goes against
the thrifty grain of my traders soul

Theres a whiff of landbreeze stirring Grief said looking at
Pankburn What do you say

Pankburn nodded

Very well Grief measured the faintness and irregularity of the wind
against his cheek

Mr Carlsen heave short and get off the gaskets And stand by with
the whaleboats to tow This breeze is not dependable

He picked up a part case of tobacco containing six or seven hundred
sticks put it in OneEyes hands and helped that bewildered savage
over the rail As the foresail went up the mast a wail of consternation
arose from the canoes lying along the deadline And as the anchor
broke out and the Kittiwakes head paid off in the light breeze old
OneEye daring the rifles levelled on him paddled alongside and
made frantic signs of his tribes willingness to trade pennies for ten
sticks

Boya drinking nut Pankburn called

Its Sydney Heads for you Grief said And then what

Im coming back with you for that two hundred thousand Pankburn
answered In the meantime Im going to build an island schooner Also
Im going to call those guardians of mine before the court to show cause
why my fathers money should not be turned over to me Show cause Ill
show them cause why it should

He swelled his biceps proudly under the thin sleeve reached for the two
black stewards and put them above his head like a pair of dumbbells

Come on Swing out on that foreboomtackle Carlsen shouted from aft
where the mainsail was being winged out

Pankburn dropped the stewards and raced for it beating a Rapa sailor by
two jumps to the hauling part




Chapter ThreeTHE DEVILS OF FUATINO




I

Of his many schooners ketches and cutters that nosed about among the
coral isles of the South Seas David Grief loved most the Rattlera
yachtlike schooner of ninety tons with so swift a pair of heels that
she had made herself famous in the old days opiumsmuggling from San
Diego to Puget Sound raiding the sealrookeries of Bering Sea and
running arms in the Far East A stench and an abomination to government
officials she had been the joy of all sailormen and the pride of the
shipwrights who built her Even now after forty years of driving she
was still the same old Rattler forereaching in the same marvellous
manner that compelled sailors to see in order to believe and that
punctuated many an angry discussion with words and blows on the beaches
of all the ports from Valparaiso to Manila Bay

On this night closehauled her big mainsail preposterously flattened
down her luffs pulsing emptily on the lift of each smooth swell she
was sliding an easy four knots through the water on the veriest whisper
of a breeze For an hour David Grief had been leaning on the rail at the
lee forerigging gazing overside at the steady phosphorescence of her
gait The faint backdraught from the headsails fanned his cheek and
chest with a wine of coolness and he was in an ecstasy of appreciation
of the schooners qualities

EhShes a beauty Taute a beauty he said to the Kanaka lookout
at the same time stroking the teak of the rail with an affectionate
hand

Ay skipper the Kanaka answered in the rich bigchested tones of
Polynesia Thirty years I know ships but never like this On Raiatea
we call her Fanauao

The Dayborn Grief translated the lovephrase Who named her so

About to answer Taute peered ahead with sudden intensity Grief joined
him in the gaze

Land said Taute

Yes Fuatino Grief agreed his eyes still fixed on the spot where
the starluminous horizon was gouged by a blot of blackness Its all
right Ill tell the captain

The Rattler slid along until the loom of the island could be seen as
well as sensed until the sleepy roar of breakers and the blatting of
goats could be heard until the wind off the land was flowerdrenched
with perfume

If it wasnt a crevice she could run the passage a night like this
 Captain Glass remarked regretfully as he watched the wheel lashed hard
down by the steersman

The Rattler run off shore a mile had been hove to to wait until
daylight ere she attempted the perilous entrance to Fuatino It was a
perfect tropic night with no hint of rain or squall Forard wherever
their tasks left them the Raiatea sailors sank down to sleep on deck
Aft the captain and mate and Grief spread their beds with similar
languid unconcern They lay on their blankets smoking and murmuring
sleepy conjectures about Mataara the Queen of Fuatino and about the
love affair between her daughter Naumoo and Motuaro

Theyre certainly a romantic lot Brown the mate said As romantic
as we whites

As romantic as Pilsach Grief laughed and that is going some How
long ago was it Captain that he jumped you

Eleven years Captain Glass grunted resentfully

Tell me about it Brown pleaded They say hes never left Fuatino
since Is that right

Right O the captain rumbled Hes in love with his wifethe little
hussy Stole him from me and as good a sailorman as the trade has ever
seenif he is a Dutchman

German Grief corrected

Its all the same was the retort The sea was robbed of a good man
that night he went ashore and Notutu took one look at him I reckon they
looked good to each other Before you could say skat shed put a wreath
of some kind of white flowers on his head and in five minutes they were
off down the beach like a couple of kids holding hands and laughing I
hope hes blown that big coral patch out of the channel I always start
a sheet or two of copper warping past

Go on with the story Brown urged

Thats all He was finished right there Got married that night Never
came on board again I looked him up next day Found him in a straw
house in the bush barelegged a white savage all mixed up with flowers
and things and playing a guitar Looked like a bally ass Told me to
send his things ashore I told him Id see him damned first And thats
all Youll see her tomorrow Theyve got three kiddies nowwonderful
little rascals Ive a phonograph down below for him and about a
million records

And then you made him trader the mate inquired of Grief

What else could I do Fuatino is a love island and Filsach is a lover
He knows the native tooone of the best traders Ive got or ever had
Hes responsible Youll see him tomorrow

Look here young man Captain Glass rumbled threateningly at his mate
Are you romantic Because if you are on board you stay Fuatinos the
island of romantic insanity Everybodys in love with somebody They
live on love Its in the milk of the cocoanuts or the air or the
sea The history of the island for the last ten thousand years is
nothing but love affairs I know Ive talked with the old men And if I
catch you starting down the beach hand in hand

His sudden cessation caused both the other men to look at him They
followed his gaze which passed across them to the main rigging and saw
what he saw a brown hand and arm muscular and wet being joined from
overside by a second brown hand and arm A head followed thatched with
long elfin locks and then a face with roguish black eyes lined with
the marks of wildwoods laughter

My God Brown breathed Its a fauna seafaun

Its the Goat Man said Glass

It is Mauriri said Grief He is my own blood brother by sacred
plight of native custom His name is mine and mine is his

Broad brown shoulders and a magnificent chest rose above the rail and
with what seemed effortless ease the whole grand body followed over
the rail and noiselessly trod the deck Brown who might have been other
things than the mate of an island schooner was enchanted All that he
had ever gleaned from the books proclaimed indubitably the faunlikeness
of this visitant of the deep But a sad faun was the young mans
judgment as the goldenbrown woods god strode forward to where David
Grief sat up with outstretched hand

David said David Grief

Mauriri Big Brother said Mauriri

And thereafter in the custom of men who have pledged blood brotherhood
each called the other not by the others name but by his own Also
they talked in the Polynesian tongue of Fuatino and Brown could only
sit and guess

A long swim to say talofa Grief said as the other sat and streamed
water on the deck

Many days and nights have I watched for your coming Big Brother
 Mauriri replied I have sat on the Big Rock where the dynamite
is kept of which I have been made keeper I saw you come up to the
entrance and run back into darkness I knew you waited till morning and
I followed Great trouble has come upon us Mataara has cried these many
days for your coming She is an old woman and Motauri is dead and she
is sad

Did he marry Naumoo Grief asked after he had shaken his head and
sighed by the custom

Yes In the end they ran to live with the goats till Mataara forgave
when they returned to live with her in the Big House But he is now
dead and Naumoo soon will die Great is our trouble Big Brother Tori
is dead and TatiTori and Petoo and Nari and Pilsach and others

Pilsach too Grief exclaimed Has there been a sickness

There has been much killing Listen Big Brother Three weeks ago a
strange schooner came From the Big Rock I saw her topsails above the
sea She towed in with her boats but they did not warp by the big
patch and she pounded many times She is now on the beach where they
are strengthening the broken timbers There are eight white men on
board They have women from some island far to the east The women
talk a language in many ways like ours only different But we can
understand They say they were stolen by the men on the schooner We do
not know but they sing and dance and are happy

And the men Grief interrupted

They talk French I know for there was a mate on your schooner who
talked French long ago There are two chief men and they do not look
like the others They have blue eyes like you and they are devils One
is a bigger devil than the other The other six are also devils They do
not pay us for our yams and taro and breadfruit They take everything
from us and if we complain they kill us Thus was killed Tori and
TatiTori and Petoo and others We cannot fight for we have no
gunsonly two or three old guns

They illtreat our women Thus was killed Motuaro who made defence of
Naumoo whom they have now taken on board their schooner It was because
of this that Pilsach was killed Him the chief of the two chief men the
Big Devil shot once in his whaleboat and twice when he tried to crawl
up the sand of the beach Pilsach was a brave man and Notutu now sits
in the house and cries without end Many of the people are afraid and
have run to live with the goats But there is not food for all in the
high mountains And the men will not go out and fish and they work no
more in the gardens because of the devils who take all they have And we
are ready to fight

Big Brother we need guns and much ammunition I sent word before I
swam out to you and the men are waiting The strange white men do not
know you are come Give me a boat and the guns and I will go back
before the sun And when you come tomorrow we will be ready for the
word from you to kill the strange white men They must be killed Big
Brother you have ever been of the blood with us and the men and women
have prayed to many gods for your coming And you are come

I will go in the boat with you Grief said

No Big Brother was Mauriris reply You must be with the schooner
The strange white men will fear the schooner not us We will have the
guns and they will not know It is only when they see your schooner
come that they will be alarmed Send the young man there with the boat

So it was that Brown thrilling with all the romance and adventure he
had read and guessed and never lived took his place in the sternsheets
of a whaleboat loaded with rifles and cartridges rowed by four Baiatea
sailors steered by a goldenbrown seaswimming faun and directed
through the warm tropic darkness toward the halfmythical love island of
Fuatino which had been invaded by twentieth century pirates




II

If a line be drawn between Jaluit in the Marshall Group and
Bougainville in the Solomons and if this line be bisected at two
degrees south of the equator by a line drawn from Ukuor in the
Carolines the high island of Fuatino will be raised in that sunwashed
stretch of lonely sea Inhabited by a stock kindred to the Hawaiian
the Samoan the Tahitian and the Maori Fuatino becomes the apex of the
wedge driven by Polynesia far to the west and in between Melanesia and
Micronesia And it was Fuatino that David Grief raised next morning
two miles to the east and in direct line with the rising sun The same
whisper of a breeze held and the Rattler slid through the smooth sea
at a rate that would have been eminently proper for an island schooner
had the breeze been thrice as strong

Fuatino was nothing else than an ancient crater thrust upward from the
seabottom by some primordial cataclysm The western portion broken
and crumbled to sea level was the entrance to the crater itself which
constituted the harbour Thus Fuatino was like a rugged horseshoe the
heel pointing to the west And into the opening at the heel the Rattler
steered Captain Glass binoculars in hand and peering at the chart made
by himself which was spread on top the cabin straightened up with an
expression on his face that was half alarm half resignation

Its coming he said Fever It wasnt due till tomorrow It always
hits me hard Mr Grief In five minutes Ill be off my head Youll
have to con the schooner in Boy Get my bunk ready Plenty of blankets
Fill that hotwater bottle Its so calm Mr Grief that I think you
can pass the big patch without warping Take the leading wind and shoot
her Shes the only craft in the South Pacific that can do it and I
know you know the trick You can scrape the Big Rock by just watching
out for the main boom

He had talked rapidly almost like a drunken man as his reeling brain
battled with the rising shock of the malarial stroke When he stumbled
toward the companionway his face was purpling and mottling as if
attacked by some monstrous inflammation or decay His eyes were setting
in a glassy bulge his hands shaking his teeth clicking in the spasms
of chill

Two hours to get the sweat he chattered with a ghastly grin And a
couple more and Ill be all right I know the damned thing to the last
minute it runs its course Yyyou tttake chchchch

His voice faded away in a weak stutter as he collapsed down into the
cabin and his employer took charge The Rattler was just entering the
passage The heels of the horseshoe island were two huge mountains of
rock a thousand feet high each almost broken off from the mainland and
connected with it by a low and narrow peninsula Between the heels was
a halfmile stretch all but blocked by a reef of coral extending across
from the south heel The passage which Captain Glass had called a
crevice twisted into this reef curved directly to the north heel and
ran along the base of the perpendicular rock At this point with the
mainboom almost grazing the rock on the port side Grief peering down
on the starboard side could see bottom less than two fathoms beneath
and shoaling steeply With a whaleboat towing for steerage and as a
precaution against backdraughts from the cliff and taking advantage of
a fan of breeze he shook the Rattler full into it and glided by the big
coral patch without warping As it was he just scraped but so softly
as not to start the copper

The harbour of Fuatino opened before him It was a circular sheet of
water five miles in diameter rimmed with white coral beaches from
which the verdureclad slopes rose swiftly to the frowning crater walls
The crests of the walls were sawtoothed volcanic peaks capped and
halod with captive tradewind clouds Every nook and crevice of the
disintegrating lava gave foothold to creeping climbing vines and
treesa green foam of vegetation Thin streams of water that were
mere films of mist swayed and undulated downward in sheer descents
of hundreds of feet And to complete the magic of the place the warm
moist air was heavy with the perfume of the yellowblossomed cassi

Fanning along against light vagrant airs the Rattler worked in
Calling the whaleboat on board Grief searched out the shore with his
binoculars There was no life In the hot blaze of tropic sun the place
slept There was no sign of welcome Up the beach on the north shore
where the fringe of cocoanut palms concealed the village he could see
the black bows of the canoes in the canoehouses On the beach on even
keel rested the strange schooner Nothing moved on board of her or
around her Not until the beach lay fifty yards away did Grief let go
the anchor in forty fathoms Out in the middle long years before he
had sounded three hundred fathoms without reaching bottom which was to
be expected of a healthy craterpit like Fuatino As the chain roared
and surged through the hawsepipe he noticed a number of native women
lusciously large as only those of Polynesia are in flowing ahus
flowercrowned stream out on the deck of the schooner on the beach
Also and what they did not see he saw from the galley the squat figure
of a man steal forard drop to the sand and dive into the green screen
of bush

While the sails were furled and gasketed awnings stretched and sheets
and tackles coiled harbour fashion David Grief paced the deck and
looked vainly for a flutter of life elsewhere than on the strange
schooner Once beyond any doubt he heard the distant crack of a rifle
in the direction of the Big Rock There were no further shots and he
thought of it as some hunter shooting a wild goat

At the end of another hour Captain Glass under a mountain of blankets
had ceased shivering and was in the inferno of a profound sweat

Ill be all right in half an hour he said weakly

Very well Grief answered The place is dead and Im going ashore to
see Mataara and find out the situation

Its a tough bunch keep your eyes open the captain warned him If
youre not back in an hour send word off

Grief took the steeringsweep and four of his Raiatea men bent to the
oars As they landed on the beach he looked curiously at the women under
the schooners awning He waved his hand tentatively and they after
giggling waved back

Talofa he called

They understood the greeting but replied Iorana and he knew they
came from the Society Group

Huahine one of his sailors unhesitatingly named their island Grief
asked them whence they came and with giggles and laughter they replied
Huahine

It looks like old Dupuys schooner Grief said in Tahitian speaking
in a low voice Dont look too hard What do you think eh Isnt it
the Valetta

As the men climbed out and lifted the whaleboat slightly up the beach
they stole careless glances at the vessel

It is the Valetta Taute said She carried her topmast away seven
years ago At Papeete they rigged a new one It was ten feet shorter
That is the one

Go over and talk with the women you boys You can almost see Huahine
from Raiatea and youll be sure to know some of them Find out all you
can And if any of the white men show up dont start a row

An army of hermit crabs scuttled and rustled away before him as he
advanced up the beach but under the palms no pigs rooted and grunted
The cocoanuts lay where they had fallen and at the coprasheds there
were no signs of curing Industry and tidiness had vanished Grass
house after grass house he found deserted Once he came upon an old
man blind toothless prodigiously wrinkled who sat in the shade and
babbled with fear when he spoke to him It was as if the place had been
struck with the plague was Griefs thought as he finally approached
the Big House All was desolation and disarray There were no
flowercrowned men and maidens no brown babies rolling in the shade of
the avocado trees In the doorway crouched and rocking back and forth
sat Mataara the old queen She wept afresh at sight of him divided
between the tale of her woe and regret that no follower was left to
dispense to him her hospitality

And so they have taken Naumoo she finished Motauri is dead My
people have fled and are starving with the goats And there is no one to
open for you even a drinking cocoanut O Brother your white brothers
be devils

They are no brothers of mine Mataara Grief consoled They are
robbers and pigs and I shall clean the island of them

He broke off to whirl half around his hand flashing to his waist and
back again the big Colts levelled at the figure of a man bent double
that rushed at him from out of the trees He did not pull the trigger
nor did the man pause till he had flung himself headlong at Griefs
feet and begun to pour forth a stream of uncouth and awful noises He
recognized the creature as the one he had seen steal from the Valetta
and dive into the bush but not until he raised him up and watched
the contortions of the harelipped mouth could he understand what he
uttered

Save me master save me the man yammered in English though he was
unmistakably a South Sea native I know you Save me

And thereat he broke into a wild outpour of incoherence that did
not cease until Grief seized him by the shoulders and shook him into
silence

I know you Grief said You were cook in the French Hotel at Papeete
two years ago Everybody called you HareLip

The man nodded violently

I am now cook of the Valetta he spat and spluttered his mouth
writhing in a fearful struggle with its defect I know you I saw you
at the hotel I saw you at Lavinas I saw you on the Kittiwake I saw
you at the Mariposa wharf You are Captain Grief and you will save
me Those men are devils They killed Captain Dupuy Me they made kill
half the crew Two they shot from the crosstrees The rest they shot
in the water I knew them all They stole the girls from Huahine They
added to their strength with jailmen from Noumea They robbed the
traders in the New Hebrides They killed the trader at Vanikori and
stole two women there They

But Grief no longer heard Through the trees from the direction of
the harbour came a rattle of rifles and he started on the run for the
beach Pirates from Tahiti and convicts from New Caledonia A pretty
bunch of desperadoes that even now was attacking his schooner HareLip
followed still spluttering and spitting his tale of the white devils
doings

The riflefiring ceased as abruptly as it had begun but Grief ran
on perplexed by ominous conjectures until in a turn of the path he
encountered Mauriri running toward him from the beach

Big Brother the Goat Man panted I was too late They have taken
your schooner Come For now they will seek for you

He started back up the path away from the beach

Where is Brown Grief demanded

On the Big Rock I will tell you afterward Come now

But my men in the whaleboat

Mauriri was in an agony of apprehension

They are with the women on the strange schooner They will not be
killed I tell you true The devils want sailors But you they will
kill Listen From the water in a cracked tenor voice came a French
hunting song They are landing on the beach They have taken your
schoonerthat I saw Come




III

Careless of his own life and skin nevertheless David Grief was
possessed of no false hardihood He knew when to fight and when to run
and that this was the time for running he had no doubt Up the path
past the old men sitting in the shade past Mataara crouched in the
doorway of the Big House he followed at the heels of Mauriri At his
own heels doglike plodded HareLip From behind came the cries of the
hunters but the pace Mauriri led them was heartbreaking The broad path
narrowed swung to the right and pitched upward The last grass house
was left and through high thickets of cassi and swarms of great
golden wasps the way rose steeply until it became a goattrack Pointing
upward to a bare shoulder of volcanic rock Mauriri indicated the trail
across its face

Past that we are safe Big Brother he said The white devils never
dare it for there are rocks we roll down on their heads and there
is no other path Always do they stop here and shoot when we cross the
rock Come

A quarter of an hour later they paused where the trail went naked on the
face of the rock

Wait and when you come come quickly Mauriri cautioned

He sprang into the blaze of sunlight and from below several rifles
pumped rapidly Bullets smacked about him and puffs of stonedust
flew out but he won safely across Grief followed and so near did
one bullet come that the dust of its impact stung his cheek Nor was
HareLip struck though he essayed the passage more slowly

For the rest of the day on the greater heights they lay in a lava glen
where terraced taro and papaia grew And here Grief made his plans and
learned the fulness of the situation

It was ill luck Mauriri said Of all nights this one night was
selected by the white devils to go fishing It was dark as we came
through the passage They were in boats and canoes Always do they have
their rifles with them One Raiatea man they shot Brown was very brave
We tried to get by to the top of the bay but they headed us off and we
were driven in between the Big Rock and the village We saved the guns
and all the ammunition but they got the boat Thus they learned of your
coming Brown is now on this side of the Big Rock with the guns and the
ammunition

But why didnt he go over the top of the Big Rock and give me warning
as I came in from the sea Grief criticised

They knew not the way Only the goats and I know the way And this I
forgot for I crept through the bush to gain the water and swim to you
But the devils were in the bush shooting at Brown and the Raiatea men
and me they hunted till daylight and through the morning they hunted
me there in the lowlying land Then you came in your schooner and they
watched till you went ashore and I got away through the bush but you
were already ashore

You fired that shot

Yes to warn you But they were wise and would not shoot back and it
was my last cartridge

Now you HareLip Grief said to the Valettas cook

His tale was long and painfully detailed For a year he had been sailing
out of Tahiti and through the Paumotus on the Valetta Old Dupuy was
owner and captain On his last cruise he had shipped two strangers in
Tahiti as mate and supercargo Also another stranger he carried to be
his agent on Fanriki Raoul Van Asveld and Carl Lepsius were the names
of the mate and supercargo

They are brothers I know for I have heard them talk in the dark on
deck when they thought no one listened HareLip explained

The Valetta cruised through the Low Islands picking up shell and
pearls at Dupuys stations Frans Amundson the third stranger relieved
Pierre Gollard at Fanriki Pierre Gollard came on board to go back to
Tahiti The natives of Fanriki said he had a quart of pearls to turn
over to Dupuy The first night out from Fanriki there was shooting
in the cabin Then the bodies of Dupuy and Pierre Gollard were thrown
overboard The Tahitian sailors fled to the forecastle For two days
with nothing to eat and the Valetta hove to they remained below Then
Raoul Van Asveld put poison in the meal he made HareLip cook and carry
forard Half the sailors died

He had a rifle pointed at me master what could I do HareLip
whimpered Of the rest two went up the rigging and were shot Fanriki
was ten miles away The others went overboard to swim They were shot
as they swam I only lived and the two devils for me they wanted to
cook for them That day with the breeze they went back to Fanrika and
took on Frans Amundson for he was one of them

Then followed HareLips nightmare experiences as the schooner wandered
on the long reaches to the westward He was the one living witness and
knew they would have killed him had he not been the cook At Noumea five
convicts had joined them HareLip was never permitted ashore at any of
the islands and Grief was the first outsider to whom he had spoken

And now they will kill me HareLip spluttered for they will know
I have told you Yet am I not all a coward and I will stay with you
master and die with you

The Goat Man shook his head and stood up

Lie here and rest he said to Grief It will be a long swim tonight
As for this cookman I will take him now to the higher places where my
brothers live with the goats




IV

It is well that you swim as a man should Big Brother Mauriri
whispered

From the lava glen they had descended to the head of the bay and taken
to the water They swam softly without splash Mauriri in the lead The
black walls of the crater rose about them till it seemed they swam
on the bottom of a great bowl Above was the sky of faintly luminous
stardust Ahead they could see the light which marked the Rattler and
from her deck softened by distance came a gospel hymn played on the
phonograph intended for Pilsach

The two swimmers bore to the left away from the captured schooner
Laughter and song followed on board after the hymn then the phonograph
started again Grief grinned to himself at the appositeness of it as
Lead Kindly Light floated out over the dark water

We must take the passage and land on the Big Rock Mauriri whispered
The devils are holding the low land Listen

Half a dozen rifle shots at irregular intervals attested that Brown
still held the Rock and that the pirates had invested the narrow
peninsula

At the end of another hour they swam under the frowning loom of the Big
Rock Mauriri feeling his way led the landing in a crevice up which
for a hundred feet they climbed to a narrow ledge

Stay here said Mauriri I go to Brown In the morning I shall
return

I will go with you Brother Grief said

Mauriri laughed in the darkness

Even you Big Brother cannot do this thing I am the Goat Man and
I only of all Fuatino can go over the Big Rock in the night
Furthermore it will be the first time that even I have done it Put out
your hand You feel it That is where Pilsachs dynamite is kept Lie
close beside the wall and you may sleep without falling I go now

And high above the sounding surf on a narrow shelf beside a ton of
dynamite David Grief planned his campaign then rested his cheek on his
arm and slept

In the morning when Mauriri led him over the summit of the Big Rock
David Grief understood why he could not have done it in the night
Despite the accustomed nerve of a sailor for height and precarious
clinging he marvelled that he was able to do it in the broad light of
day There were places always under minute direction of Mauriri that
he leaned forward falling across hundredfootdeep crevices until his
outstretched hands struck a grip on the opposing wall and his legs could
then be drawn across after Once there was a tenfoot leap above half
a thousand feet of yawning emptiness and down a fathoms length to a
meagre foothold And he despite his cool head lost it another time on
a shelf a scant twelve inches wide where all handholds seemed to fail
him And Mauriri seeing him sway swung his own body far out and over
the gulf and passed him at the same time striking him sharply on the
back to brace his reeling brain Then it was and forever after that he
fully knew why Mauriri had been named the Goat Man




V

The defence of the Big Rock had its good points and its defects
Impregnable to assault two men could hold it against ten thousand
Also it guarded the passage to open sea The two schooners Raoul Van
Asveld and his cutthroat following were bottled up Grief with the ton
of dynamite which he had removed higher up the rock was master This
he demonstrated one morning when the schooners attempted to put to
sea The Valetta led the whaleboat towing her manned by captured
Fuatino men Grief and the Goat Man peered straight down from a safe
rockshelter three hundred feet above Their rifles were beside them
also a glowing firestick and a big bundle of dynamite sticks with fuses
and decanators attached As the whaleboat came beneath Mauriri shook
his head

They are our brothers We cannot shoot

Forard on the Valetta were several of Griefs own Raiatea sailors
Aft stood another at the wheel The pirates were below or on the other
schooner with the exception of one who stood rifle in hand amidships
For protection he held Naumoo the Queens daughter close to him

That is the chief devil Mauriri whispered and his eyes are blue
like yours He is a terrible man See He holds Naumoo that we may not
shoot him

A light air and a slight tide were making into the passage and the
schooners progress was slow

Do you speak English Grief called down

The man startled half lifted his rifle to the perpendicular and looked
up There was something quick and catlike in his movements and in his
burned blond face a fighting eagerness It was the face of a killer

Yes he answered What do you want

Turn back or Ill blow your schooner up Grief warned He blew on the
firestick and whispered Tell Naumoo to break away from him and run
aft

From the Rattler close astern rifles cracked and bullets spatted
against the rock Van Asveld laughed defiantly and Mauriri called
down in the native tongue to the woman When directly beneath Grief
watching saw her jerk away from the man On the instant Grief touched
the firestick to the matchhead in the split end of the short fuse
sprang into view on the face of the rock and dropped the dynamite Van
Asveld had managed to catch the girl and was struggling with her The
Goat Man held a rifle on him and waited a chance The dynamite struck
the deck in a compact package bounded and rolled into the port
scupper Van Asveld saw it and hesitated then he and the girl ran aft
for their lives The Goat Man fired but splintered the corner of the
galley The spattering of bullets from the Rattler increased and the
two on the rock crouched low for shelter and waited Mauriri tried to
see what was happening below but Grief held him back

The fuse was too long he said Ill know better next time

It was half a minute before the explosion came What happened afterward
for some little time they could not tell for the Rattlers marksmen
had got the range and were maintaining a steady fire Once fanned by a
couple of bullets Grief risked a peep The Valetta her port deck
and rail torn away was listing and sinking as she drifted back into the
harbour Climbing on board the Rattler were the men and the Huahine
women who had been hidden in the Valettas cabin and who had swum for
it under the protecting fire The Fuatino men who had been towing in the
whaleboat had cast off the line dashed back through the passage and
were rowing wildly for the south shore

From the shore of the peninsula the discharges of four rifles announced
that Brown and his men had worked through the jungle to the beach and
were taking a hand The bullets ceased coming and Grief and Mauriri
joined in with their rifles But they could do no damage for the men of
the Rattler were firing from the shelter of the deckhouses while the
wind and tide carried the schooner farther in

There was no sign of the Valetta which had sunk in the deep water of
the crater

Two things Raoul Van Asveld did that showed his keenness and coolness
and that elicited Griefs admiration Under the Rattlers rifle fire
Raoul compelled the fleeing Fuatino men to come in and surrender And at
the same time dispatching half his cutthroats in the Rattlers boat
he threw them ashore and across the peninsula preventing Brown from
getting away to the main part of the island And for the rest of the
morning the intermittent shooting told to Grief how Brown was being
driven in to the other side of the Big Rock The situation was
unchanged with the exception of the loss of the Valetta




VI

The defects of the position on the Big Rock were vital There was
neither food nor water For several nights accompanied by one of the
Raiatea men Mauriri swam to the head of the bay for supplies Then came
the night when lights flared on the water and shots were fired After
that the waterside of the Big Rock was invested as well

Its a funny situation Brown remarked who was getting all the
adventure he had been led to believe resided in the South Seas Weve
got hold and cant let go and Raoul has hold and cant let go He cant
get away and were liable to starve to death holding him

If the rain came the rockbasins would fill said Mauriri It was
their first twentyfour hours without water Big Brother tonight you
and I will get water It is the work of strong men

That night with cocoanut calabashes each of quart capacity and tightly
stoppered he led Grief down to the water from the peninsula side of the
Big Rock They swam out not more than a hundred feet Beyond they could
hear the occasional click of an oar or the knock of a paddle against
a canoe and sometimes they saw the flare of matches as the men in the
guarding boats lighted cigarettes or pipes

Wait here whispered Mauriri and hold the calabashes

Turning over he swam down Grief face downward watched his
phosphorescent track glimmer and dim and vanish A long minute
afterward Mauriri broke surface noiselessly at Griefs side

Here Drink

The calabash was full and Grief drank sweet fresh water which had come
up from the depths of the salt

It flows out from the land said Mauriri

On the bottom

No The bottom is as far below as the mountains are above Fifty feet
down it flows Swim down until you feel its coolness

Several times filling and emptying his lungs in diver fashion Grief
turned over and went down through the water Salt it was to his lips
and warm to his flesh but at last deep down it perceptibly chilled
and tasted brackish Then suddenly his body entered the cold
subterranean stream He removed the small stopper from the calabash
and as the sweet water gurgled into it he saw the phosphorescent
glimmer of a big fish like a sea ghost drift sluggishly by

Thereafter holding the growing weight of the calabashes he remained on
the surface while Mauriri took them down one by one and filled them

There are sharks Grief said as they swam back to shore

Pooh was the answer They are fish sharks We of Fuatino are
brothers to the fish sharks

But the tiger sharks I have seen them here

When they come Big Brother we will have no more water to
drinkunless it rains




VII

A week later Mauriri and a Raiatea man swam back with empty calabashes
The tiger sharks had arrived in the harbour The next day they thirsted
on the Big Rock

We must take our chance said Grief Tonight I shall go after water
with Mautau Tomorrow night Brother you will go with Tehaa

Three quarts only did Grief get when the tiger sharks appeared and
drove them in There were six of them on the Rock and a pint a day in
the sweltering heat of the midtropics is not sufficient moisture for a
mans body The next night Mauriri and Tehaa returned with no water And
the day following Brown learned the full connotation of thirst when the
lips crack to bleeding the mouth is coated with granular slime and the
swollen tongue finds the mouth too small for residence

Grief swam out in the darkness with Mautau Turn by turn they went down
through the salt to the cool sweet stream drinking their fill while
the calabashes were filling It was Mautaus turn to descend with the
last calabash and Grief peering down from the surface saw the glimmer
of seaghosts and all the phosphorescent display of the struggle He
swam back alone but without relinquishing the precious burden of full
calabashes

Of food they had little Nothing grew on the Rock and its sides
covered with shellfish at sea level where the surf thundered in were
too precipitous for access Here and there where crevices permitted a
few rank shellfish and sea urchins were gleaned Sometimes frigate birds
and other sea birds were snared Once with a piece of frigate bird
they succeeded in hooking a shark After that with jealously guarded
sharkmeat for bait they managed on occasion to catch more sharks

But water remained their direst need Mauriri prayed to the Goat
God for rain Taute prayed to the Missionary God and his two fellow
islanders backsliding invoked the deities of their old heathen days
Grief grinned and considered But Brown wildeyed with protruding
blackened tongue cursed Especially he cursed the phonograph that
in the cool twilights ground out gospel hymns from the deck of the
Rattler One hymn in particular Beyond the Smiling and the Weeping
 drove him to madness It seemed a favourite on board the schooner for
it was played most of all Brown hungry and thirsty half out of
his head from weakness and suffering could lie among the rocks with
equanimity and listen to the tinkling of ukuleles and guitars and
the hulas and himines of the Huahine women But when the voices of the
Trinity Choir floated over the water he was beside himself One evening
the cracked tenor took up the song with the machine

     Beyond the smiling and the weeping
        I shall be soon
     Beyond the waking and the sleeping
     Beyond the sowing and the reaping
        I shall be soon
        I shall be soon

Then it was that Brown rose up Again and again blindly he emptied his
rifle at the schooner Laughter floated up from the men and women and
from the peninsula came a splattering of return bullets but the cracked
tenor sang on and Brown continued to fire until the hymn was played
out

It was that night that Grief and Mauriri came back with but one calabash
of water A patch of skin six inches long was missing from Griefs
shoulder in token of the scrape of the sandpaper hide of a shark whose
dash he had eluded





VIII

In the early morning of another day before the sunblaze had gained its
full strength came an offer of a parley from Raoul Van Asveld

Brown brought the word in from the outpost among the rocks a hundred
yards away Grief was squatted over a small fire broiling a strip of
sharkflesh The last twentyfour hours had been lucky Seaweed and sea
urchins had been gathered Tehaa had caught a shark and Mauriri had
captured a fairsized octopus at the base of the crevice where the
dynamite was stored Then too in the darkness they had made two
successful swims for water before the tiger sharks had nosed them out

Said hed like to come in and talk with you Brown said But I know
what the brute is after Wants to see how near starved to death we are

Bring him in Grief said

And then we will kill him the Goat Man cried joyously

Grief shook his head

But he is a killer of men Big Brother a beast and a devil the Goat
Man protested

He must not be killed Brother It is our way not to break our word

It is a foolish way

Still it is our way Grief answered gravely turning the strip of
sharkmeat over on the coals and noting the hungry sniff and look of
Tehaa Dont do that Tehaa when the Big Devil comes Look as if you
and hunger were strangers Here cook those sea urchins you and you
Big Brother cook the squid We will have the Big Devil to feast with
us Spare nothing Cook all

And still broiling meat Grief arose as Raoul Van Asveld followed by a
large Irish terrier strode into camp Raoul did not make the mistake of
holding out his hand

Hello he said Ive heard of you

I wish Id never heard of you Grief answered

Same here was the response At first before I knew who it was
I thought I had to deal with an ordinary trading captain Thats why
youve got me bottled up

And I am ashamed to say that I underrated you Grief smiled I took
you for a thieving beachcomber and not for a really intelligent pirate
and murderer Hence the loss of my schooner Honours are even I fancy
on that score

Raoul flushed angrily under his sunburn but he contained himself His
eyes roved over the supply of food and the full watercalabashes though
he concealed the incredulous surprise he felt His was a tall slender
wellknit figure and Grief studying him estimated his character
from his face The eyes were keen and strong but a bit too close
togethernot pinched however but just a trifle near to balance the
broad forehead the strong chin and jaw and the cheekbones wide apart
Strength His face was filled with it and yet Grief sensed in it the
intangible something the man lacked

We are both strong men Raoul said with a bow We might have been
fighting for empires a hundred years ago

It was Griefs turn to bow

As it is we are squalidly scrapping over the enforcement of the
colonial laws of those empires whose destinies we might possibly have
determined a hundred years ago

It all comes to dust Raoul remarked sententiously sitting down Go
ahead with your meal Dont let me interrupt

Wont you join us was Griefs invitation

The other looked at him with sharp steadiness then accepted

Im sticky with sweat he said Can I wash

Grief nodded and ordered Mauriri to bring a calabash Raoul looked into
the Goat Mans eyes but saw nothing save languid uninterest as the
precious quart of water was wasted on the ground

The dog is thirsty Raoul said

Grief nodded and another calabash was presented to the animal

Again Raoul searched the eyes of the natives and learned nothing

Sorry we have no coffee Grief apologized Youll have to drink plain
water A calabash Tehaa Try some of this shark There is squid to
follow and sea urchins and a seaweed salad Im sorry we havent any
frigate bird The boys were lazy yesterday and did not try to catch
any

With an appetite that would not have stopped at wire nails dipped in
lard Grief ate perfunctorily and tossed the scraps to the dog

Im afraid I havent got down to the primitive diet yet he sighed
as he sat back The tinned goods on the Rattler now I could make a
hearty meal off of them but this muck He took a halfpound strip
of broiled shark and flung it to the dog I suppose Ill come to it if
you dont surrender pretty soon

Raoul laughed unpleasantly

I came to offer terms he said pointedly

Grief shook his head

There arent any terms Ive got you where the hair is short and Im
not going to let go

You think you can hold me in this hole Raoul cried

Youll never leave it alive except in double irons Grief surveyed
his guest with an air of consideration Ive handled your kind before
Weve pretty well cleaned it out of the South Seas But you are ahow
shall I saya sort of an anachronism Youre a throwback and weve
got to get rid of you Personally I would advise you to go back to the
schooner and blow your brains out It is the only way to escape what
youve got coming to you

The parley so far as Raoul was concerned proved fruitless and he went
back into his own lines convinced that the men on the Big Rock could
hold out for years though he would have been swiftly unconvinced could
he have observed Tehaa and the Raiateans the moment his back was
turned and he was out of sight crawling over the rocks and sucking and
crunching the scraps his dog had left uneaten




IX

We hunger now Brother Grief said but it is better than to hunger
for many days to come The Big Devil after feasting and drinking good
water with us in plenty will not stay long in Fuatino Even tomorrow
may he try to leave Tonight you and I sleep over the top of the Rock
and Tehaa who shoots well will sleep with us if he can dare the Rock

Tehaa alone among the Raiateans was cragsman enough to venture the
perilous way and dawn found him in a rockbarricaded nook a hundred
yards to the right of Grief and Mauriri

The first warning was the firing of rifles from the peninsula where
Brown and his two Raiateans signalled the retreat and followed the
besiegers through the jungle to the beach From the eyrie on the face
of the rock Grief could see nothing for another hour when the Rattler
appeared making for the passage As before the captive Fuatino men
towed in the whaleboat Mauriri under direction of Grief called down
instructions to them as they passed slowly beneath By Griefs side
lay several bundles of dynamite sticks welllashed together and with
extremely short fuses

The deck of the Rattler was populous Forard rifle in hand among
the Raiatean sailors stood a desperado whom Mauriri announced was
Raouls brother Aft by the helmsman stood another Attached to him
tied waist to waist with slack was Mataara the old Queen On the
other side of the helmsman his arm in a sling was Captain Glass
Amidships as before was Raoul and with him lashed waist to waist
was Naumoo

Good morning Mister David Grief Raoul called up

And yet I warned you that only in double irons would you leave the
island Grief murmured down with a sad inflection

You cant kill all your people I have on board was the answer

The schooner moving slowly jerk by jerk as the men pulled in the
whaleboat was almost directly beneath The rowers without ceasing
slacked on their oars and were immediately threatened with the rifle of
the man who stood forard

Throw Big Brother Naumoo called up in the Fuatino tongue I am
filled with sorrow and am willed to die His knife is ready with which
to cut the rope but I shall hold him tight Be not afraid Big Brother
Throw and throw straight and goodbye

Grief hesitated then lowered the firestick which he had been blowing
bright

Throw the Goat Man urged

Still Grief hesitated

If they get to sea Big Brother Naumoo dies just the same And there
are all the others What is her life against the many

If you drop any dynamite or fire a single shot well kill all on
board Raoul cried up to them Ive got you David Grief You cant
kill these people and I can Shut up you

This last was addressed to Naumoo who was calling up in her native
tongue and whom Raoul seized by the neck with one hand to choke
to silence In turn she locked both arms about him and looked up
beseechingly to Grief

Throw it Mr Grief and be damned to them Captain Glass rumbled
in his deep voice Theyre bloody murderers and the cabins full of
them

The desperado who was fastened to the old Queen swung half about to
menace Captain Glass with his rifle when Tehaa from his position
farther along the Rock pulled trigger on him The rifle dropped from
the mans hand and on his face was an expression of intense surprise as
his legs crumpled under him and he sank down on deck dragging the Queen
with him

Port Hard a port Grief cried

Captain Glass and the Kanaka whirled the wheel over and the bow of the
Rattler headed in for the Rock Amidships Raoul still struggled with
Naumoo His brother ran from forard to his aid being missed by the
fusillade of quick shots from Tehaa and the Goat Man As Raouls brother
placed the muzzle of his rifle to Naumoos side Grief touched the
firestick to the matchhead in the split end of the fuse Even as with
both hands he tossed the big bundle of dynamite the rifle went off
and Naumoos fall to the deck was simultaneous with the fall of the
dynamite This time the fuse was short enough The explosion occurred
at the instant the deck was reached and that portion of the Rattler
along with Raoul his brother and Naumoo forever disappeared

The schooners side was shattered and she began immediately to settle
Forard every Raiatean sailor dived overboard Captain Glass met the
first man springing up the companionway from the cabin with a kick
full in the face but was overborne and trampled on by the rush
Following the desperadoes came the Huahine women and as they went
overboard the Rattler sank on an even keel close to the base of the
Rock Her crosstrees still stuck out when she reached bottom

Looking down Grief could see all that occurred beneath the surface He
saw Mataara a fathom deep unfasten herself from the dead pirate and
swim upward As her head emerged she saw Captain Glass who could not
swim sinking several yards away The Queen old woman that she was
but an islander turned over swam down to him and held him up as she
struck out for the unsubmerged crosstrees

Five heads blond and brown were mingled with the dark heads of
Polynesia that dotted the surface Grief rifle in hand watched for a
chance to shoot The Goat Man after a minute was successful and they
saw the body of one man sink sluggishly But to the Raiatean sailors
big and brawny half fish was the vengeance given Swimming swiftly
they singled out the blond heads and the brown Those from above watched
the four surviving desperadoes clutched and locked dragged far down
beneath and drowned like curs

In ten minutes everything was over The Huahine women laughing and
giggling were holding on to the sides of the whaleboat which had done
the towing The Raiatean sailors waiting for orders were about the
crosstree to which Captain Glass and Mataara clung

The poor old Rattler Captain Glass lamented

Nothing of the sort Grief answered In a week well have her raised
new timbers amidships and well be on our way And to the Queen How
is it with you Sister

Naumoo is gone and Motauri Brother but Fuatino is ours again The
day is young Word shall be sent to all my people in the high places
with the goats And tonight once again and as never before we shall
feast and rejoice in the Big House

Shes been needing new timbers abaft the beam there for years quoth
Captain Glass But the chronometers will be out of commission for the
rest of the cruise




Chapter FourTHE JOKERS OF NEW GIBBON




I

Im almost afraid to take you in to New Gibbon David Grief said It
wasnt until you and the British gave me a free hand and let the place
alone that any results were accomplished

Wallenstein the German Resident Commissioner from Bougainville poured
himself a long Scotch and soda and smiled

We take off our hats to you Mr Grief he said in perfectly good
English What you have done on the devil island is a miracle And we
shall continue not to interfere It is a devil island and old Koho is
the big chief devil of them all We never could bring him to terms He
is a liar and he is no fool He is a black Napoleon a headhunting
maneating Talleyrand I remember six years ago when I landed there in
the British cruiser The niggers cleared out for the bush of course
but we found several who couldnt get away One was his latest wife She
had been hung up by one arm in the sun for two days and nights We
cut her down but she died just the same And staked out in the fresh
running water up to their necks were three more women All their bones
were broken and their joints crushed The process is supposed to make
them tender for the eating They were still alive Their vitality was
remarkable One woman the oldest lingered nearly ten days Well that
was a sample of Kohos diet No wonder hes a wild beast How you ever
pacified him is our everlasting puzzlement

I wouldnt call him exactly pacified Grief answered Though he comes
in once in a while and eats out of the hand

Thats more than we accomplished with our cruisers Neither the German
nor the English ever laid eyes on him You were the first

No McTavish was the first Grief disclaimed

Ah yes I remember himthe little driedup Scotchman Wallenstein
sipped his whiskey Hes called the Troublemender isnt he

Grief nodded

And they say the screw you pay him is bigger than mine or the British
Residents

Im afraid it is Grief admitted You see and no offence hes
really worth it He spends his time wherever the trouble is He is a
wizard Hes the one who got me my lodgment on New Gibbon Hes down on
Malaita now starting a plantation for me

The first

Theres not even a trading station on all Malaita The recruiters still
use covering boats and carry the old barbed wire above their rails
Theres the plantation now Well be in in half an hour He handed the
binoculars to his guest Those are the boatsheds to the left of the
bungalow Beyond are the barracks And to the right are the coprasheds
We dry quite a bit already Old Kohos getting civilized enough to make
his people bring in the nuts Theres the mouth of the stream where you
found the three women softening

The Wonder wingandwing was headed directly in for the anchorage
She rose and fell lazily over a glassy swell flawed here and there by
catspaws from astern It was the tailend of the monsoon season and the
air was heavy and sticky with tropic moisture the sky a florid leaden
muss of formless clouds The rugged land was swathed with cloudbanks
and squall wreaths through which headlands and interior peaks thrust
darkly On one promontory a slant of sunshine blazed torridly on
another scarcely a mile away a squall was bursting in furious downpour
of driving rain

This was the dank fat savage island of New Gibbon lying fifty miles
to leeward of Choiseul Geographically it belonged to the Solomon
Group Politically the dividing line of German and British
influence cut it in half hence the joint control by the two Resident
Commissioners In the case of New Gibbon this control existed only on
paper in the colonial offices of the two countries There was no real
control at all and never had been The bche de mer fishermen of
the old days had passed it by The sandalwood traders after stern
experiences had given it up The blackbirders had never succeeded in
recruiting one labourer on the island and after the schooner Dorset
had been cut off with all hands they left the place severely alone
Later a German company had attempted a cocoanut plantation which was
abandoned after several managers and a number of contract labourers had
lost their heads German cruisers and British cruisers had failed to
get the savage blacks to listen to reason Four times the missionary
societies had essayed the peaceful conquest of the island and four
times between sickness and massacre they had been driven away More
cruisers more pacifications had followed and followed fruitlessly
The cannibals had always retreated into the bush and laughed at the
screaming shells When the warships left it was an easy matter
to rebuild the burned grass houses and set up the ovens in the
oldfashioned way

New Gibbon was a large island fully one hundred and fifty miles long
and half as broad

Its windward coast was ironbound without anchorages or inlets and it
was inhabited by scores of warring tribesat least it had been
until Koho had arisen like a Kamehameha and by force of arms and
considerable statecraft firmly welded the greater portion of the tribes
into a confederation His policy of permitting no intercourse with white
men had been eminently right so far as survival of his own people was
concerned and after the visit of the last cruiser he had had his own
way until David Grief and McTavish the Troublemender landed on the
deserted beach where once had stood the German bungalow and barracks and
the various English missionhouses

Followed wars false peaces and more wars The weazened little
Scotchman could make trouble as well as mend it and not content with
holding the beach he imported bushmen from Malaita and invaded the
wildpig runs of the interior jungle He burned villages until Koho
wearied of rebuilding them and when he captured Kohos eldest son he
compelled a conference with the old chief It was then that McTavish
laid down the rate of headexchange For each head of his own people
he promised to take ten of Kohos After Koho had learned that the
Scotchman was a man of his word the first true peace was made In
the meantime McTavish had built the bungalow and barracks cleared the
jungleland along the beach and laid out the plantation After that
he had gone on his way to mend trouble on the atoll of Tasman where
a plague of black measles had broken out and been ascribed to Griefs
plantation by the devildevil doctors Once a year later he had been
called back again to straighten up New Gibbon and Koho after paying a
forced fine of two hundred thousand cocoanuts decided it was cheaper
to keep the peace and sell the nuts Also the fires of his youth
had burned down He was getting old and limped of one leg where a
LeeEnfield bullet had perforated the calf




II

I knew a chap in Hawaii Grief said superintendent of a sugar
plantation who used a hammer and a tenpenny nail

They were sitting on the broad bungalow veranda and watching Worth the
manager of New Gibbon doctoring the sick squad They were New Georgia
boys a dozen of them and the one with the aching tooth had been put
back to the last Worth had just failed in his first attempt He wiped
the sweat from his forehead with one hand and waved the forceps with the
other

And broke more than one jaw he asserted grimly

Grief shook his head Wallenstein smiled and elevated his brows

He said not at any rate Grief qualified He assured me
furthermore that he always succeeded on the first trial

I saw it done when I was second mate on a limejuicer Captain Ward
spoke up The old man used a caulking mallet and a steel marlinspike
He took the tooth out with the first stroke too clean as a whistle

Me for the forceps Worth muttered grimly inserting his own pair in
the mouth of the black As he pulled the man groaned and rose in the
air Lend a hand somebody and hold him down the manager appealed

Grief and Wallenstein on either side gripped the black and held him
And he in turn struggled against them and clenched his teeth on the
forceps The group swayed back and forth Such exertion in the stagnant
heat brought the sweat out on all of them The black sweated too but
his was the sweat of excruciating pain The chair on which he sat was
overturned Captain Ward paused in the act of pouring himself a drink
and called encouragement Worth pleaded with his assistants to hang
on and hung on himself twisting the tooth till it crackled and then
attempting a straightaway pull

Nor did any of them notice the little black man who limped up the steps
and stood looking on Koho was a conservative His fathers before him
had worn no clothes and neither did he not even a geestring The many
empty perforations in nose and lips and ears told of decorative passions
long since dead The holes on both earlobes had been torn out but
their size was attested by the strips of withered flesh that hung down
and swept his shoulders He cared now only for utility and in one of
the half dozen minor holes in his right ear he carried a short clay
pipe Around his waist was buckled a cheap tradebelt and between the
imitation leather and the naked skin was thrust the naked blade of a
long knife Suspended from the belt was his bamboo betelnut and lime
box In his hand was a shortbarrelled largebore Snider rifle He
was indescribably filthy and here and there marred by scars the worst
being the one left by the LeeEnfield bullet which had withered the
calf to half the size of its mate His shrunken mouth showed that few
teeth were left to serve him Face and body were shrunken and withered
but his black beadlike eyes small and close together were very
bright withal they were restless and querulous and more like a
monkeys than a mans

He looked on grinning like a shrewd little ape His joy in the torment
of the patient was natural for the world he lived in was a world of
pain He had endured his share of it and inflicted far more than his
share on others When the tooth parted from its locked hold in the jaw
and the forceps raked across the other teeth and out of the mouth with a
nerverasping sound old Kohos eyes fairly sparkled and he looked
with glee at the poor black collapsed on the veranda floor and groaning
terribly as he held his head in both his hands

I think hes going to faint Grief said bending over the victim
Captain Ward give him a drink please Youd better take one yourself
Worth youre shaking like a leaf

And I think Ill take one said Wallenstein wiping the sweat from his
face His eye caught the shadow of Koho on the floor and followed it up
to the old chief himself Hello whos this

Hello Koho Grief said genially though he knew better than to offer
to shake hands

It was one of Kohos tambos given him by the devildevil doctors when
he was born that never was his flesh to come in contact with the flesh
of a white man Worth and Captain Ward of the Wonder greeted Koho
but Worth frowned at sight of the Snider for it was one of his tambos
that no visiting bushman should carry a weapon on the plantation Rifles
had a nasty way of going off at the hip under such circumstances The
manager clapped his hands and a black houseboy recruited from San
Cristobal came running At a sign from Worth he took the rifle from
the visitors hand and carried it inside the bungalow

Koho Grief said introducing the German Resident this big fella
marster belong Bougainvillemy word big fella marster too much

Koho remembering the visits of the various German cruisers smiled with
a light of unpleasant reminiscence in his eyes

Dont shake hands with him Wallenstein Grief warned Tambo you
know Then to Koho My word you get m too much fat stop along you
Bime by you marry along new fella Mary eh

Too old fella me Koho answered with a weary shake of the head Me
no like m Mary Me no like m kaikai food Close up me die along
altogether He stole a significant glance at Worth whose head was
tilted back to a long glass Me like m rum

Grief shook his head

Tambo along black fella

He black fella no tambo Koho retorted nodding toward the groaning
labourer

He fella sick Grief explained

Me fella sick

You fella big liar Grief laughed Rum tambo all the time tambo
Now Koho we have big fella talk along this big fella marster

And he and Wallenstein and the old chief sat down on the veranda to
confer about affairs of state Koho was complimented on the peace he
had kept and he with many protestations of his aged decrepitude swore
peace again and everlasting Then was discussed the matter of starting a
German plantation twenty miles down the coast The land of course was
to be bought from Koho and the price was arranged in terms of tobacco
knives beads pipes hatchets porpoise teeth and shellmoneyin terms
of everything except rum While the talk went on Koho glancing through
the window could see Worth mixing medicines and placing bottles back in
the medicine cupboard Also he saw the manager complete his labours by
taking a drink of Scotch Koho noted the bottle carefully And though
he hung about for an hour after the conference was over there was never
a moment when some one or another was not in the room When Grief and
Worth sat down to a business talk Koho gave it up

Me go along schooner he announced then turned and limped out

How are the mighty fallen Grief laughed To think that used to be
Koho the fiercest redhanded murderer in the Solomons who defied all
his life two of the greatest world powers And now hes going aboard to
try and cadge Denby for a drink




III

For the last time in his life the supercargo of the Wonder perpetrated
a practical joke on a native He was in the main cabin checking off the
list of goods being landed in the whaleboats when Koho limped down the
companionway and took a seat opposite him at the table

Close up me die along altogether was the burden of the old chiefs
plaint All the delights of the flesh had forsaken him Me no like
m Mary Me no like m kaikai Me too much sick fella Me close up
finish A long sad pause in which his face expressed unutterable
concern for his stomach which he patted gingerly and with an assumption
of pain Belly belong me too much sick Another pause which was an
invitation to Denby to make suggestions Then followed a long weary
final sigh and a Me like m rum

Denby laughed heartlessly He had been cadged for drinks before by the
old cannibal and the sternest tambo Grief and McTavish had laid down
was the one forbidding alcohol to the natives of New Gibbon

The trouble was that Koho had acquired the taste In his younger days
he had learned the delights of drunkenness when he cut off the schooner
Dorset but unfortunately he had learned it along with all his
tribesmen and the supply had not held out long Later when he led his
naked warriors down to the destruction of the German plantation he was
wiser and he appropriated all the liquors for his sole use The result
had been a gorgeous mixed drunk on a dozen different sorts of drink
ranging from beer doctored with quinine to absinthe and apricot brandy
The drunk had lasted for months and it had left him with a thirst that
would remain with him until he died Predisposed toward alcohol after
the way of savages all the chemistry of his flesh clamoured for it
This craving was to him expressed in terms of tingling and sensation of
maggots crawling warmly and deliciously in his brain of good feeling
and well being and high exultation And in his barren old age when
women and feasting were a weariness and when old hates had smouldered
down he desired more and more the revivifying fire that came liquid out
of bottlesout of all sorts of bottlesfor he remembered them well
He would sit in the sun for hours occasionally drooling in mournful
contemplation of the great orgy which had been his when the German
plantation was cleaned out

Denby was sympathetic He sought out the old chiefs symptoms and
offered him dyspeptic tablets from the medicine chest pills and
a varied assortment of harmless tabloids and capsules But Koho
steadfastly declined Once when he cut the Dorset off he had bitten
through a capsule of quinine in addition two of his warriors had
partaken of a white powder and laid down and died very violently in a
very short time No he did not believe in drugs But the liquids from
bottles the coolflaming youthgivers and warmglowing dreammakers No
wonder the white men valued them so highly and refused to dispense them

Rum he good fella he repeated over and over plaintively and with the
weary patience of age

And then Denby made his mistake and played his joke Stepping around
behind Koho he unlocked the medicine closet and took out a fourounce
bottle labelled essence of mustard As he made believe to draw the
cork and drink of the contents in the mirror on the forard bulkhead he
glimpsed Koho twisted half around intently watching him Denby smacked
his lips and cleared his throat appreciatively as he replaced the
bottle Neglecting to relock the medicine closet he returned to his
chair and after a decent interval went on deck He stood beside the
companionway and listened After several moments the silence below was
broken by a fearful wheezing propulsive strangling cough He smiled
to himself and returned leisurely down the companionway The bottle was
back on the shelf where it belonged and the old man sat in the same
position Denby marvelled at his iron control Mouth and lips and
tongue and all sensitive membranes were a blaze of fire He gasped
and nearly coughed several times while involuntary tears brimmed in
his eyes and ran down his cheeks An ordinary man would have coughed and
strangled for half an hour But old Kohos face was grimly composed It
dawned on him that a trick had been played and into his eyes came an
expression of hatred and malignancy so primitive so abysmal that it
sent the chills up and down Denbys spine Koho arose proudly

Me go along he said You sing out one fella boat stop along me




IV

Having seen Grief and Worth start for a ride over the plantation
Wallenstein sat down in the big livingroom and with gunoil and old
rags proceeded to take apart and clean his automatic pistol On the
table beside him stood the inevitable bottle of Scotch and numerous soda
bottles Another bottle part full chanced to stand there It was also
labelled Scotch but its content was liniment which Worth had mixed for
the horses and neglected to put away

As Wallenstein worked he glanced through the window and saw Koho coming
up the compound path He was limping very rapidly but when he came
along the veranda and entered the room his gait was slow and dignified
He sat down and watched the guncleaning Though mouth and lips and
tongue were afire he gave no sign At the end of five minutes he spoke

Rum he good fella Me like m rum Wallenstein smiled and shook his
head and then it was that his perverse imp suggested what was to be his
last joke on a native The similarity of the two bottles was the real
suggestion He laid his pistol parts on the table and mixed himself
a long drink Standing as he did between Koho and the table he
interchanged the two bottles drained his glass made as if to search
for something and left the room From outside he heard the surprised
splutter and cough but when he returned the old chief sat as before
The liniment in the bottle however was lower and it still oscillated

Koho stood up clapped his hands and when the houseboy answered
signed that he desired his rifle The boy fetched the weapon and
according to custom preceded the visitor down the pathway Not
until outside the gate did the boy turn the rifle over to its owner
Wallenstein chuckling to himself watched the old chief limp along the
beach in the direction of the river

A few minutes later as he put his pistol together Wallenstein heard
the distant report of a gun For the instant he thought of Koho then
dismissed the conjecture from his mind Worth and Grief had taken
shotguns with them and it was probably one of their shots at a pigeon
Wallenstein lounged back in his chair chuckled twisted his yellow
mustache and dozed He was aroused by the excited voice of Worth
crying out

Ring the big fella bell Ring plenty too much Ring like hell

Wallenstein gained the veranda in time to see the manager jump his horse
over the low fence of the compound and dash down the beach after Grief
who was riding madly ahead A loud crackling and smoke rising through
the cocoanut trees told the story The boathouses and the barracks
were on fire The big plantation bell was ringing wildly as the German
Resident ran down the beach and he could see whaleboats hastily putting
off from the schooner

Barracks and boathouses grassthatched and like tinder were wrapped
in flames Grief emerged from the kitchen carrying a naked black child
by the leg Its head was missing

The cooks in there he told Worth Her heads gone too She was too
heavy and I had to clear out

It was my fault Wallenstein said Old Koho did it But I let him
take a drink of Worths horse liniment

I guess hes headed for the bush Worth said springing astride his
horse and starting Oliver is down there by the river Hope he didnt
get him

The manager galloped away through the trees A few minutes later as
the charred wreck of the barracks crashed in they heard him calling and
followed On the edge of the river bank they came upon him He still sat
on his horse very whitefaced and gazed at something on the ground It
was the body of Oliver the young assistant manager though it was hard
to realize it for the head was gone The black labourers breathless
from their run in from the fields were now crowding around and under
conches tonight and the wardrums all merry hell will break loose
They wont rush us but keep all the boys close up to the house Mr
Worth Come on

As they returned along the path they came upon a black who whimpered and
cried vociferously

Shut up mouth belong you Worth shouted What name you make m
noise

Him fella Koho finish along two fella bullamacow the black answered
drawing a forefinger significantly across his throat

Hes knifed the cows Grief said That means no more milk for some
time for you Worth Ill see about sending a couple up from Ugi

Wallenstein proved inconsolable until Denby coming ashore confessed
to the dose of essence of mustard Thereat the German Resident became
even cheerful though he twisted his yellow mustache up more fiercely
and continued to curse the Solomons with oaths culled from four
languages

Next morning visible from the masthead of the Wonder the bush
was alive with signalsmokes From promontory to promontory and back
through the solid jungle the smokepillars curled and puffed and
talked Remote villages on the higher peaks beyond the farthest raids
McTavish had ever driven joined in the troubled conversation From
across the river persisted a bedlam of conches while from everywhere
drifting for miles along the quiet air came the deep booming
reverberations of the great wardrumshuge tree trunks hollowed by
fire and carved with tools of stone and shell Youre all right as long
as you stay close Grief told his manager Ive got to get along
to Guvutu They wont come out in the open and attack you Keep the
workgangs close Stop the clearing till this blows over Theyll get
any detached gangs you send out And whatever you do dont be fooled
into going into the bush after Koho If you do hell get you All
youve got to do is wait for McTavish Ill send him up with a bunch of
his Malaita bushmen Hes the only man who can go inside Also until
he comes Ill leave Denby with you You dont mind do you Mr Denby
Ill send McTavish up with the Wanda and you can go back on her and
rejoin the Wonder Captain Ward can manage without you for a trip

It was just what I was going to volunteer Denby answered I never
dreamed all this muss would be kicked up over a joke You see in a way
I consider myself responsible for it

So am I responsible Wallenstein broke in

But I started it the supercargo urged

Maybe you did but I carried it along

And Koho finished it Grief said

At any rate I too shall remain said the German

I thought you were coming to Guvutu with me Grief protested

I was But this is my jurisdiction partly and I have made a fool of
myself in it completely I shall remain and help get things straight
again

At Guvutu Grief sent full instructions to McTavish by a recruiting
ketch which was just starting for Malaita Captain Ward sailed in the
Wonder for the Santa Cruz Islands and Grief borrowing a whaleboat
and a crew of black prisoners from the British Resident crossed the
channel to Guadalcanar to examine the grass lands back of Penduffryn

Three weeks later with a free sheet and a lusty breeze he threaded the
coral patches and surged up the smooth water to Guvutu anchorage The
harbour was deserted save for a small ketch which lay close in to the
shore reef Grief recognized it as the Wanda She had evidently just
got in by the Tulagi Passage for her black crew was still at work
furling the sails As he rounded alongside McTavish himself extended a
hand to help him over the rail

Whats the matter Grief asked Havent you started yet

McTavish nodded And got back Everythings all right on board

Hows New Gibbon

All there the last I saw of it barrin a few inconsequential frills
that a good eye could make out lacking from the landscape

He was a cold flame of a man small as Koho and as dried up with a
mahogany complexion and small expressionless blue eyes that were more
like gimletpoints than the eyes of a Scotchman Without fear without
enthusiasm impervious to disease and climate and sentiment he was lean
and bitter and deadly as a snake That his present sour look boded ill
news Grief was well aware

Spit it out he said Whats happened

Tis a thing severely to be condemned a damned shame this joking with
heathen niggers was the reply Also tis very expensive Come below
Mr Grief Youll be better for the information with a long glass in
your hand After you

How did you settle things his employer demanded as soon as they were
seated in the cabin

The little Scotchman shook his head There was nothing to settle It
all depends how you look at it The other way would be to say it was
settled entirely settled mind you before I got there

But the plantation man The plantation

No plantation All the years of our work have gone for naught Tis
back where we started where the missionaries started where the Germans
startedand where they finished Not a stone stands on another at the
landing pier The houses are black ashes Every tree is hacked down and
the wild pigs are rooting out the yams and sweet potatoes Those boys
from New Georgia a fine bunch they were five score of them and they
cost you a pretty penny Not one is left to tell the tale

He paused and began fumbling in a large locker under the
companionsteps

But Worth And Denby And Wallenstein

Thats what Im telling you Take a look

McTavish dragged out a sack made of rice matting and emptied its
contents on the floor David Grief pulled himself together with a jerk
for he found himself gazing fascinated at the heads of the three men he
had left at New Gibbon The yellow mustache of Wallenstein had lost its
fierce curl and drooped and wilted on the upper lip

I dont know how it happened the Scotchmans voice went on drearily
But I surmise they went into the bush after the old devil

And where is Koho Grief asked

Back in the bush and drunk as a lord Thats how I was able to recover
the heads He was too drunk to stand They lugged him on their backs out
of the village when I rushed it And if youll relieve me of the heads
Ill be well obliged He paused and sighed I suppose theyll have
regular funerals over them and put them in the ground But in my way of
thinking theyd make excellent curios Any respectable museum would pay
a hundred quid apiece Better have another drink Youre looking a bit
pale There put that down you and if youll take my advice Mr
Grief I would say set your face sternly against any joking with
the niggers It always makes trouble and it is a very expensive
divertisement





Chapter FiveA LITTLE ACCOUNT WITH SWITHIN HALL




I

With a last long scrutiny at the unbroken circle of the sea David Grief
swung out of the crosstrees and slowly and dejectedly descended the
ratlines to the deck

LeuLeu Atoll is sunk Mr Snow he said to the anxiousfaced young
mate If there is anything in navigation the atoll is surely under the
sea for weve sailed clear over it twiceor the spot where it ought to
be Its either that or the chronometers gone wrong or Ive forgotten
my navigation

It must be the chronometer sir the mate reassured his owner You
know I made separate sights and worked them up and that they agreed
with yours

Yes Grief muttered nodding glumly and where your Summer lines
crossed and mine too was the dead centre of LeuLeu Atoll It must be
the chronometerslipped a cog or something

He made a short pace to the rail and back and cast a troubled eye at
the Uncle Tobys wake The schooner with a fairly strong breeze on
her quarter was logging nine or ten knots

Better bring her up on the wind Mr Snow Put her under easy sail and
let her work to windward on twohour legs Its thickening up and I
dont imagine we can get a star observation tonight so well just hold
our weather position get a latitude sight tomorrow and run LeuLeu
down on her own latitude Thats the way all the old navigators did

Broad of beam heavily sparred with high freeboard and bluff Dutchy
bow the Uncle Toby was the slowest tubbiest safest and most
foolproof schooner David Grief possessed Her run was in the Banks and
Santa Cruz groups and to the northwest among the several isolated atolls
where his native traders collected copra hawksbill turtle and
an occasional ton of pearl shell Finding the skipper down with a
particularly bad stroke of fever Grief had relieved him and taken the
Uncle Toby on her semiannual run to the atolls He had elected to make
his first call at LeuLeu which lay farthest and now found himself
lost at sea with a chronometer that played tricks




II

No stars showed that night nor was the sun visible next day A stuffy
sticky calm obtained broken by big windsqualls and heavy downpours
From fear of working too far to windward the Uncle Toby was hove to
and four days and nights of cloudhidden sky followed Never did the sun
appear and on the several occasions that stars broke through they were
too dim and fleeting for identification By this time it was patent to
the veriest tyro that the elements were preparing to break loose Grief
coming on deck from consulting the barometer which steadfastly remained
at  encountered JackieJackie whose face was as brooding
and troublous as the sky and air JackieJackie a Tongan sailor of
experience served as a sort of bosun and semisecond mate over the
mixed Kanaka crew

Big weather he come I think he said I see him just the same before
maybe five six times

Grief nodded Hurricane weather all right JackieJackie Pretty soon
barometer go downbottom fall out

Sure the Tongan concurred He goin to blow like hell

Ten minutes later Snow came on deck

Shes started he said  going down and pumping at the same
time Its stinking hotdont you notice it He brushed his forehead
with his hands Its sickening I could lose my breakfast without
trying

JackieJackie grinned Just the same me Everything inside walk about
Always this way before big blow But Uncle Toby all right He go
through anything

Better rig that stormtrysail on the main and a stormjib Grief said
to the mate And put all the reefs into the working canvas before you
furl down No telling what we may need Put on double gaskets while
youre about it

In another hour the sultry oppressiveness steadily increasing and the
stark calm still continuing the barometer had fallen to  The
mate being young lacked the patience of waiting for the portentous He
ceased his restless pacing and waved his arms

If shes going to come let her come he cried Theres no use
shillyshallying this way Whatever the worst is let us know it and
have it A pretty picklelost with a crazy chronometer and a hurricane
that wont blow

The cloudmussed sky turned to a vague copper colour and seemed to
glow as the inside of a huge heated caldron Nobody remained below The
native sailors formed in anxious groups amidships and forard where
they talked in low voices and gazed apprehensively at the ominous
sky and the equally ominous sea that breathed in long low oily
undulations

Looks like petroleum mixed with castor oil the mate grumbled as he
spat his disgust overside My mother used to dose me with messes like
that when I was a kid Lord shes getting black

The lurid coppery glow had vanished and the sky thickened and lowered
until the darkness was as that of a late twilight David Grief who
well knew the hurricane rules nevertheless reread the Laws of Storms
 screwing his eyes in the faint light in order to see the print There
was nothing to be done save wait for the wind so that he might know
how he lay in relation to the fastflying and deadly centre that from
somewhere was approaching out of the gloom

It was three in the afternoon and the glass had sunk to  when
the wind came They could see it on the water darkening the face of the
sea crisping tiny whitecaps as it rushed along It was merely a stiff
breeze and the Uncle Toby filling away under her storm canvas till
the wind was abeam sloshed along at a fourknot gait

No weight to that Snow sneered And after such grand preparation

Pickaninny wind JackieJackie agreed He grow big man pretty quick
you see

Grief ordered the foresail put on retaining the reefs and the Uncle
Toby mended her pace in the rising breeze The wind quickly grew to
mans size but did not stop there It merely blew hard and harder and
kept on blowing harder advertising each increase by lulls followed by
fierce freshening gusts Ever it grew until the Uncle Tobys rail
was more often pressed under than not while her waist boiled with
foaming water which the scuppers could not carry off Grief studied the
barometer still steadily falling

The centre is to the southward he told Snow and were running
across its path and into it Now well turn about and run the other way
That ought to bring the glass up Take in the foresailits more than
she can carry alreadyand stand by to wear her around

The maneuver was accomplished and through the gloom that was almost
that of the first darkness of evening the Uncle Toby turned and raced
madly north across the face of the storm

Its nip and tuck Grief confided to the mate a couple of hours
later The storms swinging a big curvetheres no calculating that
curveand we may win across or the centre may catch us Thank the Lord
the glass is holding its own It all depends on how big the curve is
The seas too big for us to keep on Heave her to Shell keep working
along out anyway

I thought I knew what wind was Snow shouted in his owners ear next
morning This isnt wind Its something unthinkable Its impossible
It must reach ninety or a hundred miles an hour in the gusts That dont
mean anything How could I ever tell it to anybody I couldnt And look
at that sea Ive run my Easting down but I never saw anything like
that

Day had come and the sun should have been up an hour yet the best
it could produce was a sombre semitwilight The ocean was a stately
procession of moving mountains A third of a mile across yawned the
valleys between the great waves Their long slopes shielded somewhat
from the full fury of the wind were broken by systems of smaller
whitecapping waves but from the high crests of the big waves themselves
the wind tore the whitecaps in the forming This spume drove masthead
high and higher horizontally above the surface of the sea

Were through the worst was Griefs judgment The glass is coming
along all the time The sea will get bigger as the wind eases down Im
going to turn in Watch for shifts in the wind Theyll be sure to come
Call me at eight bells

By midafternoon in a huge sea with the wind after its last shift no
more than a stiff breeze the Tongan bosun sighted a schooner bottom
up The Uncle Tobys drift took them across the bow and they could
not make out the name but before night they picked up with a small
roundbottom doubleender boat swamped but with white lettering
visible on its bow Through the binoculars Gray made out Emily L No


A sealing schooner Grief said But what a sealers doing in these
waters is beyond me

Treasurehunters maybe Snow speculated The Sophie Sutherland and
the Herman were sealers you remember chartered out of San Francisco
by the chaps with the maps who can always go right to the spot until
they get there and dont




III

After a giddy night of grand and lofty tumbling in which over a big
and dying sea without a breath of wind to steady her the Uncle Toby
rolled every person on board sick of soul a light breeze sprang up
and the reefs were shaken out By midday on a smooth ocean floor the
clouds thinned and cleared and sights of the sun were obtained Two
degrees and fifteen minutes south the observation gave them With a
broken chronometer longitude was out of the question

Were anywhere within five hundred and a thousand miles along that
latitude line Grief remarked as he and the mate bent over the chart

LeuLeu is to the southard somewhere and this section of ocean is all
blank There is neither an island nor a reef by which we can regulate
the chronometer The only thing to do

Land ho skipper the Tongan called down the companionway

Grief took a quick glance at the empty blank of the chart whistled his
surprise and sank back feebly in a chair

It gets me he said There cant be land around here We never
drifted or ran like that The whole voyage has been crazy Will you
kindly go up Mr Snow and see whats ailing Jackie

Its land all right the mate called down a minute afterward You can
see it from the decktops of cocoanutsan atoll of some sort Maybe
its LeuLeu after all

Grief shook his head positively as he gazed at the fringe of palms only
the tops visible apparently rising out of the sea

Haul up on the wind Mr Snow closeandby and well take a look
We can just reach past to the south and if it spreads off in that
direction well hit the southwest corner

Very near must palms be to be seen from the low deck of a schooner and
slowly as the Uncle Toby sailed she quickly raised the low land above
the sea while more palms increased the definition of the atoll circle

Shes a beauty the mate remarked A perfect circle Looks as if
it might be eight or nine miles across Wonder if theres an entrance
to the lagoon Who knows Maybe its a brand new find

They coasted up the west side of the atoll making short tacks in to
the surfpounded coral rock and out again From the masthead across
the palmfringe a Kanaka announced the lagoon and a small island in the
middle

I know what youre thinking Grief said to his mate

Snow who had been muttering and shaking his head looked up with quick
and challenging incredulity

Youre thinking the entrance will be on the northwest Grief went on
as if reciting

Two cable lengths wide marked on the north by three separated
cocoanuts and on the south by pandanus trees Eight miles in diameter
a perfect circle with an island in the dead centre

I was thinking that Snow acknowledged

And theres the entrance opening up just where it ought to be

And the three palms Snow almost whispered and the pandanus trees
If theres a windmill on the island its itSwithin Halls island But
it cant be Everybodys been looking for it for the last ten years

Hall played you a dirty trick once didnt he Grief queried

Snow nodded Thats why Im working for you He broke me flat It was
downright robbery I bought the wreck of the Cascade down in Sydney
out of a first instalment of a legacy from home

She went on Christmas Island didnt she

Yes full tilt high and dry in the night They saved the passengers
and mails Then I bought a little island schooner which took the rest
of my money and I had to wait the final payment by the executors to fit
her out What did Swithin Hall dohe was at Honolulu at the timebut
make a straightaway run for Christmas Island Neither right nor title
did he have When I got there the hull and engines were all that was
left of the Cascade She had had a fair shipment of silk on board
too And it wasnt even damaged I got it afterward pretty straight from
his supercargo He cleared something like sixty thousand dollars

Snow shrugged his shoulders and gazed bleakly at the smooth surface of
the lagoon where tiny wavelets danced in the afternoon sun

The wreck was mine I bought her at public auction Id gambled big
and Id lost When I got back to Sydney the crew and some of the
tradesmen whod extended me credit libelled the schooner I pawned
my watch and sextant and shovelled coal one spell and finally got a
billet in the New Hebrides on a screw of eight pounds a month Then I
tried my luck as independent trader went broke took a mates billet on
a recruiter down to Tanna and over to Fiji got a job as overseer on a
German plantation back of Apia and finally settled down on the Uncle
Toby

Have you ever met Swithin Hall

Snow shook his head

Well youre likely to meet him now Theres the windmill

In the centre of the lagoon as they emerged from the passage they
opened a small densely wooded island among the trees of which a large
Dutch windmill showed plainly

Nobody at home from the looks of it Grief said or you might have a
chance to collect

The mates face set vindictively and his fists clenched

Cant touch him legally Hes got too much money now But I can take
sixty thousand dollars worth out of his hide I hope he is at home

Then I hope he is too Grief said with an appreciative smile You
got the description of his island from BauOti I suppose

Yes as pretty well everybody else has The trouble is that BauOti
cant give latitude or longitude Says they sailed a long way from the
Gilbertsthats all he knows I wonder what became of him

I saw him a year ago on the beach at Tahiti Said he was thinking about
shipping for a cruise through the Paumotus Well here we are getting
close in Heave the lead JackieJackie Stand by to let go Mr Snow
According to BauOti anchorage three hundred yards off the west shore
in nine fathoms coral patches to the southeast There are the patches
What do you get Jackie

Nine fadom

Let go Mr Snow

The Uncle Toby swung to her chain headsails ran down and the Kanaka
crew sprang to fore and mainhalyards and sheets




IV

The whaleboat laid alongside the small coralstone landingpier and
David Grief and his mate stepped ashore

Youd think the place deserted Grief said as they walked up a sanded
path to the bungalow But I smell a smell that Ive often smelled
Something doing or my nose is a liar The lagoon is carpeted with
shell Theyre rotting the meat out not a thousand miles away Get that
whiff

Like no bungalow in the tropics was this bungalow of Swithin Hall Of
mission architecture when they had entered through the unlatched screen
door they found decoration and furniture of the same mission style The
floor of the big livingroom was covered with the finest Samoan mats
There were couches window seats cozy corners and a billiard table A
sewing table and a sewingbasket spilling over with sheer linen in the
French embroidery of which stuck a needle tokened a womans presence
By screen and veranda the blinding sunshine was subdued to a cool dim
radiance The sheen of pearl pushbuttons caught Griefs eye

Storage batteries by George run by the windmill he exclaimed as he
pressed the buttons And concealed lighting

Hidden bowls glowed and the room was filled with diffused golden light
Many shelves of books lined the walls Grief fell to running over
their titles A fairly wellread man himself for a seaadventurer he
glimpsed a wideness of range and catholicity of taste that were beyond
him Old friends he met and others that he had heard of but never read
There were complete sets of Tolstoy Turgenieff and Gorky of Cooper
and Mark Twain of Hugo and Zola and Sue and of Flaubert De
Maupassant and Paul de Koch He glanced curiously at the pages of
Metchnikoff Weininger and Schopenhauer and wonderingly at those
of Ellis Lydston KrafftEbbing and Forel Woodruffs Expansion of
Races was in his hands when Snow returned from further exploration of
the house

Enamelled bathtub separate room for a shower and a sitzbath he
exclaimed Fitted up for a king And I reckon some of my money went to
pay for it The place must be occupied I found freshopened butter and
milk tins in the pantry and fresh turtlemeat hanging up Im going to
see what else I can find

Grief too departed through a door that led out of the opposite end
of the livingroom He found himself in a selfevident womans bedroom
Across it he peered through a wiremesh door into a screened and
darkened sleeping porch On a couch lay a woman asleep In the soft
light she seemed remarkably beautiful in a dark Spanish way By her
side opened and face downward a novel lay on a chair From the
colour in her cheeks Grief concluded that she had not been long in the
tropics After the one glimpse he stole softly back in time to see Snow
entering the livingroom through the other door By the naked arm he was
clutching an agewrinkled black who grinned in fear and made signs of
dumbness

I found him snoozing in a little kennel out back the mate said Hes
the cook I suppose Cant get a word out of him What did you find

A sleeping princess Ssh Theres somebody now

If its Hall Snow muttered clenching his fist

Grief shook his head No roughhouse Theres a woman here And if it
is Hall before we go Ill maneuver a chance for you to get action

The door opened and a large heavily built man entered In his belt was
a heavy longbarrelled Colts One quick anxious look he gave them
then his face wreathed in a genial smile and his hand was extended

Welcome strangers But if you dont mind my asking how by all thats
sacred did you ever manage to find my island

Because we were out of our course Grief answered shaking hands

My names Hall Swithin Hall the other said turning to shake Snows
hand And I dont mind telling you that youre the first visitors Ive
ever had

And this is your secret island thats had all the beaches talking for
years Grief answered Well I know the formula now for finding it

Hows that Hall asked quickly

Smash your chronometer get mixed up with a hurricane and then keep
your eyes open for cocoanuts rising out of the sea

And what is your name Hall asked after he had laughed perfunctorily

AnsteyPhil Anstey Grief answered promptly Bound on the Uncle
Toby from the Gilberts to New Guinea and trying to find my longitude
This is my mate Mr Gray a better navigator than I but who has lost
his goat just the same to the chronometer

Grief did not know his reason for lying but he had felt the prompting
and succumbed to it He vaguely divined that something was wrong but
could not place his finger on it Swithin Hall was a fat roundfaced
man with a laughing lip and laughterwrinkles in the corners of his
eyes But Grief in his early youth had learned how deceptive this type
could prove as well as the deceptiveness of blue eyes that screened the
surface with fun and hid what went on behind

What are you doing with my cooklost yours and trying to shanghai
him Hall was saying Youd better let him go if youre going to have
any supper My wifes here and shell be glad to meet youdinner she
calls it and calls me down for misnaming it but Im old fashioned My
folks always ate dinner in the middle of the day Cant get over early
training Dont you want to wash up I do Look at me Ive been working
like a dogout with the diving crewshell you know But of course you
smelt it

Snow pleaded charge of the schooner and went on board In addition to
his repugnance at breaking salt with the man who had robbed him it was
necessary for him to impress the inviolableness of Griefs lies on the
Kanaka crew By eleven oclock Grief came on board to find his mate
waiting up for him

Theres something doing on Swithin Halls island Grief said shaking
his head I cant make out what it is but I get the feel of it What
does Swithin Hall look like

Snow shook his head

That man ashore there never bought the books on the shelves Grief
declared with conviction Nor did he ever go in for concealed lighting
Hes got a surface flow of suavity but hes rough as a hoofrasp
underneath Hes an oily bluff And the bunch hes got with himWatson
and Gorman their names are they came in after you leftreal seadogs
middleaged marred and battered tough as rusty wroughtiron nails and
twice as dangerous real ugly customers with guns in their belts who
dont strike me as just the right sort to be on such comradely terms
with Swithin Hall And the woman Shes a lady I mean it She knows a
whole lot of South America and of China too Im sure shes Spanish
though her English is natural Shes travelled We talked bullfights
Shes seen them in Guayaquil in Mexico in Seville She knows a lot
about sealskins

Now heres what bothers me She knows music I asked her if she played
And hes fixed that place up like a palace That being so why hasnt
he a piano for her Another thing shes quick and lively and he watches
her whenever she talks Hes on pins and needles and continually
breaking in and leading the conversation Say did you ever hear that
Swithin Hall was married

Bless me I dont know the mate replied Never entered my head to
think about it

He introduced her as Mrs Hall And Watson and Gorman call him Hall
Theyre a precious pair those two men I dont understand it at all

What are you going to do about it Snow asked

Oh hang around a while There are some books ashore there I want to
read Suppose you send that topmast down in the morning and generally
overhaul Weve been through a hurricane you know Set up the rigging
while youre about it Get things pretty well adrift and take your
time




VI

The next day Griefs suspicions found further food Ashore early
he strolled across the little island to the barracks occupied by the
divers

They were just boarding the boats when he arrived and it struck him
that for Kanakas they behaved more like chaingang prisoners The three
white men were there and Grief noted that each carried a rifle Hall
greeted him jovially enough but Gorman and Watson scowled as they
grunted curt good mornings

A moment afterward one of the Kanakas as he bent to place his oar
favoured Grief with a slow deliberate wink The mans face was
familiar one of the thousands of native sailors and divers he had
encountered drifting about in the island trade

Dont tell them who I am Grief said in Tahitian Did you ever sail
for me

The mans head nodded and his mouth opened but before he could speak
he was suppressed by a savage Shut up from Watson who was already in
the sternsheets

I beg pardon Grief said I ought to have known better

Thats all right Hall interposed The trouble is theyre too much
talk and not enough work Have to be severe with them or they wouldnt
get enough shell to pay their grub

Grief nodded sympathetically I know them Got a crew of them
myselfthe lazy swine Got to drive them like niggers to get a
halfdays work out of them

What was you sayin to him Gorman blurted in bluntly

I was asking how the shell was and how deep they were diving

Thick Hall took over the answering Were working now in about ten
fathom Its right out there not a hundred yards off Want to come
along

Half the day Grief spent with the boats and had lunch in the bungalow
In the afternoon he loafed taking a siesta in the big livingroom
reading some and talking for half an hour with Mrs Hall After dinner
he played billiards with her husband It chanced that Grief had never
before encountered Swithin Hall yet the latters fame as an expert at
billiards was the talk of the beaches from Levuka to Honolulu But the
man Grief played with this night proved most indifferent at the game
His wife showed herself far cleverer with the cue

When he went on board the Uncle Toby Grief routed JackieJackie out of
bed He described the location of the barracks and told the Tongan
to swim softly around and have talk with the Kanakas In two hours
JackieJackie was back He shook his head as he stood dripping before
Grief

Very funny ting he reported One white man stop all the time He
has big rifle He lay in water and watch Maybe twelve oclock other
white man come and take rifle First white man go to bed Other man stop
now with rifle No good Me cannot talk with Kanakas Me come back

By George Grief said to Snow after the Tongan had gone back to his
bunk I smell something more than shell Those three men are standing
watches over their Kanakas That mans no more Swithin Hall than I am

Snow whistled from the impact of a new idea

Ive got it he cried

And Ill name it Grief retorted Its in your mind that the Emily
L was their schooner

Just that Theyre raising and rotting the shell while shes gone for
more divers or provisions or both

And I agree with you Grief glanced at the cabin clock and evinced
signs of bedgoing Hes a sailor The three of them are But theyre
not island men Theyre new in these waters

Again Snow whistled

And the Emily L is lost with all hands he said We know that
Theyre marooned here till Swithin Hall comes Then hell catch them
with all the shell

Or theyll take possession of his schooner

Hope they do Snow muttered vindictively Somebody ought to rob him
Wish I was in their boots Id balance off that sixty thousand




VII

A week passed during which time the Uncle Toby was ready for sea
while Grief managed to allay any suspicion of him by the shore crowd

Even Gorman and Watson accepted him at his selfdescription Throughout
the week Grief begged and badgered them for the longitude of the island

You wouldnt have me leave here lost he finally urged I cant get a
line on my chronometer without your longitude

Hall laughingly refused

Youre too good a navigator Mr Anstey not to fetch New Guinea or
some other high land

And youre too good a navigator Mr Hall Grief replied not to know
that I can fetch your island any time by running down its latitude

On the last evening ashore as usual to dinner Grief got his first
view of the pearls they had collected Mrs Hall waxing enthusiastic
had asked her husband to bring forth the pretties and had spent half
an hour showing them to Grief His delight in them was genuine as well
as was his surprise that they had made so rich a haul

The lagoon is virgin Hall explained You saw yourself that most
of the shell is large and old But its funny that we got most of the
valuable pearls in one small patch in the course of a week It was a
little treasure house Every oyster seemed filledseed pearls by the
quart of course but the perfect ones most of that bunch there came
out of the small patch

Grief ran his eye over them and knew their value ranged from one hundred
to a thousand dollars each while the several selected large ones went
far beyond

Oh the pretties the pretties Mrs Hall cried bending forward
suddenly and kissing them

A few minutes later she arose to say goodnight

Its goodbye Grief said as he took her hand We sail at daylight

So suddenly she cried while Grief could not help seeing the quick
light of satisfaction in her husbands eyes

Yes Grief continued All the repairs are finished I cant get the
longitude of your island out of your husband though Im still in hopes
hell relent

Hall laughed and shook his head and as his wife left the room
proposed a last farewell nightcap They sat over it smoking and
talking

What do you estimate theyre worth Grief asked indicating the spread
of pearls on the table I mean what the pearlbuyers would give you in
open market

Oh seventyfive or eighty thousand Hall said carelessly

Im afraid youre underestimating I know pearls a bit Take that
biggest one Its perfect Not a cent less than five thousand dollars
Some multimillionaire will pay double that some day when the dealers
have taken their whack And never minding the seed pearls youve got
quarts of baroques there And baroques are coming into fashion Theyre
picking up and doubling on themselves every year

Hall gave the trove of pearls a closer and longer scrutiny estimating
the different parcels and adding the sum aloud

Youre right he admitted Theyre worth a hundred thousand right
now

And at what do you figure your working expenses Grief went on Your
time and your two mens and the divers

Five thousand would cover it

Then they stand to net you ninetyfive thousand

Something like that But why so curious

Why I was just trying Grief paused and drained his glass Just
trying to reach some sort of an equitable arrangement Suppose I should
give you and your people a passage to Sydney and the five thousand
dollarsor better seven thousand five hundred Youve worked hard

Without commotion or muscular movement the other man became alert and
tense His roundfaced geniality went out like the flame of a snuffed
candle No laughter clouded the surface of the eyes and in their
depths showed the hard dangerous soul of the man He spoke in a low
deliberate voice

Now just what in hell do you mean by that

Grief casually relighted his cigar

I dont know just how to begin he said The situation iseris
embarrassing for you You see Im trying to be fair As I say youve
worked hard I dont want to confiscate the pearls I want to pay you
for your time and trouble and expense

Conviction instantaneous and absolute froze on the others face

And I thought you were in Europe he muttered Hope flickered for
a moment Look here youre joking me How do I know youre Swithin
Hall

Grief shrugged his shoulders Such a joke would be in poor taste after
your hospitality And it is equally in poor taste to have two Swithin
Halls on the island

Since youre Swithin Hall then who the deuce am I Do you know that
too

No Grief answered airily But Id like to know

Well its none of your business

I grant it Your identity is beside the point Besides I know your
schooner and I can find out who you are from that

Whats her name

The Emily L

Correct Im Captain Raffy owner and master

The sealpoacher Ive heard of you What under the sun brought you
down here on my preserves

Needed the money The seal herds are about finished

And the outoftheway places of the world are better policed eh

Pretty close to it And now about this present scrape Mr Hall I can
put up a nasty fight What are you going to do about it

What I said Even better Whats the Emily L worth

Shes seen her day Not above ten thousand which would be robbery
Every time shes in a rough sea Im afraid shell jump her ballast
through her planking

She has jumped it Captain Raffy I sighted her bottomup after the
blow Suppose we say she was worth seven thousand five hundred Ill
pay over to you fifteen thousand and give you a passage Dont move your
hands from your lap Grief stood up went over to him and took his
revolver Just a necessary precaution Captain Now youll go on board
with me Ill break the news to Mrs Raffy afterward and fetch her out
to join you

Youre behaving handsomely Mr Hall I must say Captain Raffy
volunteered as the whaleboat came alongside the Uncle Toby But
watch out for Gorman and Watson Theyre ugly customers And by the
way I dont like to mention it but youve seen my wife Ive given her
four or five pearls Watson and Gorman were willing

Say no more Captain Say no more They shall remain hers Is that you
Mr Snow Heres a friend I want you to take charge ofCaptain Raffy
Im going ashore for his wife




VIII

David Grief sat writing at the library table in the bungalow
livingroom Outside the first pale of dawn was showing He had had a
busy night Mrs Raffy had taken two hysterical hours to pack her and
Captain Raffys possessions Gorman had been caught asleep but Watson
standing guard over the divers had shown fight Matters did not reach
the shooting stage but it was only after it had been demonstrated to
him that the game was up that he consented to join his companions on
board For temporary convenience he and Gorman were shackled in the
mates room Mrs Raffy was confined in Griefs and Captain Raffy made
fast to the cabin table

Grief finished the document and read over what he had written

  To   Swithin   Hall

  To Herbert Snow paid in full for salvage from

Grief signed and dated paused and added at the bottom

     P SStill owing to Swithin Hall three books borrowed
     from library Hudsons Law of Psychic Phenomena Zolas
     Paris and Mahans Problem of Asia These books or full
     value can be collected of said David Griefs Sydney office

He shut off the electric light picked up the bundle of books carefully
latched the front door and went down to the waiting whaleboat




Chapter SixA GOBOTO NIGHT




I

At Goboto the traders come off their schooners and the planters drift
in from far wild coasts and one and all they assume shoes white duck
trousers and various other appearances of civilization At Goboto mail
is received bills are paid and newspapers rarely more than five weeks
old are accessible for the little island belted with its coral reefs
affords safe anchorage is the steamer port of call and serves as the
distributing point for the whole widescattered group

Life at Goboto is heated unhealthy and lurid and for its size it
asserts the distinction of more cases of acute alcoholism than any other
spot in the world Guvutu over in the Solomons claims that it drinks
between drinks Goboto does not deny this It merely states in passing
that in the Goboton chronology no such interval of time is known It
also points out its import statistics which show a far larger per
capita consumption of spiritous liquors Guvutu explains this on the
basis that Goboto does a larger business and has more visitors Goboto
retorts that its resident population is smaller and that its visitors
are thirstier And the discussion goes on interminably principally
because of the fact that the disputants do not live long enough to
settle it

Goboto is not large The island is only a quarter of a mile in diameter
and on it are situated an admiralty coalshed where a few tons of coal
have lain untouched for twenty years the barracks for a handful of
black labourers a big store and warehouse with sheetiron roofs and a
bungalow inhabited by the manager and his two clerks They are the white
population An average of one man out of the three is always to be found
down with fever The job at Goboto is a hard one It is the policy of
the company to treat its patrons well as invading companies have found
out and it is the task of the manager and clerks to do the treating
Throughout the year traders and recruiters arrive from far dry cruises
and planters from equally distant and dry shores bringing with them
magnificent thirsts Goboto is the mecca of sprees and when they have
spread they go back to their schooners and plantations to recuperate

Some of the less hardy require as much as six months between visits But
for the manager and his assistants there are no such intervals They are
on the spot and week by week blown in by monsoon or southeast
trade the schooners come to anchor cargod with copra ivory nuts
pearlshell hawksbill turtle and thirst

It is a very hard job at Goboto That is why the pay is twice that on
other stations and that is why the company selects only courageous and
intrepid men for this particular station They last no more than a year
or so when the wreckage of them is shipped back to Australia or the
remains of them are buried in the sand across on the windward side of
the islet Johnny Bassett almost the legendary hero of Goboto broke
all records He was a remittance man with a remarkable constitution
and he lasted seven years His dying request was duly observed by his
clerks who pickled him in a cask of traderum paid for out of
their own salaries and shipped him back to his people in England
Nevertheless at Goboto they tried to be gentlemen For that matter
though something was wrong with them they were gentlemen and had been
gentlemen That was why the great unwritten rule of Goboto was that
visitors should put on pants and shoes Breechclouts lavalavas and
bare legs were not tolerated When Captain Jensen the wildest of the
Blackbirders though descended from old New York Knickerbocker stock
surged in clad in loincloth undershirt two belted revolvers and
a sheathknife he was stopped at the beach This was in the days of
Johnny Bassett ever a stickler in matters of etiquette Captain Jensen
stood up in the sternsheets of his whaleboat and denied the existence of
pants on his schooner Also he affirmed his intention of coming ashore
They of Goboto nursed him back to health from a bullethole through his
shoulder and in addition handsomely begged his pardon for no pants
had they found on his schooner And finally on the first day he sat up
Johnny Bassett kindly but firmly assisted his guest into a pair of pants
of his own This was the great precedent In all the succeeding years it
had never been violated White men and pants were undivorceable Only
niggers ran naked Pants constituted caste




II

On this night things were with one exception in nowise different from
any other night Seven of them with glimmering eyes and steady legs
had capped a day of Scotch with swivelsticked cocktails and sat down to
dinner Jacketed trousered and shod they were Jerry McMurtrey the
manager Eddy Little and Jack Andrews clerks Captain Stapler of the
recruiting ketch Merry Darby Shryleton planter from TitoIto Peter
Gee a halfcaste Chinese pearlbuyer who ranged from Ceylon to the
Paumotus and Alfred Deacon a visitor who had stopped off from the last
steamer At first wine was served by the black servants to those that
drank it though all quickly shifted back to Scotch and soda pickling
their food as they ate it ere it went into their calcined pickled
stomachs

Over their coffee they heard the rumble of an anchorchain through a
hawsepipe tokening the arrival of a vessel

Its David Grief Peter Gee remarked

How do you know Deacon demanded truculently and then went on to deny
the halfcastes knowledge You chaps put on a lot of side over a new
chum Ive done some sailing myself and this naming a craft when
its sail is only a blur or naming a man by the sound of his
anchoritsits unadulterated poppycock

Peter Gee was engaged in lighting a cigarette and did not answer

Some of the niggers do amazing things that way McMurtrey interposed
tactfully

As with the others this conduct of their visitor jarred on the manager
From the moment of Peter Gees arrival that afternoon Deacon had
manifested a tendency to pick on him He had disputed his statements and
been generally rude

Maybe its because Peters got Chink blood in him had been Andrews
hypothesis Deacons Australian you know and theyre daffy down there
on colour

I fancy thats it McMurtrey had agreed But we cant permit any
bullying especially of a man like Peter Gee whos whiter than most
white men

In this the manager had been in nowise wrong Peter Gee was that rare
creature a good as well as clever Eurasian In fact it was the
stolid integrity of the Chinese blood that toned the recklessness and
licentiousness of the English blood which had run in his fathers veins
Also he was better educated than any man there spoke better English
as well as several other tongues and knew and lived more of their own
ideals of gentlemanness than they did themselves And finally he was
a gentle soul Violence he deprecated though he had killed men in his
time Turbulence he abhorred

He always avoided it as he would the plague

Captain Stapler stepped in to help McMurtrey

I remember when I changed schooners and came into Altman the niggers
knew right off the bat it was me I wasnt expected either much less
to be in another craft They told the trader it was me He used the
glasses and wouldnt believe them But they did know Told me afterward
they could see it sticking out all over the schooner that I was running
her

Deacon ignored him and returned to the attack on the pearlbuyer

How do you know from the sound of the anchor that it was this
whateveryoucalledhim man he challenged

There are so many things that go to make up such a judgment Peter
Gee answered Its very hard to explain It would require almost a text
book

I thought so Deacon sneered Explanation that doesnt explain is
easy

Whos for bridge Eddy Little the second clerk interrupted looking
up expectantly and starting to shuffle Youll play wont you Peter

If he does hes a bluffer Deacon cut back Im getting tired of all
this poppycock Mr Gee you will favour me and put yourself in a
better light if you tell how you know who that man was that just dropped
anchor After that Ill play you piquet

Id prefer bridge Peter answered As for the other thing
its something like this By the sound it was a small craftno
squarerigger No whistle no siren was blownagain a small craft It
anchored close instill again a small craft for steamers and big ships
must drop hook outside the middle shoal Now the entrance is tortuous
There is no recruiting nor trading captain in the group who dares to run
the passage after dark Certainly no stranger would There were two
exceptions The first was Margonville But he was executed by the High
Court at Fiji Remains the other exception David Grief Night or
day in any weather he runs the passage This is well known to all A
possible factor in case Grief were somewhere else would be some young
daredevil of a skipper In this connection in the first place I dont
know of any nor does anybody else In the second place David Grief is
in these waters cruising on the Gunga which is shortly scheduled to
leave here for KaroKaro I spoke to Grief on the Gunga in Sandfly
Passage day before yesterday He was putting a trader ashore on a new
station He said he was going to call in at Babo and then come on to
Goboto He has had ample time to get here I have heard an anchor drop
Who else than David Grief can it be Captain Donovan is skipper of the
Gunga and him I know too well to believe that hed run in to Goboto
after dark unless his owner were in charge In a few minutes David
Grief will enter through that door and say In Guvutu they merely drink
between drinks Ill wager fifty pounds hes the man that enters and
that his words will be In Guvutu they merely drink between drinks 
 Deacon was for the moment crushed The sullen blood rose darkly in his
face

Well hes answered you McMurtrey laughed genially And Ill back
his bet myself for a couple of sovereigns

Bridge Whos going to take a hand Eddy Little cried impatiently
Come on Peter

The rest of you play Deacon said He and I are going to play
piquet

Id prefer bridge Peter Gee said mildly

Dont you play piquet

The pearlbuyer nodded

Then come on Maybe I can show I know more about that than I do about
anchors

Oh I say McMurtrey began

You can play bridge Deacon shut him off We prefer piquet

Reluctantly Peter Gee was bullied into a game that he knew would be
unhappy

Only a rubber he said as he cut for deal

For how much Deacon asked

Peter Gee shrugged his shoulders As you please

Hundred upfive pounds a game

Peter Gee agreed

With the lurch double of course ten pounds

All right said Peter Gee

At another table four of the others sat in at bridge Captain Stapler
who was no cardplayer looked on and replenished the long glasses
of Scotch that stood at each mans right hand McMurtrey with poorly
concealed apprehension followed as well as he could what went on at
the piquet table His fellow Englishmen as well were shocked by the
behaviour of the Australian and all were troubled by fear of some
untoward act on his part That he was working up his animosity against
the halfcaste and that the explosion might come any time was apparent
to all

I hope Peter loses McMurtrey said in an undertone

Not if he has any luck Andrews answered Hes a wizard at piquet I
know by experience

That Peter Gee was lucky was patent from the continual badgering of
Deacon who filled his glass frequently He had lost the first game
and from his remarks was losing the second when the door opened and
David Grief entered

In Guvutu they merely drink between drinks he remarked casually to
the assembled company ere he gripped the managers hand Hello Mac
Say my skippers down in the whaleboat Hes got a silk shirt a tie
and tennis shoes all complete but he wants you to send a pair of pants
down Mine are too small but yours will fit him Hello Eddy Hows
that ngaringari You up Jock The miracle has happened No one down
with fever and no one remarkably drunk He sighed I suppose the
night is young yet Hello Peter Did you catch that big squall an hour
after you left us We had to let go the second anchor

While he was being introduced to Deacon McMurtrey dispatched a
houseboy with the pants and when Captain Donovan came in it was as a
white man shouldat least in Goboto

Deacon lost the second game and an outburst heralded the fact Peter
Gee devoted himself to lighting a cigarette and keeping quiet

Whatare you quitting because youre ahead Deacon demanded

Grief raised his eyebrows questioningly to McMurtrey who frowned back
his own disgust

Its the rubber Peter Gee answered

It takes three games to make a rubber Its my deal Come on

Peter Gee acquiesced and the third game was on

Young whelphe needs a lacing McMurtrey muttered to Grief Come on
let us quit you chaps I want to keep an eye on him If he goes too far
Ill throw him out on the beach company instructions or no

Who is he Grief queried

A leftover from last steamer Companys orders to treat him nice Hes
looking to invest in a plantation Has a tenthousandpound letter of
credit with the company Hes got allwhite Australia on the brain
Thinks because his skin is white and because his father was once
AttorneyGeneral of the Commonwealth that he can be a cur Thats why
hes picking on Peter and you know Peters the last man in the world
to make trouble or incur trouble Damn the company I didnt engage
to wetnurse its infants with bank accounts Come on fill your glass
Grief The mans a blighter a blithering blighter

Maybe hes only young Grief suggested

He cant contain his drinkthats clear The manager glared his
disgust and wrath If he raises a hand to Peter so help me Ill give
him a licking myself the little overgrown cad

The pearlbuyer pulled the pegs out of the cribbage board on which he
was scoring and sat back He had won the third game He glanced across
to Eddy Little saying

Im ready for the bridge now

I wouldnt be a quitter Deacon snarled

Oh really Im tired of the game Peter Gee assured him with his
habitual quietness

Come on and be game Deacon bullied One more You cant take my
money that way Im out fifteen pounds Double or quits

McMurtrey was about to interpose but Grief restrained him with his
eyes

If it positively is the last all right said Peter Gee gathering up
the cards Its my deal I believe As I understand it this final is
for fifteen pounds Either you owe me thirty or we quit even

Thats it chappie Either we break even or I pay you thirty

Getting blooded eh Grief remarked drawing up a chair

The other men stood or sat around the table and Deacon played again
in bad luck That he was a good player was clear The cards were merely
running against him That he could not take his ill luck with equanimity
was equally clear He was guilty of sharp ugly curses and he snapped
and growled at the imperturbable halfcaste In the end Peter Gee
counted out while Deacon had not even made his fifty points He
glowered speechlessly at his opponent

Looks like a lurch said Grief

Which is double said Peter Gee

Theres no need your telling me Deacon snarled Ive studied
arithmetic I owe you fortyfive pounds There take it

The way in which he flung the nine fivepound notes on the table was
an insult in itself Peter Gee was even quieter and flew no signals of
resentment

Youve got fools luck but you cant play cards I can tell you that
much Deacon went on I could teach you cards

The halfcaste smiled and nodded acquiescence as he folded up the money

Theres a little game called casinoI wonder if you ever heard of
ita childs game

Ive seen it played the halfcaste murmured gently

Whats that snapped Deacon Maybe you think you can play it

Oh no not for a moment Im afraid I havent head enough for it

Its a bully game casino Grief broke in pleasantly I like it very
much

Deacon ignored him

Ill play you ten quid a gamethirtyone points out was the
challenge to Peter Gee And Ill show you how little you know about
cards Come on Wheres a full deck

No thanks the halfcaste answered They are waiting for me in order
to make up a bridge set

Yes come on Eddy Little begged eagerly Come on Peter lets get
started

Afraid of a little game like casino Deacon girded Maybe the stakes
are too high Ill play you for penniesor farthings if you say so

The mans conduct was a hurt and an affront to all of them McMurtrey
could stand it no longer

Now hold on Deacon He says he doesnt want to play Let him alone

Deacon turned raging upon his host but before he could blurt out his
abuse Grief had stepped into the breach

Id like to play casino with you he said

What do you know about it

Not much but Im willing to learn

Well Im not teaching for pennies tonight

Oh thats all right Grief answered Ill play for almost any
sumwithin reason of course

Deacon proceeded to dispose of this intruder with one stroke

Ill play you a hundred pounds a game if that will do you any good

Grief beamed his delight That will be all right very right Let us
begin Do you count sweeps

Deacon was taken aback He had not expected a Goboton trader to be
anything but crushed by such a proposition

Do you count sweeps Grief repeated

Andrews had brought him a new deck and he was throwing out the joker

Certainly not Deacon answered Thats a sissy game

Im glad Grief coincided I dont like sissy games either

You dont eh Well then Ill tell you what well do Well play for
five hundred pounds a game

Again Deacon was taken aback

Im agreeable Grief said beginning to shuffle Cards and spades go
out first of course and then big and little casino and the aces in
the bridge order of value Is that right

Youre a lot of jokers down here Deacon laughed but his laughter was
strained How do I know youve got the money

By the same token I know youve got it Mac hows my credit with the
company

For all you want the manager answered

You personally guarantee that Deacon demanded

I certainly do McMurtrey said Depend upon it the company will
honour his paper up and past your letter of credit

Low deals Grief said placing the deck before Deacon on the table

The latter hesitated in the midst of the cut and looked around with
querulous misgiving at the faces of the others The clerks and captains
nodded

Youre all strangers to me Deacon complained How am I to know
Money on paper isnt always the real thing

Then it was that Peter Gee drawing a wallet from his pocket and
borrowing a fountain pen from McMurtrey went into action

I havent gone to buying yet the halfcaste explained so the
account is intact Ill just indorse it over to you Grief Its for
fifteen thousand There look at it

Deacon intercepted the letter of credit as it was being passed across
the table He read it slowly then glanced up at McMurtrey

Is that right

Yes Its just the same as your own and just as good The companys
paper is always good

Deacon cut the cards won the deal and gave them a thorough shuffle
But his luck was still against him and he lost the game

Another game he said We didnt say how many and you cant quit
with me a loser I want action

Grief shuffled and passed the cards for the cut

Lets play for a thousand Deacon said when he had lost the second
game And when the thousand had gone the way of the two five hundred
bets he proposed to play for two thousand

Thats progression McMurtrey warned and was rewarded by a glare
from Deacon But the manager was insistent You dont have to play
progression Grief unless youre foolish

Whos playing this game Deacon flamed at his host and then to
Grief Ive lost two thousand to you Will you play for two thousand

Grief nodded the fourth game began and Deacon won The manifest
unfairness of such betting was known to all of them Though he had lost
three games out of four Deacon had lost no money By the childs device
of doubling his wager with each loss he was bound with the first game
he won no matter how long delayed to be even again

He now evinced an unspoken desire to stop but Grief passed the deck to
be cut

What Deacon cried You want more

Havent got anything yet Grief murmured whimsically as he began the
deal For the usual five hundred I suppose

The shame of what he had done must have tingled in Deacon for he
answered No well play for a thousand And say Thirtyone points is
too long Why not twentyone points outif it isnt too rapid for you

That will make it a nice quick little game Grief agreed

The former method of play was repeated Deacon lost two games doubled
the stake and was again even But Grief was patient though the thing
occurred several times in the next hours play Then happened what he
was waiting fora lengthening in the series of losing games for Deacon
The latter doubled to four thousand and lost doubled to eight thousand
and lost and then proposed to double to sixteen thousand

Grief shook his head You cant do that you know Youre only ten
thousand credit with the company

You mean you wont give me action Deacon asked hoarsely You mean
that with eight thousand of my money youre going to quit

Grief smiled and shook his head

Its robbery plain robbery Deacon went on You take my money and
wont give me action

No youre wrong Im perfectly willing to give you what action youve
got coming to you Youve got two thousand pounds of action yet

Well well play it Deacon took him up You cut

The game was played in silence save for irritable remarks and curses
from Deacon Silently the onlookers filled and sipped their long
Scotch glasses Grief took no notice of his opponents outbursts but
concentrated on the game He was really playing cards and there were
fiftytwo in the deck to be kept track of and of which he did keep
track Two thirds of the way through the last deal he threw down his
hand

Cards put me out he said I have twentyseven

If youve made a mistake Deacon threatened his face white and drawn

Then I shall have lost Count them

Grief passed over his stack of takings and Deacon with trembling
fingers verified the count He half shoved his chair back from the
table and emptied his glass He looked about him at unsympathetic faces

I fancy Ill be catching the next steamer for Sydney he said and for
the first time his speech was quiet and without bluster

As Grief told them afterward Had he whined or raised a roar I wouldnt
have given him that last chance As it was he took his medicine like a
man and I had to do it

Deacon glanced at his watch simulated a weary yawn and started to
rise

Wait Grief said Do you want further action

The other sank down in his chair strove to speak but could not licked
his dry lips and nodded his head

Captain Donovan here sails at daylight in the Gunga for KaroKaro
 Grief began with seeming irrelevance KaroKaro is a ring of sand in
the sea with a few thousand cocoanut trees Pandanus grows there but
they cant grow sweet potatoes nor taro There aremabout eight hundred
natives a king and two prime ministers and the last three named are
the only ones who wear any clothes Its a sort of Godforsaken little
hole and once a year I send a schooner up from Goboto The drinking
water is brackish but old Tom Butler has survived on it for a dozen
years Hes the only white man there and he has a boats crew of five
Santa Cruz boys who would run away or kill him if they could That is
why they were sent there They cant run away He is always supplied
with the hard cases from the plantations There are no missionaries
Two native Samoan teachers were clubbed to death on the beach when they
landed several years ago

Naturally you are wondering what it is all about But have patience
As I have said Captain Donovan sails on the annual trip to KaroKaro at
daylight tomorrow Tom Butler is old and getting quite helpless Ive
tried to retire him to Australia but he says he wants to remain and
die on KaroKaro and he will in the next year or so Hes a queer old
codger Now the time is due for me to send some white man up to take the
work off his hands I wonder how youd like the job Youd have to stay
two years

Hold on Ive not finished Youve talked frequently of action this
evening Theres no action in betting away what youve never sweated
for The money youve lost to me was left you by your father or some
other relative who did the sweating But two years of work as trader on
KaroKaro would mean something Ill bet the ten thousand Ive won from
you against two years of your time If you win the moneys yours If
you lose you take the job at KaroKaro and sail at daylight Now thats
what might be called real action Will you play

Deacon could not speak His throat lumped and he nodded his head as he
reached for the cards

One thing more Grief said I can do even better If you lose two
years of your time are minenaturally without wages Nevertheless
Ill pay you wages If your work is satisfactory if you observe all
instructions and rules Ill pay you five thousand pounds a year for two
years The money will be deposited with the company to be paid to you
with interest when the time expires Is that all right

Too much so Deacon stammered You are unfair to yourself A trader
only gets ten or fifteen pounds a month

Put it down to action then Grief said with an air of dismissal
And before we begin Ill jot down several of the rules These you will
repeat aloud every morning during the two yearsif you lose They
are for the good of your soul When you have repeated them aloud seven
hundred and thirty KaroKaro mornings I am confident they will be in
your memory to stay Lend me your pen Mac Now lets see

He wrote steadily and rapidly for some minutes then proceeded to read
the matter aloud

I must always remember that one man is as good as another save and
except when he thinks he is better

No matter how drunk I am I must not fail to be a gentleman A
gentleman is a man who is gentle Note It would be better not to get
drunk

When I play a mans game with men I must play like a man

A good curse rightly used and rarely is an efficient thing Too many
curses spoil the cursing Note A curse cannot change a card seguence
nor cause the wind to blow

There is no license for a man to be less than a man Ten thousand
pounds cannot purchase such a license

At the beginning of the reading Deacons face had gone white with anger
Then had arisen from neck to forehead a slow and terrible flush that
deepened to the end of the reading

There that will be all Grief said as he folded the paper and tossed
it to the centre of the table Are you still ready to play the game

I deserve it Deacon muttered brokenly Ive been an ass Mr Gee
before I know whether I win or lose I want to apologize Maybe it was
the whiskey I dont know but Im an ass a cad a boundereverything
thats rotten

He held out his hand and the halfcaste took it beamingly

I say Grief he blurted out the boys all right Call the whole
thing off and lets forget it in a final nightcap

Grief showed signs of debating but Deacon cried

No I wont permit it Im not a quitter If its KaroKaro its
KaroKaro Theres nothing more to it

Right said Grief as he began the shuffle If hes the right stuff
to go to KaroKaro KaroKaro wont do him any harm

The game was close and hard Three times they divided the deck between
them and cards was not scored At the beginning of the fifth and
last deal Deacon needed three points to go out and Grief needed four
Cards alone would put Deacon out and he played for cards He no
longer muttered or cursed and played his best game of the evening
Incidentally he gathered in the two black aces and the ace of hearts

I suppose you can name the four cards I hold he challenged as the
last of the deal was exhausted and he picked up his hand

Grief nodded

Then name them

The knave of spades the deuce of spades the tray of hearts and the
ace of diamonds Grief answered

Those behind Deacon and looking at his hand made no sign Yet the naming
had been correct

I fancy you play casino better than I Deacon acknowledged I can
name only three of yours a knave an ace and big casino

Wrong There arent five aces in the deck Youve taken in three and
you hold the fourth in your hand now

By Jove youre right Deacon admitted I did scoop in three Anyway
Ill make cards on you Thats all I need

Ill let you save little casino Grief paused to calculate Yes
and the ace as well and still Ill make cards and go out with big
casino Play

No cards and I win Deacon exulted as the last of the hand was
played I go out on little casino and the four aces Big casino and
spades only bring you to twenty

Grief shook his head Some mistake Im afraid

No Deacon declared positively I counted every card I took in
Thats the one thing I was correct on Ive twentysix and youve
twentysix

Count again Grief said

Carefully and slowly with trembling fingers Deacon counted the cards
he had taken There were twentyfive He reached over to the corner of
the table took up the rules Grief had written folded them and put
them in his pocket Then he emptied his glass and stood up Captain
Donovan looked at his watch yawned and also arose

Going aboard Captain Deacon asked

Yes was the answer What time shall I send the whaleboat for you

Ill go with you now Well pick up my luggage from the Billy as we
go by I was sailing on her for Babo in the morning

Deacon shook hands all around after receiving a final pledge of good
luck on KaroKaro

Does Tom Butler play cards he asked Grief

Solitaire was the answer

Then Ill teach him double solitaire Deacon turned toward the door
where Captain Donovan waited and added with a sigh And I fancy hell
skin me too if he plays like the rest of you island men





Chapter SevenTHE FEATHERS OF THE SUN




I

It was the island of FituIvathe last independent Polynesian
stronghold in the South Seas Three factors conduced to FituIvas
independence The first and second were its isolation and the
warlikeness of its population But these would not have saved it in
the end had it not been for the fact that Japan France Great
Britain Germany and the United States discovered its desirableness
simultaneously It was like gamins scrambling for a penny They got
in one anothers way The war vessels of the five Powers cluttered
FituIvas one small harbour There were rumours of war and threats of
war Over its morning toast all the world read columns about FituIva
As a Yankee blue jacket epitomized it at the time they all got their
feet in the trough at once

So it was that FituIva escaped even a joint protectorate and King
Tulifau otherwise Tui Tulifau continued to dispense the high justice
and the low in the framehouse palace built for him by a Sydney trader
out of California redwood Not only was Tui Tulifau every inch a king
but he was every second a king When he had ruled fiftyeight years and
five months he was only fiftyeight years and three months old That
is to say he had ruled over five million seconds more than he had
breathed having been crowned two months before he was born

He was a kingly king a royal figure of a man standing six feet and
a half and without being excessively fat weighing three hundred and
twenty pounds But this was not unusual for Polynesian chief stock
 Sepeli his queen was six feet three inches and weighed two hundred
and sixty while her brother Uiliami who commanded the army in the
intervals of resignation from the premiership topped her by an inch and
notched her an even halfhundredweight Tui Tulifau was a merry soul a
great feaster and drinker So were all his people merry souls save in
anger when on occasion they could be guilty even of throwing dead
pigs at those who made them wroth Nevertheless on occasion they could
fight like Maoris as piratical sandalwood traders and Blackbirders in
the old days learned to their cost




II

Griefs schooner the Cantani had passed the Pillar Rocks at the
entrance two hours before and crept up the harbour to the whispering
flutters of a breeze that could not make up its mind to blow It was
a cool starlight evening and they lolled about the poop waiting till
their snails pace would bring them to the anchorage Willie Smee the
supercargo emerged from the cabin conspicuous in his shore clothes
The mate glanced at his shirt of the finest and whitest silk and
giggled significantly

Dance tonight I suppose Grief observed

No said the mate Its Taitua Willies stuck on her

Catch me the supercargo disclaimed

Then shes stuck on you and its all the same the mate went on You
wont be ashore half an hour before youll have a flower behind your
ear a wreath on your head and your arm around Taitua

Simple jealousy Willie Smee sniffed Youd like to have her
yourself only you cant

I cant find shirts like that thats why Ill bet you half a crown
you wont sail from FituIva with that shirt

And if Taitua doesnt get it its an even break Tui Tulifau does
 Grief warned Better not let him spot that shirt or its all day with
it

Thats right Captain Boig agreed turning his head from watching the
house lights on the shore Last voyage he fined one of my Kanakas out
of a fancy belt and sheathknife He turned to the mate You can let
go any time Mr Marsh Dont give too much slack Theres no sign of
wind and in the morning we may shift opposite the coprasheds

A minute later the anchor rumbled down The whaleboat already hoisted
out lay alongside and the shoregoing party dropped into it Save for
the Kanakas who were all bent for shore only Grief and the supercargo
were in the boat At the head of the little coralstone pier Willie
Smee with an apologetic gurgle separated from his employer and
disappeared down an avenue of palms Grief turned in the opposite
direction past the front of the old mission church Here among
the graves on the beach lightly clad in ahus and lavalavas
flowercrowned and garlanded with great phosphorescent hibiscus
blossoms in their hair youths and maidens were dancing Farther on
Grief passed the long grassbuilt himine house where a few score
of the elders sat in long rows chanting the old hymns taught them by
forgotten missionaries He passed also the palace of Tui Tulifau where
by the lights and sounds he knew the customary revelry was going
on For of the happy South Sea isles FituIva was the happiest They
feasted and frolicked at births and deaths and the dead and the unborn
were likewise feasted

Grief held steadily along the Broom Road which curved and twisted
through a lush growth of flowers and fernlike algarobas The warm air
was rich with perfume and overhead outlined against the stars were
fruitburdened mangoes stately avocado trees and slendertufted palms
Every here and there were grass houses Voices and laughter rippled
through the darkness Out on the water flickering lights and softvoiced
choruses marked the fishers returning from the reef

At last Grief stepped aside from the road stumbling over a pig that
grunted indignantly Looking through an open door he saw a stout and
elderly native sitting on a heap of mats a dozen deep From time to
time automatically he brushed his naked legs with a cocoanutfibre
flyflicker He wore glasses and was reading methodically in what Grief
knew to be an English Bible For this was Ieremia his trader so named
from the prophet Jeremiah

Ieremia was lighterskinned than the FituIvans as was natural in a
fullblooded Samoan Educated by the missionaries as lay teacher he had
served their cause well over in the cannibal atolls to the westward As
a reward he had been sent to the paradise of FituIva where all were
or had been good converts to gather in the backsliders Unfortunately
Ieremia had become too well educated A stray volume of Darwin a
nagging wife and a pretty FituIvan widow had driven him into the ranks
of the backsliders It was not a case of apostasy The effect of Darwin
had been one of intellectual fatigue What was the use of trying to
understand this vastly complicated and enigmatical world especially
when one was married to a nagging woman As Ieremia slackened in his
labours the mission board threatened louder and louder to send him back
to the atolls while his wifes tongue grew correspondingly sharper Tui
Tulifau was a sympathetic monarch whose queen on occasions when he was
particularly drunk was known to beat him For political reasonsthe
queen belonging to as royal stock as himself and her brother commanding
the armyTui Tulifau could not divorce her but he could and did
divorce Ieremia who promptly took up with commercial life and the lady
of his choice As an independent trader he had failed chiefly because
of the disastrous patronage of Tui Tulifau To refuse credit to that
merry monarch was to invite confiscation to grant him credit was
certain bankruptcy After a years idleness on the beach leremia had
become David Griefs trader and for a dozen years his service had
been honourable and efficient for Grief had proven the first man who
successfully refused credit to the king or who collected when it had
been accorded

Ieremia looked gravely over the rims of his glasses when his employer
entered gravely marked the place in the Bible and set it aside and
gravely shook hands

I am glad you came in person he said

How else could I come Grief laughed

But Ieremia had no sense of humour and he ignored the remark

The commercial situation on the island is damn bad he said with great
solemnity and an unctuous mouthing of the manysyllabled words My
ledger account is shocking

Trade bad

On the contrary It has been excellent The shelves are empty
exceedingly empty But His eyes glistened proudly But there are
many goods remaining in the storehouse I have kept it carefully
locked

Been allowing Tui Tulifau too much credit

On the contrary There has been no credit at all And every old account
has been settled up

I dont follow you Ieremia Grief confessed Whats the
jokeshelves empty no credit old accounts all square storehouse
carefully lockedwhats the answer

Ieremia did not reply immediately Reaching under the rear corner of the
mats he drew forth a large cashbox Grief noted and wondered that
it was not locked The Samoan had always been fastidiously cautious in
guarding cash The box seemed filled with paper money He skinned off
the top note and passed it over

There is the answer

Grief glanced at a fairly well executed banknote The First Royal Bank
of FituIva will pay to bearer on demand one pound sterling he read
In the centre was the smudged likeness of a native face At the bottom
was the signature of Tui Tulifau and the signature of Fulualea with
the printed information appended Chancellor of the Exchequer

Who the deuce is Fulualea Grief demanded Its Fijian isnt
itmeaning the feathers of the sun

Just so It means the feathers of the sun Thus does this base
interloper caption himself He has come up from Fiji to turn FituIva
upside downthat is commercially

Some one of those smart Levuka boys I suppose

Ieremia shook his head sadly No this low fellow is a white man and
a scoundrel He has taken a noble and highsounding Fijian name and
dragged it in the dirt to suit his nefarious purposes He has made Tui
Tulifau drunk He has made him very drunk He has kept him very drunk
all the time In return he has been made Chancellor of the Exchequer
and other things He has issued this false paper and compelled the
people to receive it He has levied a store tax a copra tax and a
tobacco tax There are harbour dues and regulations and other taxes
But the people are not taxedonly the traders When the copra tax was
levied I lowered the purchasing price accordingly Then the people
began to grumble and Feathers of the Sun passed a new law setting
the old price back and forbidding any man to lower it Me he fined two
pounds and five pigs it being well known that I possessed five pigs
You will find them entered in the ledger Hawkins who is trader for
the Fulcrum Company was fined first pigs then gin and because he
continued to make loud conversation the army came and burned his store
When I declined to sell this Feathers of the Sun fined me once more and
promised to burn the store if again I offended So I sold all that was
on the shelves and there is the box full of worthless paper I shall
be chagrined if you pay me my salary in paper but it would be just no
more than just Now what is to be done

Grief shrugged his shoulders I must first see this Feathers of the Sun
and size up the situation

Then you must see him soon Ieremia advised Else he will have an
accumulation of many fines against you Thus does he absorb all the
coin of the realm He has it all now save what has been buried in the
ground




III

On his way back along the Broom Road under the lighted lamps that
marked the entrance to the palace grounds Grief encountered a short
rotund gentleman in unstarched ducks smoothshaven and of florid
complexion who was just emerging Something about his tentative
saturated gait was familiar Grief knew it on the instant On the
beaches of a dozen South Sea ports had he seen it before

Of all men Cornelius Deasy he cried

If it aint Grief himself the old devil was the return greeting as
they shook hands

If youll come on board Ive some choice smoky Irish Grief invited

Cornelius threw back his shoulders and stiffened

Nothing doin Mr Grief Tis Fulualea I am now No blarneyin of
old times for me Also and by the leave of his gracious Majesty King
Tulifau tis Chancellor of the Exchequer I am an Chief Justice I am
save in moments of royal sport when the king himself chooses to toy with
the wheels of justice

Grief whistled his amazement So youre Feathers of the Sun

I prefer the native idiom was the correction Fulualea an it
please you Not forgettin old times Mr Grief it sorrows the heart
of me to break you the news Youll have to pay your legitimate import
duties same as any other trader with mind intent on robbin the gentle
Polynesian savage on coral isles implanted Where was I Ah I
remember Youve violated the regulations With malice intent have you
entered the port of FituIva after sunset without sidelights burnin
Dont interrupt With my own eyes did I see you For which offence are
you fined the sum of five pounds Have you any gin Tis a serious
offence Not lightly are the lives of the mariners of our commodious
port to be risked for the savin of a pennyorth of oil Did I ask have
you any gin Tis the harbour master that asks

Youve taken a lot on your shoulders Grief grinned

Tis the white mans burden These rapscallion traders have been
puttin it all over poor Tui Tulif the besthearted old monarch
that ever sat a South Sea throne an mopped grogroot from the imperial
calabash Tis I CorneliusFulualea ratherthat am here to see
justice done Much as I dislike the doin of it as harbour master tis
my duty to find you guilty of breach of quarantine

Quarantine

Tis the rulin of the port doctor No intercourse with the shore till
the ship is passed What dire calamity to the confidin native if
chicken pox or whoopin cough was aboard of you Who is there to protect
the gentle confidin Polynesian I Fulualea the Feathers of the Sun
on my high mission

Who in hell is the port doctor Grief queried

Tis me Fulualea Your offence is serious Consider yourself fined
five cases of firstquality Holland gin

Grief laughed heartily Well compromise Cornelius Come aboard and
have a drink

The Feathers of the Sun waved the proffer aside grandly Tis bribery
Ill have none of itme faithful to my salt And wherefore did you not
present your ships papers As chief of the custom house you are fined
five pounds and two more cases of gin

Look here Cornelius A jokes a joke but this one has gone far
enough This is not Levuka Ive half a mind to pull your nose for you
You cant buck me

The Feathers of the Sun retreated unsteadily and in alarm

Lay no violence on me he threatened Youre right This is not
Levuka And by the same token with Tui Tulifau and the royal army
behind me buck you is just the thing I can and will Youll pay them
fines promptly or Ill confiscate your vessel Youre not the first
What does that Chink pearlbuyer Peter Gee do but slip into harbour
violatin all regulations an makin rough house for the matter of a
few paltry fines No he wouldnt pay em and hes on the beach now
thinkin it over

You dont mean to say

Sure an I do In the high exercise of office I seized his schooner A
fifth of the loyal army is now in charge on board of her Shell be sold
this day week Some ten tons of shell in the hold and Im wonderin
if I can trade it to you for gin I can promise you a rare bargain How
much gin did you say you had

Still more gin eh

An why not Tis a royal souse is Tui Tulifau Sure it keeps my wits
workin overtime to supply him hes that amazin liberal with it The
whole gang of hangeron chiefs is perpetually loaded to the guards Its
disgraceful Are you goin to pay them fines Mr Grief or is it to
harsher measures Ill be forced

Grief turned impatiently on his heel

Cornelius youre drunk Think it over and come to your senses The
old rollicking South Sea days are gone You cant play tricks like that
now

If you think youre goin on board Mr Grief Ill save you the
trouble I know your kind I foresaw your stiffnecked stubbornness An
its forestalled you are Tis on the beach youll find your crew The
vessels seized

Grief turned back on him in the halfbelief still that he was joking
Fulualea again retreated in alarm The form of a large man loomed beside
him in the darkness

Is it you Uiliami Fulualea crooned Here is another sea pirate
Stand by me with the strength of thy arm O Herculean brother

Greeting Uiliami Grief said Since when has FituIva come to be
run by a Levuka beachcomber He says my schooner has been seized Is it
true

It is true Uiliami boomed from his deep chest Have you any more
silk shirts like Willie Smees Tui Tulifau would like such a shirt He
has heard of it

Tis all the same Fulualea interrupted Shirts or schooners the
king shall have them

Rather highhanded Cornelius Grief murmured Its rank piracy You
seized my vessel without giving me a chance

A chance is it As we stood here not five minutes gone didnt you
refuse to pay your fines

But she was already seized

Sure an why not Didnt I know youd refuse Tis all fair an no
injustice doneJustice the bright particular star at whose shining
altar Cornelius Deasyor Fulualea tis the same thingever worships
Get thee gone Mr Trader or Ill set the palace guards on you
Uiliami tis a desperate character this trader man Call the guards

Uiliami blew the whistle suspended on his broad bare chest by a cord
of cocoanut sennit Grief reached out an angry hand for Cornelius who
titubated into safety behind Uiliamis massive bulk A dozen strapping
Polynesians not one under six feet ran down the palace walk and ranged
behind their commander

Get thee gone Mr Trader Cornelius ordered The interview is
terminated Well try your several cases in the mornin Appear promptly
at the palace at ten oclock to answer to the followin charges to
wit breach of the peace seditious and treasonable utterance violent
assault on the chief magistrate with intent to cut wound maim an
bruise breach of quarantine violation of harbour regulations and
gross breakage of custom house rules In the mornin fellow in the
mornin justice shall be done while the breadfruit falls And the Lord
have mercy on your soul




III

Before the hour set for the trial Grief accompanied by Peter Gee won
access to Tui Tulifau The king surrounded by half a dozen chiefs lay
on mats under the shade of the avocados in the palace compound Early
as was the hour palace maids were industriously serving squarefaces of
gin The king was glad to see his old friend Davida and regretful
that he had run foul of the new regulations Beyond that he steadfastly
avoided discussion of the matter in hand All protests of the
expropriated traders were washed away in proffers of gin Have a
drink was his invariable reply though once he unbosomed himself
enough to say that Feathers of the Sun was a wonderful man Never had
palace affairs been so prosperous Never had there been so much money
in the treasury nor so much gin in circulation Well pleased am I with
Fulualea he concluded Have a drink

Weve got to get out of this pronto Grief whispered to Peter Gee a
few minutes later or well be a pair of boiled owls Also I am to be
tried for arson or heresy or leprosy or something in a few minutes
and I must control my wits

As they withdrew from the royal presence Grief caught a glimpse of
Sepeli the queen She was peering out at her royal spouse and his
fellow tipplers and the frown on her face gave Grief his cue Whatever
was to be accomplished must be through her

In another shady corner of the big compound Cornelius was holding court
He had been at it early for when Grief arrived the case of Willie Smee
was being settled The entire royal army save that portion in charge of
the seized vessels was in attendance

Let the defendant stand up said Cornelius and receive the just and
merciful sentence of the Court for licentious and disgraceful conduct
unbecomin a supercargo The defendant says he has no money Very well
The Court regrets it has no calaboose In lieu thereof and in view
of the impoverished condition of the defendant the Court fines said
defendant one white silk shirt of the same kind make and quality at
present worn by defendant

Cornelius nodded to several of the soldiers who led the supercargo away
behind an avocado tree A minute later he emerged minus the garment in
question and sat down beside Grief

What have you been up to Grief asked

Blessed if I know What crimes have you committed

Next case said Cornelius in his most extralegal tones David Grief
defendant stand up The Court has considered the evidence in the case
or cases and renders the following judgment to witShut up he
thundered at Grief who had attempted to interrupt I tell you the
evidence has been considered deeply considered It is no wish of the
Court to lay additional hardship on the defendant and the Court takes
this opportunity to warn the defendant that he is liable for contempt
For open and wanton violation of harbour rules and regulations breach
of quarantine and disregard of shipping laws his schooner the
Cantani is hereby declared confiscated to the Government of
FituIva to be sold at public auction ten days from date with
all appurtenances fittings and cargo thereunto pertaining For the
personal crimes of the defendant consisting of violent and turbulent
conduct and notorious disregard of the laws of the realm he is fined in
the sum of one hundred pounds sterling and fifteen cases of gin I will
not ask you if you have anything to say But will you pay That is the
question

Grief shook his head

In the meantime Cornelius went on consider yourself a prisoner at
large There is no calaboose in which to confine you And finally it
has come to the knowledge of the Court that at an early hour of this
morning the defendant did wilfully and deliberately send Kanakas in his
employ out on the reef to catch fish for breakfast This is distinctly
an infringement of the rights of the fisherfolk of FituIva Home
industries must be protected This conduct of the defendant is severely
reprehended by the Court and on any repetition of the offence the
offender and offenders all and sundry shall be immediately put to hard
labour on the improvement of the Broom Road The court is dismissed

As they left the compound Peter Gee nudged Grief to look where Tui
Tulifau reclined on the mats The supercargos shirt stretched and
bulged already encased the royal fat




IV

The thing is clear said Peter Gee at a conference in Ieremias
house Deasy has about gathered in all the coin In the meantime he
keeps the king going on the gin hes captured on our vessels As soon
as he can maneuver it hell take the cash and skin out on your craft or
mine

He is a low fellow Ieremia declared pausing in the polishing of his
spectacles He is a scoundrel and a blackguard He should be struck by
a dead pig by a particularly dead pig

The very thing said Grief He shall be struck by a dead pig
Ieremia I should not be surprised if you were the man to strike him
with the dead pig Be sure and select a particularly dead one Tui
Tulifau is down at the boat house broaching a case of my Scotch Im
going up to the palace to work kitchen politics with the queen In the
meantime you get a few things on your shelves from the storeroom Ill
lend you some Hawkins And you Peter see the German store Start in
all of you selling for paper Remember Ill back the losses If
Im not mistaken in three days well have a national council or a
revolution You Ieremia start messengers around the island to the
fishers and farmers everywhere even to the mountain goathunters Tell
them to assemble at the palace three days from now

But the soldiers Ieremia objected

Ill take care of them They havent been paid for two months Besides
Uiliami is the queens brother Dont have too much on your shelves at a
time As soon as the soldiers show up with paper stop selling

Then will they burn the stores said Ieremia

Let them King Tulifau will pay for it if they do

Will he pay for my shirt Willie Smee demanded

That is purely a personal and private matter between you and Tui
Tulifau Grief answered

Its beginning to split up the back the supercargo lamented I
noticed that much this morning when he hadnt had it on ten minutes It
cost me thirty shillings and I only wore it once

Where shall I get a dead pig Ieremia asked

Kill one of course said Grief Kill a small one

A small one is worth ten shillings

Then enter it in your ledger under operating expenses Grief paused a
moment If you want it particularly dead it would be well to kill it
at once




V

You have spoken well Davida said Queen Sepeli This Fulualea has
brought a madness with him and Tui Tulifau is drowned in gin If he
does not grant the big council I shall give him a beating He is easy
to beat when he is in drink

She doubled up her fist and such were her Amazonian proportions and the
determination in her face that Grief knew the council would be called
So akin was the FituIvan tongue to the Samoan that he spoke it like a
native

And you Uiliami he said have pointed out that the soldiers have
demanded coin and refused the paper Fulualea has offered them Tell them
to take the paper and see that they be paid tomorrow

Why trouble Uiliami objected The king remains happily drunk There
is much money in the treasury And I am content In my house are two
cases of gin and much goods from Hawkinss store

Excellent pig O my brother Sepeli erupted Has not Davida spoken
Have you no ears When the gin and the goods in your house are gone and
no more traders come with gin and goods and Feathers of the Sun has run
away to Levuka with all the cash money of FituIva what then will you
do Cash money is silver and gold but paper is only paper I tell you
the people are grumbling There is no fish in the palace Yams and
sweet potatoes seem to have fled from the soil for they come not The
mountain dwellers have sent no wild goat in a week Though Feathers of
the Sun compels the traders to buy copra at the old price the people
sell not for they will have none of the paper money Only today have I
sent messengers to twenty houses There are no eggs Has Feathers of the
Sun put a blight upon the hens I do not know All I know is that there
are no eggs Well it is that those who drink much eat little else would
there be a palace famine Tell your soldiers to receive their pay Let
it be in his paper money

And remember Grief warned though there be selling in the stores
when the soldiers come with their paper it will be refused And in three
days will be the council and Feathers of the Sun will be as dead as a
dead pig




VI

The day of the council found the population of the island crowded into
the capital By canoe and whaleboat on foot and donkeyback the five
thousand inhabitants of FituIva had trooped in The three intervening
days had had their share of excitement At first there had been much
selling from the sparse shelves of the traders But when the soldiers
appeared their patronage was declined and they were told to go to
Fulualea for coin Says it not so on the face of the paper the
traders demanded that for the asking the coin will be given in
exchange

Only the strong authority of Uiliami had prevented the burning of the
traders houses As it was one of Griefs coprasheds went up in smoke
and was duly charged by Ieremia to the kings account Ieremia himself
had been abused and mocked and his spectacles broken The skin was
off Willie Smees knuckles This had been caused by three boisterous
soldiers who violently struck their jaws thereon in quick succession
Captain Boig was similarly injured Peter Gee had come off undamaged
because it chanced that it was breadbaskets and not jaws that struck
him on the fists

Tui Tulifau with Sepeli at his side and surrounded by his convivial
chiefs sat at the head of the council in the big compound His
right eye and jaw were swollen as if he too had engaged in assaulting
somebodys fist It was palace gossip that morning that Sepeli had
administered a conjugal beating At any rate her spouse was sober
and his fat bulged spiritlessly through the rips in Willie Smees silk
shirt His thirst was prodigious and he was continually served with
young drinking nuts Outside the compound held back by the army was
the mass of the common people Only the lesser chiefs village maids
village beaux and talking men with their staffs of office were
permitted inside Cornelius Deasy as befitted a high and favoured
official sat near to the right hand of the king On the left of the
queen opposite Cornelius and surrounded by the white traders he was
to represent sat Ieremia Bereft of his spectacles he peered
shortsightedly across at the Chancellor of the Exchequer

In turn the talking man of the windward coast the talking man of the
leeward coast and the talking man of the mountain villages each backed
by his group of lesser talking men and chiefs arose and made oration
What they said was much the same They grumbled about the paper money
Affairs were not prosperous No more copra was being smoked The people
were suspicious To such a pass had things come that all people wanted
to pay their debts and no one wanted to be paid Creditors made a
practice of running away from debtors The money was cheap Prices were
going up and commodities were getting scarce It cost three times the
ordinary price to buy a fowl and then it was tough and like to die
of old age if not immediately sold The outlook was gloomy There were
signs and omens There was a plague of rats in some districts The crops
were bad The custard apples were small The bestbearing avocado on the
windward coast had mysteriously shed all its leaves The taste had
gone from the mangoes The plantains were eaten by a worm The fish had
forsaken the ocean and vast numbers of tigersharks appeared The wild
goats had fled to inaccessible summits The poi in the poipits had
turned bitter There were rumblings in the mountains nightwalking
of spirits a woman of PuntaPuna had been struck speechless and a
fivelegged shegoat had been born in the village of Eiho And that all
was due to the strange money of Fulualea was the firm conviction of the
elders in the village councils assembled

Uiliami spoke for the army His men were discontented and mutinous
Though by royal decree the traders were bidden accept the money yet did
they refuse it He would not say but it looked as if the strange money
of Fulualea had something to do with it

Ieremia as talking man of the traders next spoke When he arose it
was noticeable that he stood with legs spraddled over a large grass
basket He dwelt upon the cloth of the traders its variety and beauty
and durability which so exceeded the FituIvan wetpounded tapa
fragile and coarse No one wore tapa any more Yet all had worn
tapa and nothing but tapa before the traders came There was the
mosquitonetting sold for a song that the cleverest FituIvan
netweaver could not duplicate in a thousand years He enlarged on the
incomparable virtues of rifles axes and steel fishhooks down through
needles thread and cotton fishlines to white flour and kerosene oil

He expounded at length with firstlies and secondlies and all minor
subdivisions of argument on organization and order and civilization
He contended that the trader was the bearer of civilization and that
the trader must be protected in his trade else he would not come Over
to the westward were islands which would not protect the traders What
was the result The traders would not come and the people were like
wild animals They wore no clothes no silk shirts here he peered and
blinked significantly at the king and they ate one another

The queer paper of the Feathers of the Sun was not money The traders
knew what money was and they would not receive it If FituIva
persisted in trying to make them receive it they would go away and never
come back And then the FituIvans who had forgotten how to make tapa
would run around naked and eat one another

Much more he said talking a solid hour and always coming back to what
their dire condition would be when the traders came no more And in
that day he perorated how will the FituIvan be known in the great
world Kaikanak will men call him Kiakanak Kaikanak

      Maneater

Tui Tulifau spoke briefly The case had been presented he said for the
people the army and the traders It was now time for Feathers of the
Sun to present his side It could not be denied that he had wrought
wonders with his financial system Many times has he explained to me
the working of his system Tui Tulif au concluded It is very simple
And now he will explain it to you

It was a conspiracy of the white traders Cornelius contended Ieremia
was right so far as concerned the manifold blessings of white flour
and kerosene oil FituIva did not want to become kaikanak FituIva
wanted civilization it wanted more and more civilization Now that was
the very point and they must follow him closely Paper money was an
earmark of higher civilization That was why he the Feathers of the
Sun had introduced it And that was why the traders opposed it They
did not want to see FituIva civilized Why did they come across the far
ocean stretches with their goods to FituIva He the Feathers of the
Sun would tell them why to their faces in grand council assembled In
their own countries men were too civilized to let the traders make the
immense profits that they made out of the FituIvans If the FituIvans
became properly civilized the trade of the traders would be gone In
that day every FituIvan could become a trader if he pleased

That was why the white traders fought the system of paper money that
he the Feathers of the Sun had brought Why was he called the Feathers
of the Sun Because he was the LightBringer from the World Beyond the
Sky The paper money was the light The robbing white traders could not
flourish in the light Therefore they fought the light

He would prove it to the good people of FituIva and he would prove
it out of the mouths of his enemies It was a wellknown fact that all
highly civilized countries had papermoney systems He would ask Ieremia
if this was not so

Ieremia did not answer

You see Cornelius went on he makes no answer He cannot deny what
is true England France Germany America all the great Papalangi
countries have the papermoney system It works From century to
century it works I challenge you Ieremia as an honest man as one
who was once a zealous worker in the Lords vineyard I challenge you to
deny that in the great Papalangi countries the system works

Ieremia could not deny and his fingers played nervously with the
fastening of the basket on his knees

You see it is as I have said Cornelius continued Ieremia agrees
that it is so Therefore I ask you all good people of FituIva if
a system is good for the Papalangi countries why is it not good for
FituIva

It is not the same Ieremia cried The paper of the Feathers of the
Sun is different from the paper of the great countries

That Cornelius had been prepared for this was evident He held up a
FituIvan note that was recognized by all

What is that he demanded

Paper mere paper was Ieremias reply

And that

This time Cornelius held up a Bank of England note

It is the paper money of the English he explained to the Council
at the same time extending it for Ieremia to examine Is it not true
Ieremia that it is paper money of the English

Ieremia nodded reluctantly

You have said that the paper money of FituIva was paper now how about
this of the English What is it You must answer like a true man
All wait for your answer Ieremia

It isit is the puzzled Ieremia began then spluttered
helplessly the fallacy beyond his penetration

Paper mere paper Cornelius concluded for him imitating his halting
utterance

Conviction sat on the faces of all The king clapped his hands
admiringly and murmured It is most clear very clear

You see he himself acknowledges it Assured triumph was in Deasys
voice and bearing He knows of no difference There is no difference
Tis the very image of money Tis money itself

In the meantime Grief was whispering in Ieremias ear who nodded and
began to speak

But it is well known to all the Papalangi that the English Government
will pay coin money for the paper

Deasys victory was now absolute He held aloft a FituIvan note

Is it not so written on this paper as well

Again Grief whispered

That FituIva will pay coin money asked Ieremia

It is so written

A third time Grief prompted

On demand asked Ieremia

On demand Cornelius assured him

Then I demand coin money now said Ieremia drawing a small package of
notes from the pouch at his girdle

Cornelius scanned the package with a quick estimating eye

Very well he agreed I shall give you the coin money now How much

And we will see the system work the king proclaimed partaking in his
Chancellors triumph

You have heardHe will give coin money now Ieremia cried in a loud
voice to the assemblage

At the same time he plunged both hands in the basket and drew forth many
packages of FituIvan notes It was noticed that a peculiar odour was
adrift about the council

I have here Ieremia announced one thousand and twentyeight pounds
twelve shillings and sixpence Here is a sack to put the coin money in

Cornelius recoiled He had not expected such a sum and everywhere about
the council his uneasy eyes showed him chiefs and talking men drawing
out bundles of notes The army its two months pay in its hands
pressed forward to the edge of the council while behind it the
populace with more money invaded the compound

Tis a run on the bank youve precipitated he said reproachfully to
Grief

Here is the sack to put the coin money in Ieremia urged

It must be postponed Cornelius said desperately Tis not in banking
hours

Ieremia flourished a package of money Nothing of banking hours is
written here It says on demand and I now demand

Let them come tomorrow O Tui Tulifau Cornelius appealed to the
king They shall be paid tomorrow

Tui Tulifau hesitated but his spouse glared at him her brawny arm
tensing as the fist doubled into a redoubtable knot Tui Tulifau tried
to look away but failed He cleared his throat nervously

We will see the system work he decreed The people have come far

Tis good money youre asking me to pay out Deasy muttered in a low
voice to the king

Sepeli caught what he said and grunted so savagely as to startle the
king who involuntarily shrank away from her

Forget not the pig Grief whispered to Ieremia who immediately stood
up

With a sweeping gesture he stilled the babel of voices that was
beginning to rise

It was an ancient and honourable custom of FituIva he said that
when a man was proved a notorious evildoer his joints were broken with
a club and he was staked out at low water to be fed upon alive by the
sharks Unfortunately that day is past Nevertheless another ancient
and honourable custom remains with us You all know what it is When a
man is a proven thief and liar he shall be struck with a dead pig

His right hand went into the basket and despite the lack of his
spectacles the dead pig that came into view landed accurately on
Deasys neck With such force was it thrown that the Chancellor in
his sitting position toppled over sidewise Before he could recover
Sepeli with an agility unexpected of a woman who weighed two hundred
and sixty pounds had sprung across to him One hand clutched his shirt
collar the other hand brandished the pig and amid the vast uproar of a
delighted kingdom she royally swatted him

There remained nothing for Tui Tulifau but to put a good face on his
favourites disgrace and his mountainous fat lay back on the mats and
shook in a gale of Gargantuan laughter

When Sepeli dropped both pig and Chancellor a talking man from the
windward coast picked up the carcass Cornelius was on his feet and
running when the pig caught him on the legs and tripped him The people
and the army with shouts and laughter joined in the sport

Twist and dodge as he would everywhere the exChancellor of the
Exchequer was met or overtaken by the flying pig He scuttled like a
frightened rabbit in and out among the avocados and the palms No hand
was laid upon him and his tormentors made way before him but ever they
pursued and ever the pig flew as fast as hands could pick it up

As the chase died away down the Broom Road Grief led the traders to the
royal treasury and the day was well over ere the last FituIvan bank
note had been redeemed with coin




VII

Through the mellow cool of twilight a man paddled out from a clump of
jungle to the Cantani It was a leaky and abandoned dugout and he
paddled slowly desisting from time to time in order to bale The
Kanaka sailors giggled gleefully as he came alongside and painfully
drew himself over the rail He was bedraggled and filthy and seemed
halfdazed

Could I speak a word with you Mr Grief he asked sadly and humbly

Sit to leeward and farther away Grief answered A little farther
away Thats better

Cornelius sat down on the rail and held his head in both his hands

Tis right he said Im as fragrant as a recent battlefield My head
aches to burstin My neck is fair broken The teeth are loose in my
jaws Theres nests of hornets buzzin in my ears My medulla oblongata
is dislocated Ive been through earthquake and pestilence and the
heavens have rained pigs He paused with a sigh that ended in a groan
Tis a vision of terrible death One that the poets never dreamed To
be eaten by rats or boiled in oil or pulled apart by wild horsesthat
would be unpleasant But to be beaten to death with a dead pig
 He shuddered at the awfulness of it Sure it transcends the human
imagination

Captain Boig sniffed audibly moved his canvas chair farther to
windward and sat down again

I hear youre runnin over to Yap Mr Grief Cornelius went on An
two things Im wantin to beg of you a passage an the nip of the old
smoky I refused the night you landed

Grief clapped his hands for the black steward and ordered soap and
towels

Go forard Cornelius and take a scrub first he said The boy will
bring you a pair of dungarees and a shirt And by the way before you
go how was it we found more coin in the treasury than paper you had
issued

Twas the stake of my own Id brought with me for the adventure

Weve decided to charge the demurrage and other expenses and loss to
Tui Tulifau Grief said So the balance we found will be turned over
to you But ten shillings must be deducted

For what

Do you think dead pigs grow on trees The sum of ten shillings for that
pig is entered in the accounts

Cornelius bowed his assent with a shudder

Sure its grateful I am it wasnt a fifteenshilling pig or a
twentyshilling one





Chapter EightTHE PEARLS OF PARLAY




I

The Kanaka helmsman put the wheel down and the Malahini slipped into
the eye of the wind and righted to an even keel Her headsails emptied
there was a rattat of reefpoints and quick shifting of boomtackles
and she was heeled over and filled away on the other tack Though it was
early morning and the wind brisk the five white men who lounged on
the poopdeck were scantily clad David Grief and his guest Gregory
Mulhall an Englishman were still in pajamas their naked feet thrust
into Chinese slippers The captain and mate were in thin undershirts and
unstarched duck pants while the supercargo still held in his hands
the undershirt he was reluctant to put on The sweat stood out on his
forehead and he seemed to thrust his bare chest thirstily into the wind
that did not cool

Pretty muggy for a breeze like this he complained

And whats it doing around in the west Thats what I want to know
 was Griefs contribution to the general plaint

It wont last and it aint been there long said Hermann the Holland
mate She is been chop around all nightfive minutes here ten minutes
there one hour somewhere other quarter

Something makin  something makin  Captain Warfield croaked
spreading his bushy beard with the fingers of both hands and shoving
the thatch of his chin into the breeze in a vain search for coolness
Weathers been crazy for a fortnight Havent had the proper trades in
three weeks Everythings mixed up Barometer was pumping at sunset last
night and its pumping now though the weather sharps say it dont mean
anything All the same Ive got a prejudice against seeing it pump
Gets on my nerves sort of you know She was pumping that way the time
we lost the Lancaster I was only an apprentice but I can remember
that well enough Brand new fourmasted steel ship first voyage broke
the old mans heart Hed been forty years in the company Just faded
way and died the next year

Despite the wind and the early hour the heat was suffocating The wind
whispered coolness but did not deliver coolness It might have blown
off the Sahara save for the extreme humidity with which it was laden
There was no fog nor mist nor hint of fog or mist yet the dimness of
distance produced the impression There were no defined clouds yet
so thickly were the heavens covered by a messy cloudpall that the sun
failed to shine through

Ready about Captain Warfield ordered with slow sharpness

The brown breechclouted Kanaka sailors moved languidly but quickly to
headsheets and boomtackles

Hard alee

The helmsman ran the spokes over with no hint of gentling and the
Malahini darted prettily into the wind and about

Jove shes a witch was Mulhalls appreciation I didnt know you
South Sea traders sailed yachts

She was a Gloucester fisherman originally Grief explained and
the Gloucester boats are all yachts when it comes to build rig and
sailing

But youre heading right inwhy dont you make it came the
Englishmans criticism

Try it Captain Warfield Grief suggested Show him what a lagoon
entrance is on a strong ebb

Closeandby the captain ordered

Closeandby the Kanaka repeated easing half a spoke

The Malahini laid squarely into the narrow passage which was the
lagoon entrance of a large long and narrow oval of an atoll The
atoll was shaped as if three atolls in the course of building had
collided and coalesced and failed to rear the partition walls Cocoanut
palms grew in spots on the circle of sand and there were many gaps
where the sand was too low to the sea for cocoanuts and through which
could be seen the protected lagoon where the water lay flat like the
ruffled surface of a mirror Many square miles of water were in the
irregular lagoon all of which surged out on the ebb through the one
narrow channel So narrow was the channel so large the outflow of
water that the passage was more like the rapids of a river than the
mere tidal entrance to an atoll The water boiled and whirled and
swirled and drove outward in a white foam of stiff serrated waves Each
heave and blow on her bows of the upstanding waves of the current swung
the Malahini off the straight lead and wedged her as with wedges of
steel toward the side of the passage Part way in she was when her
closeness to the coral edge compelled her to go about On the opposite
tack broadside to the current she swept seaward with the currents
speed

Nows the time for that new and expensive engine of yours Grief
jeered goodnaturedly

That the engine was a sore point with Captain Warfield was patent He
had begged and badgered for it until in the end Grief had given his
consent

It will pay for itself yet the captain retorted You wait and
see It beats insurance and you know the underwriters wont stand for
insurance in the Paumotus

Grief pointed to a small cutter beating up astern of them on the same
course

Ill wager a fivefranc piece the little Nuhiva beats us in

Sure Captain Warfield agreed Shes overpowered Were like a liner
alongside of her and weve only got forty horsepower Shes got ten
horse and shes a little skimming dish She could skate across the
froth of hell but just the same she cant buck this current Its
running ten knots right now

And at the rate of ten knots buffeted and jerkily rolled the
Malahini went out to sea with the tide

Shell slacken in half an hourthen well make headway Captain
Warfield said with an irritation explained by his next words He has
no right to call it Parlay Its down on the admiralty charts and the
French charts too as Hikihoho Bougainville discovered it and named it
from the natives

Whats the name matter the supercargo demanded taking advantage of
speech to pause with arms shoved into the sleeves of the undershirt
There it is right under our nose and old Parlay is there with the
pearls

Who see them pearl Hermann queried looking from one to another

Its well known was the supercargos reply He turned to the
steersman TaiHotauri what about old Parlays pearls

The Kanaka pleased and selfconscious took and gave a spoke

My brother dive for Parlay three four month and he make much talk
about pearl Hikihoho very good place for pearl

And the pearlbuyers have never got him to part with a pearl the
captain broke in

And they say he had a hatful for Armande when he sailed for Tahiti
 the supercargo carried on the tale Thats fifteen years ago and hes
been adding to it ever sincestored the shell as well Everybodys seen
thathundreds of tons of it They say the lagoons fished clean now
Maybe thats why hes announced the auction

If he really sells this will be the biggest years output of pearls in
the Paumotus Grief said

I say now look here Mulhall burst forth harried by the humid
heat as much as the rest of them Whats it all about Whos the old
beachcomber anyway What are all these pearls Why so secretious about
it

Hikihoho belongs to old Parlay the supercargo answered Hes got a
fortune in pearls saved up for years and years and he sent the word
out weeks ago that hed auction them off to the buyers tomorrow See
those schooners masts sticking up inside the lagoon

Eight so I see said Hermann

What are they doing in a dinky atoll like this the supercargo went
on There isnt a schoonerload of copra a year in the place Theyve
come for the auction Thats why were here Thats why the little
Nuhivas bumping along astern there though what she can buy is beyond
me Narii Herringhes an English Jew halfcasteowns and runs her
and his only assets are his nerve his debts and his whiskey bills
Hes a genius in such things He owes so much that there isnt a
merchant in Papeete who isnt interested in his welfare They go out of
their way to throw work in his way Theyve got to and a dandy stunt it
is for Narii Now I owe nobody Whats the result If I fell down in
a fit on the beach theyd let me lie there and die They wouldnt lose
anything But Narii Herringwhat wouldnt they do if he fell in a fit
Their best wouldnt be too good for him Theyve got too much money
tied up in him to let him lie Theyd take him into their homes and
handnurse him like a brother Let me tell you honesty in paying bills
aint what its cracked up to be

Whats this Narii chap got to do with it was the Englishmans
shorttempered demand And turning to Grief he said Whats all this
pearl nonsense Begin at the beginning

Youll have to help me out Grief warned the others as he began Old
Parlay is a character From what Ive seen of him I believe hes partly
and mildly insane Anyway heres the story Parlays a fullblooded
Frenchman He told me once that he came from Paris His accent is the
true Parisian He arrived down here in the old days Went to trading
and all the rest Thats how he got in on Hikihoho Came in trading when
trading was the real thing About a hundred miserable Paumotans lived
on the island He married the queennative fashion When she died
everything was his Measles came through and there werent more than a
dozen survivors He fed them and worked them and was king Now before
the queen died she gave birth to a girl Thats Armande When she was
three he sent her to the convent at Papeete When she was seven or eight
he sent her to France You begin to glimpse the situation The best
and most aristocratic convent in France was none too good for the only
daughter of a Paumotan island king and capitalist and you know the old
country French draw no colour line She was educated like a princess
and she accepted herself in much the same way Also she thought she was
allwhite and never dreamed of a bar sinister

Now comes the tragedy The old man had always been cranky and erratic
and hed played the despot on Hikihoho so long that hed got the idea
in his head that there was nothing wrong with the kingor the princess
either When Armande was eighteen he sent for her He had slews and
slathers of money as Yankee Bill would say Hed built the big house on
Hikihoho and a whacking fine bungalow in Papeete She was to arrive on
the mail boat from New Zealand and he sailed in his schooner to meet
her at Papeete And he might have carried the situation off despite the
hens and bullbeasts of Papeete if it hadnt been for the hurricane
That was the year wasnt it when ManuHuhi was swept and eleven
hundred drowned

The others nodded and Captain Warfield said I was in the Magpie
that blow and we went ashore all hands and the cook Magpie and all
a quarter of a mile into the cocoanuts at the head of Taiohae Bayand
it a supposedly hurricaneproof harbour

Well Grief continued old Parlay got caught in the same blow and
arrived in Papeete with his hatful of pearls three weeks too late Hed
had to jack up his schooner and build half a mile of ways before he
could get her back into the sea

And in the meantime there was Armande at Papeete Nobody called on her
She did French fashion make the initial calls on the Governor and the
port doctor They saw her but neither of their henwives was at home to
her nor returned the call She was out of caste without caste though
she had never dreamed it and that was the gentle way they broke the
information to her There was a gay young lieutenant on the French
cruiser He lost his heart to her but not his head You can imagine
the shock to this young woman refined beautiful raised like an
aristocrat pampered with the best of old France that money could buy
And you can guess the end He shrugged his shoulders There was a
Japanese servant in the bungalow He saw it Said she did it with the
proper spirit of the Samurai Took a stilettono thrust no drive
no wild rush for annihilationtook the stiletto placed the point
carefully against her heart and with both hands slowly and steadily
pressed home

Old Parlay arrived after that with his pearls There was one single one
of them they say worth sixty thousand francs Peter Gee saw it and
has told me he offered that much for it The old man went clean off for
a while They had him straitjacketed in the Colonial Club two days

His wifes uncle an old Paumotan cut him out of the jacket and turned
him loose the supercargo corroborated

And then old Parlay proceeded to eat things up Grief went on Pumped
three bullets into the scalawag of a lieutenant

Who lay in sick bay for three months Captain Warfield contributed

Flung a glass of wine in the Governors face fought a duel with the
port doctor beat up his native servants wrecked the hospital broke
two ribs and the collarbone of a man nurse and escaped and went down
to his schooner a gun in each hand daring the chief of police and all
the gendarmes to arrest him and sailed for Hikihoho And they say hes
never left the island since

The supercargo nodded That was fifteen years ago and hes never
budged

And added to his pearls said the captain Hes a blithering old
lunatic Makes my flesh creep Hes a regular Finn

Whats that Mulhall inquired

Bosses the weatherthats what the natives believe at any rate Ask
TaiHotauri there Hey TaiHotauri what you think old Parlay do along
weather

Just the same one big weather devil came the Kanakas answer I
know He want big blow he make big blow He want no wind no wind
come

A regular old Warlock said Mulhall

No good luck them pearl TaiHotauri blurted out rolling his head
ominously He say he sell Plenty schooner come Then he make big
hurricane everybody finish you see All native men say so

Its hurricane season now Captain Warfield laughed morosely
Theyre not far wrong Its making for something right now and Id
feel better if the Malahini was a thousand miles away from here

He is a bit mad Grief concluded Ive tried to get his point of
view Itswell its mixed For eighteen years hed centred everything
on Armande Half the time he believes shes still alive not yet come
back from France Thats one of the reasons he held on to the pearls
And all the time he hates white men He never forgets they killed her
though a great deal of the time he forgets shes dead Hello Wheres
your wind

The sails bellied emptily overhead and Captain Warfield grunted his
disgust Intolerable as the heat had been in the absence of wind it
was almost overpowering The sweat oozed out on all their faces and now
one and again another drew deep breaths involuntarily questing for
more air

Here she comes againan eight point haul Boomtackles across Jump

The Kanakas sprang to the captains orders and for five minutes the
schooner laid directly into the passage and even gained on the current
Again the breeze fell flat then puffed from the old quarter compelling
a shift back of sheets and tackles

Here comes the Nuhiva Grief said Shes got her engine on Look at
her skim

All ready the captain asked the engineer a Portuguese halfcaste
whose head and shoulders protruded from the small hatch just forard of
the cabin and who wiped the sweat from his face with a bunch of greasy
waste

Sure he replied

Then let her go

The engineer disappeared into his den and a moment later the exhaust
muffler coughed and spluttered overside But the schooner could not hold
her lead The little cutter made three feet to her two and was quickly
alongside and forging ahead Only natives were on her deck and the man
steering waved his hand in derisive greeting and farewell

Thats Narii Herring Grief told Mulhall The big fellow at the
wheelthe nerviest and most conscienceless scoundrel in the Paumotus

Five minutes later a cry of joy from their own Kanakas centred all eyes
on the Nuhiva Her engine had broken down and they were overtaking
her The Malahinis sailors sprang into the rigging and jeered as they
went by the little cutter heeled over by the wind with a bone in her
teeth going backward on the tide

Some engine that of ours Grief approved as the lagoon opened before
them and the course was changed across it to the anchorage

Captain Warfield was visibly cheered though he merely grunted Itll
pay for itself never fear

The Malahini ran well into the centre of the little fleet ere she
found swinging room to anchor

Theres Isaacs on the Dolly Grief observed with a hand wave of
greeting And Peter Gees on the Roberta Couldnt keep him away from
a pearl sale like this And theres Francini on the Cactus Theyre
all here all the buyers Old Parlay will surely get a price

They havent repaired the engine yet Captain Warfield grumbled
gleefully

He was looking across the lagoon to where the Nuhivas sails showed
through the sparse cocoanuts




II

The house of Parlay was a big twostory frame affair built of
California lumber with a galvanized iron roof So disproportionate
was it to the slender ring of the atoll that it showed out upon the
sandstrip and above it like some monstrous excrescence They of the
Malahini paid the courtesy visit ashore immediately after anchoring
Other captains and buyers were in the big room examining the pearls that
were to be auctioned next day Paumotan servants natives of Hikihoho
and relatives of the owner moved about dispensing whiskey and absinthe
And through the curious company moved Parlay himself cackling and
sneering the withered wreck of what had once been a tall and powerful
man His eyes were deep sunken and feverish his cheeks fallen in and
cavernous The hair of his head seemed to have come out in patches and
his mustache and imperial had shed in the same lopsided way

Jove Mulhall muttered under his breath A longlegged Napoleon the
Third but burnt out baked and firecrackled And mangy No wonder he
crooks his head to one side Hes got to keep the balance

Goin to have a blow was the old mans greeting to Grief You must
think a lot of pearls to come a day like this

Theyre worth going to inferno for Grief laughed genially back
running his eyes over the surface of the table covered by the display

Other men have already made that journey for them old Parlay cackled
See this one He pointed to a large perfect pearl the size of a small
walnut that lay apart on a piece of chamois They offered me sixty
thousand francs for it in Tahiti Theyll bid as much and more for it
tomorrow if they arent blown away Well that pearl it was found by
my cousin my cousin by marriage He was a native you see Also he
was a thief He hid it It was mine His cousin who was also my
cousinwere all related herekilled him for it and fled away in a
cutter to NooNau I pursued but the chief of NooNau had killed him
for it before I got there Oh yes there are many dead men represented
on the table there Have a drink Captain Your face is not familiar
You are new in the islands

Its Captain Robinson of the Roberta Grief said introducing them

In the meantime Mulhall had shaken hands with Peter Gee

I never fancied there were so many pearls in the world Mulhall said

Nor have I ever seen so many together at one time Peter Gee admitted

What ought they to be worth

Fifty or sixty thousand poundsand thats to us buyers In
Paris He shrugged his shoulders and lifted his eyebrows at the
incommunicableness of the sum

Mulhall wiped the sweat from his eyes All were sweating profusely
and breathing hard There was no ice in the drink that was served and
whiskey and absinthe went down lukewarm

Yes yes Parlay was cackling Many dead men lie on the table
there I know those pearls all of them You see those three Perfectly
matched arent they A diver from Easter Island got them for me inside
a week Next week a shark got him took his arm off and blood poison did
the business And that big baroque therenothing muchif Im
offered twenty francs for it tomorrow Ill be in luck it came out of
twentytwo fathoms of water The man was from Raratonga He broke all
diving records He got it out of twentytwo fathoms I saw him And he
burst his lungs at the same time or got the bends for he died in two
hours He died screaming They could hear him for miles He was the most
powerful native I ever saw Half a dozen of my divers have died of the
bends And more men will die more men will die

Oh hush your croaking Parlay chided one of the captains It aint
going to blow

If I was a strong man I couldnt get up hook and get out fast enough
 the old man retorted in the falsetto of age Not if I was a strong man
with the taste for wine yet in my mouth But not you Youll all stay I
wouldnt advise you if I thought youd go You cant drive buzzards away
from the carrion Have another drink my brave sailormen Well well
what men will dare for a few little oyster drops There they are the
beauties Auction tomorrow at ten sharp Old Parlays selling out and
the buzzards are gatheringold Parlay who was a stronger man in his day
than any of them and who will see most of them dead yet

If he isnt a vile old beast the supercargo of the Malahini
whispered to Peter Gee

What if she does blow said the captain of the Dolly Hikihohos
never been swept

The more reason she will be then Captain Warfield answered back I
wouldnt trust her

Whos croaking now Grief reproved

Id hate to lose that new engine before it paid for itself Captain
Warfield replied gloomily

Parlay skipped with astonishing nimbleness across the crowded room to
the barometer on the wall

Take a look my brave sailormen he cried exultantly

The man nearest read the glass The sobering effect showed plainly on
his face

Its dropped ten was all he said yet every face went anxious and
there was a look as if every man desired immediately to start for the
door

Listen Parlay commanded

In the silence the outer surf seemed to have become unusually loud
There was a great rumbling roar

A big sea is beginning to set some one said and there was a movement
to the windows where all gathered

Through the sparse cocoanuts they gazed seaward An orderly succession
of huge smooth seas was rolling down upon the coral shore For some
minutes they gazed on the strange sight and talked in low voices and in
those few minutes it was manifest to all that the waves were increasing
in size It was uncanny this rising sea in a dead calm and their
voices unconsciously sank lower Old Parlay shocked them with his abrupt
cackle

There is yet time to get away to sea brave gentlemen You can tow
across the lagoon with your whaleboats

Its all right old man said Darling the mate of the Cactus a
stalwart youngster of twentyfive The blows to the southward and
passing on Well not get a whiff of it

An air of relief went through the room Conversations were started and
the voices became louder Several of the buyers even went back to the
table to continue the examination of the pearls

Parlays shrill cackle rose higher

Thats right he encouraged If the world was coming to an end youd
go on buying

Well buy these tomorrow just the same Isaacs assured him

Then youll be doing your buying in hell

The chorus of incredulous laughter incensed the old man He turned
fiercely on Darling

Since when have children like you come to the knowledge of storms And
who is the man who has plotted the hurricanecourses of the Paumotus
What books will you find it in I sailed the Paumotus before the oldest
of you drew breath I know To the eastward the paths of the hurricanes
are on so wide a circle they make a straight line To the westward here
they make a sharp curve Remember your chart How did it happen the
hurricane of  swept Auri and Hiolau The curve my brave boy the
curve In an hour or two or three at most will come the wind Listen
to that

A vast rumbling crash shook the coral foundations of the atoll The
house quivered to it The native servants with bottles of whiskey and
absinthe in their hands shrank together as if for protection and stared
with fear through the windows at the mighty wash of the wave lapping far
up the beach to the corner of a coprashed

Parlay looked at the barometer giggled and leered around at his
guests Captain Warfield strode across to see

 he read Shes gone down five more By God the old devils
right Shes acoming and its me for one for aboard

Its growing dark Isaacs half whispered

Jove its like a stage Mulhall said to Grief looking at his watch
Ten oclock in the morning and its like twilight Down go the lights
for the tragedy Wheres the slow music

In answer another rumbling crash shook the atoll and the house Almost
in a panic the company started for the door In the dim light their
sweaty faces appeared ghastly Isaacs panted asthmatically in the
suffocating heat

Whats your haste Parlay chuckled and girded at his departing guests
A last drink brave gentlemen No one noticed him As they took the
shellbordered path to the beach he stuck his head out the door and
called Dont forget gentlemen at ten tomorrow old Parlay sells his
pearls




III

On the beach a curious scene took place Whaleboat after whaleboat was
being hurriedly manned and shoved off It had grown still darker The
stagnant calm continued and the sand shook under their feet with each
buffet of the sea on the outer shore Narii Herring walked leisurely
along the sand He grinned at the very evident haste of the captains and
buyers With him were three of his Kanakas and also TaiHotauri

Get into the boat and take an oar Captain Warfield ordered the
latter

TaiHotauri came over jauntily while Narii Herring and his three
Kanakas paused and looked on from forty feet away

I work no more for you skipper TaiHotauri said insolently and
loudly But his face belied his words for he was guilty of a
prodigious wink Fire me skipper he huskily whispered with a second
significant wink

Captain Warfield took the cue and proceeded to do some acting himself
He raised his fist and his voice

Get into that boat he thundered or Ill knock seven bells out of
you

The Kanaka drew back truculently and Grief stepped between to placate
his captain

I go to work on the Nuhiva TaiHotauri said rejoining the other
group

Come back here the captain threatened

Hes a free man skipper Narii Herring spoke up Hes sailed with me
in the past and hes sailing again thats all

Come on we must get on board Grief urged Look how dark its
getting

Captain Warfield gave in but as the boat shoved off he stood up in the
sternsheets and shook his fist ashore

Ill settle with you yet Narii he cried Youre the only skipper in
the group that steals other mens sailors He sat down and in lowered
voice queried Now whats TaiHotauri up to Hes on to something but
what is it




IV

As the boat came alongside the Malahini Hermanns anxious face
greeted them over the rail

Bottom out fall from barometer he announced Shes goin to blow I
got starboard anchor overhaul

Overhaul the big one too Captain Warfield ordered taking charge
And here some of you hoist in this boat Lower her down to the deck
and lash her bottom up

Men were busy at work on the decks of all the schooners There was a
great clanking of chains being overhauled and now one craft and
now another hove in veered and dropped a second anchor Like the
Malahini those that had third anchors were preparing to drop them
when the wind showed what quarter it was to blow from

The roar of the big surf continually grew though the lagoon lay in the
mirrorlike calm

There was no sign of life where Parlays big house perched on the sand
Boat and coprasheds and the sheds where the shell was stored were
deserted

For two cents Id up anchors and get out Grief said Id do it
anyway if it were open sea But those chains of atolls to the north and
east have us pocketed Weve a better chance right here What do you
think Captain Warfield

I agree with you though a lagoon is no millpond for riding it out
I wonder where shes going to start from Hello There goes one of
Parlays coprasheds

They could see the grassthatched shed lift and collapse while a froth
of foam cleared the crest of the sand and ran down to the lagoon

Breached across Mulhall exclaimed Thats something for a starter
There she comes again

The wreck of the shed was now flung up and left on the sandcrest A
third wave buffeted it into fragments which washed down the slope toward
the lagoon

If she blow I would as be cooler yet Hermann grunted No longer can
I breathe It is damn hot I am dry like a stove

He chopped open a drinking cocoanut with his heavy sheathknife and
drained the contents The rest of them followed his example pausing
once to watch one of Parlays shell sheds go down in ruin The barometer
now registered 

Must be pretty close to the centre of the area of low pressure Grief
remarked cheerfully I was never through the eye of a hurricane before
It will be an experience for you too Mulhall From the speed the
barometers dropped its going to be a big one

Captain Warfield groaned and all eyes drew to him He was looking
through the glasses down the length of the lagoon to the southeast

There she comes he said quietly

They did not need glasses to see A flying film strangely marked
seemed drawing over the surface of the lagoon Abreast of it along the
atoll travelling with equal speed was a stiff bending of the cocoanut
palms and a blur of flying leaves The front of the wind on the water
was a solid sharply defined strip of darkcoloured windvexed water
In advance of this strip like skirmishers were flashes of windflaws
Behind this strip a quarter of a mile in width was a strip of what
seemed glassy calm Next came another dark strip of wind and behind
that the lagoon was all crisping boiling whiteness

What is that calm streak Mulhall asked

Calm Warfield answered

But it travels as fast as the wind was the others objection

It has to or it would be overtaken and it wouldnt be any calm Its
a doubleheader I saw a big squall like that off Savaii once A regular
doubleheader Smash it hit us then it lulled to nothing and smashed
us a second time Stand by and hold on Here she is on top of us Look
at the Roberta

The Roberta lying nearest to the wind at slack chains was swept off
broadside like a straw Then her chains brought her up bow on to the
wind with an astonishing jerk Schooner after schooner the Malahini
with them was now sweeping away with the first gust and fetching up
on taut chains Mulhall and several of the Kanakas were taken off their
feet when the Malahini jerked to her anchors

And then there was no wind The flying calm streak had reached
them Grief lighted a match and the unshielded flame burned without
flickering in the still air A very dim twilight prevailed The
cloudsky lowering as it had been for hours seemed now to have
descended quite down upon the sea

The Roberta tightened to her chains when the second head of the
hurricane hit as did schooner after schooner in swift succession The
sea white with fury boiled in tiny spitting wavelets The deck of the
Malahini vibrated under the mens feet The tautstretched halyards
beat a tattoo against the masts and all the rigging as if smote by
some mighty hand set up a wild thrumming It was impossible to face the
wind and breathe Mulhall crouching with the others behind the shelter
of the cabin discovered this and his lungs were filled in an instant
with so great a volume of driven air which he could not expel that he
nearly strangled ere he could turn his head away

Its incredible he gasped but no one heard him

Hermann and several Kanakas were crawling forard on hands and knees to
let go the third anchor Grief touched Captain Warfield and pointed to
the Roberta She was dragging down upon them Warfield put his mouth
to Griefs ear and shouted

Were dragging too

Grief sprang to the wheel and put it hard over veering the Mahhini
to port The third anchor took hold and the Roberta went by
sternfirst a dozen yards away They waved their hands to Peter Gee
and Captain Robinson who with a number of sailors were at work on the
bow

Hes knocking out the shackles Grief shouted Going to chance the
passage Got to Anchors skating

Were holding now came the answering shout There goes the Cactus
down on the Misi That settles them

The Misi had been holding but the added windage of the Cactus
was too much and the entangled schooners slid away across the boiling
white Their men could be seen chopping and fighting to get them apart
The Roberta cleared of her anchors with a patch of tarpaulin set
forard was heading for the passage at the northwestern end of the
lagoon They saw her make it and drive out to sea But the Misi and
Cactus unable to get clear of each other went ashore on the atoll
half a mile from the passage The wind merely increased on itself and
continued to increase To face the full blast of it required all ones
strength and several minutes of crawling on deck against it tired a man
to exhaustion Hermann with his Kanakas plodded steadily lashing and
making secure putting ever more gaskets on the sails The wind ripped
and tore their thin undershirts from their backs They moved slowly as
if their bodies weighed tons never releasing a handhold until another
had been secured Loose ends of rope stood out stiffly horizontal and
when a whipping gave the loose end frazzled and blew away

Mulhall touched one and then another and pointed to the shore The
grasssheds had disappeared and Parlays house rocked drunkenly
Because the wind blew lengthwise along the atoll the house had been
sheltered by the miles of cocoanut trees But the big seas breaking
across from outside were undermining it and hammering it to pieces
Already tilted down the slope of sand its end was imminent Here and
there in the cocoanut trees people had lashed themselves The trees did
not sway or thresh about Bent over rigidly from the wind they remained
in that position and vibrated monstrously Underneath across the sand
surged the white spume of the breakers A big sea was likewise making
down the length of the lagoon It had plenty of room to kick up in
the tenmile stretch from the windward rim of the atoll and all the
schooners were bucking and plunging into it The Malahini had begun
shoving her bow and focsle head under the bigger ones and at times
her waist was filled railhigh with water

Nows the time for your engine Grief bellowed and Captain Warfield
crawling over to where the engineer lay shouted emphatic commands

Under the engine going full speed ahead the Malahini behaved better
While she continued to ship seas over her bow she was not jerked down
so fiercely by her anchors On the other hand she was unable to get any
slack in the chains The best her forty horsepower could do was to ease
the strain

Still the wind increased The little Nuhiva lying abreast of the
Malahini and closer in to the beach her engine still unrepaired and
her captain ashore was having a bad time of it She buried herself so
frequently and so deeply that they wondered each time if she could clear
herself of the water At three in the afternoon buried by a second sea
before she could free herself of the preceding one she did not come up

Mulhall looked at Grief

Burst in her hatches was the bellowed answer

Captain Warfield pointed to the Winifred a little schooner plunging
and burying outside of them and shouted in Griefs ear His voice came
in patches of dim words with intervals of silence when whisked away by
the roaring wind

Rotten little tub Anchors hold But how she holds together Old
as the ark

An hour later Hermann pointed to her Her forard bitts foremast and
most of her bow were gone having been jerked out of her by her anchors
She swung broadside rolling in the trough and settling by the head and
in this plight was swept away to leeward

Five vessels now remained and of them the Malahini was the only one
with an engine Fearing either the Nuhivas or the Winifdreds
fate two of them followed the Robertas example knocking out the
chainshackles and running for the passage The Dolly was the first
but her tarpaulin was carried away and she went to destruction on the
leerim of the atoll near the Misi and the Cactus Undeterred by
this the Moana let go and followed with the same result

Pretty good engine that eh Captain Warfield yelled to his owner

Grief put out his hand and shook Shes paying for herself he yelled
back The winds shifting around to the southward and we ought to lie
easier

Slowly and steadily but with everincreasing velocity the wind veered
around to the south and the southwest till the three schooners that
were left pointed directly in toward the beach The wreck of Parlays
house was picked up hurled into the lagoon and blown out upon them
Passing the Malahini it crashed into the Papara lying a quarter of
a mile astern There was wild work forard on her and in a quarter of
an hour the house went clear but it had taken the Paparas foremast
and bowsprit with it

Inshore on their port bow lay the Tahaa slim and yachtlike
but excessively oversparred Her anchors still held but her captain
finding no abatement in the wind proceeded to reduce windage by
chopping down his masts

Pretty good engine that Grief congratulated his skipper It will
save our sticks for us yet

Captain Warfield shook his head dubiously

The sea on the lagoon went swiftly down with the change of wind but
they were beginning to feel the heave and lift of the outer sea breaking
across the atoll There were not so many trees remaining Some had been
broken short off others uprooted One tree they saw snap off halfway
up three persons clinging to it and whirl away by the wind into the
lagoon Two detached themselves from it and swam to the Tahaa Not
long after just before darkness they saw one jump overboard from that
schooners stern and strike out strongly for the Malahini through the
white spitting wavelets

Its TaiHotauri was Griefs judgment Now well have the news

The Kanaka caught the bobstay climbed over the bow and crawled aft
Time was given him to breathe and then behind the part shelter of the
cabin in broken snatches and largely by signs he told his story

Narii damn robber He want steal pearls Kill Parlay One
man kill Parlay No man know what man Three Kanakas Narii me
Five beans hat Narii say one bean black Nobody know Kill
Parlay Narii damn liar All beans black Five black Coprashed
dark Every man get black bean Big wind come No chance
Everybody get up tree No good luck them pearls I tell you
before No good luck

Wheres Parlay Grief shouted

Up tree Three of his Kanakas same tree Narii and one Kanakanother
tree My tree blow to hell then I come on board

Wheres the pearls

Up tree along Parlay Mebbe Narii get them pearl yet

In the ear of one after another Grief passed on TaiHotauris story
Captain Warfield was particularly incensed and they could see him
grinding his teeth

Hermann went below and returned with a riding light but the moment it
was lifted above the level of the cabin wall the wind blew it out He
had better success with the binnacle lamp which was lighted only after
many collective attempts

A fine night of wind Grief yelled in Mulhalls ear And blowing
harder all the time

How hard

A hundred miles an hour two hundred I dont know Harder than
Ive ever seen it

The lagoon grew more and more troubled by the sea that swept across
the atoll Hundreds of leagues of ocean was being backed up by the
hurricane which more than overcame the lowering effect of the ebb tide
Immediately the tide began to rise the increase in the size of the seas
was noticeable Moon and wind were heaping the South Pacific on Hikihoho
atoll

Captain Warfield returned from one of his periodical trips to the engine
room with the word that the engineer lay in a faint

Cant let that engine stop he concluded helplessly

All right Grief said Bring him on deck Ill spell him

The hatch to the engine room was battened down access being gained
through a narrow passage from the cabin The heat and gas fumes were
stifling Grief took one hasty comprehensive examination of the engine
and the fittings of the tiny room then blew out the oillamp After
that he worked in darkness save for the glow from endless cigars which
he went into the cabin to light Eventempered as he was he soon began
to give evidences of the strain of being pent in with a mechanical
monster that toiled and sobbed and slubbered in the shouting dark
Naked to the waist covered with grease and oil bruised and skinned
from being knocked about by the plunging jumping vessel his head
swimming from the mixture of gas and air he was compelled to breathe
he laboured on hour after hour in turns petting blessing nursing and
cursing the engine and all its parts The ignition began to go bad The
feed grew worse And worst of all the cylinders began to heat In
a consultation held in the cabin the halfcaste engineer begged and
pleaded to stop the engine for half an hour in order to cool it and
to attend to the water circulation Captain Warfield was against any
stopping The halfcaste swore that the engine would ruin itself and
stop anyway and for good Grief with glaring eyes greasy and battered
yelled and cursed them both down and issued commands Mulhall
the supercargo and Hermann were set to work in the cabin at
doublestraining and triplestraining the gasoline A hole was chopped
through the engine room floor and a Kanaka heaved bilgewater over the
cylinders while Grief continued to souse running parts in oil

Didnt know you were a gasoline expert Captain Warfield admired when
Grief came into the cabin to catch a breath of little less impure air

I bathe in gasoline he grated savagely through his teeth I eat it

What other uses he might have found for it were never given for at that
moment all the men in the cabin as well as the gasoline being strained
were smashed forward against the bulkhead as the Malahini took an
abrupt deep dive For the space of several minutes unable to gain
their feet they rolled back and forth and pounded and hammered from
wall to wall The schooner swept by three big seas creaked and groaned
and quivered and from the weight of water on her decks behaved logily
Grief crept to the engine while Captain Warfield waited his chance to
get through the companionway and out on deck

It was half an hour before he came back

Whaleboats gone he reported Galleys gone Everything gone except
the deck and hatches And if that engine hadnt been going wed be gone
Keep up the good work

By midnight the engineers lungs and head had been sufficiently cleared
of gas fumes to let him relieve Grief who went on deck to get his own
head and lungs clear He joined the others who crouched behind
the cabin holding on with their hands and made doubly secure by
ropelashings It was a complicated huddle for it was the only place
of refuge for the Kanakas Some of them had accepted the skippers
invitation into the cabin but had been driven out by the fumes The
Malahini was being plunged down and swept frequently and what they
breathed was air and spray and water commingled

Making heavy weather of it Mulhall Grief shouted to his guest
between immersions

Mulhall strangling and choking could only nod The scuppers could not
carry off the burden of water on the schooners deck She rolled it out
and took it in over one rail and the other and at times nose thrown
skyward sitting down on her heel she avalanched it aft It surged
along the poop gangways poured over the top of the cabin submerging
and bruising those that clung on and went out over the sternrail

Mulhall saw him first and drew Griefs attention It was Narii Herring
crouching and holding on where the dim binnacle light shone upon him He
was quite naked save for a belt and a barebladed knife thrust between
it and the skin

Captain Warfield untied his lashings and made his way over the bodies of
the others When his face became visible in the light from the binnacle
it was working with anger They could see him speak but the wind tore
the sound away He would not put his lips to Nariis ear Instead he
pointed over the side Narii Herring understood His white teeth showed
in an amused and sneering smile and he stood up a magnificent figure
of a man

Its murder Mulhall yelled to Grief

Hed have murdered Old Parlay Grief yelled back

For the moment the poop was clear of water and the Malahini on an even
keel Narii made a bravado attempt to walk to the rail but was flung
down by the wind Thereafter he crawled disappearing in the darkness
though there was certitude in all of them that he had gone over the
side The Malahini dived deep and when they emerged from the flood that
swept aft Grief got Mulhalls ear

Cant lose him Hes the Fish Man of Tahiti Hell cross the lagoon and
land on the other rim of the atoll if theres any atoll left

Five minutes afterward in another submergence a mess of bodies poured
down on them over the top of the cabin These they seized and held
till the water cleared when they carried them below and learned their
identity Old Parlay lay oh his back on the floor with closed eyes and
without movement The other two were his Kanaka cousins All three were
naked and bloody The arm of one Kanaka hung helpless and broken at his
side The other man bled freely from a hideous scalp wound

Narii did that Mulhall demanded

Grief shook his head No its from being smashed along the deck and
over the house

Something suddenly ceased leaving them in dizzying uncertainty For
the moment it was hard to realize there was no wind With the absolute
abruptness of a sword slash the wind had been chopped off The schooner
rolled and plunged fetching up on her anchors with a crash which for
the first time they could hear Also for the first time they could hear
the water washing about on deck The engineer threw off the propeller
and eased the engine down

Were in the dead centre Grief said Now for the shift It will come
as hard as ever He looked at the barometer  he read

Not in a moment could he tone down the voice which for hours had battled
against the wind and so loudly did he speak that in the quiet it hurt
the others ears

All his ribs are smashed the supercargo said feeling along Parlays
side Hes still breathing but hes a goner

Old Parlay groaned moved one arm impotently and opened his eyes In
them was the light of recognition

My brave gentlemen he whispered haltingly Dont forget the
auction at ten oclock in hell

His eyes dropped shut and the lower jaw threatened to drop but he
mastered the qualms of dissolution long enough to omit one final loud
derisive cackle

Above and below pandemonium broke out

The old familiar roar of the wind was with them The Malahini caught
broadside was pressed down almost on her beam ends as she swung the
arc compelled by her anchors They rounded her into the wind where she
jerked to an even keel The propeller was thrown on and the engine took
up its work again

Northwest Captain Warfield shouted to Grief when he came on deck
Hauled eight points like a shot

Nariill never get across the lagoon now Grief observed

Then hell blow back to our side worse luck




V

After the passing of the centre the barometer began to rise Equally
rapid was the fall of the wind When it was no more than a howling
gale the engine lifted up in the air parted its bedplates with a last
convulsive effort of its forty horsepower and lay down on its side
A wash of water from the bilge sizzled over it and the steam arose in
clouds The engineer wailed his dismay but Grief glanced over the wreck
affectionately and went into the cabin to swab the grease off his chest
and arms with bunches of cotton waste

The sun was up and the gentlest of summer breezes blowing when he came
on deck after sewing up the scalp of one Kanaka and setting the others
arm The Malahini lay close in to the beach Forard Hermann and the
crew were heaving in and straightening out the tangle of anchors The
Papara and the Tahaa were gone and Captain Warfield through the
glasses was searching the opposite rim of the atoll

Not a stick left of them he said Thats what comes of not having
engines They must have dragged across before the big shift came

Ashore where Parlays house had been was no vestige of any house For
the space of three hundred yards where the sea had breached no tree or
even stump was left Here and there farther along stood an occasional
palm and there were numbers which had been snapped off above the
ground In the crown of one surviving palm TaiHotauri asserted he saw
something move There were no boats left to the Malahini and they
watched him swim ashore and climb the tree

When he came back they helped over the rail a young native girl of
Parleys household But first she passed up to them a battered basket
In it was a litter of blind kittensall dead save one that feebly
mewed and staggered on awkward legs

Hello said Mulhall Whos that

Along the beach they saw a man walking He moved casually as if out
for a morning stroll Captain Warfield gritted his teeth It was Narii
Herring

Hello skipper Narii called when he was abreast of them Can I come
aboard and get some breakfast

Captain Warfields face and neck began to swell and turn purple He
tried to speak but choked

For two centsfor two cents was all he could manage to
articulate
