A TANGLED TALE




KNOT I

EXCELSIOR


Goblin lead them up and down


The ruddy glow of sunset was already fading into the sombre shadows of
night when two travellers might have been observed swiftlyat a pace
of six miles in the hourdescending the rugged side of a mountain the
younger bounding from crag to crag with the agility of a fawn while his
companion whose aged limbs seemed ill at ease in the heavy chain armour
habitually worn by tourists in that district toiled on painfully at his
side

As is always the case under such circumstances the younger knight was
the first to break the silence

A goodly pace I trow he exclaimed We sped not thus in the ascent

Goodly indeed the other echoed with a groan We clomb it but at
three miles in the hour

And on the dead level our pace is the younger suggested for he
was weak in statistics and left all such details to his aged companion

Four miles in the hour the other wearily replied Not an ounce
more he added with that love of metaphor so common in old age and
not a farthing less

Twas three hours past high noon when we left our hostelry the young
man said musingly We shall scarce be back by suppertime Perchance
mine host will roundly deny us all food

He will chide our tardy return was the grave reply and such a
rebuke will be meet

A brave conceit cried the other with a merry laugh And should we
bid him bring us yet another course I trow his answer will be tart

We shall but get our deserts sighed the elder knight who had never
seen a joke in his life and was somewhat displeased at his companions
untimely levity Twill be nine of the clock he added in an
undertone by the time we regain our hostelry Full many a mile shall
we have plodded this day

How many How many cried the eager youth ever athirst for knowledge

The old man was silent

Tell me he answered after a moments thought what time it was when
we stood together on yonder peak Not exact to the minute he added
hastily reading a protest in the young mans face An thy guess be
within one poor halfhour of the mark tis all I ask of thy mothers
son Then will I tell thee true to the last inch how far we shall have
trudged betwixt three and nine of the clock

A groan was the young mans only reply while his convulsed features and
the deep wrinkles that chased each other across his manly brow revealed
the abyss of arithmetical agony into which one chance question had
plunged him




KNOT II

ELIGIBLE APARTMENTS

   Straight down the crooked lane
   And all round the square


Lets ask Balbus about it said Hugh

All right said Lambert

He can guess it said Hugh

Rather said Lambert

No more words were needed the two brothers understood each other
perfectly

Illustration BALBUS WAS ASSISTING HIS MOTHERINLAW TO CONVINCE THE
DRAGON

Balbus was waiting for them at the hotel the journey down had tired
him he said so his two pupils had been the round of the place in
search of lodgings without the old tutor who had been their inseparable
companion from their childhood They had named him after the hero of
their Latin exercisebook which overflowed with anecdotes of that
versatile geniusanecdotes whose vagueness in detail was more than
compensated by their sensational brilliance Balbus has overcome all
his enemies had been marked by their tutor in the margin of the book
Successful Bravery In this way he had tried to extract a moral from
every anecdote about Balbussometimes one of warning as in Balbus had
borrowed a healthy dragon against which he had written Rashness in
Speculationsometimes of encouragement as in the words Influence of
Sympathy in United Action which stood opposite to the anecdote Balbus
was assisting his motherinlaw to convince the dragonand sometimes
it dwindled down to a single word such as Prudence which was all he
could extract from the touching record that Balbus having scorched the
tail of the dragon went away His pupils liked the short morals best
as it left them more room for marginal illustrations and in this
instance they required all the space they could get to exhibit the
rapidity of the heros departure

Their report of the state of things was discouraging That most
fashionable of wateringplaces Little Mendip was chockfull as the
boys expressed it from end to end But in one Square they had seen no
less than four cards in different houses all announcing in flaming
capitals ELIGIBLE APARTMENTS So theres plenty of choice after all
you see said spokesman Hugh in conclusion

That doesnt follow from the data said Balbus as he rose from the
easy chair where he had been dozing over The Little Mendip Gazette
They may be all single rooms However we may as well see them I shall
be glad to stretch my legs a bit

An unprejudiced bystander might have objected that the operation was
needless and that this long lank creature would have been all the
better with even shorter legs but no such thought occurred to his
loving pupils One on each side they did their best to keep up with his
gigantic strides while Hugh repeated the sentence in their fathers
letter just received from abroad over which he and Lambert had been
puzzling He says a friend of his the Governor ofwhat was that
name again Lambert Kgovjni said Lambert Well yes The
Governor ofwhatyoumaycallitwants to give a very small
dinnerparty and he means to ask his fathers brotherinlaw his
brothers fatherinlaw his fatherinlaws brother and his
brotherinlaws father and were to guess how many guests there will
be

There was an anxious pause How large did he say the pudding was to
be Balbus said at last Take its cubical contents divide by the
cubical contents of what each man can eat and the quotient

He didnt say anything about pudding said Hugh and heres the
Square as they turned a corner and came into sight of the eligible
apartments

It is a Square was Balbus first cry of delight as he gazed around
him Beautiful Beautiful Equilateral And rectangular

The boys looked round with less enthusiasm Number nine is the first
with a card said prosaic Lambert but Balbus would not so soon awake
from his dream of beauty

See boys he cried Twenty doors on a side What symmetry Each side
divided into twentyone equal parts Its delicious

Shall I knock or ring said Hugh looking in some perplexity at a
square brass plate which bore the simple inscription RING ALSO

Both said Balbus Thats an Ellipsis my boy Did you never see an
Ellipsis before

I couldnt hardly read it said Hugh evasively Its no good having
an Ellipsis if they dont keep it clean

Which there is one room gentlemen said the smiling landlady And
a sweet room too As snug a little backroom

We will see it said Balbus gloomily as they followed her in I knew
how it would be One room in each house No view I suppose

Which indeed there is gentlemen the landlady indignantly
protested as she drew up the blind and indicated the back garden

Cabbages I perceive said Balbus Well theyre green at any rate

Which the greens at the shops their hostess explained are by no
means dependable upon Here you has them on the premises and of the
best

Does the window open was always Balbus first question in testing a
lodging and Does the chimney smoke his second Satisfied on all
points he secured the refusal of the room and they moved on to Number
Twentyfive

This landlady was grave and stern Ive nobbut one room left she
told them and it gives on the backgyardin

But there are cabbages Balbus suggested

The landlady visibly relented There is sir she said and good
ones though I say it as shouldnt We cant rely on the shops for
greens So we grows them ourselves

A singular advantage said Balbus and after the usual questions
they went on to Fiftytwo

And Id gladly accommodate you all if I could was the greeting that
met them We are but mortal Irrelevant muttered Balbus and Ive
let all my rooms but one

Which one is a backroom I perceive said Balbus and looking out
onon cabbages I presume

Yes indeed sir said their hostess Whatever other folks may do
we grows our own For the shops

An excellent arrangement Balbus interrupted Then one can really
depend on their being good Does the window open

The usual questions were answered satisfactorily but this time Hugh
added one of his own inventionDoes the cat scratch

The landlady looked round suspiciously as if to make sure the cat was
not listening I will not deceive you gentlemen she said It do
scratch but not without you pulls its whiskers Itll never do it she
repeated slowly with a visible effort to recall the exact words of some
written agreement between herself and the cat without you pulls its
whiskers

Much may be excused in a cat so treated said Balbus as they left the
house and crossed to Number Seventythree leaving the landlady
curtseying on the doorstep and still murmuring to herself her parting
words as if they were a form of blessing  not without you pulls
its whiskers

At Number Seventythree they found only a small shy girl to show the
house who said yesm in answer to all questions

The usual room said Balbus as they marched in the usual
backgarden the usual cabbages I suppose you cant get them good at
the shops

Yesm said the girl

Well you may tell your mistress we will take the room and that her
plan of growing her own cabbages is simply admirable

Yesm said the girl as she showed them out

One dayroom and three bedrooms said Balbus as they returned to the
hotel We will take as our dayroom the one that gives us the least
walking to do to get to it

Must we walk from door to door and count the steps said Lambert

No no Figure it out my boys figure it out Balbus gaily exclaimed
as he put pens ink and paper before his hapless pupils and left the
room

I say Itll be a job said Hugh

Rather said Lambert




KNOT III

MAD MATHESIS

   I waited for the train


Well they call me so because I am a little mad I suppose she
said goodhumouredly in answer to Claras cautiouslyworded question
as to how she came by so strange a nickname You see I never do what
sane people are expected to do nowadays I never wear long trains
talking of trains thats the Charing Cross Metropolitan StationIve
something to tell you about that and I never play lawntennis I
cant cook an omelette I cant even set a broken limb Theres an
ignoramus for you

Clara was her niece and full twenty years her junior in fact she was
still attending a High Schoolan institution of which Mad Mathesis
spoke with undisguised aversion Let a woman be meek and lowly she
would say None of your High Schools for me But it was vacationtime
just now and Clara was her guest and Mad Mathesis was showing her the
sights of that Eighth Wonder of the worldLondon

The Charing Cross Metropolitan Station she resumed waving her hand
towards the entrance as if she were introducing her niece to a friend
The Bayswater and Birmingham Extension is just completed and the
trains now run round and round continuouslyskirting the border of
Wales just touching at York and so round by the east coast back to
London The way the trains run is most peculiar The westerly ones go
round in two hours the easterly ones take three but they always manage
to start two trains from here opposite ways punctually every
quarterofanhour

They part to meet again said Clara her eyes filling with tears at
the romantic thought

No need to cry about it her aunt grimly remarked They dont meet on
the same line of rails you know Talking of meeting an idea strikes
me she added changing the subject with her usual abruptness Lets
go opposite ways round and see which can meet most trains No need for
a chaperonladies saloon you know You shall go whichever way you
like and well have a bet about it

I never make bets Clara said very gravely Our excellent preceptress
has often warned us

Youd be none the worse if you did Mad Mathesis interrupted In
fact youd be the better Im certain

Neither does our excellent preceptress approve of puns said Clara
But well have a match if you like Let me choose my train she added
after a brief mental calculation and Ill engage to meet exactly half
as many again as you do

Not if you count fair Mad Mathesis bluntly interrupted Remember we
only count the trains we meet on the way You mustnt count the one
that starts as you start nor the one that arrives as you arrive

That will only make the difference of one train said Clara as they
turned and entered the station But I never travelled alone before
Therell be no one to help me to alight However I dont mind Lets
have a match

A ragged little boy overheard her remark and came running after her
Buy a box of cigarlights Miss he pleaded pulling her shawl to
attract her attention Clara stopped to explain

I never smoke cigars she said in a meekly apologetic tone Our
excellent preceptress but Mad Mathesis impatiently hurried her on
and the little boy was left gazing after her with round eyes of
amazement

The two ladies bought their tickets and moved slowly down the central
platform Mad Mathesis prattling on as usualClara silent anxiously
reconsidering the calculation on which she rested her hopes of winning
the match

Mind where you go dear cried her aunt checking her just in time
One step more and youd have been in that pail of cold water

I know I know Clara said dreamily The pale the cold and the
moony

Take your places on the springboards shouted a porter

What are they for Clara asked in a terrified whisper

Merely to help us into the trains The elder lady spoke with the
nonchalance of one quite used to the process Very few people can get
into a carriage without help in less than three seconds and the trains
only stop for one second At this moment the whistle was heard and two
trains rushed into the station A moments pause and they were gone
again but in that brief interval several hundred passengers had been
shot into them each flying straight to his place with the accuracy of a
Minie bulletwhile an equal number were showered out upon the
sideplatforms

Three hours had passed away and the two friends met again on the
Charing Cross platform and eagerly compared notes Then Clara turned
away with a sigh To young impulsive hearts like hers disappointment
is always a bitter pill Mad Mathesis followed her full of kindly
sympathy

Try again my love she said cheerily Let us vary the experiment
We will start as we did before but not to begin counting till our
trains meet When we see each other we will say One and so count on
till we come here again

Clara brightened up I shall win that she exclaimed eagerly if I
may choose my train

Another shriek of engine whistles another upheaving of springboards
another living avalanche plunging into two trains as they flashed by
and the travellers were off again

Each gazed eagerly from her carriage window holding up her handkerchief
as a signal to her friend A rush and a roar Two trains shot past each
other in a tunnel and two travellers leaned back in their corners with
a sighor rather with two sighsof relief One Clara murmured to
herself Won Its a word of good omen This time at any rate the
victory will be mine

But was it




KNOT IV

THE DEAD RECKONING

   I did dream of moneybags tonight


Noonday on the open sea within a few degrees of the Equator is apt to be
oppressively warm and our two travellers were now airily clad in suits
of dazzling white linen having laid aside the chainarmour which they
had found not only endurable in the cold mountain air they had lately
been breathing but a necessary precaution against the daggers of the
banditti who infested the heights Their holidaytrip was over and they
were now on their way home in the monthly packet which plied between
the two great ports of the island they had been exploring

Along with their armour the tourists had laid aside the antiquated
speech it had pleased them to affect while in knightly disguise and
had returned to the ordinary style of two country gentlemen of the
Twentieth Century

Stretched on a pile of cushions under the shade of a huge umbrella
they were lazily watching some native fishermen who had come on board
at the last landingplace each carrying over his shoulder a small but
heavy sack A large weighingmachine that had been used for cargo at
the last port stood on the deck and round this the fishermen had
gathered and with much unintelligible jabber seemed to be weighing
their sacks

More like sparrows in a tree than human talk isnt it the elder
tourist remarked to his son who smiled feebly but would not exert
himself so far as to speak The old man tried another listener

What have they got in those sacks Captain he inquired as that great
being passed them in his never ending parade to and fro on the deck

The Captain paused in his march and towered over the travellerstall
grave and serenely selfsatisfied

Fishermen he explained are often passengers in My ship These five
are from Mhruxithe place we last touched atand thats the way they
carry their money The money of this island is heavy gentlemen but it
costs little as you may guess We buy it from them by weightabout
five shillings a pound I fancy a ten poundnote would buy all those
sacks

By this time the old man had closed his eyesin order no doubt to
concentrate his thoughts on these interesting facts but the Captain
failed to realise his motive and with a grunt resumed his monotonous
march

Meanwhile the fishermen were getting so noisy over the weighingmachine
that one of the sailors took the precaution of carrying off all the
weights leaving them to amuse themselves with such substitutes in the
form of winchhandles belayingpins c as they could find This
brought their excitement to a speedy end they carefully hid their sacks
in the folds of the jib that lay on the deck near the tourists and
strolled away

When next the Captains heavy footfall passed the younger man roused
himself to speak

What did you call the place those fellows came from Captain he
asked

Mhruxi sir

And the one we are bound for

The Captain took a long breath plunged into the word and came out of
it nobly They call it Kgovjni sir

KI give it up the young man faintly said

He stretched out his hand for a glass of iced water which the
compassionate steward had brought him a minute ago and had set down
unluckily just outside the shadow of the umbrella It was scalding hot
and he decided not to drink it The effort of making this resolution
coming close on the fatiguing conversation he had just gone through was
too much for him he sank back among the cushions in silence

His father courteously tried to make amends for his nonchalance

Whereabouts are we now Captain said he Have you any idea

The Captain cast a pitying look on the ignorant landsman I could tell
you that sir he said in a tone of lofty condescension to an
inch

You dont say so the old man remarked in a tone of languid surprise

And mean so persisted the Captain Why what do you suppose would
become of My ship if I were to lose My Longitude and My Latitude
Could you make anything of My Dead Reckoning

Nobody could Im sure the other heartily rejoined

But he had overdone it

Its perfectly intelligible the Captain said in an offended tone
to any one that understands such things With these words he moved
away and began giving orders to the men who were preparing to hoist
the jib

Our tourists watched the operation with such interest that neither of
them remembered the five moneybags which in another moment as the
wind filled out the jib were whirled overboard and fell heavily into
the sea

But the poor fishermen had not so easily forgotten their property In a
moment they had rushed to the spot and stood uttering cries of fury
and pointing now to the sea and now to the sailors who had caused the
disaster

The old man explained it to the Captain

Let us make it up among us he added in conclusion Ten pounds will
do it I think you said

Illustration

But the Captain put aside the suggestion with a wave of the hand

No sir he said in his grandest manner You will excuse Me I am
sure but these are My passengers The accident has happened on board My
ship and under My orders It is for Me to make compensation He
turned to the angry fishermen Come here my men he said in the
Mhruxian dialect Tell me the weight of each sack I saw you weighing
them just now

Then ensued a perfect Babel of noise as the five natives explained all
screaming together how the sailors had carried off the weights and
they had done what they could with whatever came handy

Two iron belayingpins three blocks six holystones four
winchhandles and a large hammer were now carefully weighed the
Captain superintending and noting the results But the matter did not
seem to be settled even then an angry discussion followed in which
the sailors and the five natives all joined and at last the Captain
approached our tourists with a disconcerted look which he tried to
conceal under a laugh

Its an absurd difficulty he said Perhaps one of you gentlemen can
suggest something It seems they weighed the sacks two at a time

If they didnt have five separate weighings of course you cant value
them separately the youth hastily decided

Lets hear all about it was the old mans more cautious remark

They did have five separate weighings the Captain said butWell
it beats me entirely he added in a sudden burst of candour Heres
the result First and second sack weighed twelve pounds second and
third thirteen and a half third and fourth eleven and a half fourth
and fifth eight and then they say they had only the large hammer left
and it took three sacks to weigh it downthats the first third and
fifthand they weighed sixteen pounds There gentlemen Did you ever
hear anything like that

The old man muttered under his breath If only my sister were here and
looked helplessly at his son His son looked at the five natives The
five natives looked at the Captain The Captain looked at nobody his
eyes were cast down and he seemed to be saying softly to himself
Contemplate one another gentlemen if such be your good pleasure I
contemplate Myself

OUGHTS AND CROSSES

   Look here upon this picture and on this


And what made you choose the first train Goosey said Mad Mathesis
as they got into the cab Couldnt you count better than that

I took an extreme case was the tearful reply Our excellent
preceptress always says When in doubt my dears take an extreme case
And I was in doubt

Does it always succeed her aunt enquired

Clara sighed Not always she reluctantly admitted And I cant
make out why One day she was telling the little girlsthey make such a
noise at tea you knowThe more noise you make the less jam you will
have and vice vers And I thought they wouldnt know what vice
vers meant so I explained it to them I said If you make an
infinite noise youll get no jam and if you make no noise youll get
an infinite lot of jam But our excellent preceptress said that wasnt
a good instance Why wasnt it she added plaintively

Her aunt evaded the question One sees certain objections to it she
said But how did you work it with the Metropolitan trains None of
them go infinitely fast I believe

I called them hares and tortoises Clara saida little timidly for
she dreaded being laughed at And I thought there couldnt be so many
hares as tortoises on the Line so I took an extreme caseone hare and
an infinite number of tortoises

An extreme case indeed her aunt remarked with admirable gravity
and a most dangerous state of things

And I thought if I went with a tortoise there would be only one
hare to meet but if I went with the hareyou know there were crowds
of tortoises

It wasnt a bad idea said the elder lady as they left the cab at
the entrance of Burlington House You shall have another chance today
Well have a match in marking pictures

Clara brightened up I should like to try again very much she said
Ill take more care this time How are we to play

To this question Mad Mathesis made no reply she was busy drawing lines
down the margins of the catalogue See she said after a minute Ive
drawn three columns against the names of the pictures in the long room
and I want you to fill them with oughts and crossescrosses for good
marks and oughts for bad The first column is for choice of subject the
second for arrangement the third for colouring And these are the
conditions of the match You must give three crosses to two or three
pictures You must give two crosses to four or five

Do you mean only two crosses said Clara Or may I count the
threecross pictures among the twocross pictures

Of course you may said her aunt Any one that has three eyes may
be said to have two eyes I suppose

Clara followed her aunts dreamy gaze across the crowded gallery
halfdreading to find that there was a threeeyed person in sight

And you must give one cross to nine or ten

And which wins the match Clara asked as she carefully entered these
conditions on a blank leaf in her catalogue

Whichever marks fewest pictures

But suppose we marked the same number

Then whichever uses most marks

Clara considered I dont think its much of a match she said I
shall mark nine pictures and give three crosses to three of them two
crosses to two more and one cross each to all the rest

Will you indeed said her aunt Wait till youve heard all the
conditions my impetuous child You must give three oughts to one or two
pictures two oughts to three or four and one ought to eight or nine I
dont want you to be too hard on the RAs

Clara quite gasped as she wrote down all these fresh conditions Its a
great deal worse than Circulating Decimals she said But Im
determined to win all the same

Her aunt smiled grimly We can begin here she said as they paused
before a gigantic picture which the catalogue informed them was the
Portrait of Lieutenant Brown mounted on his favorite elephant

He looks awfully conceited said Clara I dont think he was the
elephants favorite Lieutenant What a hideous picture it is And it
takes up room enough for twenty

Mind what you say my dear her aunt interposed Its by an RA

But Clara was quite reckless I dont care who its by she cried
And I shall give it three bad marks

Aunt and niece soon drifted away from each other in the crowd and for
the next halfhour Clara was hard at work putting in marks and rubbing
them out again and hunting up and down for suitable pictures This she
found the hardest part of all I cant find the one I want she
exclaimed at last almost crying with vexation

What is it you want to find my dear The voice was strange to Clara
but so sweet and gentle that she felt attracted to the owner of it even
before she had seen her and when she turned and met the smiling looks
of two little old ladies whose round dimpled faces exactly alike
seemed never to have known a care it was as much as she could doas
she confessed to Aunt Mattie afterwardsto keep herself from hugging
them both

I was looking for a picture she said that has a good subjectand
thats well arrangedbut badly coloured

The little old ladies glanced at each other in some alarm Calm
yourself my dear said the one who had spoken first and try to
remember which it was What was the subject

Was it an elephant for instance the other sister suggested They
were still in sight of Lieutenant Brown

I dont know indeed Clara impetuously replied You know it doesnt
matter a bit what the subject is so long as its a good one

Once more the sisters exchanged looks of alarm and one of them
whispered something to the other of which Clara caught only the one
word mad

They mean Aunt Mattie of course she said to herselffancying in
her innocence that London was like her native town where everybody
knew everybody else If you mean my aunt she added aloud shes
therejust three pictures beyond Lieutenant Brown

Ah well Then youd better go to her my dear her new friend said
soothingly Shell find you the picture you want Goodbye dear

Goodbye dear echoed the other sister Mind you dont lose sight of
your aunt And the pair trotted off into another room leaving Clara
rather perplexed at their manner

Theyre real darlings she soliloquised I wonder why they pity me
so And she wandered on murmuring to herself It must have two good
marks and

HER RADIANCY

   One piecee thing that my have got
     MaskeeA that thing my no can do
   You talkee you no sabey what
               Bamboo


They landed and were at once conducted to the Palace About half way
they were met by the Governor who welcomed them in Englisha great
relief to our travellers whose guide could speak nothing but Kgovjnian

I dont half like the way they grin at us as we go by the old man
whispered to his son And why do they say Bamboo so often

It alludes to a local custom replied the Governor who had overheard
the question Such persons as happen in any way to displease Her
Radiancy are usually beaten with rods

Illustration WHY DO THEY SAY BAMBOO SO OFTEN

The old man shuddered A most objectional local custom he remarked
with strong emphasis I wish we had never landed Did you notice that
black fellow Norman opening his great mouth at us I verily believe he
would like to eat us

Norman appealed to the Governor who was walking at his other side Do
they often eat distinguished strangers here he said in as indifferent
a tone as he could assume

Not oftennot ever was the welcome reply They are not good for it
Pigs we eat for they are fat This old man is thin

And thankful to be so muttered the elder traveller Beaten we shall
be without a doubt Its a comfort to know it wont be Beaten without
the B My dear boy just look at the peacocks

They were now walking between two unbroken lines of those gorgeous
birds each held in check by means of a golden collar and chain by a
black slave who stood well behind so as not to interrupt the view of
the glittering tail with its network of rustling feathers and its
hundred eyes

The Governor smiled proudly In your honour he said Her Radiancy
has ordered up ten thousand additional peacocks She will no doubt
decorate you before you go with the usual Star and Feathers

Itll be Star without the S faltered one of his hearers

Come come Dont lose heart said the other All this is full of
charm for me

You are young Norman sighed his father young and lighthearted
For me it is Charm without the C

The old one is sad the Governor remarked with some anxiety He has
without doubt effected some fearful crime

But I havent the poor old gentleman hastily exclaimed Tell him I
havent Norman

He has not as yet Norman gently explained And the Governor
repeated in a satisfied tone Not as yet

Yours is a wondrous country the Governor resumed after a pause Now
here is a letter from a friend of mine a merchant in London He and
his brother went there a year ago with a thousand pounds apiece and on
NewYearsday they had sixty thousand pounds between them

How did they do it Norman eagerly exclaimed Even the elder traveller
looked excited

The Governor handed him the open letter Anybody can do it when once
they know how so ran this oracular document We borrowed nought we
stole nought We began the year with only a thousand pounds apiece and
last NewYearsday we had sixty thousand pounds between ussixty
thousand golden sovereigns

Norman looked grave and thoughtful as he handed back the letter His
father hazarded one guess Was it by gambling

A Kgovjnian never gambles said the Governor gravely as he ushered
them through the palace gates They followed him in silence down a long
passage and soon found themselves in a lofty hall lined entirely with
peacocks feathers In the centre was a pile of crimson cushions which
almost concealed the figure of Her Radiancya plump little damsel in a
robe of green satin dotted with silver stars whose pale round face lit
up for a moment with a halfsmile as the travellers bowed before her
and then relapsed into the exact expression of a wax doll while she
languidly murmured a word or two in the Kgovjnian dialect

The Governor interpreted Her Radiancy welcomes you She notes the
Impenetrable Placidity of the old one and the Imperceptible Acuteness
of the youth

Here the little potentate clapped her hands and a troop of slaves
instantly appeared carrying trays of coffee and sweetmeats which they
offered to the guests who had at a signal from the Governor seated
themselves on the carpet

Sugarplums muttered the old man One might as well be at a
confectioners Ask for a penny bun Norman

Not so loud his son whispered Say something complimentary For the
Governor was evidently expecting a speech

We thank Her Exalted Potency the old man timidly began We bask in
the light of her smile which

The words of old men are weak the Governor interrupted angrily Let
the youth speak

Tell her cried Norman in a wild burst of eloquence that like two
grasshoppers in a volcano we are shrivelled up in the presence of Her
Spangled Vehemence

It is well said the Governor and translated this into Kgovjnian I
am now to tell you he proceeded what Her Radiancy requires of you
before you go The yearly competition for the post of Imperial
Scarfmaker is just ended you are the judges You will take account of
the rate of work the lightness of the scarves and their warmth
Usually the competitors differ in one point only Thus last year Fifi
and Gogo made the same number of scarves in the trialweek and they
were equally light but Fifis were twice as warm as Gogos and she was
pronounced twice as good But this year woe is me who can judge it
Three competitors are here and they differ in all points While you
settle their claims you shall be lodged Her Radiancy bids me say free
of expensein the best dungeon and abundantly fed on the best bread
and water

The old man groaned All is lost he wildly exclaimed But Norman
heeded him not he had taken out his notebook and was calmly jotting
down the particulars

Three they be the Governor proceeded Lolo Mimi and Zuzu Lolo
makes  scarves while Mimi makes  but Zuzu makes  while Lolo makes 
Again so fairylike is Zuzus handiwork  of her scarves weigh no more
than one of Lolos yet Mimis is lighter still of hers will but
balance  of Zuzus And for warmth one of Mimis is equal to  of
Zuzus yet one of Lolos is as warm as  of Mimis

Here the little lady once more clapped her hands

It is our signal of dismissal the Governor hastily said Pay Her
Radiancy your farewell complimentsand walk out backwards

The walking part was all the elder tourist could manage Norman simply
said Tell Her Radiancy we are transfixed by the spectacle of Her Serene
Brilliance and bid an agonized farewell to her Condensed Milkiness

Her Radiancy is pleased the Governor reported after duly translating
this She casts on you a glance from Her Imperial Eyes and is
confident that you will catch it

That I warrant we shall the elder traveller moaned to himself
distractedly

Once more they bowed low and then followed the Governor down a winding
staircase to the Imperial Dungeon which they found to be lined with
coloured marble lighted from the roof and splendidly though not
luxuriously furnished with a bench of polished malachite I trust you
will not delay the calculation the Governor said ushering them in
with much ceremony I have known great inconveniencegreat and serious
inconvenienceresult to those unhappy ones who have delayed to execute
the commands of Her Radiancy And on this occasion she is resolute she
says the thing must and shall be done and she has ordered up ten
thousand additional bamboos With these words he left them and they
heard him lock and bar the door on the outside

I told you how it would end moaned the elder traveller wringing his
hands and quite forgetting in his anguish that he had himself proposed
the expedition and had never predicted anything of the sort Oh that
we were well out of this miserable business

Courage cried the younger cheerily Hc olim meminisse juvabit
The end of all this will be glory

Glory without the L was all the poor old man could say as he rocked
himself to and fro on the malachite bench Glory without the L

PETTY CASH

   Base is the slave that pays


Aunt Mattie

My child

Would you mind writing it down at once I shall be quite certain to
forget it if you dont

My dear we really must wait till the cab stops How can I possibly
write anything in the midst of all this jolting

But really I shall be forgetting it

Claras voice took the plaintive tone that her aunt never knew how to
resist and with a sigh the old lady drew forth her ivory tablets and
prepared to record the amount that Clara had just spent at the
confectioners shop Her expenditure was always made out of her aunts
purse but the poor girl knew by bitter experience that sooner or
later Mad Mathesis would expect an exact account of every penny that
had gone and she waited with illconcealed impatience while the old
lady turned the tablets over and over till she had found the one headed
PETTY CASH

Heres the place she said at last and here we have yesterdays
luncheon duly entered One glass lemonade Why cant you drink water
like me three sandwiches They never put in half mustard enough I
told the young woman so to her face and she tossed her headlike her
impudence and seven biscuits Total oneandtwopence Well now
for todays

One glass of lemonade Clara was beginning to say when suddenly
the cab drew up and a courteous railwayporter was handing out the
bewildered girl before she had had time to finish her sentence

Her aunt pocketed the tablets instantly Business first she said
petty cashwhich is a form of pleasure whatever you may
thinkafterwards And she proceeded to pay the driver and to give
voluminous orders about the luggage quite deaf to the entreaties of her
unhappy niece that she would enter the rest of the luncheon account

My dear you really must cultivate a more capacious mind was all the
consolation she vouchsafed to the poor girl Are not the tablets of
your memory wide enough to contain the record of one single luncheon

Not wide enough Not half wide enough was the passionate reply

The words came in aptly enough but the voice was not that of Clara and
both ladies turned in some surprise to see who it was that had so
suddenly struck into their conversation A fat little old lady was
standing at the door of a cab helping the driver to extricate what
seemed an exact duplicate of herself it would have been no easy task to
decide which was the fatter or which looked the more goodhumoured of
the two sisters

I tell you the cabdoor isnt half wide enough she repeated as her
sister finally emerged somewhat after the fashion of a pellet from a
popgun and she turned to appeal to Clara Is it dear she said
trying hard to bring a frown into a face that dimpled all over with
smiles

Some folks is too wide for em growled the cabdriver

Illustration I TELL YOU THE CABDOOR ISNT HALF WIDE ENOUGH

Dont provoke me man cried the little old lady in what she meant
for a tempest of fury Say another word and Ill put you into the
County Court and sue you for a Habeas Corpus The cabman touched his
hat and marched off grinning

Nothing like a little Law to cow the ruffians my dear she remarked
confidentially to Clara You saw how he quailed when I mentioned the
Habeas Corpus Not that Ive any idea what it means but it sounds
very grand doesnt it

Its very provoking Clara replied a little vaguely

Very the little old lady eagerly repeated And were very much
provoked indeed Arent we sister

I never was so provoked in all my life the fatter sister assented
radiantly

By this time Clara had recognised her picturegallery acquaintances
and drawing her aunt aside she hastily whispered her reminiscences I
met them first in the Royal Academyand they were very kind to meand
they were lunching at the next table to us just now you knowand they
tried to help me to find the picture I wantedand Im sure theyre dear
old things

Friends of yours are they said Mad Mathesis Well I like their
looks You can be civil to them while I get the tickets But do try and
arrange your ideas a little more chronologically

And so it came to pass that the four ladies found themselves seated side
by side on the same bench waiting for the train and chatting as if they
had known one another for years

Now this I call quite a remarkable coincidence exclaimed the smaller
and more talkative of the two sistersthe one whose legal knowledge had
annihilated the cabdriver Not only that we should be waiting for the
same train and at the same stationthat would be curious enoughbut
actually on the same day and the same hour of the day Thats what
strikes me so forcibly She glanced at the fatter and more silent
sister whose chief function in life seemed to be to support the family
opinion and who meekly responded

And me too sister

Those are not independent coincidences Mad Mathesis was just
beginning when Clara ventured to interpose

Theres no jolting here she pleaded meekly Would you mind writing
it down now

Out came the ivory tablets once more What was it then said her
aunt

One glass of lemonade one sandwich one biscuitOh dear me cried
poor Clara the historical tone suddenly changing to a wail of agony

Toothache said her aunt calmly as she wrote down the items The two
sisters instantly opened their reticules and produced two different
remedies for neuralgia each marked unequalled

It isnt that said poor Clara Thank you very much Its only that I
cant remember how much I paid

Well try and make it out then said her aunt Youve got
yesterdays luncheon to help you you know And heres the luncheon we
had the day beforethe first day we went to that shopone
glass lemonade four sandwiches ten biscuits Total
oneandfivepence She handed the tablets to Clara who gazed at them
with eyes so dim with tears that she did not at first notice that she
was holding them upside down

The two sisters had been listening to all this with the deepest
interest and at this juncture the smaller one softly laid her hand on
Claras arm

Do you know my dear she said coaxingly my sister and I are in the
very same predicament Quite identically the very same predicament
Arent we sister

Quite identically and absolutely the very began the fatter sister
but she was constructing her sentence on too large a scale and the
little one would not wait for her to finish it

Yes my dear she resumed we were lunching at the very same shop as
you wereand we had two glasses of lemonade and three sandwiches and
five biscuitsand neither of us has the least idea what we paid Have
we sister

Quite identically and absolutely murmured the other who evidently
considered that she was now a whole sentence in arrears and that she
ought to discharge one obligation before contracting any fresh
liabilities but the little lady broke in again and she retired from
the conversation a bankrupt

Would you make it out for us my dear pleaded the little old lady

You can do Arithmetic I trust her aunt said a little anxiously as
Clara turned from one tablet to another vainly trying to collect her
thoughts Her mind was a blank and all human expression was rapidly
fading out of her face

A gloomy silence ensued




KNOT VIII

DE OMNIBUS REBUS

   This little pig went to market
   This little pig staid at home


By Her Radiancys express command said the Governor as he conducted
the travellers for the last time from the Imperial presence I shall
now have the ecstasy of escorting you as far as the outer gate of the
Military Quarter where the agony of partingif indeed Nature can
survive the shockmust be endured From that gate grurmstipths start
every quarter of an hour both ways

Would you mind repeating that word said Norman Grurm

Grurmstipths the Governor repeated You call them omnibuses in
England They run both ways and you can travel by one of them all the
way down to the harbour

The old man breathed a sigh of relief four hours of courtly ceremony
had wearied him and he had been in constant terror lest something
should call into use the ten thousand additional bamboos

In another minute they were crossing a large quadrangle paved with
marble and tastefully decorated with a pigsty in each corner Soldiers
carrying pigs were marching in all directions and in the middle stood
a gigantic officer giving orders in a voice of thunder which made
itself heard above all the uproar of the pigs

It is the CommanderinChief the Governor hurriedly whispered to his
companions who at once followed his example in prostrating themselves
before the great man The Commander gravely bowed in return He was
covered with gold lace from head to foot his face wore an expression of
deep misery and he had a little black pig under each arm Still the
gallant fellow did his best in the midst of the orders he was every
moment issuing to his men to bid a courteous farewell to the departing
guests

Farewell oh old onecarry these three to the South cornerand
farewell to thee thou young oneput this fat one on the top of the
others in the Western stymay your shadows never be lesswoe is me it
is wrongly done Empty out all the sties and begin again And the
soldier leant upon his sword and wiped away a tear

He is in distress the Governor explained as they left the court Her
Radiancy has commanded him to place twentyfour pigs in those four
sties so that as she goes round the court she may always find the
number in each sty nearer to ten than the number in the last

Does she call ten nearer to ten than nine is said Norman

Surely said the Governor Her Radiancy would admit that ten is
nearer to ten than nine isand also nearer than eleven is

Then I think it can be done said Norman

The Governor shook his head The Commander has been transferring them
in vain for four months he said What hope remains And Her Radiancy
has ordered up ten thousand additional

The pigs dont seem to enjoy being transferred the old man hastily
interrupted He did not like the subject of bamboos

They are only provisionally transferred you know said the
Governor In most cases they are immediately carried back again so
they need not mind it And all is done with the greatest care under the
personal superintendence of the CommanderinChief

Of course she would only go once round said Norman

Alas no sighed their conductor Round and round Round and round
These are Her Radiancys own words But oh agony Here is the outer
gate and we must part He sobbed as he shook hands with them and the
next moment was briskly walking away

He might have waited to see us off said the old man piteously

And he neednt have begun whistling the very moment he left us said
the young one severely But look sharphere are two whatshisnames
in the act of starting

Unluckily the seabound omnibus was full Never mind said Norman
cheerily Well walk on till the next one overtakes us

They trudged on in silence both thinking over the military problem
till they met an omnibus coming from the sea The elder traveller took
out his watch Just twelve minutes and a half since we started he
remarked in an absent manner Suddenly the vacant face brightened the
old man had an idea My boy he shouted bringing his hand down upon
Normans shoulder so suddenly as for a moment to transfer his centre of
gravity beyond the base of support

Thus taken off his guard the young man wildly staggered forwards and
seemed about to plunge into space but in another moment he had
gracefully recovered himself Problem in Precession and Nutation he
remarkedin tones where filial respect only just managed to conceal a
shade of annoyance What is it he hastily added fearing his father
might have been taken ill Will you have some brandy

When will the next omnibus overtake us When When the old man cried
growing more excited every moment

Norman looked gloomy Give me time he said I must think it over
And once more the travellers passed on in silencea silence only broken
by the distant squeals of the unfortunate little pigs who were still
being provisionally transferred from sty to sty under the personal
superintendence of the CommanderinChief




KNOT IX

A SERPENT WITH CORNERS

   Water water every where
   Nor any drop to drink


Itll just take one more pebble

What ever are you doing with those buckets

The speakers were Hugh and Lambert Place the beach of Little Mendip
Time  PM Hugh was floating a bucket in another a size larger
and trying how many pebbles it would carry without sinking Lambert was
lying on his back doing nothing

For the next minute or two Hugh was silent evidently deep in thought
Suddenly he started I say look here Lambert he cried

If its alive and slimy and with legs I dont care to said
Lambert

Didnt Balbus say this morning that if a body is immersed in liquid
it displaces as much liquid as is equal to its own bulk said Hugh

He said things of that sort Lambert vaguely replied

Well just look here a minute Heres the little bucket almost quite
immersed so the water displaced ought to be just about the same bulk
And now just look at it He took out the little bucket as he spoke and
handed the big one to Lambert Why theres hardly a teacupful Do you
mean to say that water is the same bulk as the little bucket

Course it is said Lambert

Well look here again cried Hugh triumphantly as he poured the
water from the big bucket into the little one Why it doesnt half
fill it

Thats its business said Lambert If Balbus says its the same
bulk why it is the same bulk you know

Well I dont believe it said Hugh

You neednt said Lambert Besides its dinnertime Come along

They found Balbus waiting dinner for them and to him Hugh at once
propounded his difficulty

Lets get you helped first said Balbus briskly cutting away at the
joint You know the old proverb Mutton first mechanics afterwards

The boys did not know the proverb but they accepted it in perfect
good faith as they did every piece of information however startling
that came from so infallible an authority as their tutor They ate on
steadily in silence and when dinner was over Hugh set out the usual
array of pens ink and paper while Balbus repeated to them the problem
he had prepared for their afternoons task

A friend of mine has a flowergardena very pretty one though no
great size

How big is it said Hugh

Thats what you have to find out Balbus gaily replied All I
tell you is that it is oblong in shapejust half a yard longer than its
widthand that a gravelwalk one yard wide begins at one corner and
runs all round it

Joining into itself said Hugh

Not joining into itself young man Just before doing that it
turns a corner and runs round the garden again alongside of the first
portion and then inside that again winding in and in and each lap
touching the last one till it has used up the whole of the area

Like a serpent with corners said Lambert

Exactly so And if you walk the whole length of it to the last inch
keeping in the centre of the path its exactly two miles and half a
furlong Now while you find out the length and breadth of the garden
Ill see if I can think out that seawater puzzle

You said it was a flowergarden Hugh inquired as Balbus was leaving
the room

I did said Balbus

Where do the flowers grow said Hugh But Balbus thought it best not
to hear the question He left the boys to their problem and in the
silence of his own room set himself to unravel Hughs mechanical
paradox

To fix our thoughts he murmured to himself as with hands
deepburied in his pockets he paced up and down the room we will take
a cylindrical glass jar with a scale of inches marked up the side and
fill it with water up to the inch mark and we will assume that every
inch depth of jar contains a pint of water We will now take a solid
cylinder such that every inch of it is equal in bulk to half a pint
of water and plunge  inches of it into the water so that the end of
the cylinder comes down to the inch mark Well that displaces 
pints of water What becomes of them Why if there were no more
cylinder they would lie comfortably on the top and fill the jar up to
the inch mark But unfortunately there is more cylinder occupying
half the space between the inch and the inch marks so that only
one pint of water can be accommodated there What becomes of the other
pint Why if there were no more cylinder it would lie on the top and
fill the jar up to the inch mark But unfortunatelyShade of
Newton he exclaimed in sudden accents of terror When does the
water stop rising

A bright idea struck him Ill write a little essay on it he said

                                   

Balbuss Essay

When a solid is immersed in a liquid it is well known that it
displaces a portion of the liquid equal to itself in bulk and that the
level of the liquid rises just so much as it would rise if a quantity of
liquid had been added to it equal in bulk to the solid Lardner says
precisely the same process occurs when a solid is partially immersed
the quantity of liquid displaced in this case equalling the portion of
the solid which is immersed and the rise of the level being in
proportion

Suppose a solid held above the surface of a liquid and partially
immersed a portion of the liquid is displaced and the level of the
liquid rises But by this rise of level a little bit more of the solid
is of course immersed and so there is a new displacement of a second
portion of the liquid and a consequent rise of level Again this
second rise of level causes a yet further immersion and by consequence
another displacement of liquid and another rise It is selfevident that
this process must continue till the entire solid is immersed and that
the liquid will then begin to immerse whatever holds the solid which
being connected with it must for the time be considered a part of it
If you hold a stick six feet long with its end in a tumbler of water
and wait long enough you must eventually be immersed The question as
to the source from which the water is suppliedwhich belongs to a high
branch of mathematics and is therefore beyond our present scopedoes
not apply to the sea Let us therefore take the familiar instance of a
man standing at the edge of the sea at ebbtide with a solid in his
hand which he partially immerses he remains steadfast and unmoved and
we all know that he must be drowned The multitudes who daily perish in
this manner to attest a philosophical truth and whose bodies the
unreasoning wave casts sullenly upon our thankless shores have a truer
claim to be called the martyrs of science than a Galileo or a Kepler To
use Kossuths eloquent phrase they are the unnamed demigods of the
nineteenth centuryB

                                   

Theres a fallacy somewhere he murmured drowsily as he stretched
his long legs upon the sofa I must think it over again He closed his
eyes in order to concentrate his attention more perfectly and for the
next hour or so his slow and regular breathing bore witness to the
careful deliberation with which he was investigating this new and
perplexing view of the subject

CHELSEA BUNS

   Yea buns and buns and buns

                          OLD SONG


How very very sad exclaimed Clara and the eyes of the gentle girl
filled with tears as she spoke

Sadbut very curious when you come to look at it arithmetically was
her aunts less romantic reply Some of them have lost an arm in their
countrys service some a leg some an ear some an eye

And some perhaps all Clara murmured dreamily as they passed the
long rows of weatherbeaten heroes basking in the sun Did you notice
that very old one with a red face who was drawing a map in the dust
with his wooden leg and all the others watching I think it was a
plan of a battle

The battle of Trafalgar no doubt her aunt interrupted briskly

Hardly that I think Clara ventured to say You see in that case
he couldnt well be alive

Couldnt well be alive the old lady contemptuously repeated Hes as
lively as you and me put together Why if drawing a map in the
dustwith ones wooden legdoesnt prove one to be alive perhaps
youll kindly mention what does prove it

Clara did not see her way out of it Logic had never been her forte

To return to the arithmetic Mad Mathesis resumedthe eccentric old
lady never let slip an opportunity of driving her niece into a
calculationwhat percentage do you suppose must have lost all foura
leg an arm an eye and an ear

How can I tell gasped the terrified girl She knew well what was
coming

You cant of course without data her aunt replied but Im just
going to give you

Give her a Chelsea bun Miss Thats what most young ladies likes
best The voice was rich and musical and the speaker dexterously
whipped back the snowy cloth that covered his basket and disclosed a
tempting array of the familiar square buns joined together in rows
richly egged and browned and glistening in the sun

No sir I shall give her nothing so indigestible Be off The old
lady waved her parasol threateningly but nothing seemed to disturb the
goodhumour of the jolly old man who marched on chanting his melodious
refrain

Music Chelsea buns Chelsea buns hot Chelsea buns

Piping hot Chelsea buns hot Chelsea buns

Far too indigestible my love said the old lady Percentages will
agree with you ever so much better

Clara sighed and there was a hungry look in her eyes as she watched the
basket lessening in the distance but she meekly listened to the
relentless old lady who at once proceeded to count off the data on
her fingers

Say that  per cent have lost an eye per cent an ear per
cent an arm per cent a legthatll do it beautifully Now my
dear what percentage at least must have lost all four

No more conversation occurredunless a smothered exclamation of Piping
hot which escaped from Claras lips as the basket vanished round a
corner could be counted as suchuntil they reached the old Chelsea
mansion where Claras father was then staying with his three sons and
their old tutor

Balbus Lambert and Hugh had entered the house only a few minutes
before them They had been out walking and Hugh had been propounding a
difficulty which had reduced Lambert to the depths of gloom and had
even puzzled Balbus

It changes from Wednesday to Thursday at midnight doesnt it Hugh
had begun

Sometimes said Balbus cautiously

Always said Lambert decisively

Sometimes Balbus gently insisted Six midnights out of seven it
changes to some other name

I meant of course Hugh corrected himself when it does change
from Wednesday to Thursday it does it at midnightand only at
midnight

Surely said Balbus Lambert was silent

Well now suppose its midnight here in Chelsea Then its Wednesday
west of Chelsea say in Ireland or America where midnight hasnt
arrived yet and its Thursday east of Chelsea say in Germany or
Russia where midnight has just passed by

Surely Balbus said again Even Lambert nodded this time

But it isnt midnight anywhere else so it cant be changing from one
day to another anywhere else And yet if Ireland and America and so on
call it Wednesday and Germany and Russia and so on call it Thursday
there must be some placenot Chelseathat has different days on the
two sides of it And the worst of it is the people there get their
days in the wrong order theyve got Wednesday east of them and
Thursday westjust as if their day had changed from Thursday to
Wednesday

Ive heard that puzzle before cried Lambert And Ill tell you the
explanation When a ship goes round the world from east to west we
know that it loses a day in its reckoning so that when it gets home
and calls its day Wednesday it finds people here calling it Thursday
because weve had one more midnight than the ship has had And when you
go the other way round you gain a day

I know all that said Hugh in reply to this not very lucid
explanation but it doesnt help me because the ship hasnt proper
days One way round you get more than twentyfour hours to the day and
the other way you get less so of course the names get wrong but people
that live on in one place always get twentyfour hours to the day

I suppose there is such a place Balbus said meditatively though
I never heard of it And the people must find it very queer as Hugh
says to have the old day east of them and the new one west
because when midnight comes round to them with the new day in front of
it and the old one behind it one doesnt see exactly what happens I
must think it over

So they had entered the house in the state I have describedBalbus
puzzled and Lambert buried in gloomy thought

Yes mm Master is at home mm said the stately old butler
NBIt is only a butler of experience who can manage a series of
three Ms together without any interjacent vowels And the ole
party is awaiting for you in the libery

I dont like his calling your father an old party Mad Mathesis
whispered to her niece as they crossed the hall And Clara had only
just time to whisper in reply he meant the whole party before they
were ushered into the library and the sight of the five solemn faces
there assembled chilled her into silence

Her father sat at the head of the table and mutely signed to the ladies
to take the two vacant chairs one on each side of him His three sons
and Balbus completed the party Writing materials had been arranged
round the table after the fashion of a ghostly banquet the butler had
evidently bestowed much thought on the grim device Sheets of quarto
paper each flanked by a pen on one side and a pencil on the other
represented the platespenwipers did duty for rolls of breadwhile
inkbottles stood in the places usually occupied by wineglasses The
pice de resistance was a large green baize bag which gave forth as
the old man restlessly lifted it from side to side a charming jingle
as of innumerable golden guineas

Sister daughter sonsand Balbus the old man began so nervously
that Balbus put in a gentle Hear hear while Hugh drummed on the
table with his fists This disconcerted the unpractised orator
Sister he began again then paused a moment moved the bag to the
other side and went on with a rush I meanthis beinga critical
occasionmore or lessbeing the year when one of my sons comes of
age he paused again in some confusion having evidently got into the
middle of his speech sooner than he intended but it was too late to go
back Hear hear cried Balbus Quite so said the old gentleman
recovering his selfpossession a little when first I began this annual
custommy friend Balbus will correct me if I am wrong Hugh
whispered with a strap but nobody heard him except Lambert who only
frowned and shook his head at him this annual custom of giving each
of my sons as many guineas as would represent his ageit was a critical
timeso Balbus informed meas the ages of two of you were together
equal to that of the thirdso on that occasion I made a speech He
paused so long that Balbus thought it well to come to the rescue with
the words It was a most but the old man checked him with a warning
look yes made a speech he repeated A few years after that Balbus
pointed outI say pointed out Hear hear cried Balbus Quite
so said the grateful old man that it was another critical
occasion The ages of two of you were together double that of the
third So I made another speechanother speech And now again its a
critical occasionso Balbus saysand I am making Here Mad
Mathesis pointedly referred to her watch all the haste I can the old
man cried with wonderful presence of mind Indeed sister Im coming
to the point now The number of years that have passed since that first
occasion is just twothirds of the number of guineas I then gave you
Now my boys calculate your ages from the data and you shall have
the money

But we know our ages cried Hugh

Silence sir thundered the old man rising to his full height he was

ANSWERS TO KNOT I

ProblemTwo travellers spend from  oclock till  in walking along
a level road up a hill and home again their pace on the level being 
miles an hour up hill  and down hill  Find distance walked also
within half an hour time of reaching top of hill

Answer miles halfpast 

                                   

SolutionA level mile takes  of an hour up hill  down hill
 Hence to go and return over the same mile whether on the level or
on the hillside takes  an hour Hence in  hours they went  miles
out and  back If the  miles out had been nearly all level they
would have taken a little over  hours if nearly all up hill a little
under  Hence  hours must be within  an hour of the time taken
in reaching the peak thus as they started at  they got there within
 an hour of  past 

                                   

Twentyseven answers have come in Of these  are right  partially
right and  wrong The  give the distance correctly but they have
failed to grasp the fact that the top of the hill might have been
reached at any moment between  oclock and 

The two wrong answers are from GERTY VERNON and A NIHILIST The former
makes the distance  miles while her revolutionary companion puts it
at  GERTY VERNON says they had to go  miles along the plain and
got to the foot of the hill at  oclock They might have done so I
grant but you have no ground for saying they did so It was 
miles to the top of the hill and they reached that at  before 
oclock Here you go wrong in your arithmetic and I must however
reluctantly bid you farewell  miles at  miles an hour would
not require  hours A NIHILIST says Let x denote the whole
number of miles y the number of hours to hilltop  therefore y 
number of miles to hilltop and xy  number of miles on the other
side You bewilder me The other side of what Of the hill you
say But then how did they get home again However to accommodate your
views we will build a new hostelry at the foot of the hill on the
opposite side and also assume what I grant you is possible though
it is not necessarily true that there was no level road at all Even
then you go wrong

You say

   y    x  y  i

   x                 ii

I grant you i but I deny ii it rests on the assumption that to go
part of the time at  miles an hour and the rest at  miles an hour
comes to the same result as going the whole time at  miles an
hour But this would only be true if the part were an exact half
ie if they went up hill for  hours and down hill for the other 
which they certainly did not do

The sixteen who are partially right are AGNES BAILEY F K FIFEE G
E B H P KIT M E T MYSIE A MOTHERS SON NAIRAM A
REDRUTHIAN A SOCIALIST SPEAR MAIDEN T B C VIS INERTI and YAK Of
these F K FIFEE T B C and VIS INERTI do not attempt the second
part at all F K and H P give no working The rest make particular
assumptions such as that there was no level roadthat there were 
miles of level roadand so on all leading to particular times being
fixed for reaching the hilltop The most curious assumption is that of
AGNES BAILEY who says Let x  number of hours occupied in ascent
then x  hours occupied in descent and x  hours occupied on
the level I suppose you were thinking of the relative rates up
hill and on the level which we might express by saying that if they
went x miles up hill in a certain time they would go x miles on
the level in the same time You have in fact assumed that they took
the same time on the level that they took in ascending the hill FIFEE
assumes that when the aged knight said they had gone four miles in the
hour on the level he meant that four miles was the distance gone
not merely the rate This would have beenif FIFEE will excuse the
slang expressiona sell illsuited to the dignity of the hero

affords no clue to the total distance It does not enable us to state
precisely to an inch how much level and how much hill there was on the
road Fair damsel the aged knight replies if as I surmise thy

Yet stay said the youth as a gleam of inspiration lighted up the
relaxing muscles of his quiescent features Stay Methinks it matters
little when we reached that summit the crown of our toil For in the
space of time wherein we clambered up one mile and bounded down the same
on our return we could have trudged the twain on the level We have
plodded then fourandtwenty miles in these six mortal hours for
never a moment did we stop for catching of fleeting breath or for gazing
on the scene around

Very good said the old man Twelve miles out and twelve miles in
And we reached the top some time between six and seven of the clock Now
mark me For every five minutes that had fled since six of the clock
when we stood on yonder peak so many miles had we toiled upwards on the
dreary mountainside

The youth moaned and rushed into the hostel

   BLITHE

   The elder and the younger knight
     They sallied forth at three
   How far they went on level ground
     It matters not to me
   What time they reached the foot of hill
     When they began to mount
   Are problems which I hold to be
     Of very small account

   The moment that each waved his hat
     Upon the topmost peak
   To trivial query such as this
     No answer will I seek
   Yet can I tell the distance well
     They must have travelled oer
   On hill and plain twixt three and nine
     The miles were twentyfour

   Four miles an hour their steady pace
     Along the level track
   Three when they climbedbut six when they
     Came swiftly striding back
   Adown the hill and little skill
     It needs methinks to show
   Up hill and down together told
     Four miles an hour they go

   For whether long or short the time
     Upon the hill they spent
   Two thirds were passed in going up
     One third in the descent
   Two thirds at three one third at six

  THE LODGINGS

ProblemA Square has  doors on each side which contains  equal
parts They are numbered all round beginning at one corner From which
of the four Nos     is the sum of the distances to the
other three least

AnswerFrom No 

                                   

Illustration

Let A be No  B No  C No  and D No 

   Then AB   sqrt     sqrt  
   AC

   NB ie between  and 
   BC   sqrt     sqrt  
   BD   sqrt     sqrt  
   CD   sqrt     sqrt  


Hence sum of distances from A is between  and  from B between 
and  from C between  and  from D between  and  Why not
between  and  Make this out for yourselves Hence the sum is
least for A

PINAFORE JANET and VALENTINE with the simple remark that they insist
on the unfortunate lodgers keeping to the pavement I used the words
crossed to Number Seventythree for the special purpose of showing
that short cuts were possible SEABREEZE does the same and adds
that the result would be the same even if they crossed the Square but
gives no proof of this M M draws a diagram and says that No  is
the house as the diagram shows I cannot see how it does so OLD
CAT assumes that the house must be No  or No  She does not
explain how she estimates the distances Bees Arithmetic is faulty she
makes  sqrt   sqrt   sqrt   I suppose you
mean  sqrt which would be a little nearer the truth But roots
cannot be added in this manner Do you think  sqrt   sqrt is
 or even  sqrt But AYRS state is more perilous still she
draws illogical conclusions with a frightful calmness After pointing
out rightly that AC is less than BD she says therefore the nearest
house to the other three must be A or C And again after pointing out
rightly that B and D are both within the halfsquare containing A
she says therefore AB  AD must be less than BC  CD There is no
logical force in either therefore For the first try Nos   
 this will make your premiss true and your conclusion false
Similarly for the second try Nos    

Of the five partlyright solutions RAGS AND TATTERS and MAD HATTER who
send one answer between them make No   units from the corner
instead of  CHEAM E R D L and MEGGY POTTS leave openings at the
corners of the Square which are not in the data moreover CHEAM gives
values for the distances without any hint that they are only
approximations CROPHI AND MOPHI make the bold and unfounded
assumption that there were really  houses on each side instead of 
as stated by Balbus We may assume they add that the doors of Nos
    are invisible from the centre of the Square What is
there I wonder that CROPHI AND MOPHI would not assume

Of the five who are wholly right I think BRADSHAW OF THE FUTURE CAIUS
CLIFTON C and MARTREB deserve special praise for their full
analytical solutions MATTHEW MATTICKS picks out No  and proves it
to be the right house in two ways very neatly and ingeniously but

Problem Two travellers starting at the same time went
opposite ways round a circular railway Trains start each way every 
minutes the easterly ones going round in  hours the westerly in 
How many trains did each meet on the way not counting trains met at the
terminus itself  They went round as before each traveller
counting as one the train containing the other traveller How many did
each meet

Answers   The easterly traveller met  the other 

                                   

The trains one way took  minutes the other way  Let us take the
L C M  and divide the railway into  units Then one set of
trains went at the rate of  units a minute and at intervals of 
units the other at the rate of  units a minute and at intervals of 
units An easterly train starting has  units between it and the first
train it will meet it does ths of this while the other does ths
and thus meets it at the end of  units and so all the way round A
westerly train starting has  units between it and the first train it
will meet it does ths of this while the other does ths and thus
meets it at the end of  units and so all the way round Hence if the
railway be divided by  posts into  parts each containing 
units trains meet at every post and in  each traveller passes 
posts in going round and so meets  trains But in  the easterly
traveller only begins to count after traversing ths of the journey
ie on reaching the th post and so counts  posts similarly the
other counts  They meet at the end of ths of  hours or ths of
 hours ie  minutes

Of the  answers for which the working is given  are wrong 
halfwrong and halfright  right except that they cherish the
delusion that it was Clara who travelled in the easterly traina
point which the data do not enable us to settle and  wholly right

The  wrong answers are from BOPEEP FINANCIER I W T KATE B M
A H Q Y Z SEAGULL THISTLEDOWN TOMQUAD and an unsigned one
BOPEEP rightly says that the easterly traveller met all trains which
started during the  hours of her trip as well as all which started
during the previous  hours ie all which started at the
commencements of  periods of  minutes each and she is right in
striking out the one she met at the moment of starting but wrong in
striking out the last train for she did not meet this at the
terminus but  minutes before she got there She makes the same
mistake in  FINANCIER thinks that any train met for the second
time is not to be counted I W T finds by a process which is not
stated that the travellers met at the end of  minutes and 
seconds KATE B thinks the trains which are met on starting and on
arriving are never to be counted even when met elsewhere Q Y Z
tries a rather complex algebraical solution and succeeds in finding the
time of meeting correctly all else is wrong SEAGULL seems to think
that in  the easterly train stood still for  hours and says
that in  the travellers met at the end of  minutes  seconds
THISTLEDOWN nobly confesses to having tried no calculation but merely
having drawn a picture of the railway and counted the trains in 
she counts wrong in  she makes them meet in  minutes TOMQUAD
omits  in  he makes Clara count the train she met on her arrival
The unsigned one is also unintelligible it states that the travellers
go th more than the total distance to be traversed The Clara
theory already referred to is adopted by  of these viz BOPEEP
FINANCIER KATE B TOMQUAD and the nameless writer

The  halfright answers are from BOGOAK BRIDGET CASTOR CHESHIRE
CAT G E B GUY MARY M A H OLD MAID R W and VENDREDI All
these adopt the Clara theory CASTOR omits  VENDREDI gets 
right but in  makes the same mistake as BOPEEP I notice in your
solution a marvellous proportionsum miles  hours  one mile
 seconds May I venture to advise your acquiring as soon as
possible an utter disbelief in the possibility of a ratio existing
between miles and hours Do not be disheartened by your two friends
sarcastic remarks on your roundabout ways Their short method of
adding  and  has the slight disadvantage of bringing the answer
wrong even a roundabout method is better than that M A H in
 makes the travellers count one after they met not when they
met CHESHIRE CAT and OLD MAID get  as answer for  by forgetting
to strike out the train met on arrival The others all get  in
various ways BOGOAK GUY and R W divide the trains which the
westerly traveller has to meet into  sets viz those already on the
line which they rightly make  and those which started during her
 hours journey exclusive of train met on arrival which they
wrongly make  and they make a similar mistake with the easterly
train BRIDGET rightly says that the westerly traveller met a train
every  minutes for  hours but wrongly makes the number  it
should be  G E B adopts BOPEEPS method but wrongly strikes
out for the easterly traveller the train which started at the
commencement of the previous  hours MARY thinks a train met on
arrival must not be counted even when met on a previous occasion

condition  xs to  or  pictures can only mean either to  or
else to  if as one competitor holds it might mean any number not
less than  the words or  would be superfluous I E A I am
happy to say that none of these bloodless phantoms appear this time in
the classlist Is it IDEA with the D left out gives  xs to 
pictures She then takes me to task for using the word ought instead
of nought No doubt to one who thus rebels against the rules laid
down for her guidance the word must be distasteful But does not I E
A remember the parallel case of adder That creature was originally
a nadder then the two words took to bandying the poor n backwards
and forwards like a shuttlecock the final state of the game being an
adder May not a nought have similarly become an ought Anyhow
oughts and crosses is a very old game I dont think I ever heard it
called noughts and crosses

In the following Classlist I hope the solitary occupant of III will
sheathe her claws when she hears how narrow an escape she has had of not
being named at all Her account of the process by which she got the
answer is so meagre that like the nursery tale of JackaMinory I
trust I E A will be merciful to the spelling it is scarcely to be

Problem A and B began the year with only l apiece
They borrowed nought they stole nought On the next NewYears Day they
had l between them How did they do it

SolutionThey went that day to the Bank of England A stood in
front of it while B went round and stood behind it

                                   

Two answers have been received both worthy of much honour ADDLEPATE
makes them borrow  and steal  and uses both cyphers by putting
them at the righthand end of the l thus producing l
which is well over the mark But or to express it in Latin AT SPES
INFRACTA has solved it even more ingeniously with the first cypher she
turns the  of the l into a  and adds the result to the
original sum thus getting l and in this by means of the
other  she turns the  into a  thus hitting the exact

Problem L makes  scarves while M makes  Z makes  while
L makes  Five scarves of Zs weigh one of Ls  of Ms weigh
 of Zs One of Ms is as warm as  of Zs and one of Ls as
warm as  of Ms Which is best giving equal weight in the result to
rapidity of work lightness and warmth

AnswerThe order is M L Z

                                   

SolutionAs to rapidity other things being constant Ls merit is
to Ms in the ratio of  to  Zs to Ls in the ratio of  to 
In order to get one set of  numbers fulfilling these conditions it is
perhaps simplest to take the one that occurs twice as unity and
reduce the others to fractions this gives for L M and Z the
marks    In estimating for lightness we observe that the
greater the weight the less the merit so that Zs merit is to Ls
as  to  Thus the marks for lightness are    And
similarly the marks for warmth are    To get the total result
we must multiply Ls  marks together and do the same for M and
for Z The final numbers are              
 ie    ie multiplying throughout by  which
will not alter the proportion    showing the order of merit to
be M L Z

                                   

Twentynine answers have been received of which five are right and
twentyfour wrong These hapless ones have all with three exceptions
fallen into the error of adding the proportional numbers together for
each candidate instead of multiplying Why the latter is right
rather than the former is fully proved in textbooks so I will not
occupy space by stating it here but it can be illustrated very easily
by the case of length breadth and depth Suppose A and B are rival
diggers of rectangular tanks the amount of work done is evidently
measured by the number of cubical feet dug out Let A dig a tank 
feet long  wide  deep let B dig one  feet long  wide 
deep The cubical contents are   ie B is best digger in
the ratio of  to  Now try marking for length width and depth
separately giving a maximum mark of  to the best in each contest and
then adding the results

Of the twentyfour malefactors one gives no working and so has no real
claim to be named but I break the rule for once in deference to its
success in Problem  he she or it is ADDLEPATE The other
twentythree may be divided into five groups

First and worst are I take it those who put the rightful winner
last arranging them as Lolo Zuzu Mimi The names of these
desperate wrongdoers are AYR BRADSHAW OF THE FUTURE FURZEBUSH and
POLLUX who send a joint answer GREYSTEAD GUY OLD HEN and SIMPLE
SUSAN The latter was once best of all the Old Hen has taken
advantage of her simplicity and beguiled her with the chaff which was
the bane of her own chickenhood

Secondly I point the finger of scorn at those who have put the worst
candidate at the top arranging them as Zuzu Mimi Lolo They are
GRAECIA M M OLD CAT and R E X Tis Greece but

The third set have avoided both these enormities and have even
succeeded in putting the worst last their answer being Lolo Mimi
Zuzu Their names are AYR who also appears among the quite too too
CLIFTON C F B FIFEE GRIG JANET and MRS SAIREY GAMP F B has
not fallen into the common error she multiplies together the
proportionate numbers she gets but in getting them she goes wrong by
reckoning warmth as a demerit Possibly she is Freshly Burnt or
comes From Bombay JANET and MRS SAIREY GAMP have also avoided this
error the method they have adopted is shrouded in mysteryI scarcely
feel competent to criticize it MRS GAMP says if Zuzu makes  while
Lolo makes  Zuzu makes  while Lolo makes  bad reasoning while
Mimi makes  From this she concludes therefore Zuzu excels in speed
by  ie when compared with Lolo but what about Mimi She then
compares the  kinds of excellence measured on this mystic scale JANET
takes the statement that Lolo makes  while Mimi makes  to prove
that Lolo makes  while Mimi makes  and Zuzu  worse reasoning than
MRS GAMPS and thence concludes that Zuzu excels in speed by 
JANET should have been ADELINE mystery of mysteries

The fourth set actually put Mimi at the top arranging them as Mimi
Zuzu Lolo They are MARQUIS AND CO MARTREB S B B first initial
scarcely legible may be meant for J and STANZA

The fifth set consist of AN ANCIENT FISH and CAMEL These illassorted
comrades by dint of foot and fin have scrambled into the right answer
but as their method is wrong of course it counts for nothing Also AN
ANCIENT FISH has very ancient and fishlike ideas as to how numbers
represent merit she says Lolo gains  on Mimi Two and a half
what Fish fish art thou in thy duty

Of the five winners I put BALBUS and THE ELDER TRAVELLER slightly below
the other threeBALBUS for defective reasoning the other for scanty
working BALBUS gives two reasons for saying that addition of marks is
not the right method and then adds it follows that the decision must
be made by multiplying the marks together This is hardly more
logical than to say This is not Spring therefore it must be Autumn

ANSWERS TO KNOT VII

ProblemGiven that one glass of lemonade  sandwiches and 
biscuits cost s d and that one glass of lemonade 
sandwiches and  biscuits cost s d find the cost of  a
glass of lemonade a sandwich and a biscuit and   glasses of
lemonade  sandwiches and  biscuits

Answer d  s d

SolutionThis is best treated algebraically Let x  the cost in
pence of a glass of lemonade y of a sandwich and z of a biscuit
Then we have x  y  z   and x  y  z   And we
require the values of x  y  z and of x  y  z Now
from two equations only we cannot find separately the values of
three unknowns certain combinations of them may however be found
Also we know that we can by the help of the given equations eliminate
 of the  unknowns from the quantity whose value is required which
will then contain one only If then the required value is
ascertainable at all it can only be by the rd unknown vanishing of
itself otherwise the problem is impossible

Let us then eliminate lemonade and sandwiches and reduce everything to
biscuitsa state of things even more depressing than if all the world
were applepieby subtracting the st equation from the nd which
eliminates lemonade and gives y  z   or y  z and then
substituting this value of y in the st which gives xz  
ie x    z Now if we substitute these values of x y in
the quantities whose values are required the first becomes   z 
z  z ie  and the second becomes   z  z
 z ie  Hence the answers are  d  s d

                                   

The above is a universal method that is it is absolutely certain
either to produce the answer or to prove that no answer is possible
The question may also be solved by combining the quantities whose values
are given so as to form those whose values are required This is merely
a matter of ingenuity and good luck and as it may fail even when the
thing is possible and is of no use in proving it impossible I cannot
rank this method as equal in value with the other Even when it
succeeds it may prove a very tedious process Suppose the 
competitors who have sent in what I may call accidental solutions
had had a question to deal with where every number contained  or 
digits I suspect it would have been a case of silvered is the raven
hair see Patience before any solution would have been hit on by
the most ingenious of them

Fortyfive answers have come in of which  give I am happy to say
some sort of working and therefore deserve to be mentioned by name
and to have their virtues or vices as the case may be discussed
Thirteen have made assumptions to which they have no right and so
cannot figure in the Classlist even though in  of the  cases the
answer is right Of the remaining  no less than  have sent in
accidental solutions and therefore fall short of the highest honours

I will now discuss individual cases taking the worst first as my
custom is

FROGGY gives no workingat least this is all he gives after stating
the given equations he says therefore the difference  sandwich  
biscuits  d then follow the amounts of the unknown bills with
no further hint as to how he got them FROGGY has had a very narrow
escape of not being named at all

Of those who are wrong VIS INERTI has sent in a piece of incorrect
working Peruse the horrid details and shudder She takes x call it
y as the cost of a sandwich and concludes rightly enough that a
biscuit will cost y She then subtracts the second equation from
the first and deduces y    yy    y  
By making two mistakes in this line she brings out y   Try it
again oh VIS INERTI Away with INERTI infuse a little more VIS and
you will bring out the correct though uninteresting result   
This will show you that it is hopeless to try to coax any one of these 
unknowns to reveal its separate value The other competitor who is
wrong throughout is either J M C or T M C but whether he be a
Juvenile MisCalculator or a True Mathematician Confused he makes the
answers d and s d He assumes with Too Much Confidence that
biscuits were d each and that Clara paid for  though she only
ate 

We will now consider the  whose working is wrong though the answer is
right and not to measure their demerits too exactly I will take them
in alphabetical order ANITA finds rightly that  sandwich and 
biscuits cost d and proceeds therefore  sandwich  d 
biscuits  d  lemonade  d DINAH MITE begins like ANITA
and thence proves rightly that a biscuit costs less than a d
whence she concludes wrongly that it must cost d F C W is
so beautifully resigned to the certainty of a verdict of guilty that
I have hardly the heart to utter the word without adding a recommended
to mercy owing to extenuating circumstances But really you know
where are the extenuating circumstances She begins by assuming that
lemonade is d a glass and sandwiches d each making with the 
given equations four conditions to be fulfilled by three miserable
unknowns And having naturally developed this into a contradiction
she then tries d and d with a similar result NB This
process might have been carried on through the whole of the Tertiary
Period without gratifying one single Megatherium She then by a
happy thought tries halfpenny biscuits and so obtains a consistent
result This may be a good solution viewing the problem as a conundrum
but it is not scientific JANET identifies sandwiches with biscuits
One sandwich   biscuits she makes equal to  Four what MAYFAIR
makes the astounding assertion that the equation s  b   is
evidently only satisfied by s   b   OLD CAT believes that
the assumption that a sandwich costs d is the only way to avoid
unmanageable fractions But why avoid them Is there not a certain
glow of triumph in taming such a fraction Ladies and gentlemen the
fraction now before you is one that for years defied all efforts of a
refining nature it was in a word hopelessly vulgar Treating it as a
circulating decimal the treadmill of fractions only made matters
worse As a last resource I reduced it to its lowest terms and
extracted its square root Joking apart let me thank OLD CAT for some
very kind words of sympathy in reference to a correspondent whose name
I am happy to say I have now forgotten who had found fault with me as a
discourteous critic O V L is beyond my comprehension He takes the
given equations as  and  thence by the process  deduces
rightly equation  viz s  b   and thence again by the
process x a hopeless mystery deduces s  b   I have
nothing to say about it I give it up SEABREEZE says it is immaterial
to the answer why in what proportion d is divided between the
sandwich and the  biscuits so she assumes s  ld b 
d STANZA is one of a very irregular metre At first she like
JANET identifies sandwiches with biscuits She then tries two
assumptions s   b   and s   b   and
naturally ends in contradictions Then she returns to the first
assumption and finds the  unknowns separately quod est absurdum
STILETTO identifies sandwiches and biscuits as articles Is the word
ever used by confectioners I fancied What is the next article Maam
was limited to linendrapers TWO SISTERS first assume that biscuits are
 a penny and then that they are  a penny adding that the answer
will of course be the same in both cases It is a dreamy remark
making one feel something like Macbeth grasping at the spectral dagger

walked the same way this morning and I were to say one of you
walked the same way but the other didnt which of the three would be
the most hopelessly confused TURTLE PYATE what is a Turtle Pyate
please and OLD CROW who send a joint answer and Y Y adopt the
same method Y Y gets the equation s  b   and then says this
sum must be apportioned in one of the three following ways It may
be I grant you but Y Y do you say must I fear it is possible
for Y Y to be two Ys The other two conspirators are less positive
they say it can be so divided but they add either of the three
prices being right This is bad grammar and bad arithmetic at once oh
mysterious birds

Of those who win honours THE SHETLAND SNARK must have the rd class all
to himself He has only answered half the question viz the amount of
Claras luncheon the two little old ladies he pitilessly leaves in the
midst of their difficulty I beg to assure him with thanks for his
friendly remarks that entrancefees and subscriptions are things
unknown in that most economical of clubs The KnotUntiers

The authors of the  accidental solutions differ only in the number
of steps they have taken between the data and the answers In order
to do them full justice I have arranged the nd class in sections
according to the number of steps The two Kings are fearfully
deliberate I suppose walking quick or taking short cuts is
inconsistent with kingly dignity but really in reading THESEUS
solution one almost fancied he was marking time and making no
advance at all The other King will I hope pardon me for having
altered Coal into Cole King Coilus or Coil seems to have reigned
soon after Arthurs time Henry of Huntingdon identifies him with the
King Col who first built walls round Colchester which was named after
him In the Chronicle of Robert of Gloucester we read

   Aftur Kyng Aruirag of wam we habbeth y told
   Marius ys sone was kyng quoynte mon  bold
   And ys sone was aftur hym Coil was ys name
   Bothe it were quoynte men  of noble fame

BALBUS lays it down as a general principle that in order to ascertain
the cost of any one luncheon it must come to the same amount upon two
different assumptions Query Should not it be we Otherwise the
luncheon is represented as wishing to ascertain its own cost He then
makes two assumptionsone that sandwiches cost nothing the other
that biscuits cost nothing either arrangement would lead to the shop
being inconveniently crowdedand brings out the unknown luncheons as
d and d on each assumption He then concludes that this
agreement of results shows that the answers are correct Now I propose
to disprove his general law by simply giving one instance of its
failing One instance is quite enough In logical language in order to
disprove a universal affirmative it is enough to prove its
contradictory which is a particular negative I must pause for a
digression on Logic and especially on Ladies Logic The universal
affirmative everybody says hes a duck is crushed instantly by proving
the particular negative Peter says hes a goose which is equivalent
to Peter does not say hes a duck And the universal negative
nobody calls on her is well met by the particular affirmative I
called yesterday In short either of two contradictories disproves the
other and the moral is that since a particular proposition is much
more easily proved than a universal one it is the wisest course in
arguing with a Lady to limit ones own assertions to particulars
and leave her to prove the universal contradictory if she can You
will thus generally secure a logical victory a practical victory is
not to be hoped for since she can always fall back upon the crushing
remark that has nothing to do with ita move for which Man has not
yet discovered any satisfactory answer Now let us return to BALBUS
Here is my particular negative on which to test his rule Suppose the
two recorded luncheons to have been  buns one queencake 
sausagerolls and a bottle of Zodone total oneandninepence and
one bun  queencakes a sausageroll and a bottle of Zodone total
oneandfourpence And suppose Claras unknown luncheon to have been 
buns one queencake one sausageroll and  bottles of Zodone while
the two little sisters had been indulging in  buns  queencakes 
sausagerolls and  bottles of Zodone Poor souls how thirsty they
must have been If BALBUS will kindly try this by his principle of two
assumptions first assuming that a bun is d and a queencake d
and then that a bun is d and a queencake d he will bring out
the other two luncheons on each assumption as oneandninepence and
fourandtenpence respectively which harmony of results he will
say shows that the answers are correct And yet as a matter of fact
the buns were d each the queencakes d the sausagerolls
d and the Zodone d a bottle so that Claras third luncheon
had cost oneandsevenpence and her thirsty friends had spent
fourandfourpence

Another remark of BALBUS I will quote and discuss for I think that it
also may yield a moral for some of my readers He says it is the same
thing in substance whether in solving this problem we use words and call
it Arithmetic or use letters and signs and call it Algebra Now this
does not appear to me a correct description of the two methods the
Arithmetical method is that of synthesis only it goes from one known
fact to another till it reaches its goal whereas the Algebraical
method is that of analysis it begins with the goal symbolically
represented and so goes backwards dragging its veiled victim with it
till it has reached the full daylight of known facts in which it can
tear off the veil and say I know you

Take an illustration Your house has been broken into and robbed and
you appeal to the policeman who was on duty that night Well Mum I
did see a chap getting out over your gardenwall but I was a good bit
off so I didnt chase him like I just cut down the short way to the
Chequers and who should I meet but Bill Sykes coming full split round
the corner So I just ups and says My lad youre wanted Thats all I
says And he says Ill go along quiet Bobby he says without the
darbies he says Theres your Arithmetical policeman Now try the
other method I seed somebody a running but he was well gone or ever
I got nigh the place So I just took a look round in the garden And I
noticed the footmarks where the chap had come right across your
flowerbeds They was good big footmarks surely And I noticed as the
left foot went down at the heel ever so much deeper than the other And
I says to myself The chaps been a big hulking chap and he goes lame
on his left foot And I rubs my hand on the wall where he got over and
there was soot on it and no mistake So I says to myself Now where can
I light on a big man in the chimbleysweep line whats lame of one
foot And I flashes up permiscuous and I says Its Bill Sykes says
I There is your Algebraical policemana higher intellectual type
to my thinking than the other

LITTLE JACKS solution calls for a word of praise as he has written out
what really is an algebraical proof in words without representing any
of his facts as equations If it is all his own he will make a good
algebraist in the time to come I beg to thank SIMPLE SUSAN for some
kind words of sympathy to the same effect as those received from OLD

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS

I have received several letters on the subjects of Knots II and VI
which lead me to think some further explanation desirable

In Knot II I had intended the numbering of the houses to begin at one
corner of the Square and this was assumed by most if not all of the
competitors TROJANUS however says assuming in default of any
information that the street enters the square in the middle of each
side it may be supposed that the numbering begins at a street But
surely the other is the more natural assumption

In Knot VI the first Problem was of course a mere jeu de mots whose
presence I thought excusable in a series of Problems whose aim is to
entertain rather than to instruct but it has not escaped the
contemptuous criticisms of two of my correspondents who seem to think
that Apollo is in duty bound to keep his bow always on the stretch
Neither of them has guessed it and this is true human nature Only the
other daythe st of September to be quite exactI met my old friend
Brown and gave him a riddle I had just heard With one great effort of
his colossal mind Brown guessed it Right said I Ah said he
its very neatvery neat And it isnt an answer that would occur to
everybody Very neat indeed A few yards further on I fell in with
Smith and to him I propounded the same riddle He frowned over it for a
minute and then gave it up Meekly I faltered out the answer A poor
thing sir Smith growled as he turned away A very poor thing I
wonder you care to repeat such rubbish Yet Smiths mind is if
possible even more colossal than Browns

The second Problem of Knot VI is an example in ordinary Double Rule of
Three whose essential feature is that the result depends on the
variation of several elements which are so related to it that if all
but one be constant it varies as that one hence if none be constant
it varies as their product Thus for example the cubical contents of a
rectangular tank vary as its length if breadth and depth be constant
and so on hence if none be constant it varies as the product of the
length breadth and depth

When the result is not thus connected with the varying elements the
Problem ceases to be Double Rule of Three and often becomes one of great
complexity

To illustrate this let us take two candidates for a prize A and B
who are to compete in French German and Italian

a Let it be laid down that the result is to depend on their
relative knowledge of each subject so that whether their marks for
French be   or   the result will be the same and let it
also be laid down that if they get equal marks on  papers the final
marks are to have the same ratio as those of the rd paper This is a
case of ordinary Double Rule of Three We multiply As  marks
together and do the same for B Note that if A gets a single 
his final mark is  even if he gets full marks for  papers while B
gets only one mark for each paper This of course would be very unfair
on A though a correct solution under the given conditions

b The result is to depend as before on relative knowledge but
French is to have twice as much weight as German or Italian This is an
unusual form of question I should be inclined to say the resulting
ratio is to be nearer to the French ratio than if we multiplied as in
a and so much nearer that it would be necessary to use the other
multipliers twice to produce the same result as in a eg if
the French Ratio were  and the others   so that the ultimate
ratio by method a would be  I should multiply instead by 
 giving the result  which is nearer to  than if he had used
method a

c The result is to depend on actual amount of knowledge of the 
subjects collectively Here we have to ask two questions  What is
to be the unit ie standard to measure by in each subject 
Are these units to be of equal or unequal value The usual unit is
the knowledge shown by answering the whole paper correctly calling this
 all lower amounts are represented by numbers between  and
 Then if these units are to be of equal value we simply add
As  marks together and do the same for B

d The conditions are the same as c but French is to have double
weight Here we simply double the French marks and add as before

e French is to have such weight that if other marks be equal the
ultimate ratio is to be that of the French paper so that a  in this
would swamp the candidate but the other two subjects are only to affect
the result collectively by the amount of knowledge shown the two being
reckoned of equal value Here I should add As German and Italian
marks together and multiply by his French mark

But I need not go on the problem may evidently be set with many varying
conditions each requiring its own method of solution The Problem in
Knot VI was meant to belong to variety a and to make this clear I
inserted the following passage

Usually the competitors differ in one point only Thus last year Fifi
and Gogo made the same number of scarves in the trial week and they
were equally light but Fifis were twice as warm as Gogos and she was
pronounced twice as good

What I have said will suffice I hope as an answer to BALBUS who holds
that a and c are the only possible varieties of the problem and
that to say We cannot use addition therefore we must be intended to
use multiplication is no more illogical than from knowledge that one
was not born in the night to infer that he was born in the daytime
and also to FIFEE who says I think a little more consideration will
show you that our error of adding the proportional numbers together
for each candidate instead of multiplying is no error at all Why
even if addition had been the right method to use not one of the
writers I speak from memory showed any consciousness of the necessity
of fixing a unit for each subject No error at all They were
positively steeped in error

One correspondent I do not name him as the communication is not quite
friendly in tone writes thusI wish to add very respectfully that
I think it would be in better taste if you were to abstain from the very
trenchant expressions which you are accustomed to indulge in when
criticising the answer That such a tone must not be be not
agreeable to the persons concerned who have made mistakes may possibly
have no great weight with you but I hope you will feel that it would be
as well not to employ it unless you are quite certain of being correct
yourself The only instances the writer gives of the trenchant
expressions are hapless and malefactors I beg to assure him and
any others who may need the assurance I trust there are none that all
such words have been used in jest and with no idea that they could
possibly annoy any one and that I sincerely regret any annoyance I may
have thus inadvertently given May I hope that in future they will
recognise the distinction between severe language used in sober earnest
and the words of unmeant bitterness which Coleridge has alluded to in
that lovely passage beginning A little child a limber elf If the
writer will refer to that passage or to the preface to Fire Famine
and Slaughter he will find the distinction for which I plead far
better drawn out than I could hope to do in any words of mine

The writers insinuation that I care not how much annoyance I give to my
readers I think it best to pass over in silence but to his concluding
remark I must entirely demur I hold that to use language likely to
annoy any of my correspondents would not be in the least justified by
the plea that I was quite certain of being correct I trust that the
knotuntiers and I are not on such terms as those

I beg to thank G B for the offer of a puzzlewhich however is too
like the old one Make four s into

  THE GRURMSTIPTHS

ProblemOmnibuses start from a certain point both ways every 
minutes A traveller starting on foot along with one of them meets
one in  minutes when will he be overtaken by one

AnswerIn  minutes

                                   

SolutionLet a be the distance an omnibus goes in  minutes
and x the distance from the startingpoint to where the traveller is
overtaken Since the omnibus met is due at the startingpoint in 
minutes it goes in that time as far as the traveller walks in 
ie it goes  times as fast Now the overtaking omnibus is a
behind the traveller when he starts and therefore goes a  x
while he goes x Hence a  x  x ie x  a and x
 a This distance would be traversed by an omnibus in  minutes
and therefore by the traveller in    Hence he is overtaken in
 minutes after starting ie in  minutes after meeting the
omnibus

                                   

Four answers have been received of which two are wrong DINAH MITE
rightly states that the overtaking omnibus reached the point where they
met the other omnibus  minutes after they left but wrongly concludes
that going  times as fast it would overtake them in another minute
The travellers are minuteswalk ahead of the omnibus and must walk
th of this distance farther before the omnibus overtakes them which
will be th of the distance traversed by the omnibus in the same time
this will require  minutes more NOLENS VOLENS tries it by a
process like Achilles and the Tortoise He rightly states that when
the overtaking omnibus leaves the gate the travellers are th of
a ahead and that it will take the omnibus  minutes to traverse
this distance during which time the travellers he tells us go
th of a this should be th The travellers being now th
of a ahead he concludes that the work remaining to be done is for
the travellers to go th of a while the omnibus goes lth The
principle is correct and might have been applied earlier

ANSWERS TO KNOT IX


  THE BUCKETS

ProblemLardner states that a solid immersed in a fluid displaces
an amount equal to itself in bulk How can this be true of a small
bucket floating in a larger one

SolutionLardner means by displaces occupies a space which
might be filled with water without any change in the surroundings If
the portion of the floating bucket which is above the water could be
annihilated and the rest of it transformed into water the surrounding
water would not change its position which agrees with Lardners
statement

                                   

Five answers have been received none of which explains the difficulty
arising from the wellknown fact that a floating body is the same weight
as the displaced fluid HECLA says that only that portion of the
smaller bucket which descends below the original level of the water can
be properly said to be immersed and only an equal bulk of water is
displaced Hence according to HECLA a solid whose weight was equal
to that of an equal bulk of water would not float till the whole of it
was below the original level of the water but as a matter of fact
it would float as soon as it was all under water MAGPIE says the
fallacy is the assumption that one body can displace another from a
place where it isnt and that Lardners assertion is incorrect except
when the containing vessel was originally full to the brim But the
question of floating depends on the present state of things not on past
history OLD KING COLE takes the same view as HECLA TYMPANUM and VINDEX
assume that displaced means raised above its original level and
merely explain how it comes to pass that the water so raised is less
in bulk than the immersed portion of bucket and thus land
themselvesor rather set themselves floatingin the same boat as
HECLA

I regret that there is no Classlist to publish for this Problem

                                   


  BALBUS ESSAY

ProblemBalbus states that if a certain solid be immersed in a
certain vessel of water the water will rise through a series of
distances two inches one inch half an inch c which series has no
end He concludes that the water will rise without limit Is this true

SolutionNo This series can never reach  inches since however
many terms we take we are always short of  inches by an amount equal
to the last term taken

                                   

Three answers have been receivedbut only two seem to me worthy of
honours

TYMPANUM says that the statement about the stick is merely a blind to
which the old answer may well be applied solvitur ambulando or
rather mergendo I trust TYMPANUM will not test this in his own
person by taking the place of the man in Balbus Essay He would
infallibly be drowned

OLD KING COLE rightly points out that the series   c is a
decreasing Geometrical Progression while VINDEX rightly identifies the
fallacy as that of Achilles and the Tortoise

  THE GARDEN

ProblemAn oblong garden half a yard longer than wide consists
entirely of a gravelwalk spirally arranged a yard wide and 
yards long Find the dimensions of the garden

Answer 

SolutionThe number of yards and fractions of a yard traversed in
walking along a straight piece of walk is evidently the same as the
number of squareyards and fractions of a squareyard contained in that
piece of walk and the distance traversed in passing through a
squareyard at a corner is evidently a yard Hence the area of the
garden is  squareyards ie if x be the width x x 
   Solving this Quadratic we find x   Hence the
dimensions are  

                                   

Twelve answers have been receivedseven right and five wrong

C G L NABOB OLD CROW and TYMPANUM assume that the number of yards
in the length of the path is equal to the number of squareyards in the
garden This is true but should have been proved But each is guilty of
darker deeds C G Ls working consists of dividing  by 
Whence came this divisor oh Segiel Divination Or was it a dream I
fear this solution is worth nothing OLD CROWS is shorter and so if
possible worth rather less He says the answer is at once seen to be
   NABOBS calculation is short but as rich as a Nabob in
error He says that the square root of  multiplied by  equals
the length plus the breadth That is      His first
assertion is only true of a square garden His second is irrelevant
since  is not the squareroot of  Nay Bob this will not
do TYMPANUM says that by extracting the squareroot of  we get
 yards with a remainder of  or halfayard which we add so as
to make the oblong    This is very terrible but worse remains
behind TYMPANUM proceeds thusBut why should there be the halfyard
at all Because without it there would be no space at all for flowers
By means of it we find reserved in the very centre a small plot of
ground two yards long by halfayard wide the only space not occupied
by walk But Balbus expressly said that the walk used up the whole of
the area Oh TYMPANUM My tympa is exhausted my brain is num I can
say no more

HECLA indulges again and again in that most fatal of all habits in
computationthe making two mistakes which cancel each other She
takes x as the width of the garden in yards and x   as its
length and makes her first coil the sum of x x x
x ie x but the fourth term should be x so that
her first coil is  a yard too long Her second coil is the sum of
x x x x here the first term should be x
and the last x these two mistakes cancel and this coil is
therefore right And the same thing is true of every other coil but the
last which needs an extra halfyard to reach the end of the path and
this exactly balances the mistake in the first coil Thus the sum total
of the coils comes right though the working is all wrong

Of the seven who are right DINAH MITE JANET MAGPIE and TAFFY make
the same assumption as C G L and Co They then solve by a Quadratic
MAGPIE also tries it by Arithmetical Progression but fails to notice
that the first and last coils have special values

ALUMNUS ETON attempts to prove what C G L assumes by a particular
instance taking a garden  by  He ought to have proved it
generally what is true of one number is not always true of others OLD
KING COLE solves it by an Arithmetical Progression It is right but too
lengthy to be worth as much as a Quadratic

VINDEX proves it very neatly by pointing out that a yard of walk
measured along the middle represents a square yard of garden whether
we consider the straight stretches of walk or the square yards at the
angles in which the middle line goes half a yard in one direction and
then turns a right angle and goes half a yard in another direction

ANSWERS TO KNOT X


  THE CHELSEA PENSIONERS

ProblemIf  per cent have lost an eye  per cent an ear 
per cent an arm  per cent a leg what percentage at least must
have lost all four

AnswerTen


SolutionI adopt that of POLAR STAR as being better than my own
Adding the wounds together we get          among 
men which gives  to each and  to  men Therefore the least
percentage is 

                                   

Nineteen answers have been received One is  but as no working is
given with it it must in accordance with the rule remain a deed
without a name JANET makes it  and ths I am sorry she has
misunderstood the question and has supposed that those who had lost an
ear were  per cent of those who had lost an eye and so on Of
course on this supposition the percentages must all be multiplied
together This she has done correctly but I can give her no honours
as I do not think the question will fairly bear her interpretation
THREE SCORE AND TEN makes it  and ths Her solution has given
meI will not say many anxious days and sleepless nights for I wish
to be strictly truthful butsome trouble in making any sense at all of
it She makes the number of pensioners wounded once to be  per
cent I suppose dividing by  she gets  and a half as average
percentage again dividing by  she gets  and ths as percentage
wounded four times Does she suppose wounds of different kinds to
absorb each other so to speak Then no doubt the data are
equivalent to  pensioners with one wound each and a halfpensioner
with a halfwound And does she then suppose these concentrated wounds
to be transferable so that ths of these unfortunates can obtain
perfect health by handing over their wounds to the remaining th
Granting these suppositions her answer is right or rather if the
question had been A road is covered with one inch of gravel along 
and a half per cent of it How much of it could be covered  inches
deep with the same material her answer would have been right But
alas that wasnt the question DELTA makes some most amazing
assumptions let every one who has not lost an eye have lost an ear
let every one who has not lost both eyes and ears have lost an arm
Her ideas of a battlefield are grim indeed Fancy a warrior who would
continue fighting after losing both eyes both ears and both arms This
is a case which she or it evidently considers possible

Next come eight writers who have made the unwarrantable assumption that
because  per cent have lost an eye therefore  per cent have
not lost one so that they have both eyes This is illogical If you
give me a bag containing  sovereigns and if in an hour I come to you
my face not beaming with gratitude nearly so much as when I received
the bag to say I am sorry to tell you that  of these sovereigns are
bad do I thereby guarantee the other  to be good Perhaps I have not
tested them yet The sides of this illogical octagon are as follows in
alphabetical orderALGERNON BRAY DINAH MITE G S C JANE E J D
W MAGPIE who makes the delightful remark therefore  per cent have
two of something recalling to ones memory that fortunate monarch
with whom Xerxes was so much pleased that he gave him ten of
everything S S G and TOKIO

BRADSHAW OF THE FUTURE and T R do the question in a piecemeal
fashionon the principle that the  per cent and the  per cent
though commenced at opposite ends of the  must overlap by at least
 per cent and so on This is quite correct working but not I
think quite the best way of doing it

The other five competitors will I hope feel themselves sufficiently
glorified by being placed in the first class without my composing a
Triumphal Ode for each

  CHANGE OF DAY

I must postpone sine die the geographical problempartly because I
have not yet received the statistics I am hoping for and partly because
I am myself so entirely puzzled by it and when an examiner is himself
dimly hovering between a second class and a third how is he to decide
the position of others


  THE SONS AGES

ProblemAt first two of the ages are together equal to the third
A few years afterwards two of them are together double of the third
When the number of years since the first occasion is twothirds of the
sum of the ages on that occasion one age is  What are the other two

Answer and 

                                   

SolutionLet the ages at first be x y x  y Now if a
 b  c then an  bn  cn whatever be the
value of n Hence the second relationship if ever true was
always true Hence it was true at first But it cannot be true that
x and y are together double of x  y Hence it must be true of
x  y together with x or y and it does not matter which we
take We assume then x  y  x  y ie y  x
Hence the three ages were at first x x x and the number of
years since that time is twothirds of x ie is x Hence the
present ages are x x x The ages are clearly integers
since this is only the year when one of my sons comes of age Hence
x   x   and the other ages are  

                                   

Eighteen answers have been received One of the writers merely asserts
that the first occasion was  years ago that the ages were then  
and  and that on the second occasion they were   and  As a
Roman father I ought to withhold the name of the rash writer but
respect for age makes me break the rule it is THREE SCORE AND TEN JANE
E also asserts that the ages at first were    then she calculates
the present ages leaving the second occasion unnoticed OLD HEN is
nearly as bad she tried various numbers till I found one that fitted
all the conditions but merely scratching up the earth and pecking
about is not the way to solve a problem oh venerable bird And close
after OLD HEN prowls with hungry eyes OLD CAT who calmly assumes to
begin with that the son who comes of age is the eldest Eat your
bird Puss for you will get nothing from me

There are yet two zeroes to dispose of MINERVA assumes that on every
occasion a son comes of age and that it is only such a son who is
tipped with gold Is it wise thus to interpret now my boys
calculate your ages and you shall have the money BRADSHAW OF THE
FUTURE says let the ages at first be    then assumes that the
second occasion was  years afterwards and on these baseless
assumptions brings out the right answers Guide future travellers an
thou wilt thou art no Bradshaw for this Age

Of those who win honours the merely honourable are two DINAH MITE
ascertains rightly the relationship between the three ages at first
but then assumes one of them to be  thus making the rest of her
solution tentative M F C does the algebra all right up to the
conclusion that the present ages are z z and z it then
assumes without giving any reason that z  

Of the more honourable DELTA attempts a noveltyto discover which
son comes of age by elimination it assumes successively that it is
the middle one and that it is the youngest and in each case it
apparently brings out an absurdity Still as the proof contains the
following bit of algebra   x  y  therefore   x  
sevenths of y I trust it will admit that its proof is not quite
conclusive The rest of its work is good MAGPIE betrays the deplorable
tendency of her tribeto appropriate any stray conclusion she comes
across without having any strict logical right to it Assuming A
B C as the ages at first and D as the number of the years that
have elapsed since then she finds rightly the  equations A 
B C  B  A D  B She then says supposing that A  
then B   C   and D   Therefore for A B C D
four numbers are wanted which shall be to each other as  It is
in the therefore that I detect the unconscientiousness of this bird
The conclusion is true but this is only because the equations are
homogeneous ie having one unknown in each term a fact which I
strongly suspect had not been graspedI beg pardon clawedby her
Were I to lay this little pitfall A    B B    C
supposing A   then B   and C   Therefore for A B
C three numbers are wanted which shall be to one another as 
would you not flutter down into it oh MAGPIE as amiably as a Dove
SIMPLE SUSAN is anything but simple to me After ascertaining that the
 ages at first are as  she says then as twothirds of their
sum added to one of them   the sum cannot exceed  and
consequently the highest cannot exceed  I suppose her mental
argument is something like thistwothirds of sum  one age  
 therefore sum   halves of one age   and a half But  halves of
one age cannot be less than  andahalf here I perceive that SIMPLE
SUSAN would on no account present a guinea to a newborn baby hence
the sum cannot exceed  This is ingenious but her proof after that
is as she candidly admits clumsy and roundabout She finds that
there are  possible sets of ages and eliminates four of them Suppose
that instead of  there had been  million possible sets Would SIMPLE
SUSAN have courageously ordered in the necessary gallon of ink and ream
of paper

The solution sent in by C R is like that of SIMPLE SUSAN partly
tentative and so does not rise higher than being Clumsily Right

Among those who have earned the highest honours ALGERNON BRAY solves
the problem quite correctly but adds that there is nothing to exclude
the supposition that all the ages were fractional This would make the
number of answers infinite Let me meekly protest that I never
intended my readers to devote the rest of their lives to writing out
answers E M RIX points out that if fractional ages be admissible
any one of the three sons might be the one come of age but she
rightly rejects this supposition on the ground that it would make the
problem indeterminate WHITE SUGAR is the only one who has detected an
oversight of mine I had forgotten the possibility which of course
ought to be allowed for that the son who came of age that year need
not have done so by that day so that he might be only  This
gives a second solution viz    Well said pure Crystal
Verily thy fair discourse hath been as sugar

I have received more than one remonstrance on my assertion in the
Chelsea Pensioners problem that it was illogical to assume from the
datum  p c have lost an eye that  p c have not ALGERNON
BRAY states as a parallel case suppose Tommys father gives him 
apples and he eats one of them how many has he left and says I
think we are justified in answering  I think so too There is no
must here and the data are evidently meant to fix the answer
exactly but if the question were set me how many must he have
left I should understand the data to be that his father gave him 
at least but may have given him more

I take this opportunity of thanking those who have sent along with
their answers to the Tenth Knot regrets that there are no more Knots to
come or petitions that I should recall my resolution to bring them to
an end I am most grateful for their kind words but I think it wisest
to end what at best was but a lame attempt The stretched metre of an
antique song is beyond my compass and my puppets were neither
distinctly in my life like those I now address nor yet like Alice
and the Mock Turtle distinctly out of it Yet let me at least fancy
as I lay down the pen that I carry with me into my silent life dear
reader a farewell smile from your unseen face and a kindly farewell
pressure from your unfelt hand And so good night Parting is such
sweet sorrow that I shall say good night till it be morrow
