     Who but the imaginative young shall inherit the stars

                                   




The sleek transcontinental airliner settled onto one of the maze of
runways that was Stevenson Airport With its turbojets fading into a
dense roar it taxied across the field toward the central building
Inside the plane a red light went off

Senator Vance Duran unhooked the seat belt reached for his briefcase
and stepped into the crowded aisle The other passengers were all
strangers which had meant that for nearly an hour he had been able to
give his full attention to the several hundred pages of proposed
legislation and reports presented to the Committee on Extraterrestrial
Development of which he was chairman But now there would be
reporters local political pleaders the dinner at the Governors and
the inevitable unexpected interruptions which were a part of every
trip home

As he strode through the door and onto the mobile escalator he donned
his smile of tempered confidence in the economic future of the nation
A television camera went into action at once and newsmen formed a
small circle at the bottom of the ramp

That was a great little debate you put on with Ben Wickolm last
week one of the reporters said You really tied him up

You can thank Senator Wickolm for arousing me Duran answered
observing to himself that perhaps all of his efforts on the Hill did
not go unnoticed in his home state if most of them seemed to

What do you think Senator of the FCCs modified ruling on the
integrated lunar relay station plan another asked

I havent had time to get fully acquainted with it the senator
evaded stepping onto the ground and out of the way of the ramp

Say Senator what about the Mars colony project a third put in
How come its bogged down

No comment at present the senator said But he gave them an
ambiguous little grimace which was meant to suggest a minor but sticky
snarl behind the scenes He hoped it would satisfy them for the
moment

Making his escape as quickly as possible he climbed onto the shuttle
car already loaded down with the other passengers Finding an empty
seat he folded himself into it and was immediately joined by someone
else

Well Senator how does it feel to be home his companion asked with
sympathetic irony

Duran turned grinned and reached for the mans hand

Great Wayne he answered recognizing an old friend who had been of
no small aid during his earlier years in politics Say Id ask you
over for dinner if we werent going to the Governors tonight Molly
would love to see you Unfortunately Im leaving for Washington again
in the morning

Why doesnt Molly move to DC with you Vance the journalist
asked

Duran hesitated Maybe in a year or so After the boys are out of
highschool If I get the job again

The smile on the younger mans face was heartening

Dont play coy with me Vance You know youve got this state sewed
up Then came the slight frown of doubt Just one thing though A
lot of people are wondering why the hold up on the colony project
Youre bound to get a little of the criticism What the hells wrong
anyway

Cant you guess

Yeah I can guess Theres only one possibility since the government
scientists assure us theyve ironed out all the technical wrinkles
But its pretty hard to believe that out of the thousands of people
who volunteer every week not even a couple of hundred are
acceptable

Duran considered his answer carefully before voicing it

Ever ask yourself who volunteers Wayne

The journalist looked at him oddly then nodded

                                   

The senator took an elevator directly to the helicopter landing on the
roof of the building It was several minutes before he had located the
little runabout he had bought for his wife the previous Christmas
Jack Woodvale their caretaker gardener and chauffeur was just
retrieving his suitcase from the baggage lift as the senator arrived

Waiting until Woodvale had secured the suitcase in the luggage
compartment and climbed into the pilots seat Duran squeezed himself
into the cabin A minute or two later the little craft was rising from
the port directed automatically into the appropriate channel and
guided off toward the city

Howve things been going Jack the senator asked He felt good
Waynes friendship and assurances had provided a needed boost
Everything okay

Id say so sir Woodvale told him Had a little trouble with the
solar screen The store sent a man out to fix it Its all right now

The new power unit had been another of Mollys ideas Duran recalled
The old crystal sulfide screen had been perfectly reliable But Molly
had thought it looked ugly up there on the roof Mollys main faults
he decided derived from her concern with the neighbors opinions

Oh there was something else came up while I was on my way out to get
you Woodvale continued abruptly The states Attorney General
calledsaid it was important you contact him immediately

Duran sensed anger surging up as he remembered the times when as
District Attorney Sig Loeffler had openly snubbed him That of
course had been back in the days when Duran had been a junior partner
in one of the citys smaller law firms He had not forgiven Loeffler
nor had Loeffler given him any reason to do so Only the Governors
backslapping mediation had allowed them to reach a politically stable
relationship The relationship did not involve Durans compliance with
the mans whims however

Get him on the phone Jack Duran said at last But just make one
call If hes not at his office forget it

In less than a minute Woodvale was turning around to say

Hes in sir You want to talk to him

Duran grunted and lifted the phone from the clamp beside his seat

Senator Duran speaking he said

Vance this is Loeffler boomed a voice in considerable contrast to
the senators own mild tone Something pretty fantastic has happened
Were trying to keep it quiet at least until we decide on what action
to take But if you can make it over here some time this evening Ill
tell you the story Youre going to be in on it eventually and I
thought youd prefer getting in on it early

Duran had intended quite bluntly to explain that he had more important
business But there was something compelling about the mans
apparently ingenuous urgency that caused the senator to change his
mind

Okay Loeffler Ill be right over

He broke the contact and told Woodvale to dial his home number

Ernie this is Dad he said at the sound of his younger sons voice
Tell Mother Im going to stop off at the Attorney Generals
officethats rightbut that Ill be home in plenty of time to get
ready for the dinner Got that Thats right Hows school Something
wrong Okay son Ill see you later

Ernie had said that everything was all right but with an uneasiness
in the way he spoke Grades maybe Duran thought The boy had been
doing pretty well almost as well as Roger but was showing the
inevitable adolescent ramifications of interest Duran found himself
musing briefly upon his own youthful extracurricular forays up the
tree of knowledge and sighed

Go to the capitol building Jack he said

Which port should I use sir the younger man asked

The official one Duran told him This was Loefflers idea

                                   

The senator was surprised to find one of the Attorney Generals
harriedlooking secretaries working late She glanced up from her
typewriter and gave him an equivocal smile of recognition

Hes expecting you Mr Senator she said nodding toward the inner
office Go right in

Sigmund Loeffler was not alone But the two other visitors were paled
by the aura of importance which emanated from the large blackhaired
man behind the desk He rose grandly at Durans entrance and without
bothering to shake hands proceeded with introductions

Fritz Ambly Senator Vance Duran Fritz he explained is chairman
of the state Youth Welfare Board

Duran took the thin hand which the other extended to him and noted the
concern on the mans slim freckled face His features were
appropriately almost those of a child but of a worried child

And Bob Duff Senator Duran Loeffler went on Bob is head of our
Civil Defense now

The second man was in contrast short and homely but not without a
touch of the others anxiety

Well gentlemen youre welcome to stay if you wish the Attorney
General told them Ill have to repeat all the facts to Senator
Duran of course

Id better be off Ambly said Perhaps Ill see you at the
Governors tonight

Not me Im afraid Loeffler told him The DA and I have a little
problem to work out together Ill call you both tomorrow about the
press release

We cant wait too long said Duff Rumors can be a lot worse than
the truth Especially about something like this In fact I dont see
the point in waiting at all

Tomorrow Bob Tomorrow Loeffler promised Noon at the latest

His heavy smile faded as the two visitors closed the door behind them
With an unthrottled groan he lowered himself into the chair and
turned his dark gaze upon the senator

They think they have troubles he said

And you think I have Duran returned seating himself

I know you do Unfortunately I happen to share them to some
extent

He paused to relight the stub of a cigar then went on

Its a crazy world we live in Vance Things change Sometimes its
hard for us adults to keep up with it The kids seem to though

Duran tried to appear suavely bored with the others musings But in
spite of himself he could sense his gaze becoming intently expectant
Whatever connection there might be between himself Ambly and Duff
completely eluded him And that elusive connection had aroused his
curiosity

Yeah they keep up with things all right Loeffler went on And
sometimes they get some pretty big ideas

He halted puffed thoughtfully then barked

Remember Mel Skinners lodge out on that island in Wakataoga Lake
Big Spanishstyle place Built it for that wife of his he brought back
from Chile or somewhere

Yes I remember it Molly and I spent a weekend there a couple of
years ago Why the senator asked realizing more than ever how much
he disliked Sigmund Loeffler What are you getting at

Well the next time you go youd better take along some sleeping
bags said Loeffler Because the house isnt there anymore

Okay Duran said strangely anxious Lets forget the riddles and
get down to business What happened to Mel Skinners hacienda

The Attorney General stared at his guest for a moment before
remarking harshly

It got blown up

A bomb you mean Duran asked

Oh no nonothing so crude as that This was a guided missile With
a warhead

The senator was thinking fast now but still the pattern eluded him

Not an act of war surely he remarked

More like an act of revolution Loeffler told him Because the
agents behind it were kids Kids from our state our city Kids
from decent homes educated families Bright kids Happy kids Kids
with every opportunity Kids who ought to know better

Hold it Loeffler Duran interrupted rising from the chair to place
both hands on the edge of the desk Just one questionwas anyone
killed or injured

The other man hesitated melodramatically then looked down at his
cigar

No There was no one on the island The place had been closed down
for the winter Thats the only pleasant thing about it

Duran found it such unexpectedly good news that he was actually able
to smile when he dropped back into the chair

In other words Loeffler it was a prank

But the Attorney General seemed not to see it in precisely that light

A prank yes he exploded A hundred thousand dollar prank My God
Vance dont you see what those boys did They demonstrated the
grossest lack of respect for private property And what if theyd
miscalculated That rocket was fired from a distance of some fifty or
sixty miles It could have killed any number of people along its
course had it fallen short

Well Ill admit its not the sort of thing Id like to see
encouraged said Duran Now give me the details Who were they
Where did they get the rocket What was the point of it anyway

Sigmund Loeffler opened a folder which lay on his desk and started
sifting through its contents He pulled out several memoranda and a
list of names closing the folder again

There was a gang of eight all in the eleventh or twelfth grades at
Eisenhower High Five of them were members of the school rocket club
Three of them had juvenile delinquency recordsminor stuff mostly
like copter stunting and public disturbance The youngest had won a
couple of science awards for demonstrations in he glanced
significantly at the senator the chemistry of explosives

Duran said nothing but his sense of concern was growing

Lets see Loeffler went on Two of the boys were taking vocational
courses One had his own machine shop in fact Then there was the
electronics expertCeasar Grassos sonknow him

The senator nodded

He runs the highschool TV station Knows a lot about radio I
understand Oh yes There was also the lad who drew up the plans for
the gadget Pretty sharp at engineering design they say

Duran peered numbly across the desk at the grim faced official This
was what he had been fearing all along But despite his apprehension
he was not entirely ready for it

That I suppose he said quietly was my son Roger

Loeffler nodded slowly That was your boy Vance Sorry I had to be
the one to break it to you

But where is he Duran asked And does Molly know about it

She knows hes been detained but not how serious the charges are

Just how serious are the charges

I dont know yet said Loeffler Thats not really my province of
course said Loeffler But the problem is complicated by the fact
that Lake Wakataoga is state property with the island merely leased
to Skinner

Duran fumbled through his pockets for his cigarettes He found them
and lit one

When did this happen he asked aware that the painfully tangled
knot in his stomach was beginning to untie itself

This afternoon around onethirty A couple of guys fishing on the
lake saw the explosion and called the local civil defense
headquarters They claim they heard the rocket fall Damned near had
a war scare till the pieces were found They were easy enough to
trace and the kids gave themselves away by all eight of them being
awol from their one oclock classes Especially since five of them
were absent from a physics classthat was one class they never cut

I dont see how they managed to go all the way through with it
without someone finding out Duran said bewilderedly

I know agreed Loeffler nodding Thats the way we all felt But
they admit doing ithell theyre proud of itand we found the shed
where the thing was assembled

I dont suppose they offered any motive Duran said

Oh sure They claim theyd been planning it ever since Skinner
wouldnt let them land copters on the island Pretty weak huh

The senator made no response

Well Vance I guess youll want to talk to the boy Loeffler
concluded I had him brought up here Figured it would be best all
around that way I knew you had to get back to Washington tomorrow and
probably wouldnt have time to see him then Shall I have him come
in

When Duran hesitated he added Oh Ive got to duck out for a few
minutes Get some supper Got a long evening ahead of me

Okay Loeffler send him in And This was the hardest part And I
appreciate this

No trouble Vance the man said rising and stepping around the
desk No more than weve got already

He removed a suit coat from a hanger and left the office with it under
his arm A moment later the door opened again and the senator saw the
shaggy head of his older son peer into the room The boy was the one
who finally broke the silence which followed

Hi Dad he said sauntering casually into the office Guess youre
pretty sore at me Cant blame you

Duran remained seated indicating a chair against one wall He waited
till his son had sat down

Im a little dumbfounded Rog thats all I suppose you had a good
reason for it

Sure Old skinflint Skinner wouldnt let us

Roger the senator growled threateningly He was not going to
allow the interview to start off with a halftruth

Yeah but thats state land the boy persisted He hadnt any
right

Roger I said a good reason

Okay Dad he sighed No we didnt have that kind of a reason

What it amounted to Duran said was that you wanted to do
something spectacular like building a rocket and firing it at
something Only to be fun it had to be illegal if not immoral And
Melvin Skinners place seemed like the least objectionable target
Isnt that about it

Yeah I guess so Only we had just about finished the rocket before
we started wondering about a target That was the trouble Once wed
built it we had to do something with it

How do you think thats going to sound in court

I dont know Dad Youre the lawyer

Duran cringed but tried not to show it

Roger he said slowly Flippancy is the easiest defense and the
least effective I hope you wont feel you have to resort to it too
often

The boy said nothing

Well tell me about it his father suggested sensing his sons
isolation

About what

The rocket Wouldnt a jet have been easier to make

A rocket was cheaper

The source of the money required for the project was something Duran
had overlooked However it was he realized one best postponed for
the present The important thing now was to regain his sons
confidence

Did you design it

Yeah Well I drew it up Nothing very original about it But it was
a good little machine

Duran noticed the boys restless squirming saw him perfunctorily
place a hand to the baggy pocket of his jacket and quickly withdraw
it then arrived at a decision Reaching into his own coat Duran took
out the pack of cigarettes extending it to his son

Care for a cigarette he asked

The youth looked at him doubtfully for an instant Then he smiled his
first smile that evening

Thanks Dad he responded taking one and lighting it
selfconsciously He added Youve been out of town so much I didnt
think you knew Id started

I know Rog the man said aware of a rising flood of
selfcondemnation Go on son About the rocket What kind of fuel
did you use

Oh nothing special It had a liquid bipropellant motor We used
ethanol and liquid oxygen Pretty oldfashioned But we didnt know
how to get hold of the fancier stuff and didnt have any way of
synthesizing it Then at the last minute we found that one of the
valves feeding into the nozzle was clogged up Thats why we were late
to class

Couldnt that have been dangerous Duran asked and realized at once
that he had said the wrong thing

The boy merely shrugged

Well it must have been a pretty good machine if it flew sixty miles
and hit its target Duran went on

Oh we had it radiocontrolled with a midget TV transmitter
mounted in it Grasso took care of that He did a terrific job Of
course it was pretty expensive

He glanced at his father tentatively for a moment then bent his gaze
to the cigarette

I dont have my car any more But I guess I wont be needing it now

There was a cautious knock on the door

Listen Rog Duran began Ill try to get to see you tomorrow
before I leave Remember that your mother and I are both on your side
without qualification Youve done a pretty terrible thing of course
But I have to admit at the same time that Im really rather proud of
you Does that make sense

Sure said Roger huskily I guess so

                                   

The flight home was a quiet one Duran found himself with many
thoughts to think not the least of which was what his wifes reaction
would be The difficulty lay in the fact that their married life had
been too easy too free of tragedy to enable him to foresee her
response But life would not be quite the same now even if Roger
escaped the more concrete forms of punishment And perhaps it would be
the most difficult for Ernest who would forever be expected either to
live up to or down to his older brothers reputation When all poor
Ernest seemed to want these days was to play the saxophone

And then there was his own political future to consider This would
certainly not help it But perhaps the affair would be forgotten in
the next three years After all it might have been far worse It
might have happened in a campaign year This way he still had a
fighting chance Three sessions with a good record might overbalance
the loss in public confidence this would incur And then he thought of
the Mars colony mess and winced

Telling his wife about the matter was not nearly so difficult as the
senator had feared She had been ready for news of a crime of passion
or at least of armed robbery What her husband had to relate stunned
her at first But once she had ridden out the shock she recovered
quickly

You dont have to go tonight Molly Duran told her

You think it might look better if I didnt she asked gently

That wasnt what I was getting at he said He thought it over for a
moment then added No I dont In fact I think it would look
better if we both went to the Governors Roger is not a juvenile
delinquent That I believe is understood If we must accept some of
the responsibility for what he did today then lets do so gracefully
Were you to stay home tonight it might appear to some that you had
reason to be ashamed of the business which you dont

It might also look as if I were afraid that Ernest might do
something similar as if I felt I had to watch him she said Oh
people can be so ridiculous Why wasnt Millie Gortons boy in on it

Duran smiled at the idea of the Governors tubby obtuse son involved
in the construction of anything more demanding than a paper glider

                                   

The Governors mansion a century old edifice typifying the moribund
tendency to confuse dignity with discomfort was teeming with
professional and political personages when the Durans arrived The
dinner went off routinely with no overt references made to the
missile matter However the senator noticed that no one inquired into
the health and happiness of his two sons so that he presumed word had
got around

It was not until after dinner when he had seated himself alone in a
corner of the luxurious old living room a B and B in one hand and a
cigar in the other that his host approached him

Evenin Vance Sure glad you could make it exclaimed the
familiarly jovial voice of Governor Will Gorton

Duran sat down his drink and took the Governors plump hand shaking
it vigorously Then the senator observed the intense youngish face of
Fritz Ambly who had followed the Governor

Guess you know Fritz Gorton went on seating himself next to Duran
Says he met you at Sigs office this afternoon

Thats right Duran said Good to see you again Ambly

The Youth Welfare board chairman nodded affably and took the remaining
chair His look of concern had mellowed somewhat with the evening But
the pale close eyes remained set in an expression of aggressive
earnestness

Hows Roger Gorton asked after a moments silence

As normal as ever said Duran unprepared for the question Then
slyly he added Thanks for talking Loeffler into letting me see
him

Well Sig agreed it was the only thing to do after I told him youd
be leaving for Washington again tomorrow the Governor said

Duran grinned wryly It had been a guess but a good one And
Loefflers having passed the interview off as a personal favor put
their relationship back in its proper perspective

Well whats to be done about the boys Theyre all under eighteen I
suppose

Thats right Gorton said Its entirely a matter for the juvenile
authority At least were going to try to keep it there But theres
more to it than that Which is why Fritz is here He has something on
his mind which he thinks is pretty important I do too

You see Senator said Ambly coming in promptly on his cue its
this way If the case were an isolated one it would be easy enough
for us to deal with But its part of a pattern which few people have
yet noticed Let me cite several other similar incidents

Perhaps you read about the group of fifty teenaged copter jockeys
who decided to hold a transcontinental scavenger hunt Ignoring all
airtraffic regulations they managed to run up the magnificent total
of seventeen collisions and thirtytwo casualties

Hear about that one Vance the Governor asked his earlier
festiveness gone

Yes I think I saw something about it Duran said It was pretty
unfortunate but

And then there was the case of the promising young New England
biologist who was discovered to have evolved a particularly deadly
strain of bacteria which he had been toting around with him in an
aspirin bottle Ambly went on his thin hands clasped tightly in
front of him Of course at the age of sixteen one perhaps cant be
expected to foresee all of the possible consequences

So let us consider the two seventeenyearolds who caused something
of a sensation in Florida when they used the BranskiBaker method of
genetic exchange to breed a quite fabulous species of winged
alligator Several of these so called allibats escaped into the
everglades but it is doubted that they will be able to reproduce
themselves At least there is some doubt

The senator reached for his drink and sipped it thoughtfully He was
beginning to see Rogers gangs misadventure in a new light But it
was an unfamiliar light one that would take him a while to become
accustomed to

Perhaps the most startling case of all Ambly went on concerns the
Nuclear Fission Society of Urania Nevada It is not a well publicized
fact that this quasiacademic group of adolescent physicists was
exposed in the act of assembling an elementary but workable atomic
bomb Many of the elders in this fastgrowing little community are
engaged as you no doubt know in atomic development of one sort or
another It seemed that this interest had trickled down to their
offspring who showed an impressive amount of ingenuity in getting the
necessary materials Fortunately one youngster asked his father
entirely too many questions concerning the actual fabrication of
fission weapons The man investigated and

Now wait a minute Duran interrupted wondering momentarily if the
whole tale might not have been a hoax How much of this am I really
expected to believe

Its all fact Vance Governor Gorton responded solemnly Fritz has
a couple of scrapbooks Id like you to look at some time Each case is
pretty well authenticated But the important thing is the pattern
Its really sort of frightening in a way

Many similar incidents have no doubt occurred of which I have no
record said Ambly Id estimate that ninety percent of such cases
are suppressed either in the interest of national security or because
the childrens parents are sufficiently influential to have the story
squelched

Just as wed have sat on this one added Gorton if the dang thing
hadnt actually been shot off

Duran smiled inwardly at the picture evoked by the Governors
metaphor However he had to admit that the press would in all
probability not have learned about the rocket at all had it been
discovered prior to being launched

Still he remarked its odd that the papers havent shown more of
an interest in it

I wrote an article on the subject some time ago Ambly told him
but was never able to get it published It seems that people for the
most part are more interested in the traditional sordidsensational
type of juvenile delinquency

Whereas this is something different something unique It isnt the
result of poverty or broken homes ignorance or twisted
personalitiesthis is a mixture of genius knowledge restlessness
and something else I dont think we understand

What do you suggest be done about it Duran asked

Well the first step said Ambly is to get Congress to recognize
the problem for what it is And even that wont be easy

Thats where youre supposed to come in the Governor said grinning
a little guiltily Fritz has been tryin to get me to talk to you
about it for some months Ive got to admit though that the business
this afternoon involvin your son was what finally convinced me you
might be sold

Im sold Will Duran told him But whats the solution We cant
supervise the activities of every kid in the country with an IQ above
a hundred and ten Anyway theyre too limited as it is That it
seems to me is part of the trouble And we cant hold their parents
accountable Responsibility has to be an individual matter So whats
the solution

Governor Gorton raised a quizzical eyebrow at Fritz Ambly who in turn
merely shrugged The senator glanced at each of them then down at his
drink

So there isnt one he said

Whatever it is said Ambly it wont be simple or painless Theres
only one such solution and thats the timehonored technique of
letting them grow into maturity And even that is far from painless
and simple to those doing the growing nor is it always the solution

Yet youre convinced this the senator paused briefly phenomenon
constitutes a danger to the nation

Ambly merely smiled But very very grimly

Well think it over Vance the Governor said getting to his feet
Say there are a couple of hydroponics men here somewhere who are
pretty interested in meetin you Youve heard of Van Neef Industries
Hes one of em

So much for the welfare of the nation Duran thought with a taste of
bitterness Now back to politics

But he finished off his drink and put out his cigar and rose to
follow the Governor Politics after all was the reason he had come

                                   

It was two am before Senator Vance Duran wearily dropped into bed
But he found no rest in sleep that night For in his dreams he seemed
to see a youngster walking now through a forest now through a city
now through an autumn countryside And in the boys hand was a tightly
capped bottle And the expression on his face was an enigma

Early the next morning Jack Woodvale parked the helicopter in a lot
back of the city youth detention home Five minutes later the senator
was again talking to his older son

I have to get back to Washington this morning Roger he said Ive
scheduled a committee meeting for tenthirty I suppose I could call
it off but weve got to do something about the Mars colony project
before public apathy forces us to drop the whole thing You
understand dont you

Sure the boy said with apparent indifference Maybe you should
have let me volunteer Youd have solved two problems at the same
time

Now Roger Duran began But he stopped suddenly alert

Son you werent ever serious about that were you I mean all that
talk I used to hear about your wanting to go to one of the planets

Ah I dont know Dad

Please Roger youve got to be honest with me I want to know
exactly how you feel about it I know youve tried before and I
refused to take you seriously I realize that But nownow tell me
the truth

And the curious thing was he realized that he wanted to hear from
his son what he feared most to hear

Wellsure I wanted to go his son said I kept telling you
didnt I Of course I wouldnt want to go unless some of the gang
were going too

You really think that youd be willing to leave Earth your home
your family

Duran hesitated angrily knowing it was the wrong approach He waited
a moment then began again

Im not condemning you for it Roger I just find it hard to believe
And I have to be sure you know what youd be sacrificing

I think I do Dad Roger said But youve got to make a break
sometime I guess thered be some girls going along wouldnt there

Duran grinned numbly

I guess there would son he said

                                   

The Senator watched the land of his home state sink rapidly into the
morning haze as the jetliner soared upward It was a sight he had seen
often but never with the sense of challenge he experienced now For
every moment brought him closer to what beyond all doubt would be the
toughest fight of his political career But he felt that he had logic
on his side though sentiment would very probably be against him

He sat back lit a cigarette and considered the irony of the
situation When legislation had been passed authorizing the Department
of Extraterrestrial Development to start the colony project a list of
criteria had been drawn up for the wouldbe settler It had
meticulously specified the requirements of health intelligence and
adaptability And most rigidly adhered to of all had been the
provision that the applicant be over the age of twentyfive For
above all it was assumed a colonist must be mature

And in that assumption Duran concluded had been hidden the fallacy
which had made a fiasco of the project For was not maturity largely a
matter of finding an acceptable place for oneself in the scheme of
things Was not maturity essentially a realistic but wholly
irrevocable resignation If so it had been inevitable that those who
came to volunteer would for the most part be the misfits and the
malcontents men who hoped to escape the imagined or to find the
imaginary

The mature the resigned had assuredly inherited the earth Only the
young could seek the stars
