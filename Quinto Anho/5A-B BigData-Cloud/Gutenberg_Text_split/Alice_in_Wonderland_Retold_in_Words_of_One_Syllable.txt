CHAPTER I

DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE


Alice had sat on the bank by her sister till she was tired Once or
twice she had looked at the book her sister held in her hand but there
were no pictures in it and what is the use of a book thought Alice
without pictures She asked herself as well as she could for the
hot day made her feel quite dull if it would be worth while to get up
and pick some daisies to make a chain Just then a white rabbit with
pink eyes ran close by her

Illustration

That was not such a strange thing nor did Alice think it so much out of
the way to hear the Rabbit say Oh dear Oh dear I shall be late
But when the Rabbit took a watch out of its pocket and looked at it
and then ran on Alice started to her feet for she knew that was the
first time she had seen a Rabbit with a watch She jumped up and ran to
get a look at it and was just in time to see it pop down a large
rabbit hole near the hedge

As fast as she could go Alice went down the hole after it and did
not once stop to think how in the world she was to get out

The hole went straight on for some way and then turned down with a sharp
bend so sharp that Alice had no time to think to stop till she found
herself falling in what seemed a deep well

She must not have moved fast or the well must have been quite deep for
it took her a long time to go down and as she went she had time to look
at the strange things she passed First she tried to look down and make
out what was there but it was too dark to see then she looked at the
sides of the well and saw that they were piled with bookshelves here
and there she saw maps hung on pegs She took down a jar from one of the
shelves as she passed On it was the word Jam but there was no jam in
it so she put it back on one of the shelves as she fell past it

Well thought Alice to herself after such a fall as this I shall
not mind a fall down stairs at all How brave theyll all think me at
home Why I wouldnt say a thing if I fell off the top of the house
Which I dare say was quite true

Down down down Would the fall never come to an end I should like
to know she said how far I have come by this time Wouldnt it be
strange if I should fall right through the earth and come out where the
folks walk with their feet up and their heads down

Down down down Dinah will miss me tonight Alice went on
Dinah was the cat I hope theyll think to give her her milk at
teatime Dinah my dear I wish you were down here with me There are
no mice in the air but you might catch a bat and thats much like a
mouse you know But do cats eat bats And here Alice must have gone
to sleep for she dreamed that she walked hand in hand with Dinah and
just as she asked her Now Dinah tell me the truth do you eat
bats all at once thump thump down she came on a heap of sticks and
dry leaves and the long fall was over

Alice was not a bit hurt but at once jumped to her feet She looked
up but all was dark there At the end of a long hall in front of her
the white rabbit was still in sight There was no time to be lost so
off Alice went like the wind and was just in time to hear it say Oh
my ears how late it is then it was out of sight She found she was in
a long hall with a low roof from which hung a row of lighted lamps

There were doors on all sides but when Alice had been all round and
tried each one she found they were all locked She walked back and
forth and tried to think how she was to get out At last she came to a
stand made all of glass On it was a tiny key of gold and Alices
first thought was that this might be a key to one of the doors of the
hall but when she had tried the key in each lock she found the locks
were too large or the key was too smallit did not fit one of them But
when she went round the hall once more she came to a low curtain which
she had not seen at first and when she drew this back she found a small
door not much more than a foot high she tried the key in the lock and
to her great joy it fitted

Illustration

Alice found that the door led to a hall the size of a rat hole she
knelt down and looked through it into a garden of gay flowers How
she longed to get out of that dark hall and near those bright blooms
but she could not so much as get her head through the door and if my
head would go through thought Alice it would be of no use for the
rest of me would still be too large to go through Oh how I wish I
could shut up small I think I could if I knew how to start

There seemed to be no use to wait by the small door so she went back to
the stand with the hope that she might find a key to one of the large
doors or maybe a book of rules that would teach her to grow small
This time she found a small bottle on it which I am sure was not here
just now said Alice and tied round the neck of the bottle was a
tag with the words Drink me printed on it

It was all right to say Drink me but Alice was too wise to do that
in haste No Ill look first she said and see if its marked
poison or not for she had been taught if you drink much from a
bottle marked poison it is sure to make you sick This had no such
mark on it so she dared to taste it and as she found it nice it had
in fact a taste of pie icecream roast fowl and hot toast she soon
drank it off

How strange I feel said Alice I am sure I am not so large as I
was

And so it was she was now not quite a foot high and her face lighted
up at the thought that she was now the right size to go through the
small door and get out to that lovely garden

Illustration

Poor Alice When she reached the door she found that she had left the
key on the stand and when she went back for it she found she could by
no means reach it She could see it through the glass and she tried her
best to climb one of the legs of the stand but it was too sleek and
when she was quite tired out she sat down and cried

Come theres no use to cry like that Alice said to herself as
stern as she could speak I tell you to leave off at once

Soon her eyes fell on a small glass box that lay on the floor She
looked in it and found a tiny cake on which were the words Eat me
marked in grapes Well Ill eat it said Alice and if it makes me
grow tall I can reach the key and if it makes me shrink up I can
creep under the door so Ill get out some way

So she set to work and soon ate all the cake




CHAPTER II

THE POOL OF TEARS


How strange Oh my said Alice how tall I am and all at once too
Goodby feet For when she looked down at her feet they seemed so far
off she thought they would soon be out of sight Oh my poor feet
who will put on your shoes for you now dears Im sure I shant do it
I shall be a great deal too far off to take care of you you must get on
the best way you can but I must be kind to them thought Alice or
they wont walk the way I want to go Let me see Ill give them a pair
of new shoes each Christmas

She stopped to think how she would send them They must go by the
mail she thought and how funny itll seem to send shoes to ones
own feet How odd the address will look

    ALICES RIGHT FOOT ESQ
      Hearthrug
        Near the Fire
    With Alices love

Illustration

Oh dear theres no sense in all that

Just then her head struck the roof of the hall in fact she was now more
than nine feet high and she at once took up the small key and went back
to the door

Poor Alice It was as much as she could do when she lay down on one
side to look through to the garden with one eye but to get through
was not to be hoped for so she sat down and had a good cry

Shame on you said Alice a great big girl like you she might well
say this to cry in this way Stop at once I tell you But she went
on all the same and shed tears till there was a large pool all round
her and which reached half way down the hall

Illustration

At last she heard the sound of feet not far off then she dried her eyes
in great haste to see who it was It was the White Rabbit that had come
back dressed in fine clothes with a pair of white kid gloves in one
hand and a large fan in the other He trotted on in great haste and
talked to himself as he came Oh the Duchess the Duchess Oh
wont she be in a fine rage if Ive made her wait

Alice felt so bad and so in need of help from some one that when the
Rabbit came near she said in a low timid voice If you please
sir The Rabbit started as if shot dropped the white kid gloves and
the fan and ran off into the dark as fast as his two hind feet could
take him

Alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was quite hot she
fanned herself all the time she went on talking Dear dear How
queer all things are today Could I have been changed in the night Let
me think was I the same when I got up today Seems to me I didnt feel
quite the same But if Im not the same then who in the world am I
Then she thought of all the girls she knew that were of her age to see
if she could have been changed for one of them

Im sure Im not Ada she said for her hair is in such long curls
and mine doesnt curl at all and Im sure I cant be Mabel for I know
all sorts of things and she oh she knows such a little Then shes
she and Im I andoh dear how strange it all is Ill try if I know
all the things I used to know Let me see four times five is twelve
and four times six is thirteen and four times seven isoh dear that
is not right I must have been changed for Mabel Ill try if I know
How doth the little and she placed her hands on her lap as if
she were at school and tried to say it but her voice was hoarse and
strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do

Im sure those are not the right words said poor Alice and her eyes
filled with tears as she went on I must be Mabel after all and I
shall have to go and live in that poky house and have next to no toys
to play with and oh such hard things to learn No Ive made up my
mind if Im Mabel Ill stay down here Itll be no use for them to
put their heads down and say Come up dear I shall look up and say
Who am I then Tell me that first and then if I like it Ill come
up if not Ill stay down here till Im some one elsebut oh dear
cried Alice with a fresh burst of tears I do wish they would put their
heads down I am so tired of this place

As she said this she looked down at her hands and saw that she had put
on one of the Rabbits white kid gloves while she was talking How
can I have done that she thought I must have grown small once more
She got up and went to the glass stand to test her height by that and
found that as well as she could guess she was now not more than two feet
high and still shrinking quite fast She soon found out that the cause
of this was the fan she held and she dropped it at once or she might
have shrunk to the size of a gnat

Alice was at first in a sad fright at the quick change but glad that
it was no worse Now for the garden and she ran with all her speed
back to the small door but oh dear the door was shut and the key lay
on the glass stand and things are worse than ever thought the poor
child for I never was so small as this never Its too bad that it
is

As she said these words her foot slipped and splash she was up to her
chin in salt water At first she thought she must be in the sea but
she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept
when she was nine feet high

Illustration

I wish I hadnt cried so much said Alice as she swam round and tried
to find her way out I shall now be drowned in my own tears That will
be a queer thing to be sure But all things are queer today

Just then she heard a splash in the pool a little way off and she swam
near to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a whale
but when she thought how small she was now she soon made out that it
was a mouse that had slipped in the pond

Would it be of any use now to speak to this mouse All things are so
outofway down here I should think maybe it can talk at least
theres no harm to try So she said O Mouse do you know the way out
of this pool I have swum here till Im quite tired O Mouse The Mouse
looked at her and seemed to her to wink with one of its small eyes but
it did not speak

It may be a French Mouse thought Alice so she said O est ma
chatte Where is my cat which was all the French she could think of
just then The Mouse gave a quick leap out of the water and seemed in
a great fright Oh I beg your pardon cried Alice I quite forgot
you didnt like cats

Not like cats cried the Mouse in a shrill harsh voice Would you
like cats if you were me

Well I guess not said Alice but please dont get mad And yet I
wish I could show you our cat Dinah Im sure youd like cats if you
could see her She is such a dear thing Alice went on half to
herself as she swam round in the pool and she sits and purrs by the
fire and licks her paws and washes her faceand she is such a nice
soft thing to nurseand shes a fine one to catch miceOh dear
cried Alice for this time the Mouse was in a great fright and each
hair stood on end We wont talk of her if you dont like it

We talk cried the Mouse who shook down to the end of his tail As
if I would talk of such low mean things as cats All rats hate them
Dont let me hear the name again

I wont said Alice in great haste to change the theme Are you
fondofof dogs The mouse did not speak so Alice went on There
is such a nice dog near our house I should like to show you A tiny
brighteyed dog you know with oh such long curly brown hair And
itll fetch things when you throw them and itll sit up and beg for its
meat and do all sorts of thingsI cant tell you half of them And it
kills all the rats and moh dear cried Alice in a sad tone Ive
made it mad again For the Mouse swam off from her as fast as it could
go and made quite a stir in the pool as it went

So she called it in a soft kind voice Mouse dear Do come back and we
wont talk of cats or dogs if you dont like them When the Mouse heard
this it turned round and swam back to her its face was quite pale with
rage Alice thought and it said in a low weak voice Let us get to
the shore and then Ill tell you why it is I hate cats and dogs

It was high time to go for the pool was by this time quite crowded with
the birds and beasts that had slipped into it Alice led the way and
they all swam to the shore




CHAPTER III

A RACE


They were a queer looking crowd as they stood or sat on the bankthe
wings and tails of the birds drooped to the earth the fur of the beasts
clung close to them and all were as wet and cross as could be

Illustration

The first thought of course was how to get dry They had a long talk
about this and Alice joined with them as if she had known them all
her life But it was hard to tell what was best

What I want to say at last spoke up the Dodo is that the best
thing to get us dry would be a race

What kind of race asked Alice not that she much wanted to know
but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that some one ought to speak
and no one else would say a word Why said the Dodo the best way
to make it plain is to do it And as you might like to try the thing
some cold day Ill tell you how the Dodo did it

First it marked out a racecourse in a sort of ring it didnt care much
for the shape and then all the crowd were placed on the course here
and there There was no One two three and here we go but they ran
when they liked and left off when they liked so that no one could tell
when the race was ended When they had been running half an hour or so
and were all quite dry the Dodo called out The race is over and
they all crowded round it and and asked But who has won

This the Dodo could not at first tell but sat for a long time with
one claw pressed to its head while the rest waited but did not speak
At last the Dodo said All have won and each must have a prize

But who is to give them all asked at once

Why she of course said the Dodo as it pointed to Alice with one
long claw and the whole party at once crowded round her as they
called out A prize a prize

Alice did not know what to do but she pulled from her pocket a box of
little cakes by a strange good luck they did not get wet while she
was in the pool and handed them round as prizes There was one
apiece all round

But she must have a prize you know said the Mouse

Of course the Dodo said What else have you got he went on as he
turned to Alice

A thimble said Alice looking quite sad

Hand it here said the Dodo

Then they all crowded round her once more while the Dodo handed the
thimble back to Alice and said We beg that you accept this fine
thimble and when it had made this short speech they all cheered

Alice thought the whole thing quite foolish but they all looked so
grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think what to
say she bowed and took the thimble while she looked as staid as she
could

Illustration

The next thing was to eat the cakes this caused some noise as the
large birds said they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked
and had to be patted on the back It was over at last and they sat
down in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them a tale

You said you would tell us why you hate cats and dogs said Alice

Mine is a long and a sad tale said the Mouse as it turned to Alice
with a sigh

It is a long tail Im sure said Alice looking down at the Mouses
tail but why do you call it sad

I shall not tell you said the Mouse as it got up and walked off

Please come back and tell us your tale called Alice and all joined
in Yes please do but the Mouse shook its head and walked on and was
soon out of sight

I wish I had our Dinah here I know I do said Alice Shed soon
fetch it back

And who is Dinah if I may dare to ask such a thing said one of the
birds

Alice was glad to talk of her pet Dinahs our cat and shes such a
fine one to catch mice you cant think And oh I wish you could see
her chase a bird Why shell eat a bird as soon as look at it

This speech caused a great stir in the party Some of the birds rushed
off at once one old jay wrapped itself up with care and said I must
get home the night air doesnt suit my throat and a wren called out
to her brood come my dears Its high time you were all in bed

Soon they all moved off and Alice was left alone

I wish I hadnt told them of Dinah she said to herself No one
seems to like her down here and Im sure shes the best cat in the
world Oh my dear Dinah Shall I ever see you any more And here
poor Alice burst into tears for she felt very sad and lonely In a
short time she heard the patter of feet and she looked up with the
hope that the Mouse had changed its mind and come back to tell his long
and sad tale




CHAPTER IV

THE RABBIT SENDS IN A BILL


It was the White Rabbit who trotted back again It looked from side
to side as it went as if it had lost something and Alice heard it say
to itself The Duchess The Duchess Oh my dear paws Shell get my
head cut off as sure as rats are rats Where can I have lost them
Alice guessed at once that he was in search of the fan and the pair of
white kid gloves and like the good girl that she was she set out to
hunt for them but they were not to be found All things seemed to have
changed since her swim in the pool the great hall with the glass stand
and the little doorall were gone Soon the Rabbit saw Alice and
called out to her Why Ann what are you out here for Run home at
once and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan Quick now And Alice
was in such a fright that she ran off and did not wait to tell it who
she was

He took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran What
will he think when he finds out who I am But I must take him his fan
and glovesthat is if I can find them

As she said this she came to a small neat house on the door of which was
a bright brass plate with the name W Rabbit on it She ran upstairs
in great fear lest she should meet Ann and be turned out of the house
before she had found the fan and gloves

How queer it seems that I should do things for a Rabbit I guess
Dinahll send me to wait on her next

Illustration

By this time she had made her way to a tidy room with a table near the
wall and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs of small
white kid gloves She took up the fan and a pair of gloves and turned
to leave the room when her eye fell upon a small bottle that stood
near There was no tag this time with the words Drink me but Alice
put it to her lips I know I am sure to change in some way if I eat or
drink anything so Ill just see what this does I do hope itll make
me grow large again for Im quite tired of this size Alice said to
herself

It did as she had wished for in a short time her head pressed the roof
so hard she couldnt stand up straight She put the bottle down in
haste and said Thats as much as I needI hope I shant grow any
moreas it is I cant get out at the doorI do wish I hadnt drunk so
much

But it was too late to wish that She grew and grew till she had to
kneel down on the floor next there was not room for this and she had to
lie down Still she grew and grew and grew till she had to put one arm
out the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself Now I
can do no more let come what may There seemed no sort of chance that
she could ever get out of the room

I wish I was at home thought poor Alice where I wouldnt change so
much and where I didnt have to do things for mice and rabbits I wish
I hadnt gone down that rabbit holeand yetand yetits queer you
know this sort of life When I used to read fairy tales I thought
they were just made up by some one and now here I am in one myself
When I grow up Ill write a book about these strange thingsbut Im
grown up now she added in a sad tone at least theres no room to
grow any more here

She heard a voice outside and stopped to listen

Ann Ann said the voice fetch me my gloves quick Then came the
sound of feet on the stairs Alice knew it was the Rabbit and that it
had come to look for her She quaked with fear till she shook the house
Poor thing She didnt think that she was now more than ten times as
large as the Rabbit and that she had no cause to be afraid of it

Soon the Rabbit came to the door and tried to come in but Alices arm
pressed it so hard the door would not move Alice heard it say Then
Ill go round and get in at the window

Illustration

That you wont thought Alice then she waited till she heard the
Rabbit quite near the window then spread out her hand and made a
snatch in the air She did not get hold of it but she heard a shriek
and a fall

Next came an angry voicethe RabbitsPat Pat Where are you And
then a voice which was new to her Sure then Im here Digging for
apples yer honor

Digging for apples indeed said the Rabbit Here Come and help
me out of this Now tell me Pat whats that in the window

Sure its an arm yer honor

An arm you goose Whoever saw one that size Why it fills the whole
window

Sure it does yer honor but its an arm for all that

Well it has no right there go and take it out

For a long time they seemed to stand still but now and then Alice
could hear a few words in a low voice such as Sure I dont like it
yer honor at all at all

Do as I tell you you coward and at last she spread out her hand and
made a snatch in the air This time there were two little shrieks

I should like to know what theyll do next As to their threats to pull
me out I only wish they could Im sure I dont want to stay in here

She waited for some time but all was still at last came the noise of
small cart wheels and the sound of voices from which she made out the
words Wheres the other ladder Why I hadnt to bring but one
Bills got the other Bill fetch it here lad Here put em up at
this place No tie em firstthey dont reach half as high as they
should yetoh theyll do Here Bill catch hold of this ropeWill
the roof bear Mind that loose slateoh here it comes Look out A
loud crashNow who did that It was Bill I guessWhos to go down
the chimney Nay I shant You do itThat I wont thenBills got
to go downHere Bill youve got to go down the chimney

Oh so Bills got to come down has he said Alice to herself Why
they seem to put all the work on Bill I wouldnt be in Bills place for
a good deal this fireplace is small to be sure but I think I can
kick some

She drew her foot as far down as she could and waited till she heard a
small beast she couldnt guess of what sort it was come scratch
scratch down the chimney quite close to her then she said to
herself This is Bill gave one sharp kick and waited to see what
would happen next

Illustration

The first thing she heard was There goes Bill then the Rabbits
voice Catch him you by the hedge Then all was still then the
voicesHold up his headWine nowDont choke himHow was it old
fellow What sent you up so fast Tell us all about it

Last came a weak voice Thats Bill thought Alice Well I dont
knowno more thankye Im not so weak nowbut Im a deal too shocked
to tell youall I know is a thing comes at me like a Jackinthebox
and up I goes like a rocket

So you did old fellow said the others

We must burn the house down said the Rabbits voice and Alice
called out as loud as she could If you do Ill set Dinah at you

At once all was still as death and Alice thought What will they do
next If they had any sense theyd take the roof off

Then she heard the Rabbit say One load will do to start with

A load of what thought Alice but she had not long to doubt for
soon a shower of small stones came in at the window and some of them
hit her in the face Ill put a stop to this she said to herself
and shouted out You stop that at once Again all was still as
death

Alice saw that the stones all changed to small cakes as they lay on the
floor and a bright thought came to her If I eat one of these cakes
she said it is sure to make some change in my size and as it cant
make me larger I hope it will change me to the size I used to be

So she ate one of the cakes and was glad to see that she shrank quite
fast She was soon so small that she could get through the door so she
ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of beasts and birds in the
yard The poor lizard Bill was in the midst of the group held up by
two guinea pigs who gave it something to drink out of a bottle They
all made a rush at Alice as soon as she came out but she ran off as
hard as she could and was soon safe in a thick wood

The first thing Ive got to do said Alice to herself as she walked
round in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the next
thing is to find my way to that lovely garden I think that will be
the best plan

It was a fine scheme no doubt and well planned but the hard thing was
that she did not in the least know how she should start to work it out
and while she peered round through the trees a sharp bark just over
her head made her look up in great haste

Illustration

A great puppy looked down at her with large round eyes stretched out
one paw and tried to touch her Poor thing said Alice in a kind tone
and tried hard to show it that she wished to be its friend but she was
in a sore fright lest it should eat her up

Alice could not think what to do next so she picked up a bit of stick
and held it out to the puppy It jumped from the tree with a yelp of
joy as if to play with it then Alice dodged round a large plant that
stood near but the puppy soon found her and made a rush at the stick
again but tumbled head over heels in its haste to get hold of it
Alice felt that it was quite like a game with a cart horse and looked
at each turn to be crushed neath its great feet At last to her joy
it seemed to grow tired of the sport and ran a good way off and sat down
with its tongue out of its mouth and its big eyes half shut

This seemed to Alice a good time to get out of its sight so she set
out at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till
the puppys bark sounded quite faint

Illustration

And yet what a dear puppy it was said Alice as she stopped to rest
and fanned herself with a leaf I should have liked so much to teach
it tricks ifif Id been the right size to do it Oh dear Ive got to
grow up again Let me seehow am I to do it I guess I ought to eat or
drink something but I dont know what

Alice looked all round her at the blades of grass the blooms the
leaves but could not see a thing that looked like the right thing to
eat or drink to make her grow

There was a large mushroom near her about the same height as she was
and when she had looked all round it she thought she might as well look
and see what was on the top of it She stretched up as tall as she
could and her eyes met those of a large blue caterpillar that sat on
the top with its arms folded smoking a queer pipe with a long stem
that bent and curved round it like a hoop




CHAPTER V

A CATERPILLAR TELLS ALICE WHAT TO DO


The Caterpillar looked at Alice and she stared at it but did not
speak At last it took the pipe from its mouth and said Who are you
Alice said Im not sure sir who I am just nowI know who I was
when I left home but I think I have been changed two or three times
since then

What do you mean by that asked the Caterpillar

I fear I cant tell you for Im sure I dont know myself but to
change so many times all in one day makes ones head swim

It doesnt said the Caterpillar

Well maybe you havent found it so yet said Alice but when you
have to changeyou will some day you knowI should think youd feel
it queer wont you

Not a bit said the Caterpillar

Well you may not feel as I do said Alice all I know is it feels
queer to me to change so much

You said the Caterpillar with its nose in the air Who are you

Which brought them back to the point from which they started Alice
was not pleased at this so she said in as stern a voice as she could
I think you ought to tell me who you are first

Why said the Caterpillar

As Alice could not think what to say to this and as it did not seem to
want to talk she turned away

Come back said the Caterpillar I have something to say to you

Alice turned and came back

Keep your temper said the Caterpillar

Is that all asked Alice while she hid her anger as well as she
could

No said the Caterpillar

Alice waited what seemed to her a long time while it sat and smoked
but did not speak At last it took the pipe from its mouth and said
So you think youre changed do you

I fear I am sir said Alice I dont know things as I once didand
I dont keep the same size but a short while at a time

What things is it you dont know

Well Ive tried to say the things I knew at school but the words all
came wrong

Let me hear you say You are old Father William said the
Caterpillar

Alice folded her hands and began

Illustration

    You are old Father William the young man said
      And your hair has become very white
    And yet you stand all the time on your head
      Do you think at your age it is right

    In my youth Father William then said to his son
      I feared it might injure the brain
    But now that I know full well I have none
      Why I do it again and again

    You are old said the youth shall I tell you once more
      And are now quite as large as a tun
    Yet you turned a back somerset in at the door
      Pray tell me now how was that done

    Illustration

    In my youth said the sage as he shook his gray locks
      I kept all my limbs very supple
    By the use of this ointmentone shilling the box
      Allow me to sell you a couple

    You are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak
      For any thing tougher than suet
    Yet you ate up the goose with the bones and the beak
      Pray how did you manage to do it

    Illustration

    In my youth said his father I took to the law
      And argued each case with my wife
    And the very great strength which it gave to my jaw
      Has lasted the rest of my life

    You are old said the youth one would hardly suppose
      That your eye was as steady as ever
    Yet you balance an eel on the end of your nose
      What makes you always so clever

    Illustration

    I have replied to three questions and that is enough
      Said the father dont give yourself airs
    Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff
      Be off or Ill kick you downstairs

That is not said right said the Caterpillar

Not quite right I fear said Alice some of the words are
changed

It is wrong from first to last said the Caterpillar then did not
speak for some time At last it said What size do you want to be

Oh I dont care so much as to size but one doesnt like to change so
much you know

I dont know it said

Alice was too much vexed to speak for she had never in all her life
been talked to in that rude way

Do you like your size now asked the Caterpillar

Well Im not quite so large as I would like to be said Alice
three inches is such a wretched height to be

It is a good height indeed said the Caterpillar and reared
itself up straight as it spoke It was just three inches high

But Im not used to it pleaded poor Alice And she thought I wish
the things wouldnt be so easy to get mad

Youll get used to it in time the Caterpillar said and put the
pipe to its mouth and Alice waited till it should choose to speak At
last it took the pipe from its mouth yawned once or twice then got
down from its perch and crawled off in the grass As it went it said
One side will make you tall and one side will make you small

One side of what thought Alice to herself

Of the mushroom said the Caterpillar just as if it had heard her
speak soon it was out of sight

Alice stood and looked at the mushroom a long time and tried to make
out which were the two sides of it as it was round she found this a
hard thing to do At last she stretched her arms round it as far as they
would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand

And now which is which she said to herself and ate a small piece of
the righthand bit to try what it would do The next moment she felt
her chin strike her foot with a hard blow

She was in a sore fright at this quick change but she felt that there
was no time to be lost as she was shrinking so fast so she set to work
at once to eat some from the left hand bit

                                   

Come my heads free at last said Alice with great joy which
changed to fear when she found that her waist and hands were nowhere to
be seen All she could see when she looked down was a vast length of
neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves
that lay far below her

What can all that green stuff be said Alice And where has my waist
got to And oh my poor hands how is it I cant see you She moved
them as she spoke the green leaves shook as if to let her know her
hands were there but she could not see them

As there seemed to be no chance to get her hands up to her head she
tried to get her head down to them and was pleased to find that her neck
would bend about like a snake Just as she had curved it down and meant
to dive in the sea of green which she found was the tops of the trees
neath which she had been walking a sharp hiss made her draw back in
haste A large bird had flown into her face and struck her with its
wings

Snake snake screamed the bird

Im not a snake said Alice Let me alone

Snake I say Snake cried the bird then added with a kind of sob
Ive tried all ways but I cannot suit them

I dont know what you mean said Alice

The bird seemed not to hear her but went on Ive tried the roots of
trees and Ive tried banks and Ive tried a hedge but those snakes
Theres no way to please them As if it were not hard work to hatch the
eggs but I must watch for snakes night and day Why I havent had a
wink of sleep these three weeks

Its too bad for you to be so much put out said Alice who began to
see what it meant

And just as I had built my nest in this high tree the bird went on
raising its voice to a shriek and just as I thought I should be free
of them at last they must needs fall down from the sky Ugh Snake

But Im not a snake I tell you said Alice Im aIm a

Well What are you said the bird I can see you will not tell me the
truth

IIm a little girl said Alice though she was not sure what she
was when she thought of all the changes she had gone through that day

Ive seen girls in my time but none with such a neck as that said
the bird No no Youre a snake and theres no use to say youre not
I guess youll say next that you dont eat eggs

Of course I eat eggs said Alice but girls eat eggs quite as much
as snakes do you know

I dont know said the bird but if they do why then theyre a kind
of snake thats all I can say

This was such a new thing to Alice that at first she did not speak
which gave the bird a chance to add You want eggs now I know that
quite well

But I dont want eggs and if I did I shouldnt want yours I dont
like them raw

Well be off then said the bird as it sat down in its nest

Alice crouched down through the trees as well as she could for her
neck would twist round the boughs and now and then she had to stop to
get it off At last she thought of the mushroom in her hands and set
to work with great care to take a small bite first from the right hand
then from the left till at length she brought herself down to the
right size

It was so long since she had been this height that it felt quite
strange at first but she soon got used to it

Come theres half my plan done now she said How strange all these
things are Im not sure one hour what I shall be the next Im glad
Im back to my right size the next thing is to get into that
gardenhow is that to be done I should like to know As she said
this she saw in front of her a small house not more than four feet
high Who lives there thought Alice itll not do at all to come
upon them this size why I should scare them out of their wits

So she ate some of the right hand bit again and did not dare to go
near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high




CHAPTER VI

PIG AND PEPPER


For a while Alice stood and looked at the house and tried to think what
to do next when a footman ran out of the wood from the way he was
dressed she took him to be a footman though if she had judged by his
face she would have called him a fish and knocked at the door with his
fist A footman with a round face and large eyes came to the door
Alice wanted to know what it all meant so she crept a short way out
of the wood to hear what they said

Illustration

The FishFootman took from under his arm a great letter and handed
it to the other and said in a grave tone For the Duchess from the
Queen The FrogFootman said in the same grave tone From the Queen
for the Duchess Then they both bowed so low that their heads touched
each other

All this made Alice laugh so much that she had to run back to the wood
for fear they would hear her and when she next peeped out the
FishFootman was gone and the other sat on the ground near the door
and stared up at the sky

Alice went up to the door and knocked

Theres no sort of use for you to knock said the Footman Im on
the same side of the door that you are and there is so much noise in
the room that no one could hear you There was indeed a great noise
in the housea howling and sneezing with now and then a great crash
as if a dish or a pot had been broken to pieces

Please then said Alice how am I to get in

There might be some sense in your knocking the Footman went on if
we were not both on the same side of the door If you were in the room
you might knock and I could let you out you know He looked up at the
sky all the time he was speaking which Alice thought was quite rude
But perhaps he cant help it she thought his eyes are so near the
top of his head Still he might tell me what I ask himHow am I to get
in she asked

I shall sit here the Footman said till tomorrow

Just then the door of the house flew open and a large plate skimmed out
straight at his head it just grazed his nose and broke on one of the
trees near him or next day maybe he went on in the same tone as
if he had not seen the plate

Illustration

How am I to get in Alice asked as loud as she could speak

Are you to get in at all he said Thats the first thing you know

It was no doubt but Alice didnt like to be told so

The Footman seemed to think this a good time to say again I shall
sit here on and off for days and days

But what am I to do said Alice

Do what you like he said

Oh theres no use to try to talk to him said Alice he has no
sense at all And she opened the door and went in

The door led right into a large room that was full of smoke from end to
end the Duchess sat on a stool and held a child in her arms the cook
stood near the fire and stirred a large pot which seemed to be full of
soup

Theres too much pepper in that soup Alice said to herself as well
as she could for sneezing There was too much of it in the air for the
Duchess sneezed now and then and as for the child it sneezed and
howled all the time

A large cat sat on the hearth grinning from ear to ear

Please would you tell me said Alice not quite sure that it was
right for her to speak first why your cat grins like that

Its a Cheshire cat said the Duchess and thats why Pig

She said the last word so loud that Alice jumped but she soon saw that
the Duchess spoke to the child and not to her so she went on

I didnt know that Cheshire cats grinned in fact I didnt know that
cats could grin

They all can said the Duchess and most of em do

I dont know of any that do Alice said quite pleased to have some
one to talk with

You dont know much said the Duchess and thats a fact

Alice did not at all like the tone in which this was said and thought
it would be as well to speak of something else While she tried to
think of what to say the cook took the pot from the fire and at once
set to work throwing things at the Duchess and the childthe tongs
came first then pots pans plates and cups flew thick and fast through
the air The Duchess did not seem to see them even when they hit her
and the child had howled so loud all the while that one could not tell
if the blows hurt it or not

Oh please mind what you do cried Alice as she jumped up and down
in great fear lest she should be struck

Hold your tongue said the Duchess then she began a sort of song to
the child giving it a hard shake at the end of each line

At the end of the song she threw the child at Alice and said Here
you may nurse it a bit if you like I must go and get ready to play
croquet with the Queen and she left the room in great haste The cook
threw a pan after her as she went but it just missed her

Alice caught the child which held out its arms and legs on all sides
just like a starfish Alice thought The poor thing snorted like a
steam engine when she caught it and turned about so much it was as
much as she could do at first to hold it

As soon as she found out the right way to nurse it which was to twist
it up in a sort of knot then keep tight hold of its right ear and left
foot she took it out in the fresh air If I dont take this child
with me thought Alice theyre sure to kill it in a day or two
wouldnt it be wrong to leave it here She said the last words out
loud and the child grunted it had left off sneezing by this time
Dont grunt said Alice that is not at all the right way to do

The child grunted again and Alice looked at its face to see what was
wrong with it There could be no doubt that it had a turnup nose much
more like a snout than a childs nose Its eyes were quite small too in
fact she did not like the look of the thing at all

Illustration

Perhaps that was not a grunt but a sob and she looked to see if
there were tears in its eyes

No there were no tears If youre going to turn into a pig my
dear said Alice Ill have no more to do with you Mind now The
poor thing sobbed once more or grunted Alice couldnt say which

Now what am I to do with this thing when I get it home thought
Alice Just then it grunted so loud that she looked down at its face
with some fear This time there could be no doubt about itit was a
pig

So she set it down and felt glad to see it trot off into the wood

As she turned to walk on she saw the Cheshire Cat on the bough of a
tree a few yards off The Cat grinned when it saw Alice It looked like
a good cat she thought still it had long claws and large teeth so she
felt she ought to be kind to it

Illustration

Puss said Alice would you please tell me which way I ought to walk
from here

That depends a good deal on where you want to go to said the Cat

I dont much care where said Alice

Then you need not care which way you walk said the Cat

so long as I get somewhere Alice added

Oh youre sure to do that if you dont stop said the Cat

Alice knew that this was true so she asked What sort of people live
near here

In that way said the Cat with a wave of its right paw lives a
Hatter and in that way with a wave of its left paw lives a March
Hare Go to see the one you like theyre both mad

But I dont want to go where mad folks live said Alice

Illustration

Oh you cant help that said the Cat were all mad here Im mad
Youre mad

How do you know Im mad asked Alice

You must be said the Cat or you wouldnt have come here

Alice didnt think that proved it at all but she went on and how do
you know that you are mad

First said the Cat a dogs not mad You grant that

Yes

Well then the Cat went on you know a dog growls when its angry
and wags its tail when its pleased Now I growl when Im pleased and
wag my tail when Im angry So you see Im mad

I say the cat purrs I do not call it a growl said Alice

Call it what you like said the Cat Do you play croquet with the
Queen today

I should like it but I havent been asked yet said Alice

Youll see me there said the Cat then faded out of sight

Alice did not think this so queer as she was now used to strange
things While she still looked at the place where it had been it came
back again all at once

Bytheby what became of the child it asked

It turned into a pig Alice said

I thought it would said the Cat then once more faded out of sight

Alice waited a while to see if it would come back then walked on in
the way in which the March Hare was said to live

Ive seen Hatters she said to herself so Ill go to see the March
Hare As she said this she looked up and there sat the Cat on a
branch of a tree

Did you say pig or fig asked the Cat

I said pig and I wish you wouldnt come and go all at once like you
do you make one quite giddy

All right said the Cat and this time it faded out in such a way that
its tail went first and the last thing Alice saw was the grin which
stayed some time after the rest of it had gone

Well Ive seen a cat without a grin thought Alice but a grin
without a cat Its the strangest thing I ever saw in all my life

She soon came in sight of the house of the March Hare she thought it
must be the right place as the chimneys were shaped like ears and the
roof was thatched with fur It was so large a house that she did not
like to go too near while she was so small so she ate a small piece
from the lefthand bit of mushroom and raised herself to two feet
high Then she walked up to the house though with some fear lest it
should be mad as the Cat had said




CHAPTER VII

A MAD TEAPARTY


There was a table set out in the shade of the trees in front of the
house and the March Hare and the Hatter were at tea a Dormouse sat
between them but it seemed to have gone to sleep

The table was a long one but the three were all crowded at one
corner of it No room No room they cried out as soon as they saw
Alice Theres plenty of room she said and sat down in a large
armchair at one end of the table

Have some wine the March Hare said in a kind tone

Alice looked all round the table but there was not a thing on it but
tea I dont see the wine she said

There isnt any said the March Hare

Then it wasnt polite of you to ask me to have wine said Alice

It wasnt polite of you to sit down when no one had asked you to have
a seat said the March Hare

I didnt know it was your table said Alice its laid for more
than three

Your hair wants cutting said the Hatter He had looked hard at
Alice for some time and this was his first speech

You should learn not to speak to a guest like that said Alice it
is very rude

The Hatter stretched his eyes quite wide at this but all he said was
Why is a raven like a desk

Illustration

Come we shall have some fun now thought Alice I think I can guess
that she added out loud

Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it asked
the March Hare

I do said Alice

Then you should say what you mean the March Hare went on

I do Alice said at leastat least I mean what I saythats the
same thing you know

Not the same thing a bit said the Hatter Why you might just as
well say I see what I eat is the same thing as I eat what I see

You might just as well say added the March Hare that I like what I
get is the same thing as I get what I like

You might just as well say added the Dormouse who seemed to be
talking in his sleep that I breathe when I sleep is the same thing
as I sleep when I breathe

It is the same with you said the Hatter

No one spoke for some time while Alice tried to think of all she knew
of ravens and desks which wasnt much

The Hatter was the first to speak What day of the month is it he
said turning to Alice He had his watch in his hand looked at it and
shook it now and then while he held it to his ear

Alice thought awhile and said The fourth

Two days wrong sighed the Hatter I told you butter wouldnt suit
this watch he added with a scowl as he looked at the March Hare

It was the best butter the March Hare said

Yes but some crumbs must have got in the Hatter growled you
shouldnt have put it in with the breadknife

The March Hare took the watch and looked at it then dipped it into his
cup of tea and looked at it again but all he could think to say was
it was the best butter you know

Oh what a funny watch said Alice It tells the day of the month
and doesnt tell what oclock it is

Why should it growled the Hatter

Does your watch tell what year it is

Of course not said Alice but theres no need that it should since
it stays the same year such a long time

Which is just the case with mine said the Hatter which seemed to
Alice to have no sense in it at all

I dont quite know what you mean she said

The Dormouse has gone to sleep once more said the Hatter and he
poured some hot tea on the tip of its nose

The Dormouse shook its head and said with its eyes still closed Of
course of course just what I wanted to say myself

Have you guessed the riddle yet the Hatter asked turning to
Alice

No I give it up she said Whats the answer

I do not know at all said the Hatter

Nor I said the March Hare

Alice sighed I think you might do better with the time than to waste
it by asking riddles that have no answers

If you knew Time as well as I do you wouldnt say waste it Its
him

I dont know what you mean Alice said

Of course you dont said the Hatter with a toss of his head I dare
say you never even spoke to Time

Maybe not she said but I know I have to beat time when I learn to
sing

Oh thats it said the Hatter He wont stand beating Now if you
kept on good terms with him he would do anything you liked with the
clock Say it was nine oclock just time to go to school youd have
but to give a hint to Time and round goes the clock Halfpast one
time for lunch

I wish it was the March Hare said to itself

Illustration

That would be grand Im sure said Alice but thenI shouldnt be
hungry for it you know

Not at first perhaps but you could keep it to halfpast one as long
as you liked said the Hatter

Is that the way you do asked Alice

The Hatter shook his head and sighed Not I he said Time and I
fell out last March It was at the great concert given by the Queen of
Hearts and I had to sing

    Twinkle twinkle little bat
    How I wonder what youre at

You know the song perhaps

Ive heard something like it said Alice

It goes on you know the Hatter said in this way

    Up above the world you fly
    Like a teatray in the sky
    Twinkle twinkle

Here the Dormouse shook itself and sang in its sleep twinkle
twinkle twinkle twinkle and went on so long that they had to
pinch it to make it stop

Well while I sang the first verse the Hatter went on the Queen
bawled out See how he murders the time Off with his head And ever
since that he wont do a thing I ask Its always six oclock now

A bright thought came into Alices head Is that why so many tea
things are put out here she asked

Yes thats it said the Hatter with a sigh its always teatime
and weve no time to wash the things

Then you keep moving round I guess said Alice

Just so said the Hatter as the things get used up

But when you come to the place where you started what do you do then
Alice dared to ask

Im tired of this yawned the March Hare I vote you tell us a tale

I fear I dont know one said Alice

I want a clean cup spoke up the Hatter

He moved on as he spoke and the Dormouse moved into his place the
March Hare moved into the Dormouses place and Alice none too well
pleased took the place of the March Hare The Hatter was the only one
to get any good from the change and Alice was a good deal worse off
as the March Hare had upset the milkjug into his plate

Now for your story the March Hare said to Alice

Im sure I dont knowAlice began II dont think

Then you shouldnt talk said the Hatter

Illustration

This was more than Alice could stand so she got up and walked off and
though she looked back once or twice and half hoped they would call
after her they didnt seem to know that she was gone The last time
she saw them they were trying to put the poor Dormouse head first
into the teapot

Well Ill not go there again said Alice as she picked her way
through the wood Its the dullest teaparty I was ever at in all my
life

As Alice said this she saw that one of the trees had a door that led
right into it Thats strange she thought but I havent seen a
thing today that isnt strange I think I may as well go in at once
And in she went

Once more she found herself in a long hall and close to the little
glass stand She took up the little key and unlocked the door that led
to the garden Then she set to work to eat some of the mushroom which
she still had with her When she was about a foot high she went
through the door and walked down the little hall thenshe found
herself at last in the lovely garden where she had seen the bright
blooms and the cool fountains




CHAPTER VIII

THE QUEENS CROQUET GROUND


A large rose tree stood near the garden gate The blooms on it were
white but three men who seemed to be in great haste were painting them
red Alice thought this a strange thing to do so she went nearer to
watch them Just as she came up to them she heard one of them say
Look out now Five Dont splash paint on me like that

I couldnt help it said Five Six knocked my arm

On which Six looked up and said Thats right Five Dont fail to lay
the blame on some one else

You neednt talk said Five I heard the Queen say your head must
come off

What for asked the one who spoke first

What is that to you Two said Six

It is much to him and Ill tell him said Five He brought the cook
tulip roots for onions

Six flung down the brush and said Well of all the wrong things
Just then his eyes chanced to fall on Alice who stood and watched
them and he checked himself at once Five and Two looked round also
and all of them bowed low

Would you tell me please said Alice why you paint those roses

Five and Six did not speak but looked at Two who said in a low voice
Why the fact is you see Miss this here ought to have been a red
rose tree and by mistake a white one was put in and if the Queen was
to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know So you
see Miss we are hard at work to get it painted so that she may
not Just then Five who had stood and watched the gate for some time
called out The Queen the Queen and the three men at once threw
themselves flat upon their faces Alice heard the tramp of feet and
looked round glad if at last she could see the Queen

Illustration

First came ten soldiers with clubs these were all shaped like the
three men at the rose tree long and flat like cards with their hands
and feet at the corners next came ten men who were trimmed with
diamonds and walked two and two like the soldiers The ten children
of the King and Queen came next and the little dears came with a skip
and a jump hand in hand by twos They were trimmed with hearts

Next came the guests most of whom were Kings and Queens Alice saw
the White Rabbit with them He did not seem at ease though he smiled
at all that was said He didnt see Alice as he went by Then came the
Knave of Hearts with the Kings crown on a red velvet cushion and
last of all came The King and Queen of Hearts

Illustration

At first Alice thought it might be right for her to lie down on her
face like the three men at the rose tree but what would be the use of
such a fine show she thought if all had to lie down so that they
couldnt see it So she stood where she was and waited

When they came to where she stood they all stopped and looked at her
and the Queen said in a stern voice Who is this She spoke to the
Knave of Hearts who bowed and smiled but did not speak

Fool said the Queen with a toss of her head then she turned to
Alice and asked Whats your name child

My name is Alice so please your majesty said Alice but she
thought to herself Why theyre a mere pack of cards I need have no
fears of them

And who are these asked the Queen as she pointed to the three men
who still lay round the rose tree for you see as they all lay on their
faces and their backs were the same as the rest of the pack she could
not tell who they were

How should I know said Alice and thought it strange that she should
speak to a Queen in that way

The Queen turned red with rage glared at her for a moment like a wild
beast then screamed Off with her head Off

Nonsense said Alice in a loud firm voice and the Queen said no
more

The King laid his hand on the Queens arm and said Think my dear she
is but a child

The Queen turned from him with a scowl and said to the Knave Turn them
over

The Knave did so with one foot

Get up said the Queen in a shrill loud voice and the three men
jumped up at once and bowed to the King and Queen and to the whole
crowd

Leave off that screamed the Queen you make me giddy Then she
turned to the rose tree and asked What have you been doing here

May it please your majesty said Two and went down on one knee as
he spoke we were trying

I see said the Queen who in the mean time had seen that some of the
roses were painted red and some were still white Off with their
heads and the crowd moved on while three of the soldiers stayed to
cut off the heads of the poor men who ran to Alice for help

They shant hurt you she said as she hid them in a large flower pot
that stood near The three soldiers walked round and looked for them a
short while then marched off

Are their heads off shouted the Queen

Their heads are gone if it please your majesty the soldiers
shouted back

Thats right shouted the Queen Can you play croquet she asked
Alice

Yes shouted Alice

Come on then roared the Queen and Alice went on with them

Itsits a fine day said a weak voice at her side It was the White
Rabbit who peeped up into her face

Yes said Alice wheres the Duchess

Hush Hush said the Rabbit in a low tone He looked back as he
spoke then raised up on tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and
whispered Shes to have her head cut off

What for asked Alice

Did you say What a pity the Rabbit asked

No I didnt said Alice I dont think its at all a pity I said
What for

Illustration

She boxed the Queens ears the Rabbit began Alice gave a little
scream of joy

Oh hush the Rabbit whispered in a great fright The Queen will
hear you You see she came late and the Queen said

Each one to his place shouted the Queen in a loud voice and people
ran this way and that in great haste and soon each one had found his
place and the game began

Alice thought she had never seen such a strange croquet ground in all
her life it was all ridges the balls were live hedgehogs the
mallets were live birds and the soldiers bent down and stood on their
hands and feet to make the arches

At first Alice found it hard to use a live bird for a mallet It was a
large bird with a long neck and long legs She tucked it under her arm
with its legs down but just as she got its neck straight and thought
now she could give the ball a good blow with its head the bird would
twist its neck round and give her such a queer look that she could not
help laughing and by the time she had got its head down again she
found that the hedgehog had crawled off Then too there was always a
ridge or a hole in the way of where she wanted to send her ball and
she couldnt find an arch in its place for the men would get up and
walk off when it pleased them Alice soon made up her mind that it was
a very hard game to play

The Queen was soon in a great rage and stamped about shouting Off
with his head or Off with her head with each breath

Alice felt quite ill at ease to be sure she had not as yet had cause
to feel the wrath of the Queen but she knew not how soon it might be
her turn and then she thought what shall I do

As she was looking round for some way to get off without being seen
she saw a strange thing in the air which she at last made out to be a
grin and she said to herself Its the Cat now I shall have some one
to talk to

How do you do said the Cat as soon as its whole mouth came out

Alice waited till she saw the eyes then nodded Its no use to
speak to it till its ears have come or at least one of them In a
short time the whole head came in view then she put down her bird and
told him of the game glad that she had some one that was pleased to
hear her talk

I dont think they are at all fair in the game said Alice with a
scowl and they all talk so loud that one cant hear ones self
speakand they dont have rules to play by at least if they have they
dont mind themand you dont know how bad it is to have to use live
things to play with The arch I have to go through next walked off just
now to the far end of the groundand I should have struck the Queens
hedgehog but it ran off when it saw that mine was near

How do you like the Queen asked the Cat in a low voice

Not at all said Alice shes so Just then she saw that the Queen
was behind her and heard what she said so she went on sure to win
that its not worth while to go on with the game

The Queen smiled and passed on

Who are you talking to said the King as he came up to Alice and
stared at the Cats head as if it were a strange sight

Its a friend of minea Cheshire Cat said Alice

I dont like the look of it at all said the King it may kiss my
hand if it likes

I dont want to said the Cat

Dont be rude and dont look at me like that said the King

A cat may look at a king said Alice Ive read that in some book
but I cant tell where

Well it must get off from here said the King in a firm voice and he
called to the Queen who was near My dear I wish you would see that
this cat leaves here at once

The Queen had but one cure for all ills great or small Off with his
head she said and did not so much as look round

Ill fetch the soldier myself said the King and rushed off

Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game went on
She heard the Queens voice in the distance as she screamed with rage
Off with his head He has missed his turn Alice did not like the
look of things at all for the game was so mixed she could not tell when
her turn came so she went off to find her hedgehog

She came up with two hedgehogs in a fierce fight and thought now was a
good time to strike one of them but her mallet was gone to the other
side of the ground and she saw it in a weak sort of way as it tried to
fly up into a tree

By the time she had caught the bird and brought it back the fight was
over and both hedgehogs were out of sight I dont care much
thought Alice for there is not an arch on this side the ground So
she went back to have some more talk with her friend

When she reached the place she found quite a crowd round the Cat The
King and the Queen and the soldier who had come with the axe to cut
off the Cats head were all talking at once while all the rest stood
with closed lips and looked quite grave

As soon as they saw Alice they wanted her to say which one was right
but as all three spoke at once she found it hard to make out what they
said

Illustration

The soldier said that you couldnt cut off a head unless there was a
body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing and
he wouldnt begin it now at his time of life

The King said that all heads could be cut off and that you werent to
talk nonsense

The Queen said if something wasnt done in less than no time heads
should come off all round It was this last threat that had made the
whole crowd look so grave as Alice came up

Alice could think of nothing else to say but Ask the Duchess it is
her Cat

Fetch her here the Queen said to the soldier and he went off like
an arrow

The Cats head started to fade out of sight as soon as he was gone and
by the time he had come back with the Duchess it could not be seen at
all so the King and the man ran up and down looking for it while the
rest went back to the game




CHAPTER IX

THE MOCK TURTLE


You cant think how glad I am to see you once more you dear old
thing said the Duchess as she took Alices arm and they walked off
side by side

Alice was glad to see her in such a fine mood and thought to herself
that the Duchess might not be so bad as she had seemed to be when they
first met

Then Alice fell into a long train of thought as to what she would do
if she were a Duchess

She quite lost sight of the Duchess by her side and was startled when
she heard her voice close to her ear

You have something on your mind my dear and that makes you forget
to talk I cant tell you just now what the moral of that is but I
shall think of it in a bit

Are you sure it has one asked Alice

Tut tut child said the Duchess all things have a moral if you
can but find it And she squeezed up close to Alices side as she
spoke

Alice did not much like to have the Duchess keep so close but she
didnt like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could

The game is not so bad now Alice said thinking she ought to fill
in the time with talk of some kind

Tis so said the Duchess and the moral of that isOh tis
love tis love that makes the world go round

Some one said its done by each one minding his own work said
Alice

Ah well it means much the same thing said the Duchess then
added and the moral of that isTake care of the sense and the
sounds will take care of themselves

Illustration

How she likes to find morals in things said Alice

Why dont you talk more and not think so long asked the Duchess

Ive a right to think said Alice in a sharp tone for she was tired
and vexed

Just as much right said the Duchess as pigs have to fly and the
mor

But here the voice of the Duchess died out in the midst of her pet
word moral and Alice felt the arm that was linked in hers shake as
if with fright Alice looked up and there stood the Queen in front of
them with her arms folded and a dark frown upon her face

A fine day your majesty the Duchess began in a weak voice

Now I warn you in time shouted the Queen with a stamp on the
ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in
about half no time Take your choice

The Duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment

Lets go on with the game the Queen said to Alice and Alice was in
too great a fright to speak but went with her back to the croquet
ground

The guests had all sat down in the shade to rest while the Queen was
away but as soon as they saw her they rushed back to the game while
the Queen said if they were not in their places at once it would cost
them their lives

All the time the game went on the Queen kept shouting Off with his
head or Off with her head so that by the end of half an hour there
was no one left on the grounds but the King the Queen and Alice

Then the Queen left off quite out of breath and said to Alice Have
you seen the Mock Turtle yet

No said Alice I dont know what a Mockturtle is

It is a thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from the Queen said

Ive never seen or heard of one Alice said

Come on then and he shall tell you his story said the Queen

As they walked off Alice heard the King say in a low tone to those
whom the Queen had doomed to death You may all go free Come thats
a good thing thought Alice for she felt very sad that all those men
must have their heads cut off

Illustration

They soon came to where a Gryphon lay fast asleep in the sun If you
dont know what it is like look at the picture Up dull thing
said the Queen and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle I
must go back now and she walked away and left Alice with the
Gryphon Alice was by no means pleased with its looks but she thought
she would be quite as safe with it as she would be with the Queen so
she waited

The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then watched the Queen till she
was out of sight then it laughed What fun it said half to itself
half to Alice

What is the fun she asked

Why she it said Its all a whim of hers they never cut off
those heads you know Come on

Soon they saw the Mock Turtle sitting sad and lone on a ledge of rock
and as they came near Alice could hear him sigh as if his heart would
break What makes him so sad Alice asked

Its all a whim of his said the Gryphon he hasnt got no grief
you know Come on

Illustration

So they went up to the Mock Turtle who looked at them with large eyes
full of tears but did not speak

This here young lady said the Gryphon she wants for to know
about your past life she do

Ill tell it to her said the Mock Turtle in a deep sad tone sit
down both of you and dont speak a word till I get through

So they sat down and no one spoke for some time

Once said the Mock Turtle at last with a deep sigh I was a real
Turtle When we were young we went to school in the sea We were taught
by an old Turtlewe used to call him Tortoise

Why did you call him Tortoise if he wasnt one Alice asked

He taught us thats why said the Mock Turtle you are quite dull
not to know that

Shame on you to ask such a simple thing added the Gryphon then
they both sat and looked at poor Alice who felt as if she could sink
into the earth

At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle Drive on old fellow
Dont be all day about it and he went on in these words

Yes we went to school in the sea though you maynt think its true

I didnt say I did not said Alice

You did said the Mock Turtle

Hold your tongue added the Gryphon

The Mock Turtle went on

We were well taughtin fact we went to school each day

Ive been to a day school too said Alice you neednt be so proud as
all that

Were you taught washing asked the Mock Turtle

Of course not said Alice

Ah then yours wasnt a good school said the Mock Turtle Now at
ours they had at the end of the bill French music and
washingextra

You couldnt have needed it much in the sea said Alice

I didnt learn it said the Mock Turtle with a sigh I just took
the first course

What was that asked Alice

Reeling and Writhing of course at first the Mock Turtle said
An old eel used to come once a week He taught us to drawl to stretch
and to faint in coils

What was that like Alice asked

Well I cant show you myself he said Im too stiff And the
Gryphon didnt learn it

How many hours a day did you do lessons asked Alice

Ten hours the first day said the Mock Turtle nine the next and so
on

What a strange plan said Alice

Thats why theyre called lessons said the Gryphon they lessen
from day to day

This was such a new thing to Alice that she sat still a good while and
didnt speak Then there would be a day when you would have no school
she said

Of course there would said the Mock Turtle

What did you do then asked Alice

Im tired of this said the Gryphon tell her now of the games we
played




CHAPTER X

THE LOBSTER DANCE


The Mock Turtle sighed looked at Alice and tried to speak but for a
minute or two sobs choked his voice Same as if he had a bone in his
throat said the Gryphon and set to work to shake him and punch him
in the back At last the Mock Turtle found his voice and with tears
running down his cheeks he went on

Illustration

You may not have lived much in the seaI havent said Alice
so you can not know what a fine thing a Lobster Dance is

No said Alice What sort of a dance is it

Why said the Gryphon you first form in a line on the seashore

Two lines cried the Mock Turtle Seals turtles and so on then
when youve cleared all the small fish out of the way

That takes some time put in the Gryphon

You move to the front twice

Each with a lobster by his side cried the Gryphon

Of course the Mock Turtle said move to the front twice

Change and come back in same way said the Gryphon

Then you know the Mock Turtle went on you throw the

The lobsters shouted the Gryphon with a bound into the air

As far out to sea as you can

Swim out for them screamed the Gryphon

Turn heels over head in the sea cried the Mock Turtle

Change again yelled the Gryphon at the top of his voice

Then back to land andthats all the first part said the Mock
Turtle

Both the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle had jumped about like mad things
all this time Now they sat down quite sad and still and looked at
Alice

It must be a pretty dance said Alice

Would you like to see some of it asked the Mock Turtle

Oh yes she said

Come lets try the first part said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon
We can do it without lobsters you know Which shall sing

Oh you sing said the Gryphon I dont know the words

So they danced round and round Alice now and then treading on her
toes when they passed too close They waved their fore paws to mark the
time while the Mock Turtle sang a queer kind of song each verse of
which ended with these words

    Will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance

    Will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance

Thank you its a fine dance to watch said Alice glad that it was
over at last

Now said the Gryphon tell us about what you have seen and done in
your life

I could tell you of the strange things I have seen today said
Alice with some doubt as to their wishing to hear it

All right go on they both cried

So Alice told them what she had been through that day from the time
when she first saw the White Rabbit They came up quite close to her
one on each side and sat still till she got to the part where she tried
to say You are old Father William and the words all came wrong
Then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath and said Thats quite
strange

Its all as strange as it can be said the Gryphon

It all came wrong the Mock Turtle said while he seemed to be in
deep thought I should like to hear her try to say something now Tell
her to begin He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had the
right to make Alice do as it pleased

Illustration

Stand up and say Tis the voice of the Sluggard said the Gryphon

How they do try to make one do things thought Alice I might just
as well be at school at once She stood up and tried to repeat it but
her head was so full of the Lobster Dance that she didnt know what
she was saying and the words all came very queer indeed

    Tis the voice of the lobster I heard him declare
    You have baked me too brown I must sugar my hair
    As a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose
    Trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes

Thats not the way I used to say it when I was a child said the
Gryphon

Well I never heard it before said the Mock Turtle but theres no
sense in it at all

Alice did not speak she sat down with her face in her hands and
thought Will things never be as they used to any more

I should like you to tell what it means said the Mock Turtle

She cant do that said the Gryphon Go on with the next verse

But his toes the Mock Turtle went on How could he turn them out
with his nose you know

Go on with the next verse the Gryphon said once more it begins I
passed by his garden

Alice thought she must do as she was told though she felt sure it
would all come wrong and she went on

    I passed by his garden and marked with one eye
    How the owl and the oyster were sharing the pie

What is the use of saying all that stuff the Mock Turtle broke
in if you dont tell what it means as you go on I tell you it is all
nonsense

Yes I think you might as well leave off said the Gryphon and
Alice was but too glad to do so

Shall we try the Lobster dance once more the Gryphon went on or
would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song

Oh a song please if the Mock Turtle would be so kind Alice said
with so much zest that the Gryphon threw back his head and said Hm
Well each one to his own taste Sing her Turtle Soup will you old
fellow

The Mock Turtle heaved a deep sigh and in a voice choked with sobs
began his song but just then the cry of The trial is on was heard
a long way off

Come on cried the Gryphon He took her by the hand ran off and did
not wait to hear the song

What trial is it Alice panted as she ran but the Gryphon only
said Come on and still ran as fast as he could




CHAPTER XI

WHO STOLE THE TARTS


The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when Alice
and the Gryphon came up with a great crowd about them There were all
sorts of small birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards The
Knave stood in front of them in chains with a soldier on each side to
guard him and near the King was the White Rabbit with a trumpet in
one hand and a roll of paper in the other In the middle of the court
was a table with a large dish of tarts on it They looked so good that
it made Alice feel as if she would like to eat some of them I wish
theyd get the trial done she thought and hand round the pies But
there seemed no chance of this so to pass the time away she looked
round at the strange things about her

This was the first time Alice had been in a court of this kind and she
was quite pleased to find that she knew the names of most things she saw
there Thats the judge she thought I know him by his great wig

The judge by the way was the King and as he wore his crown on top of
his wig he looked quite ill at ease

And thats the jury box thought Alice and those twelve things
she had to say things you see for some of them were beasts and some
were birds I guess are the jurors She said this last word two or
three times as she was proud that she knew it for she was right when
she thought that few girls of her age would have known what it all
meant

The twelve jurors all wrote on slates

What can they have to write now Alice asked the Gryphon in a low
tone The trial has not begun yet

Theyre putting down their names the Gryphon said for fear they
should forget them

Stupid things Alice said in a loud voice but stopped at once for
the White Rabbit cried out Silence in court and the King looked
round to make out who spoke

Alice could see quite well that the jurors all wrote down stupid
things on their slates she could even make out that one of them
didnt know how to spell stupid and that he asked the one by his side
to tell him A nice muddle their slates will be in by the time the
trials ended thought Alice

One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked as he wrote This of
course Alice could not stand so she went round near him and soon
found a chance to get it from him This she did in such a way that the
poor juror it was Bill the Lizard could not make out at all where
it was so he wrote with one finger for the rest of the day Of course
this was of no use as it left no mark on the slate

Read the charge said the King

On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and then
from the paper in his hand read

    The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts
       All on a summer day
    The Knave of Hearts he stole those tarts
       And took them quite away

The jury will now take the case said the King

Not yet not yet the Rabbit said in haste There is a great deal
else to come first

Illustration

Call the first witness said the King and the White Rabbit blew
three blasts on the trumpet and called out First witness

The first to come was the Hatter He came in with a tea cup in one hand
and a piece of bread and butter in the other

I beg pardon your majesty he said but I had to bring these in
as I was not quite through with my tea when I was sent for

You ought to have been through said the King When did you begin

The Hatter looked at the March Hare who had just come into court
arm in arm with the Dormouse Fourth of March I think it was he
said

Fifth said the March Hare

Sixth added the Dormouse

Write that down said the King to the jury and they wrote down all
three dates on their slates and then added them up and changed the sum
to shillings and pence

Take off your hat the King said to the Hatter

It isnt mine said the Hatter

Stole it cried the King as he turned to the jury who at once wrote
it down

I keep them to sell the Hatter added Ive none of my own Im a
hatter

Here the Queen put on her eyeglasses and stared hard at the Hatter
who turned pale with fright

Tell what you know of this case said the King and dont be
nervous or Ill have your head off on the spot

This did not seem to calm him at all he shifted from one foot to the
other and looked at the Queen and in his fright he bit a large piece
out of his teacup in place of the bread and butter

Just then Alice felt a strange thrill the cause of which she could not
make out till she saw she had begun to grow again

I wish you wouldnt squeeze so said the Dormouse I havent room to
breathe

I cant help it said Alice Im growing

Youve no right to grow here said the Dormouse

Dont talk such nonsense said Alice You know you grow too

Yes but not so fast as to squeeze the breath out of those who sit by
me He got up and crossed to the other side of the court

All this time the Queen had not left off staring at the Hatter and
just as the Dormouse crossed the court she said to one of the men
Bring me the list of those who sang in the last concert on which the
poor Hatter trembled so that he shook both his shoes off

Illustration

Tell what you know of this case the King called out again or Ill
have your head off if you do shake

Im a poor man your majesty the Hatter began in a weak voice
and I hadnt but just begun my tea not more than a week or so and
what with the bread and butter so thinand the twinkling of the
tea

The twinkling of what asked the King

It began with the tea the Hatter said

Of course twinkling begins with a T said the King Do you take me
for a dunce Go on

Im a poor man the Hatter went on and most things twinkled after
thatbut the March Hare said

I didnt said the March Hare in great haste

You did said the Hatter

I deny it said the March Hare

He denies it said the King leave out that part

Well Im sure the Dormouse said the Hatter went on with a look
at the Dormouse to see if he would deny it too but he was fast
asleep

Then I cut some more bread and

But what did the Dormouse say asked one of the jury

That I cant tell said the Hatter

You must tell or Ill have your head off said the King

The wretched Hatter dropped his cup and bread and went down on one
knee

Im a poor man he began

Youre a poor speaker said the King

Here one of the guinea pigs cheered and one of the men seized him
thrust him into a bag which tied up with strings and then sat upon
it

If thats all you know you may stand down the King said

Im as low as I can get now said the Hatter Im on the floor as it
is

Then you may sit down the King said

Id like to get through with my tea first said the Hatter with a
look at the Queen who still read the list in her hand

You may go said the King and the Hatter left the court in such
haste that he did not even wait to put his shoes on

And just take his head off outside the Queen added to one of the
soldiers but the Hatter was out of sight before the man could get to
the door

Call the next witness said the King

The next to come was the Duchess cook and Alice guessed who it was
by the way the people near the door sneezed all at once

Illustration

Tell what you know of this case said the King

Shant said the cook

The King looked at the White Rabbit who said in a low voice Your
majesty must make her tell

Well if I must I must said the King with a sad look He folded his
arms and frowned at the cook till his eyes were almost out of sight
then asked in a stern voice What are tarts made of

Pepper mostly said the cook

Sugar said a weak voice near her

Catch that Dormouse the Queen shrieked out Off with his head Turn
him out of court Pinch him Off with his head

The whole court ran here and there getting the Dormouse turned out
and by the time this was done the cook had gone

Thats all right said the King as if he were glad to be rid of her
Call the next and he added in a low tone to the Queen Now my
dear you must take the next witness in hand it quite makes my head
ache

Alice watched the White Rabbit as he looked over the list She
thought to herself I want to see what the next witness will be like
for they havent found out much yet

Think if you can how she felt when the White Rabbit read out at the
top of his shrill little voice the name Alice




CHAPTER XII

ALICE ON THE STAND


Here cried Alice but she quite forgot how large she had grown in
the last few minutes and jumped up in such haste that the edge of her
skirt tipped the jury box and turned them all out on the heads of the
crowd below and there they lay sprawling about which made her think
of a globe of goldfish which she had upset the week before

Illustration

Oh I beg your pardon she said and picked them up and put them
backed in the jury box as fast as she could

The trial can not go on said the King in a grave voice till all
the men are back in placeall he said with great force and looked
hard at Alice

She looked at the jury box and saw that in her haste she had put the
Lizard in head first and the poor thing was waving its tail in the
air but could not move She soon got it out and put it right not that
it matters much she thought I should think it would be quite as
much use in the trial one way up as the other

Illustration

As soon as their slates and pencils had been handed back to them the
jury set to work to write out an account of their fall all but the
Lizard who seemed too weak to write but sat and gazed up into the
roof of the court

What do you know of this case the King asked Alice

Not one thing said Alice

Not one thing at all asked the King

Not one thing at all said Alice

Write that down the King said to the jury

The King sat for some time and wrote in his notebook then he called
out Silence and read from his book Rule Fortytwo Each one more
than a mile high to leave the court

All looked at Alice

Im not a mile high said Alice

You are said the King

Not far from two miles high added the Queen

Well I shant go said Alice for I know thats a new rule you have
just made

Its the first rule in the book said the King

Then it ought to be Rule One said Alice

The King turned pale and shut his notebook at once

The jury can now take the case he said in a weak voice

Theres more to come yet please your majesty said the White
Rabbit as he jumped up this thing has just been picked up

Whats in it asked the Queen

I havent read it yet said the White Rabbit but it seems to be a
note from the Knave of Hearts to some one

Whose name is on it said one of the jurors

Theres no name on it said the White Rabbit he looked at it with
more care as he spoke and added it isnt a note at all its a set
of rhymes

Please your majesty said the Knave I didnt write it and they
cant prove that I did theres no name signed at the end

If you didnt sign it said the King that makes your case worse You
must have meant some harm or youd have signed your name like an honest
man

All clapped their hands at this as it was the first smart thing the King
had said that day

That proves his guilt said the Queen

It does not prove a thing said Alice Why you dont so much as know
what the rhymes are

Read them said the King

Where shall I begin your majesty the White Rabbit asked

Why at the first verse of course the King said looking quite grave
and go on till you come to the end then stop

The White Rabbit read

    They told me you had been to her
      And spoke of me to him
    She gave me a good name indeed
      But said I could not swim

    He sent them word that I had gone
      We know it to be true
    If she should push the matter on
      What would become of you

    I gave her one they gave him two
      You gave us three or more
    They all came back from him to you
      Though they were mine before

    My notion was she liked him best
      Before she had this fit
    This must be kept from all the rest
      But him and you and it

Thats the best thing weve heard yet said the King rubbing his
hands as if much pleased so now let the jury

If one of you can tell what it means said Alice she had grown so
large by this time that she had no fear of the King I should be glad
to hear it I dont think theres a grain of sense in it

The jury all wrote down on their slates She doesnt think theres a
grain of sense in it But no one tried to tell what it meant

If theres no sense in it said the King that saves a world of work
you know as we neednt try to find it  And yet I dont know he went
on as he spread out the rhymes on his knee and looked at them with one
eye I seem to find some sense in themsaid I could not swimyou
cant swim can you he added turning to the Knave

The Knave shook his head with a sigh Do I look like it he said
Which it was plain he did not as he was made of card board

All right so far said the King and he went on We know it to be
truethats the jury of courseI gave her one they gave him
twothat must be what he did with the tarts you know

But it goes on they all came back from him to you said Alice

Why there they are said the King pointing to the tarts Isnt
that as clear as can be Then it goes on before she had this fityou
dont have fits my dear I think he said to the Queen

Illustration

No no said the Queen in a great rage throwing an inkstand at the
Lizard as she spoke

Then the words dont fit you he said and looked round the court with
a smile But no one spoke Its a pun he added in a fierce tone then
all the court laughed

Let the jury now bring in their verdict the King said

No no said the Queen Sentence firstthen the verdict

Such stuff said Alice out loud Of course the jury must make

Hold your tongue screamed the Queen

I wont said Alice

Off with her head shouted the Queen at the top of her voice No one
moved

Who cares for you said Alice She had grown to her full size by
this time You are nothing but a pack of cards

At this the whole pack rose up in the air and flew down upon her she
gave a little scream and tried to beat them offand found herself
lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was
brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees
on to her face

Wake up Alice dear said her sister why what a long sleep you
have had

Oh Ive had such a strange dream said Alice and then she told her
sister as well as she could all these strange things that you have just
read about and when she came to the end of it her sister kissed her
and said It was a strange dream dear Im sure but run now in to
your tea its getting late

So Alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she
might what a wonderful dream it had been
