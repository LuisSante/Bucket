CHAPTER I

MISS OCTAVIA BASSETT


Slowbridge had been shaken to its foundations

It may as well be explained however at the outset that it would not
take much of a sensation to give Slowbridge a great shock In the first
place Slowbridge was not used to sensations and was used to going on
the even and respectable tenor of its way regarding the outside world
with private distrust if not with open disfavor The new mills had been
a trial to Slowbridgea sore trial On being told of the owners plan
of building them old Lady Theobald who was the cornerstone of the
social edifice of Slowbridge was said by a spectator to have turned
deathly pale with rage and on the first day of their being opened in
working order she had taken to her bed and remained shut up in her
darkened room for a week refusing to see anybody and even going so far
as to send a scathing message to the curate of St James who called in
fear and trembling because he was afraid to stay away

With mills and millhands her ladyship announced to Mr Laurence the
millowner when chance first threw them together with mills and
millhands come murder massacre and mob law And she said it so loud
and with so stern an air of conviction that the two Misses Briarton who
were of a timorous and fearful nature dropped their buttered muffins it
was at one of the teaparties which were Slowbridges only dissipation
and shuddered hysterically feeling that their fate was sealed and that
they might any night find three masculine millhands secreted under
their beds with bludgeons But as no massacres took place and the
millhands were pretty regular in their habits and even went so far as
to send their children to Lady Theobalds free school and accepted the
tracts left weekly at their doors whether they could read or not
Slowbridge gradually recovered from the shock of finding itself forced to
exist in close proximity to mills and was just settling itself to
sleepthe sleep of the justagain when as I have said it was shaken
to its foundations

It was Miss Belinda Bassett who received the first shock Miss Belinda
Bassett was a decorous little maiden lady who lived in a decorous little
house on High Street which was considered a very genteel street in
Slowbridge She had lived in the same house all her life her father had
lived in it and so also had her grandfather She had gone out to take
tea from its doors two or three times a week ever since she had been
twenty and she had had her little teaparties in its front parlor as
often as any other genteel Slowbridge entertainer She had risen at
seven breakfasted at eight dined at two taken tea at five and gone to
bed at ten with such regularity for fifty years that to rise at eight
breakfast at nine dine at three and take tea at six and go to bed at
eleven would she was firmly convinced be but to fly in the face of
Providence as she put it and sign her own deathwarrant Consequently
it is easy to imagine what a tremor and excitement seized her when one
afternoon as she sat waiting for her tea a coach from the Blue Lion
dashedor at least almost dashedup to the front door a young lady
got out and the next minute the handmaiden Mary Anne threw open the
door of the parlor announcing without the least preface

Your niece mum from Meriker

Miss Belinda got up feeling that her knees really trembled beneath her

In Slowbridge America was not approved ofin fact was almost entirely
ignored as a country where to quote Lady Theobald the laws were
loose and the prevailing sentiments revolutionary It was not
considered good taste to know Americanswhich was not unfortunate as
there were none to know and Miss Belinda Bassett had always felt a
delicacy in mentioning her only brother who had emigrated to the United
States in his youth having first disgraced himself by the utterance of
the blasphemous remark that he wanted to get to a place where a fellow
could stretch himself and not be bullied by a lot of old tabbies From
the day of his departure when he had left Miss Belinda bathed in tears
of anguish she had heard nothing of him and here upon the threshold
stood Mary Anne with delighted eagerness in her countenance
repeating

Your niece mum from Meriker

And with the words her niece entered

Miss Belinda put her hand to her heart

The young lady thus announced was the prettiest and at the same time the
most extraordinarylooking young lady she had ever seen in her life
Slowbridge contained nothing approaching this niece Her dress was so
very stylish that it was quite startling in its effect her forehead was
covered down to her large pretty eyes themselves with curls of
yellowbrown hair and her slender throat was swathed round and round
with a grand scarf of black lace

She made a step forward and then stopped looking at Miss Belinda Her
eyes suddenly to Miss Belindas amazement filled with tears

Didnt you she saidoh dear Didnt you get the letter

Thethe letter faltered Miss Belinda What letter mymy dear

Pas was the answer Oh I see you didnt

And she sank into the nearest chair putting her hands up to her face
and beginning to cry outright

Iam Octavia Bbassett she said We were coming to surpprise you
and travel in Europe but the mines went wrong and ppa was obliged to
go back to Nevada

The mines gasped Miss Belinda

Ssilvermines wept Octavia And we had scarcely landed when Piper
cabled and pa had to turn back It was something about shares and he
may have lost his last dollar

Miss Belinda sank into a chair herself

Mary Anne she said faintly bring me a glass of water

Her tone was such that Octavia removed her handkerchief from her eyes
and sat up to examine her

Are you frightened she asked in some alarm

Miss Belinda took a sip of the water brought by her handmaiden replaced
the glass upon the salver and shook her head deprecatingly

Not exactly frightened my dear she said but so amazed that I find
it difficult toto collect myself

Octavia put up her handkerchief again to wipe away a sudden new gush of
tears

If shares intended to go down she said I dont see why they couldnt
go down before we started instead of waiting until we got over here and
then spoiling every thing

Providence my dearbegan Miss Belinda

But she was interrupted by the reentrance of Mary Anne

The man from the Lion mum wants to know whats to be done with the
trunks Theres six of em an theyre all that eavy as he says he
wouldnt lift one alone for ten shilling

Six exclaimed Miss Belinda Whose are they

Mine replied Octavia Wait a minute Ill go out to him

Miss Belinda was astounded afresh by the alacrity with which her niece
seemed to forget her troubles and rise to the occasion The girl ran to
the front door as if she was quite used to directing her own affairs and
began to issue her orders

You will have to get another man she said You might have known that
Go and get one somewhere

And when the man went off grumbling a little and evidently rather at a
loss before such peremptory coolness she turned to Miss Belinda

Where must he put them she asked

It did not seem to have occurred to her once that her identity might be
doubted and some slight obstacles arise before her

I am afraid faltered Miss Belinda that five of them will have to be
put in the attic

And in fifteen minutes five of them were put into the attic and the
sixththe biggest of allstood in the trim little spare chamber and
pretty Miss Octavia had sunk into a puffy little chintzcovered
easychair while her newly found relative stood before her making the
most laudable efforts to recover her equilibrium and not to feel as if
her head were spinning round and round




CHAPTER II

AN INVESTMENT ANYWAY


The natural result of these efforts was that Miss Belinda was moved to
shed a few tears

I hope you will excuse my being too startled to say I was glad to see
you she said I have not seen my brother for thirty years and I was
very fond of him

He said you were answered Octavia and he was very fond of you too
He didnt write to you because he made up his mind not to let you hear
from him until he was a rich man and then he thought he would wait until
he could come home and surprise you He was awfully disappointed when he
had to go back without seeing you

Poor dear Martin wept Miss Belinda gently Such a journey

Octavia opened her charming eyes in surprise

Oh hell come back again she said And he doesnt mind the journey
The journey is nothing you know

Nothing echoed Miss Belinda A voyage across the Atlantic nothing
When one thinks of the danger my dear

Octavias eyes opened a shade wider

We have made the trip to the States across the Isthmus twelve times
and that takes a month she remarked So we dont think ten days much

Twelve times said Miss Belinda quite appalled Dear dear dear

And for some moments she could do nothing but look at her young relative
in doubtful wonder shaking her head with actual sadness

But she finally recovered herself with a little start

What am I thinking of she exclaimed remorsefully to let you sit here
in this way Pray excuse me my dear You see I am so upset

She left her chair in a great hurry and proceeded to embrace her young
guest tenderly though with a little timorousness The young lady
submitted to the caress with much composure

Did I upset you she inquired calmly

The fact was that she could not see why the simple advent of a relative
from Nevada should seem to have the effect of an earthquake and result
in tremor confusion and tears It was true she herself had shed a tear
or so but then her troubles had been accumulating for several days and
she had not felt confused yet

When Miss Belinda went downstairs to superintend Mary Anne in the
teamaking and left her guest alone that young person glanced about her
with a rather dubious expression

It is a queer nice little place she said But I dont wonder that pa
emigrated if they always get into such a flurry about little things I
might have been a ghost

Then she proceeded to unlock the big trunk and attire herself

Downstairs Miss Belinda was wavering between the kitchen and the
parlor in a kindly flutter

Toast some muffins Mary Anne and bring in the cold roast fowl she
said And I will put out some strawberryjam and some of the preserved
ginger Dear me Just to think how fond of preserved ginger poor Martin
was and how little of it he was allowed to eat There really seems a
special Providence in my having such a nice stock of it in the house when
his daughter comes home

In the course of half an hour every thing was in readiness and then Mary
Anne who had been sent upstairs to announce the fact came down in a
most remarkable state of delighted agitation suppressed ecstasy and
amazement exclaiming aloud in every feature

Shes dressed mum she announced an ll be down immediate and
retired to a shadowy corner of the kitchen passage that she might lie in
wait unobserved

Miss Belinda sitting behind the teaservice heard a soft flowing
silken rustle sweeping down the staircase and across the hall and then
her niece entered

Dont you think Ive dressed pretty quick she said and swept across
the little parlor and sat down in her place with the calmest and most
unconscious air in the world

There was in Slowbridge but one dressmaking establishment The head of
the establishmentMiss Letitia Chickiedesigned the costumes of every
woman in Slowbridge from Lady Theobald down There were legends that she
received her patterns from London and modified them to suit the
Slowbridge taste Possibly this was true but in that case her labors as
modifier must have been severe indeed since they were so far modified as
to be altogether unrecognizable when they left Miss Chickies
establishment and were borne home in triumph to the houses of her
patrons The taste of Slowbridge was quietupon this Slowbridge prided
itself especiallyand at the same time tended toward economy When
gores came into fashion Slowbridge clung firmly and with some pride to
substantial breadths which did not cut good silk into useless strips
which could not be utilized in aftertime and it was only when after a
visit to London Lady Theobald walked into St Jamess one Sunday with
two gores on each side that Miss Chickie regretfully put scissors into
her first breadth Each matronly member of good society possessed a
substantial silk gown of some sober color which gown having done duty
at two years teaparties descended to the grade of secondbest and
so descended year by year until it disappeared into the dim distance of
the past The young ladies had their white muslins and natural flowers
which latter decorations invariably collapsed in the course of the
evening and were worn during the latter half of any festive occasion in
a flabby and hopeless condition Miss Chickie made the muslins
festooning and adorning them after designs emanating from her fertile
imagination If they were a little short in the body and not very
generously proportioned in the matter of train there was no rival
establishment to sneer and Miss Chickie had it all her own way and at
least it could never be said that Slowbridge was vulgar or overdressed

Judge then of Miss Belinda Bassetts condition of mind when her fair
relative took her seat before her

What the material of her nieces dress was Miss Belinda could not have
told It was a silken and soft fabric of a pale blue color it clung to
the slender lissome young figure like a glove a fanlike train of great
length almost covered the hearthrug there were plaitings and frillings
all over it and yards of delicate satin ribbon cut into loops in the
most recklessly extravagant manner

Miss Belinda saw all this at the first glance as Mary Anne had seen it
and like Mary Anne lost her breath but on her second glance she saw
something more On the pretty slight hands were three wonderful
sparkling rings composed of diamonds set in clusters there were great
solitaires in the neat little ears and the thicklyplaited lace at the
throat was fastened by a diamond clasp

My dear said Miss Belinda clutching helplessly at the teapot are
yousurely it is aa little dangerous to wear suchsuch priceless
ornaments on ordinary occasions

Octavia stared at her for a moment uncomprehendingly

Your jewels I mean my love fluttered Miss Belinda Surely you dont
wear them often I declare it quite frightens me to think of having such
things in the house

Does it said Octavia Thats queer

And she looked puzzled for a moment again

Then she glanced down at her rings

I nearly always wear these she remarked Father gave them to me He
gave me one each birthday for three years He says diamonds are an
investment anyway and I might as well have them These touching the
earrings and clasp were given to my mother when she was on the stage
A lot of people clubbed together and bought them for her She was a
great favorite

Miss Belinda made another clutch at the handle of the teapot

Your mother she exclaimed faintly On thedid you say on the

Stage answered Octavia San Francisco Father married her there She
was awfully pretty I dont remember her She died when I was born She
was only nineteen

The utter calmness and freedom from embarrassment with which these
announcements were made almost shook Miss Belindas faith in her own
identity Strange to say until this moment she had scarcely given a
thought to her brothers wife and to find herself sitting in her own
genteel little parlor behind her own teaservice with her hand upon her
own teapot hearing that this wife had been a young person who had been
a great favorite upon the stage in a region peopled as she had been
led to suppose by golddiggers and escaped convicts was almost too much
for her to support herself under But she did support herself bravely
when she had time to rally

Help yourself to some fowl my dear she said hospitably even though
very faintly indeed and take a muffin

Octavia did so her oversplendid hands flashing in the light as she
moved them

American girls always have more things than English girls she
observed with admirable coolness They dress more I have been told so
by girls who have been in Europe And I have more things than most
American girls Father had more money than most people that was one
reason and he spoiled me I suppose He had no one else to give things
to and he said I should have every thing I took a fancy to He often
laughed at me for buying things but he never said I shouldnt buy them

He was always generous sighed Miss Belinda Poor dear Martin

Octavia scarcely entered into the spirit of this mournful sympathy She
was fond of her father but her recollections of him were not pathetic or
sentimental

He took me with him wherever he went she proceeded And we had a
teacher from the States who travelled with us sometimes He never sent
me away from him I wouldnt have gone if he had wanted to send meand
he didnt want to she added with a satisfied little laugh




CHAPTER III

LARGENTVILLE


Miss Belinda sat looking at her niece with a sense of being at once
stunned and fascinated To see a creature so young so pretty so
luxuriously splendid and at the same time so simply and completely at
ease with herself and her surroundings was a revelation quite beyond her
comprehension The bestbred and nicest girls Slowbridge could produce
were apt to look a trifle conscious and timid when they found themselves
attired in the white muslin and floral decorations but this slender
creature sat in her gorgeous attire her train flowing over the modest
carpet her rings flashing her earpendants twinkling apparently
entirely oblivious of or indifferent to the fact that all her
belongings were sufficiently out of place to be startling beyond measure

Her chief characteristic however seemed to be her excessive frankness
She did not hesitate at all to make the most remarkable statements
concerning her own and her fathers past career She made them too as
if there was nothing unusual about them Twice in her childhood a
luckless speculation had left her father penniless and once he had taken
her to a Californian golddiggers camp where she had been the only
female member of the somewhat reckless community

But they were pretty goodnatured and made a pet of me she said
and we did not stay very long Father had a stroke of luck and we
went away I was sorry when we had to go and so were the men They made
me a present of a set of jewelry made out of the gold they had got
themselves There is a breastpin like a breastplate and a necklace like
a dogcollar the bracelets tire my arms and the earrings pull my ears
but I wear them sometimesgold girdle and all

Did I inquired Miss Belinda timidly did I understand you to say my
dear that your fathers business was in some way connected with
silvermining

It is silvermining was the response He owns some mines you
know

Owns said Miss Belinda much fluttered owns some silvermines He
must be a very rich mana very rich man I declare it quite takes my
breath away

Oh he is rich said Octavia awfully rich sometimes And then again
he isnt Shares go up you know and then they go down and you dont
seem to have any thing But father generally comes out right because he
is lucky and knows how to manage

Butbut how uncertain gasped Miss Belinda I should be perfectly
miserable Poor dear Mar

Oh no you wouldnt said Octavia youd get used to it and wouldnt
mind much particularly if you were lucky as father is There is every
thing in being lucky and knowing how to manage When we first went to
Bloody Gulch

My dear cried Miss Belinda aghast II beg of you

Octavia stopped short she gazed at Miss Belinda in bewilderment as she
had done several times before

Is any thing the matter she inquired placidly

My dear love explained Miss Belinda innocently determined at least to
do her duty it is not customary inin Slowbridgein fact I think I
may say in Englandto use suchsuch exceedinglyI dont want to wound
your feelings my dearbut such exceedingly strong expressions I
refer my dear to the one which began with a B It is really considered
profane as well as dreadful beyond measure

The one which began with a B repeated Octavia still staring at her
That is the name of a place but I didnt name it you know It was
called that in the first place because a party of men were surprised
and murdered there while they were asleep in their camp at night It
isnt a very nice name of course but Im not responsible for it and
besides now the place is growing they are going to call it Athens or
Magnolia Vale They tried LArgentville for a while but people would
call it Lodginville and nobody liked it

I trust you never lived there said Miss Belinda I beg your pardon
for being so horrified but I really could not refrain from starting when
you spoke and I cannot help hoping you never lived there

I live there now when I am at home Octavia replied The mines are
there and father has built a house and had the furniture brought on
from New York

Miss Belinda tried not to shudder but almost failed

Wont you take another muffin my love she said with a sigh Do take
another muffin

No thank you answered Octavia and it must be confessed that she
looked a little bored as she leaned back in her chair and glanced down
at the train of her dress It seemed to her that her simplest statement
or remark created a sensation

Having at last risen from the teatable she wandered to the window and
stood there looking out at Miss Belindas flowergarden It was quite a
pretty flowergarden and a goodsized one considering the dimensions of
the house There were an oval grassplot divers gravel paths heart and
diamond shaped beds aglow with brilliant annuals a great many
rosebushes several laburnums and lilacs and a trim hedge of holly
surrounding it

I think I should like to go out and walk around there remarked
Octavia smothering a little yawn behind her hand Suppose we goif you
dont care

Certainly my dear assented Miss Belinda But perhaps with a
delicately dubious glance at her attire you would like to make some
little alteration in your dressto put something a littledark over
it

Octavia glanced down also

Oh no she replied it will do well enough I will throw a scarf over
my head though not because I need it unblushingly but because I
have a lace one that is very becoming

She went up to her room for the article in question and in three minutes
was down again When she first caught sight of her Miss Belinda found
herself obliged to clear her throat quite suddenly What Slowbridge would
think of seeing such a toilet in her front garden upon an ordinary
occasion she could not imagine The scarf truly was becoming It was a
long affair of rich white lace and was thrown over the girls head
wound around her throat and the ends tossed over her shoulders with the
most picturesque air of carelessness in the world

You look quite like a bride my dear Octavia said Miss Belinda We
are scarcely used to such things in Slowbridge

But Octavia only laughed a little

I am going to get some pink roses and fasten the ends with them when
we get into the garden she said

She stopped for this purpose at the first rosebush they reached She
gathered half a dozen slenderstemmed heavyheaded buds and having
fastened the lace with some was carelessly placing the rest at her
waist when Miss Belinda started violently




CHAPTER IV

LADY THEOBALD


Oh dear she exclaimed nervously there is Lady Theobald

Lady Theobald having been making calls of state was returning home
rather later than usual when in driving up High Street her eye fell
upon Miss Bassetts garden She put up her eyeglasses and gazed through
them severely then she issued a mandate to her coachman

Dobson she said drive more slowly

She could not believe the evidence of her own eyeglasses In Miss
Bassetts garden she saw a tall girl dressed as she put it like an
actress her delicate dress trailing upon the grass a white lace scarf
about her head and shoulders roses in that scarf roses at her waist

Good heavens she exclaimed is Belinda Bassett giving a party
without so much as mentioning it to me

Then she issued another mandate

Dobson she said drive faster and drive me to Miss Bassetts

Miss Belinda came out to the gate to meet her quaking inwardly Octavia
simply turned slightly where she stood and looked at her ladyship
without any pretence of concealing her curiosity

Lady Theobald bent forward in her landau

Belinda she said how do you do I did not know you intended to
introduce gardenparties into Slowbridge

Dear Lady Theobaldbegan Miss Belinda

Who is that young person demanded her ladyship

She is poor dear Martins daughter answered Miss Belinda She arrived
todayfrom Nevada wherewhere it appears Martin has been very
fortunate and owns a great many silvermines

A great many silvermines cried Lady Theobald Are you mad Belinda
Bassett I am ashamed of you At your time of life too

Miss Belinda almost shed tears

She said some silvermines I am sure she faltered for I remember
how astonished and bewildered I was The fact is that she is such a very
singular girl and has told me so many wonderful things in the
strangest cool way that I am quite uncertain of myself Murderers and
golddiggers and silvermines and camps full of men without women
making presents of gold girdles and dogcollars and earrings that drag
your ears down It is enough to upset any one

I should think so responded her ladyship Open the carriagedoor
Belinda and let me get out

She felt that this matter must be inquired into at once and not allowed
to go too far She had ruled Slowbridge too long to allow such
innovations to remain uninvestigated She would not be likely to be
upset at least She descended from her landau with her most rigorous
air Her stout rich black moireantique gown rustled severely the
yellow ostrich feather in her bonnet waved majestically Being a
brunette and Lady Theobald she wore yellow As she tramped up the
gravel walk she held up her dress with both hands as an example to
vulgar and reckless young people who wore trains and left them to
take care of themselves Octavia was arranging afresh the bunch of
longstemmed swaying buds at her waist and she was giving all her
attention to her task when her visitor first addressed her

How do you do remarked her ladyship in a fine deep voice

Miss Belinda followed her meekly

Octavia she explained this is Lady Theobald whom you will be very
glad to know She knew your father

Yes returned my lady years ago He has had time to improve since
then How do you do

Octavias limpid eyes rested serenely upon her

How do you do she said rather indifferently

You are from Nevada asked Lady Theobald

Yes

It is not long since you left there

Octavia smiled faintly

Do I look like that she inquired

Like what said my lady

As if I had not long lived in a civilized place I dare say I do
because it is true that I havent

You dont look like an English girl remarked her ladyship

Octavia smiled again She looked at the yellow feather and stout moire
antique dress but quite as if by accident and without any mental
deduction then she glanced at the rosebuds in her hand

I suppose I ought to be sorry for that she observed I dare say I
shall be in timewhen I have been longer away from Nevada

I must confess admitted her ladyship and evidently without the
least regret or embarrassment I must confess that I dont know where
Nevada is

It isnt in Europe replied Octavia with a soft light laugh You
know that dont you

The words themselves sounded to Lady Theobald like the most outrageous
impudence but when she looked at the pretty lovelockshaded face she
was staggered the look it wore was such a very innocent and undisturbed
one At the moment the only solution to be reached seemed to be that
this was the style of young people in Nevada and that it was ignorance
and not insolence she had to do battle withwhich indeed was
partially true

I have not had any occasion to inquire where it is situated so far
she responded firmly It is not so necessary for English people to know
America as it is for Americans to know England

Isnt it said Octavia without any great show of interest Why not

Forfor a great many reasons it would be fatiguing to explain she
answered courageously How is your father

He is very seasick now was the smiling answerdeadly seasick He
has been out just twentyfour hours

Out What does that mean

Out on the Atlantic He was called back suddenly and obliged to leave
me That is why I came here alone

Pray do come into the parlor and sit down dear Lady Theobald
ventured Miss Belinda Octavia

Dont you think it is nicer out here said Octavia

My dear answered Miss Belinda Lady TheobaldShe was really quite
shocked

Ah interposed Octavia I only thought it was cooler

She preceded them without seeming to be at all conscious that she was
taking the lead

You had better pick up your dress Miss Octavia said Lady Theobald
rather acidly

The girl glanced over her shoulder at the length of train sweeping the
path but she made no movement toward picking it up

It is too much trouble and one has to duck down so she said It is
bad enough to have to keep doing it when one is on the street Besides
they would never wear out if one took too much care of them

When they went into the parlor and sat down Lady Theobald made
excellent use of her time and managed to hear again all that had tried
and bewildered Miss Belinda She had no hesitation in asking questions
boldly she considered it her privilege to do so she had catechised
Slowbridge for forty years and meant to maintain her rights until Time
played her the knaves trick of disabling her

In half an hour she had heard about the silvermines the golddiggers
and LArgentville she knew that Martin Bassett was a millionnaire if
the news he had heard had not left him penniless that he would return to
England and visit Slowbridge as soon as his affairs were settled The
precarious condition of his finances did not seem to cause Octavia much
concern She had asked no questions when he went away and seemed quite
at ease regarding the future

People will always lend him money and then he is lucky with it she
said

She bore the catechising very well Her replies were frequently rather
trying to her interlocutor but she never seemed troubled or ashamed of
any thing she had to say and she wore from first to last that
inscrutably innocent and indifferent little air

She did not even show confusion when Lady Theobald on going away made
her farewell comment

You are a very fortunate girl to own such jewels she said glancing
critically at the diamonds in her ears but if you take my advice my
dear you will put them away and save them until you are a married
woman It is not customary on this side of the water for young girls to
wear such thingsparticularly on ordinary occasions People will think
you are odd

It is not exactly customary in America replied Octavia with her
undisturbed smile There are not many girls who have such things
Perhaps they would wear them if they had them I dont care a very great
deal about them but I mean to wear them

Lady Theobald went away in a dudgeon

You will have to exercise your authority Belinda and make her put
them away she said to Miss Bassett It is absurdbesides being
atrocious

Make her faltered Miss Bassett

Yes make herthough I see you will have your hands full I never
heard such romancing stories in my life It is just what one might expect
from your brother Martin

When Miss Bassett returned Octavia was standing before the window
watching the carriage drive away and playing absently with one of her
earrings as she did so

What an old fright she is was her first guileless remark

Miss Belinda quite bridled

My dear she said with dignity no one in Slowbridge would think of
applying such a phrase to Lady Theobald

Octavia turned around and looked at her

But dont you think she is one she exclaimed Perhaps I oughtnt to
have said it but you know we havent any thing as bad as that even out
in Nevadareally

My dear said Miss Belinda different countries contain different
people and in Slowbridge we have our standardsher best cap
trembling a little with her repressed excitement

But Octavia did not appear overwhelmed by the existence of the standards
in question She turned to the window again

Well anyway she said I think it was pretty cool in her to order me
to take off my diamonds and save them until I was married How does she
know whether I mean to be married or not I dont know that I care
about it




CHAPTER V

LUCIA


In this manner Slowbridge received the shock which shook it to
its foundations and it was a shock from which it did not recover for
some time Before ten oclock the next morning everybody knew of the
arrival of Martin Bassetts daughter

The very boardingschool Miss Pilchers select seminary for young
ladies combining the comforts of a home as the circular said
with all the advantages of genteel education was on fire with it
highly colored versions of the stories told being circulated from
the first class downward even taking the form of an Indian princess
tattooed blue and with difficulty restrained from indulging in
warwhoopswhich last feature so alarmed little Miss Bigbee aged
seven that she retired in fear and trembling and shed tears under the
bedclothes her terror and anguish being much increased by the stirring
recitals of scalpingstories by pretty Miss Phipps of the first
classa young person who possessed a vivid imagination and delighted in
romances of a tragic turn

I have not the slightest doubt said Miss Phipps that when she is at
home she lives in a wampum

What is a wampum inquired one of her admiring audience

A tent replied Miss Phipps with some impatience I should
think any goose would know that It is a kind of tent hung with
scalps andandmoccasins andlariatsand things of that sort

I dont believe that is the right name for it put in Miss Smith who
was a pert member of the third class

Ah commented Miss Phipps that was Miss Smith who spoke of course
We may always expect information from Miss Smith I trust that I may be
allowed to say that I think I have a brother

He doesnt know much about it if he calls a wigwam a wampum
interposed Miss Smith with still greater pertness I have a brother who
knows better than that if I am only in the third class For a moment
Miss Phipps appeared to be meditating Perhaps she was a trifle
discomfited but she recovered herself after a brief pause and returned
to the charge

Well she remarked perhaps it is a wigwam Who cares if it is And
at any rate whatever it is I havent the slightest doubt that she
lives in one

This comparatively tame version was however entirely discarded when the
diamonds and silvermines began to figure more largely in the reports
Certainly pretty overdressed jewelbedecked Octavia gave Slowbridge
abundant cause for excitement

After leaving her Lady Theobald drove home to Oldclough Hall rather
out of humor She had been rather out of humor for some time having
never quite recovered from her anger at the daring of that cheerful
builder of mills Mr John Burmistone Mr Burmistone had been one
innovation and Octavia Bassett was another She had not been able to
manage Mr Burmistone and she was not at all sure that she had managed
Octavia Bassett

She entered the diningroom with an ominous frown on her forehead

At the end of the table opposite her own seat was a vacant chair and
her frown deepened when she saw it

Where is Miss Gaston she demanded of the servant

Before the man had time to reply the door opened and a girl came in
hurriedly with a somewhat frightened air

I beg pardon grandmamma dear she said going to her seat quickly I
did not know you had come home

We have a dinnerhour announced her ladyship and I do not
disregard it

I am very sorry faltered the culprit

That is enough Lucia interrupted Lady Theobald and Lucia dropped her
eyes and began to eat her soup with nervous haste In fact she was glad
to escape so easily

She was a very pretty creature with brown eyes a soft white skin and
a slight figure with a reedlike grace A great quantity of brown hair
was twisted into an ugly coil on the top of her delicate little head
and she wore an ugly muslin gown of Miss Chickies make For some time
the meal progressed in dead silence but at length Lucia ventured to
raise her eyes

I have been walking in Slowbridge grandmamma she said and I met Mr
Burmistone who told me that Miss Bassett has a visitora young lady
from America

Lady Theobald laid her knife and fork down deliberately

Mr Burmistone she said Did I understand you to say that you stopped
on the roadside to converse with Mr Burmistone

Lucia colored up to her delicate eyebrows and above them

I was trying to reach a flower growing on the bank she said and he
was so kind as to stop to get it for me I did not know he was near at
first And then he inquired how you wereand told me he had just heard
about the young lady

Naturally remarked her ladyship sardonically It is as I anticipated
it would be We shall find Mr Burmistone at our elbows upon all
occasions And he will not allow himself to be easily driven away He is
as determined as persons of his class usually are

O grandmamma protested Lucia with innocent fervor I really do not
think he islike that at all I could not help thinking he was very
gentlemanly and kind He is so much interested in your school and so
anxious that it should prosper

May I ask inquired Lady Theobald how long a time this generous
expression of his sentiments occupied Was this the reason of your
forgetting the dinnerhour

We did notsaid Lucia guiltily it did not take many minutes II do
not think that made me late

Lady Theobald dismissed this paltry excuse with one remarka remark
made in the deep tones referred to once before

I should scarcely have expected she observed that a granddaughter of
mine would have spent half an hour conversing on the public road with the
proprietor of Slowbridge Mills

O grandmamma exclaimed Lucia the tears rising in her eyes it was
not half an hour

I should scarcely have expected replied her ladyship that a
granddaughter of mine would have spent five minutes conversing on the
public road with the proprietor of Slowbridge Mills

To this assault there seemed to be no reply to make Lady Theobald had
her granddaughter under excellent control Under her rigorous rule the
girlwhose mother had died at her birthhad been brought up At
nineteen she was simple sensitive shy She had been permitted to have
no companions and the greatest excitements of her life had been the
Slowbridge teaparties Of the late Sir Gilbert Theobald the less said
the better He had spent very little of his married life at Oldclough
Hall and upon his death his widow had found herself possessed of a
substantial gloomy mansion an exalted position in Slowbridge society
and a small marriagesettlement upon which she might make all the
efforts she chose to sustain her state So Lucia wore her dresses a much
longer time than any other Slowbridge young lady she was obliged to mend
her little gloves again and again and her hats were retrimmed so often
that even Slowbridge thought them oldfashioned But she was too simple
and sweetnatured to be much troubled and indeed thought very little
about the matter She was only troubled when Lady Theobald scolded her
which was by no means infrequently Perhaps the straits to which at
times her ladyship was put to maintain her dignity imbittered her
somewhat

Lucia is neither a Theobald nor a Barold she had been heard to say
once and she had said it with much rigor

A subject of much conversation in private circles had been Lucias
future It had been discussed in whispers since her seventeenth year but
no one had seemed to approach any solution of the difficulty Upon the
subject of her plans for her granddaughter Lady Theobald had preserved
stern silence Once and once only she had allowed herself to be
betrayed into the expression of a sentiment connected with the matter

If Miss Lucia marriesa matron of reckless proclivities had remarked

Lady Theobald turned upon her slowly and majestically

If Miss Gaston marries she repeated Does it seem likely that Miss
Gaston will not marry

This settled the matter finally Lucia was to be married when Lady
Theobald thought fit So far however she had not thought fit indeed
there had been nobody for Lucia to marrynobody whom her grandmother
would have allowed her to marry at least There were very few young men
in Slowbridge and the very few were scarcely eligible according to Lady
Theobalds standard andif such a thing should be mentionedto
Lucias if she had known she had one which she certainly did not




CHAPTER VI

ACCIDENTAL


When dinner was over Lady Theobald rose and proceeded to the
drawingroom Lucia following in her wake From her very babyhood Lucia
had disliked the drawingroom which was an imposing apartment of great
length and height containing much massive furniture upholstered in
faded blue satin All the girls evenings since her fifth year had been
spent sitting opposite her grandmother in one of the straightest of the
blue chairs all the most scathing reproofs she had received had been
administered to her at such times She had a secret theory indeed that
all unpleasant things occurred in the drawingroom after dinner

Just as they had seated themselves and Lady Theobald was on the point of
drawing toward her the little basket containing the gray woollen mittens
she made a duty of employing herself by knitting each evening Dobson
the coachman in his character of footman threw open the door and
announced a visitor

Capt Barold

Lady Theobald dropped her gray mitten the steel needles falling upon the
table with a clink She rose to her feet at once and met halfway the
young man who had entered

My dear Francis she remarked I am exceedingly glad to see you at
last with a slight emphasis upon the at last

Thaanks said Capt Barold rather languidly Youre very good Im
sure

Then he glanced at Lucia and Lady Theobald addressed her

Lucia she said this is Francis Barold who is your cousin

Capt Barold shook hands feebly

I have been trying to find out whether it is third or fourth he said

It is third said my lady

Lucia had never seen her display such cordiality to anybody But Capt
Francis Barold did not seem much impressed by it It struck Lucia that he
would not be likely to be impressed by any thing He seated himself near
her grandmothers chair and proceeded to explain his presence on the
spot without exhibiting much interest even in his own relation of facts

I promised the Rathburns that I would spend a week at their place and
Slowbridge was on the way so it occurred to me I would drop off in
passing The Rathburns place Broadoaks is about ten miles farther on
not far you see

Then said Lady Theobald I am to understand that your visit is
accidental

Capt Barold was not embarrassed He did not attempt to avoid her
ladyships rather stern eye as he made his cool reply

Well yes he said I beg pardon but it is accidental rather

Lucia gave him a pretty frightened look as if she felt that after such
an audacious confession something very serious must happen but nothing
serious happened at all Singularly enough it was Lady Theobald herself
who looked ill at ease and as though she had not been prepared for such
a contingency

During the whole of the evening in fact it was always Lady Theobald
who was placed at a disadvantage Lucia discovered She could hardly
realize the fact at first but before an hour had passed its truth was
forced upon her

Capt Barold was a very strikinglooking man upon the whole He was
large gracefully built and fair his eyes were gray and noticeable for
the coldness of their expression his features regular and aquiline his
movements leisurely

As he conversed with her grandmother Lucia wondered at him privately It
seemed to her innocent mind that he had been everywhere and seen every
thing and everybody without caring for or enjoying his privileges The
truth was that he had seen and experienced a great deal too much As an
only child the heir to a large property and heir prospective to one of
the oldest titles in the country he had exhausted life early He saw in
Lady Theobald not the imposing head and social front of Slowbridge
social life the power who rewarded with approval and punished with a
frown but a tiresome pretentious old woman whom his mother had asked
him for some feminine reason to visit She feels she has a claim upon
us Francis she had said appealingly

Well he had remarked that is rather deuced cool isnt it We have
people enough on our hands without cultivating Slowbridge you know

His mother sighed faintly

It is true we have a great many people to consider but I wish you would
do it my dear

She did not say any thing at all about Lucia above all she did not
mention that a year ago she herself had spent two or three days at
Slowbridge and had been charmed beyond measure by the girls innocent
freshness and that she had said rather absently to Lady Theobald

What a charming wife Lucia would make for a man to whom gentleness and a
yielding disposition were necessary We do not find such girls in society
nowadays my dear Lady Theobald It is very difficult of late years to
find a girl who is not spoken of as fast and who is not disposed to
take the reins in her own hands Our young men are flattered and courted
until they become a little dictatorial and our girls are spoiled at
home And the result is a great deal of domestic unhappiness
afterwardand even a great deal of scandal which is dreadful to
contemplate I cannot help feeling the greatest anxiety in secret
concerning Francis Young men so seldom consider these matters until it
is too late

Girls are not trained as they were in my young days or even in yours
said Lady Theobald They are allowed too much liberty Lucia has been
brought up immediately under my own eye

I feel that it is fortunate remarked Mrs Barold quite incidentally
that Francis need not make a point of money

For a few moments Lady Theobald did not respond but afterward in the
course of the conversation which followed she made an observation which
was of course purely incidental

If Lucia makes a marriage which pleases her greatuncle old Mr Dugald
Binnie of Glasgow she will be a very fortunate girl He has intimated
in his eccentric fashion that his immense fortune will either be hers
or will be spent in building charitable asylums of various kinds He is a
remarkable and singular man

When Capt Barold had entered his distinguished relatives drawingroom
he had not regarded his third cousin with a very great deal of interest
He had seen too many beauties in his thirty years to be greatly moved by
the sight of one and here was only a girl who had soft eyes and looked
young for her age and who wore an ugly muslin gown that most girls
could not have carried off at all

You have spent the greater part of your life in Slowbridge he
condescended to say in the course of the evening

I have lived here always Lucia answered I have never been away more
than a week at a time

Ah interrogatively I hope you have not found it dull

No smiling a little Not very You see I have known nothing gayer

There is society enough of a harmless kind here spoke up Lady Theobald
virtuously I do not approve of a round of gayeties for young people it
unfits them for the duties of life

But Capt Barold was not as favorably impressed by these remarks as might
have been anticipated

What an old fool she is was his polite inward comment And he resolved
at once to make his visit as brief as possible and not to be induced to
run down again during his stay at Broadoaks He did not even take the
trouble to appear to enjoy his evening From his earliest infancy he had
always found it easier to please himself than to please other people In
fact the world had devoted itself to endeavoring to please him and win
histoleration we may say instead of admiration since it could not
hope for the latter At home he had been adored rapturously by a large
circle of affectionate male and female relatives at school his tutors
had been singularly indulgent of his faults and admiring of his talents
even among his fellowpupils he had been a sort of autocrat

Why not indeed with such birthrights and such prospects When he had
entered society he had met with even more amiable treatment from
affectionate mothers from innocent daughters from cordial paternal
parents who voted him an exceedingly fine fellow Why should he bore
himself by taking the trouble to seem pleased by a stupid evening with an
old grenadier in petticoats and a badly dressed country girl

Lucia was very glad when in answer to a timidly appealing glance Lady
Theobald said

It is halfpast ten You may wish us goodnight Lucia

Lucia obeyed as if she had been halfpast ten herself instead of nearly
twenty and Barold was not long in following her example

Dobson led him to a stately chamber at the top of the staircase and left
him there The captain chose the largest and most luxurious chair sat
down in it and lighted a cigar at his leisure

Confoundedly stupid hole he said with a refined vigor one would
scarcely have expected from an individual of his birth and breeding I
shall leave tomorrow of course What was my mother thinking of Stupid
business from first to last




CHAPTER VII

I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF SLOWBRIDGE


When he announced at breakfast his intention of taking his departure on
the midday train Lucia wondered again what would happen and again to
her relief Lady Theobald was astonishingly lenient

As your friends expect you of course we cannot overrule them she
said We will however hope to see something of you during your stay at
Broadoaks It will be very easy for you to run down and give us a few
hours now and then

Thaanks said Capt Barold

He was decently civil if not enthusiastic during the few remaining
hours of his stay He sauntered through the grounds with Lucia who took
charge of him in obedience to her grandmothers wish He did not find her
particularly troublesome when she was away from her ladyships side When
she came out to him in her simple cotton gown and straw hat it occurred
to him that she was much prettier than he had thought her at first For
economical reasons she had made the little morningdress herself without
the slightest regard for the designs of Miss Chickie and as it was not
trimmed at all and had only a blackvelvet ribbon at the waist there
was nothing to place her charming figure at a disadvantage It could not
be said that her shyness and simplicity delighted Capt Barold but at
least they did not displease him and this was really as much as could
be expected

She does not expect a fellow to exert himself at all events was his
inward comment and he did not exert himself

But when on the point of taking his departure he went so far as to make
a very gracious remark to her

I hope we shall have the pleasure of seeing you in London for a season
before very long he said my mother will have great pleasure in taking
charge of you if Lady Theobald cannot be induced to leave Slowbridge

Lucia never goes from home alone said Lady Theobald but I should
certainly be obliged to call upon your mother for her good offices in
the case of our spending a season in London I am too old a woman to
alter my mode of life altogether

In obedience to her ladyships orders the venerable landau was brought
to the door and the two ladies drove to the station with him

It was during this drive that a very curious incident occurredan
incident to which perhaps this story owes its existence since if it
had not taken place there might very possibly have been no events of a
stirring nature to chronicle Just as Dobson drove rather slowly up the
part of High Street distinguished by the presence of Miss Belinda
Bassetts house Capt Barold suddenly appeared to be attracted by some
figure he discovered in the garden appertaining to that modest structure

By Jove he exclaimed in an undertone there is Miss Octavia

For the moment he was almost roused to a display of interest A faint
smile lighted his face and his cold handsome eyes slightly brightened

Lady Theobald sat bolt upright

That is Miss Bassetts niece from America she said Do I understand
you know her

Capt Barold turned to confront her evidently annoyed at having allowed
a surprise to get the better of him All expression died out of his face

I travelled with her from Framwich to Stamford he said I suppose we
should have reached Slowbridge together but that I dropped off at
Stamford to get a newspaper and the train left me behind

O grandmamma exclaimed Lucia who had turned to look how very pretty
she is

Miss Octavia certainly was amazingly so this morning She was standing by
a rosebush again and was dressed in a cashmere morningrobe of the
finest texture and the faintest pink it had a Watteau plait down the
back jabot of lace down the front and the close high frills of lace
around the throat which seemed to be a weakness with her Her hair was
dressed high upon her head and showed to advantage her little ears and
as much of her slim white neck as the frills did not conceal

But Lady Theobald did not share Lucias enthusiasm

She looks like an actress she said If the trees were painted canvas
and the roses artificial one might have some patience with her That
kind of thing is scarcely what we expect in Slowbridge

Then she turned to Barold

I had the pleasure of meeting her yesterday not long after she
arrived she said She had diamonds in her ears as big as peas and
rings to match Her manner is just what one might expect from a young
woman brought up among golddiggers and silverminers

It struck me as being a very unique and interesting manner said Capt
Barold It is chiefly noticeable for a sangfroid which might be
regarded as rather enviable She was good enough to tell me all about her
papa and the silvermines and I really found the conversation
entertaining

It is scarcely customary for English young women to confide in their
masculine travelling companions to such an extent remarked my lady
grimly

She did not confide in me at all said Barold Therein lay her
attraction One cannot submit to being confided in by a strange young
woman however charming This young ladys remarks were flavored solely
with an adorably cool candor She evidently did not desire to appeal to
any emotion whatever

And as he leaned back in his seat he still looked at the picturesque
figure which they had passed as if he would not have been sorry to see
it turn its head toward him

In fact it seemed that notwithstanding his usual good fortune Capt
Barold was doomed this morning to make remarks of a nature objectionable
to his revered relation On their way they passed Mr Burmistones mill
which was at work in all its vigor with a whir and buzz of machinery
and a slight odor of oil in its surrounding atmosphere

Ah said Mr Barold putting his single eyeglass into his eye and
scanning it after the manner of experts I did not think you had any
thing of that sort here Who put it up

The mans name replied Lady Theobald severely is Burmistone

Pretty good idea isnt it remarked Barold Good for the placeand
all that sort of thing

To my mind answered my lady it is the worst possible thing which
could have happened

Mr Francis Barold dropped his eyeglass dexterously and at once lapsed
into his normal conditionwhich was a condition by no means favorable
to argument

Think so he said slowly Pity isnt it under the circumstances

And really there was nothing at all for her ladyship to do but preserve a
lofty silence She had scarcely recovered herself when they reached the
station and it was necessary to say farewell as complacently as
possible

We will hope to see you again before many days she said with dignity
if not with warmth

Mr Francis Barold was silent for a second and a slightly reflective
expression flitted across his face

Thanks yes he said at last Certainly It is easy to come down and
I should like to see more of Slowbridge

When the train had puffed in and out of the station and Dobson was
driving down High Street again her ladyships feelings rather got the
better of her

If Belinda Bassett is a wise woman she remarked she will take my
advice and get rid of this young lady as soon as possible It appears to
me she continued with exalted piety that every welltrained English
girl has reason to thank her Maker that she was born in a civilized
land

Perhaps suggested Lucia softly Miss Octavia Bassett has had no one
to train her at all and it may be thatthat she even feels it deeply

The feathers in her ladyships bonnet trembled

She does not feel it at all she announced She is an
impertinentminx




CHAPTER VIII

SHARES LOOKING UP


There were others who echoed her ladyships words afterward though they
echoed them privately and with more caution than my lady felt necessary
It is certain that Miss Octavia Bassett did not improve as time
progressed and she had enlarged opportunities for studying the noble
example set before her by Slowbridge

On his arrival in New York Martin Bassett telegraphed to his daughter
and sister per Atlantic cable informing them that he might be detained
a couple of months and bidding them to be of good cheer The arrival of
the message in its official envelope so alarmed Miss Belinda that she
was supported by Mary Anne while it was read to her by Octavia who
received it without any surprise whatever For some time after its
completion Slowbridge had privately disbelieved in the Atlantic cable
and until this occasion had certainly disbelieved in the existence of
people who received messages through it In fact on first finding that
she was the recipient of such a message Miss Belinda had made immediate
preparations for fainting quietly away being fully convinced that a
shipwreck had occurred which had resulted in her brothers death and
that his executors had chosen this delicate method of breaking the news

A message by Atlantic cable she had gasped Dontdont read it my
love Llet some one else do that Poorpoor child Trust in Providence
my love andand bear up Ah how I wish I had a stronger mind and
could be of more service to you

Its a message from father said Octavia Nothing is the matter Hes
all right He got in on Saturday

Ah panted Miss Belinda Are you quite sure my dearare you quite
sure

Thats what he says Listen

Got in Saturday Piper met me Shares looking up May be kept here two
months Will write Keep up your spirits MARTIN BASSETT

Thank Heaven sighed Miss Belinda Thank Heaven

Why said Octavia

Why echoed Miss Belinda Ah my dear if you knew how terrified I
was I felt sure that something had happened A cable message my dear
I never received a telegram in my life before and to receive a cable
message was really a shock

Well I dont see why said Octavia It seems to me it is pretty much
like any other message

Miss Belinda regarded her timidly

Does your papa often send them she inquired Surely it must be
expensive

I dont suppose its cheap Octavia replied but it saves time and
worry I should have had to wait twelve days for a letter

Very true said Miss Belinda but

She broke off with rather a distressed shake of the head Her simple
ideas of economy and quiet living were frequently upset in these times
She had begun to regard her niece with a slight feeling of awe and yet
Octavia had not been doing any thing at all remarkable in her own eyes
and considered her life pretty dull

If the elder Miss Bassett her parents and grandparents had not been so
thoroughly well known and so universally respected if their social
position had not been so firmly established and their quiet lives not
quite so highly respectablethere is an awful possibility that
Slowbridge might even have gone so far as not to ask Octavia out to tea
at all But even Lady Theobald felt that it would not do to slight
Belinda Bassetts niece and guest To omit the customary state teas
would have been to crush innocent Miss Belinda at a blow and place
herthrough the medium of this young lady who alone deserved
condemnationbeyond the pale of all social law

It is only to be regretted said her ladyship that Belinda Bassett
has not arranged things better Relatives of such an order are certainly
to be deplored

In secret Lucia felt much softhearted sympathy for both Miss Bassett and
her guest She could not help wondering how Miss Belinda became
responsible for the calamity which had fallen upon her It really did not
seem probable that she had been previously consulted as to the kind of
niece she desired or that she had in a distinct manner evinced a
preference for a niece of this description

Perhaps dear grandmamma the girl ventured it is because Miss
Octavia Bassett is so young that

May I ask inquired Lady Theobald in fell tones how old you are

I was nineteen inin December

Miss Octavia Bassett said her ladyship was nineteen last October
and it is now June I have not yet found it necessary to apologize for
you on the score of youth

But it was her ladyship who took the initiative and set an evening for
entertaining Miss Belinda and her niece in company with several other
ladies with the best bohea thin bread and butter plumcake and
various other delicacies

What do they do at such places asked Octavia Halfpast five is
pretty early

We spend some time at the teatable my dear explained Miss Belinda
And afterward wewe converse A few of us play whist I do not I feel
as if I were not clever enough and I get flurried too easily byby
differences of opinion

I should think it wasnt very exciting said Octavia I dont fancy
I ever went to an entertainment where they did nothing but drink tea
and talk

It is not our intention or desire to be exciting my dear Miss Belinda
replied with mild dignity And an improving conversation is frequently
most beneficial to the parties engaged in it

Im afraid Octavia observed that I never heard much improving
conversation

She was really no fonder of masculine society than the generality of
girls but she could not help wondering if there would be any young men
present and if indeed there were any young men in Slowbridge who might
possibly be produced upon festive occasions even though ordinarily kept
in the background She had not heard Miss Belinda mention any masculine
name so far but that of the curate of St Jamess and when she had
seen him pass the house she had not found his slim black figure and
faint ecclesiastic whiskers especially interesting

It must be confessed that Miss Belinda suffered many pangs of anxiety in
looking forward to her young kinswomans first appearance in society A
tea at Lady Theobalds house constituted formal presentation to the
Slowbridge world Each young lady within the pale of genteel society
having arrived at years of discretion on returning home from
boardingschool was invited to tea at Oldclough Hall During an entire
evening she was the subject of watchful criticism Her deportment was
remarked her accomplishments displayed she performed her last new
pieces upon the piano she was drawn into conversation by her hostess
and upon the timid modesty of her replies and the reverence of her
listening attitudes depended her future social status So it was very
natural indeed that Miss Belinda should be anxious

I would wear something rather quiet andand simple my dear Octavia
she said A white muslin perhaps with blue ribbons

Would you answered Octavia Then after appearing to reflect upon the
matter a few seconds Ive got one that would do if its warm enough
to wear it I bought it in New York but it came from Paris Ive never
worn it yet

It would be nicer than any thing else my love said Miss Belinda
delighted to find her difficulty so easily disposed of Nothing is so
charming in the dress of a young girl as pure simplicity Our Slowbridge
young ladies rarely wear any thing but white for evening Miss Chickie
assured me a few weeks ago that she had made fifteen whitemuslin
dresses all after one simple design of her own

I shouldnt think that was particularly nice myself remarked Octavia
impartially I should be glad one of the fifteen didnt belong to me I
should feel as if people might say when I came into a room Good
gracious theres another

The first was made for Miss Lucia Gaston who is Lady Theobalds niece
replied Miss Belinda mildly And there are few young ladies in
Slowbridge who would not emulate her example

Oh said Octavia I dare say she is very nice and all that but I
dont believe I should care to copy her dresses I think I should draw
the line there

But she said it without any illnature and sensitive as Miss Belinda
was upon the subject of her cherished ideals she could not take offence

When the eventful evening arrived there was excitement in more than one
establishment upon High Street and the streets in its vicinity The
stories of the diamonds the golddiggers and the silvermines had been
added to and embellished in the most ornate and startling manner It
was well known that only Lady Theobalds fine appreciation of Miss
Belinda Bassetts feelings had induced her to extend her hospitalities to
that ladys niece

I would prefer my dear said more than one discreet matron to her
daughter as they attired themselvesI would much prefer that you
would remain near me during the earlier part of the evening before we
know how this young lady may turn out Let your manner toward her be
kind but not familiar It is well to be upon the safe side

What precise line of conduct it was generally anticipated that this
golddigging and silvermining young person would adopt it would be
difficult to say it is sufficient that the general sentiments regarding
her were of a distrustful if not timorous nature

To Miss Bassett who felt all this in the very air she breathed the
girls innocence of the condition of affairs was even a little touching
With all her splendor she was not at all hard to please and had quite
awakened to an interest in the impending social event She seemed in good
spirits and talked more than was her custom giving Miss Belinda graphic
descriptions of various festal gatherings she had attended in New York
when she seemed to have been very gay indeed and to have worn very
beautiful dresses and also to have had rather more than her share of
partners The phrases she used and the dances she described were all
strange to Miss Belinda and tended to reducing her to a bewildered
condition in which she felt much timid amazement at the intrepidity of
the NewYork young ladies and no slight suspicion of the Germanas a
theatrical kind of dance involving extraordinary figures and an
extraordinary amount of attention from partners of the stronger sex

It must be admitted however that by this time notwithstanding the
various shocks she had received Miss Belinda had begun to discover in
her young guest divers good qualities which appealed to her
affectionate and susceptible old heart In the first place the girl
had no small affectations indeed if she had been less unaffected she
might have been less subject to severe comment She was goodnatured
and generous to extravagance Her manner toward Mary Anne never ceased
to arouse Miss Belinda to interest There was not any condescension
whatever in it and yet it could not be called a vulgarly familiar
manner it was rather an astonishingly simple manner somehow
suggestive of a subtile recognition of Mary Annes youth and illluck
in not having before her more lively prospects She gave Mary Anne
presents in the shape of articles of clothing at which Slowbridge
would have exclaimed in horror if the recipient had dared to wear them
but when Miss Belinda expressed her regret at these indiscretions
Octavia was quite willing to rectify her mistakes

Ah well she said I can give her some money and she can buy some
things for herself Which she proceeded to do and when under her
mistresss direction Mary Anne purchased a stout brown merino she took
quite an interest in her struggles at making it

I wouldnt make it so short in the waist and so full in the skirt if I
were you she said Theres no reason why it shouldnt fit you know
thereby winning the housemaidens undying adoration and adding much to
the shapeliness of the garment

I am sure she has a good heart Miss Belinda said to herself as the
days went by She is like Martin in that I dare say she finds me very
ignorant and silly I often see in her face that she is unable to
understand my feeling about things but she never seems to laugh at me
nor think of me unkindly And she is very very pretty though perhaps I
ought not to think of that at all




CHAPTER IX

WHITE MUSLIN


As the good little spinster was arraying herself on this particular
evening having laid upon the bed the greater portion of her modest
splendor she went to her wardrobe and took therefrom the scored bandbox
containing her best cap All the ladies of Slowbridge wore caps and all
being respectfully plagiarized from Lady Theobald without any reference
to age size complexion or demeanor the result was sometimes a little
trying Lady Theobalds headdresses were of a severe and bristling
order The lace of which they were composed was induced by some ingenious
device to form itself into aggressive quillings the bows seemed lined
with buckram the strings neither floated nor fluttered

To a majestic person the style is very appropriate Miss Belinda had
said to Octavia that very day but to one who is not so it is rather
trying Sometimes indeed I have almost wished that Miss Chickie would
vary a little more in her designs

Perhaps the sight of the various articles contained in two of the five
trunks had inspired these doubts in the dear old ladys breast it is
certain at least that as she took the best cap up a faint sigh
fluttered upon her lips

It is very large for a small person she said And I am not at all
sure that amber is becoming to me

And just at that moment there came a tap at the door which she knew was
from Octavia

She laid the cap back in some confusion at being surprised in a moment
of weakness

Come in my love she said

Octavia pushed the door open and came in She had not dressed yet and
had on her wrapper and slippers which were both of quilted gray silk
gayly embroidered with carnations But Miss Belinda had seen both wrapper
and slippers before and had become used to their sumptuousness what she
had not seen was the trifle the girl held in her hand See here she
said See what I have been making for you

She looked quite elated and laughed triumphantly

I did not know I could do it until I tried she said I had seen some
in New York and I had the lace by me And I have enough left to make
ruffles for your neck and wrists Its Mechlin

My dear exclaimed Miss Belinda My dear

Octavia laughed again

Dont you know what it is she said It isnt like a Slowbridge cap
but its a cap nevertheless They wear them like this in New York and I
think they are ever so much prettier

It was true that it was not like a Slowbridge cap and was also true that
it was prettier It was a delicate affair of softly quilled lace adorned
here and there with loops of pale satin ribbon

Let me try it on said Octavia advancing and in a minute she had done
so and turned Miss Bassett about to face herself in the glass There
she said Isnt that better thanwell than emulating Lady Theobald

It was so pretty and so becoming and Miss Belinda was so touched by the
girls innocent enjoyment that the tears came into her eyes

Mymy love she faltered it is so beautiful and so expensive
thatthough indeed I dont know how to thank youI am afraid I should
not dare to wear it

Oh answered Octavia thats nonsense you know Im sure theres no
reason why people shouldnt wear becoming things Besides I should be
awfully disappointed I didnt think I could make it and Im real proud
of it You dont know how becoming it is

Miss Belinda looked at her reflection and faltered It was becoming

My love she protested faintly real Mechlin There is really no such
lace in Slowbridge

All the better said Octavia cheerfully Im glad to hear that It
isnt one bit too nice for you

To Miss Belindas astonishment she drew a step nearer to her and gave
one of the satin loops a queer caressing little touch which actually
seemed to mean something And then suddenly the girl stooped with a
little laugh and gave her aunt a light kiss on her cheek

There she said You must take it from me for a present Ill go and
make the ruffles this minute and you must wear those too and let people
see how stylish you can be

And without giving Miss Bassett time to speak she ran out of the room
and left the dear old lady warmed to the heart tearful delighted
frightened

A coach from the Blue Lion had been ordered to present itself at a
quarter past five promptly and at the time specified it rattled up to
the door with much spiritwith so much spirit indeed that Miss
Belinda was a little alarmed

Dear dear she said I hope the driver will be able to control the
horse and will not allow him to go too fast One hears of such terrible
accidents

Then Mary Anne was sent to announce the arrival of the equipage to Miss
Octavia and having performed the errand came back beaming with smiles

Oh mum she exclaimed you never see nothin like her Her gownd is
evingly An lor how you do look yourself to be sure

Indeed the lace ruffles on her best black silk and the little cap on
her smooth hair had done a great deal for Miss Bassett and she had only
just been reproaching herself for her vanity in recognizing this fact
But Mary Annes words awakened a new train of thought

Isis Miss Octavias dress a showy one Mary Anne she inquired Dear
me I do hope it is not a showy dress

I never see nothin no eleganter mum said Mary Anne she wants
nothin but a veil to make a bride out of heran a becominer thing she
never has wore

They heard the soft sweep of skirts at that moment and Octavia came in

There she said stopping when she had reached the middle of the room
Is that simple enough Miss Belinda could only look at her helplessly
The white muslin was composed almost entirely of Valenciennes lace the
blue ribbons were embroidered with fielddaisies the air of delicate
elaborateness about the whole was something which her innocent mind could
not have believed possible in orthodox white and blue

I dont think I should call it exactly simple she said My love what
a quantity of lace

Octavia glanced down at her jabots and frills complacently

There is a good deal of it she remarked but then it is nice and
one can stand a good deal of nice Valenciennes on white They said Worth
made the dress I hope he did It cost enough The ribbon was embroidered
by hand I suppose And there is plenty of it cut up into these bows

There was no more to be said Miss Belinda led the way to the coach
which they entered under the admiring or critical eyes of several most
respectable families who had been lying in wait behind their
windowcurtains since they had been summoned there by the sound of
the wheels

As the vehicle rattled past the boardingschool all the young ladies in
the first class rushed to the window They were rewarded for their zeal
by a glimpse of a cloud of muslin and lace a charmingly dressed
yellowbrown head and a pretty face whose eyes favored them with a
frank stare of interest

She had diamonds in her ears cried Miss Phipps wildly excited I saw
them flash Ah how I should like to see her without her wraps I have no
doubt she is a perfect blaze




CHAPTER X

ANNOUNCING MR BAROLD


Lady Theobalds invited guests sat in the faded blue drawingroom
waiting Everybody had been unusually prompt perhaps because
everybody wished to be on the ground in time to see Miss Octavia
Bassett make her entrance

I should think it would be rather a trial even to such a girl as she is
said to be remarked one matron

It is but natural that she should feel that Lady Theobald will regard
her rather critically and that she should know that American manners
will hardly be the thing for a genteel and conservative English country
town

We saw her a few days ago said Lucia who chanced to hear this
speech and she is very pretty I think I never saw any one so very
pretty before

But in quite a theatrical way I think my dear the matron replied in
a tone of gentle correction

I have seen so very few theatrical people Lucia answered sweetly
that I scarcely know what the theatrical way is dear Mrs Burnham Her
dress was very beautiful and not like what we wear in Slowbridge but
she seemed to me to be very bright and pretty in a way quite new to me
and so just a little odd

I have heard that her dress is most extravagant and wasteful put in
Miss Pilcher whose educational position entitled her to the
condescending respect of her patronesses She has lace on her morning
gowns which

Miss Bassett and Miss Octavia Bassett announced Dobson throwing
open the door

Lady Theobald rose from her seat A slight rustle made itself heard
through the company as the ladies all turned toward the entrance and
after they had so turned there were evidences of a positive thrill
Before the eyes of all Belinda Bassett advanced with rich ruffles of
Mechlin at her neck and wrists with a delicate and distinctly novel cap
upon her head her niece following her with an unabashed face twenty
pounds worth of lace on her dress and unmistakable diamonds in her
little ears

There is not a shadow of timidity about her cried Mrs Burnham under
her breath This is actual boldness

But this was a very severe term to use notwithstanding that it was born
of righteous indignation It was not boldness at all it was only the
serenity of a young person who was quite unconscious that there was any
thing to fear in the rather unimposing party before her Octavia was
accustomed to entering rooms full of strangers She had spent several
years of her life in hotels where she had been stared out of countenance
by a few score new people every day She was even used to being in some
sort a young person of note It was nothing unusual for her to know that
she was being pointed out That pretty blonde she often heard it said
is Martin Bassetts daughter sharp fellow Bassettand lucky fellow
too more money than he can count

So she was not at all frightened when she walked in behind Miss Belinda
She glanced about her cheerfully and catching sight of Lucia smiled at
her as she advanced up the room The call of state Lady Theobald had made
with her granddaughter had been a very brief one but Octavia had taken
a decided fancy to Lucia and was glad to see her again

I am glad to see you Belinda said her ladyship shaking hands And
you also Miss Octavia

Thank you responded Octavia

You are very kind Miss Belinda murmured gratefully

I hope you are both well said Lady Theobald with majestic
condescension and in tones to be heard all over the room

Quite well thank you murmured Miss Belinda again Very well
indeed rather as if this fortunate state of affairs was the result of
her ladyships kind intervention with the fates

She felt terribly conscious of being the centre of observation and
rather overpowered by the novelty of her attire which was plainly
creating a sensation Octavia however who was far more looked at was
entirely oblivious of the painful prominence of her position She
remained standing in the middle of the room talking to Lucia who had
approached to greet her She was so much taller than Lucia that she
looked very tall indeed by contrast and also very wonderfully dressed
Lucias white muslin was one of Miss Chickies fifteen and was in a
genteel way very suggestive of Slowbridge Suspended from Octavias
waist by a long loop of the embroidered ribbon was a little round fan
of downy paleblue feathers and with this she played as she talked but
Lucia having nothing to play with could only stand with her little
hands hanging at her sides

I have never been to an afternoon tea like this before Octavia said
It is nothing like a kettledrum

I am not sure that I know what a kettledrum is Lucia answered They
have them in London I think but I have never been to London

They have them in New York said Octavia and they are a crowded sort
of afternoon parties where ladies go in carriagetoilet not evening
dress People are rushing in and out all the time

Lucia glanced around the room and smiled

That is very unlike this she remarked

Well said Octavia I should think that after all this might be
nicer

Which was very civil

Lucia glanced around againthis time rather stealthilyat Lady
Theobald Then she glanced back at Octavia

But it isnt she said in an undertone

Octavia began to laugh They were on a new and familiar footing from
that moment

I said it might she answered

She was not afraid any longer of finding the evening stupid If there
were no young men there was at least a young woman who was in sympathy
with her She said

I hope that I shall behave myself pretty well and do the things I am
expected to do

Oh said Lucia with a rather alarmed expression I hope so II am
afraid you would not be comfortable if you didnt

Octavia opened her eyes as she often did at Miss Belindas remarks and
then suddenly she began to laugh again

What would they do she said disrespectfully Would they turn me out
without giving me any tea

Lucia looked still more frightened

Dont let them see you laughing she said Theythey will say you
are giddy

Giddy replied Octavia I dont think there is any thing to make me
giddy here

If they say you are giddy said Lucia your fate will be sealed and
if you are to stay here it really will be better to try to please them
a little

Octavia reflected a moment

I dont mean to displease them she said unless they are very
easily displeased I suppose I dont think very much about what people
are saying of me I dont seem to notice

Will you come now and let me introduce Miss Egerton and her sister
suggested Lucia hurriedly Grandmamma is looking at us

In the innocence of her heart Octavia glanced at Lady Theobald and
saw that she was looking at them and with a disapproving air I
wonder what thats for she said to herself but she followed Lucia
across the room

She made the acquaintance of the Misses Egerton who seemed rather
fluttered and after the first exchange of civilities subsided into
monosyllables and attentive stares They were indeed very anxious to
hear Octavia converse but had not the courage to attempt to draw her
out unless a sudden query of Miss Lydias could be considered such an
attempt

Do you like England she asked

Is this England inquired Octavia

It is a part of England of course replied the young lady with calm
literalness

Then of course I like it very much said Octavia slightly waving her
fan and smiling

Miss Lydia Egerton and Miss Violet Egerton each regarded her in dubious
silence for a moment They did not think she looked as if she were
clever but the speech sounded to both as if she were and as if she
meant to be clever a little at their expense

Naturally after that they felt slightly uncomfortable and said less
than before and conversation lagged to such an extent that Octavia was
not sorry when tea was announced

And it so happened that tea was not the only thing announced The ladies
had all just risen from their seats with a gentle rustle and Lady
Theobald was moving forward to marshal her procession into the
diningroom when Dobson appeared at the door again

Mr Barold my lady he said and Mr Burmistone

Everybody glanced first at the door and then at Lady Theobald Mr
Francis Barold crossed the threshold followed by the tall
squareshouldered builder of mills who was a strong handsome man and
bore himself very well not seeming to mind at all the numerous eyes
fixed upon him

I did not know said Barold that we should find you had guests Beg
pardon Im sure and so does Burmistone whom I had the pleasure of
meeting at Broadoaks and who was good enough to invite me to return with
him Lady Theobald extended her hand to the gentleman specified

I am glad she said rigidly to see Mr Burmistone

Then she turned to Barold

This is very fortunate she announced We are just going in to take
tea in which I hope you will join us Lucia

Mr Francis Barold naturally turned as her ladyship uttered her
granddaughters name in a tone of command It may be supposed that his
first intention in turning was to look at Lucia but he had scarcely done
so when his attention was attracted by the figure nearest to herthe
figure of a young lady who was playing with a little blue fan and
smiling at him brilliantly and unmistakably

The next moment he was standing at Octavia Bassetts side looking rather
pleased and the blood of Slowbridge was congealing as the significance
of the situation was realized

One instant of breathlessof awfulsuspense and her ladyship
recovered herself

We will go in to tea she said May I ask you Mr Burmistone to
accompany Miss Pilcher




CHAPTER XI

A SLIGHT INDISCRETION


During the remainder of the evening Miss Belinda was a prey to
wretchedness and despair When she raised her eyes to her hostess she
met with a glance full of icy significance when she looked across the
teatable she saw Octavia seated next to Mr Francis Barold
monopolizing his attention and apparently in the very best possible
spirits It only made matters worse that Mr Francis Barold seemed to
find her remarks worthy of his attention He drank very little tea and
now and then appeared much interested and amused In fact he found Miss
Octavia even more entertaining than he had found her during their
journey She did not hesitate at all to tell him that she was delighted
to see him again at this particular juncture

You dont know how glad I was to see you come in she said

She met his rather startled glance with the most open candor as she
spoke

It is very civil of you to say so he said but you can hardly expect
me to believe it you know It is too good to be true

I thought it was too good to be true when the door opened she answered
cheerfully I should have been glad to see anybody almost

Well that he interposed isnt quite so civil

It is not quite so civil to

But there she checked herself and asked him a question with the most
naive seriousness

Are you a great friend of Lady Theobalds she said

No he answered I am a relative

Thats worse she remarked

It is he replied Very much worse

I asked you she proceeded with an entrancing little smile of
irreverent approval because I was going to say that my last speech was
not quite so civil to Lady Theobald

That is perfectly true he responded It wasnt civil to her at all

He was passing his time very comfortably and was really surprised to
feel that he was more interested in these simple audacities than he had
been in any conversation for some time Perhaps it was because his
companion was so wonderfully pretty but it is not unlikely that there
were also other reasons She looked him straight in the eyes she
comported herself after the manner of a young lady who was enjoying
herself and yet he felt vaguely that she might have enjoyed herself
quite as much with Burmistone and that it was probable that she would
not think a second time of him or of what she said to him

After tea when they returned to the drawingroom the opportunities
afforded for conversation were not numerous The piano was opened and
one after another of the young ladies were invited to exhibit their
prowess Upon its musical education Slowbridge prided itself Few
towns Miss Pilcher frequently remarked could be congratulated upon
the possession of such talent and such cultivation The Misses
Egerton played a duet the Misses Loftus sang Miss Abercrombie
executed a sonata with such effect as to melt Miss Pilcher to tears
and still Octavia had not been called upon There might have been a
reason for this or there might not but the moment arrived at length
when Lady Theobald moved toward Miss Belinda with evidently fell intent

Perhaps she said perhaps your niece Miss Octavia will favor us

Miss Belinda replied in a deprecatory and uncertain murmur

Iam not sure I really dont know PerhapsOctavia my dear

Octavia raised a smiling face

I dont play she said I never learned

You do not play exclaimed Lady Theobald You do not play at all

No answered Octavia Not a note And I think I am rather glad of it
because if I tried I should be sure to do it worse than other people I
would rather with unimpaired cheerfulness let some one else do it

There were a few seconds of dead silence A dozen people seated around
her had heard Miss Pilcher shuddered Miss Belinda looked down Mr
Francis Barold preserved an entirely unmoved countenance the general
impression being that he was very much shocked and concealed his disgust
with an effort

My dear said Lady Theobald with an air of much condescension and some
grave pity I should advise you to try to learn I can assure you that
you would find it a great source of pleasure

If you could assure me that my friends would find it a great source of
pleasure I might begin answered the mistaken young person still
cheerfully but I am afraid they wouldnt

It seemed that fate had marked her for disgrace In half an hour from
that time she capped the climax of her indiscretions

The evening being warm the French windows had been left open and in
passing one of them she stopped a moment to look out at the brightly
moonlit grounds

Barold who was with her paused too

Looks rather nice doesnt it he said

Yes she replied Suppose we go out on the terrace

He laughed in an amused fashion she did not understand

Suppose we do he said By Jove thats a good idea

He laughed as he followed her

What amuses you so she inquired

Oh he replied I am merely thinking of Lady Theobald

Well she commented I think its rather disrespectful in you to
laugh Isnt it a lovely night I didnt think you had such moonlight
nights in England What a night for a drive

Is that one of the things you do in Americadrive by moonlight

Yes Do you mean to say you dont do it in England

Not often Is it young ladies who drive by moonlight in America

Well you dont suppose they go alone do you quite ironically Of
course they have some one with them

Ah Their papas

No

Their mammas

No

Their governesses their uncles their aunts

No with a little smile

He smiled also

That is another good idea he said You have a great many nice ideas
in America

She was silent a moment or so swinging her fan slowly to and fro by its
ribbon and appearing to reflect

Does that mean she said at length that it wouldnt be considered
proper in England

I hope you wont hold me responsible for English fallacies was his
sole answer

I dont hold anybody responsible for them she returned with some
spirit I dont care one thing about them

That is fortunate he commented I am happy to say I dont either I
take the liberty of pleasing myself I find it pays best

Perhaps she said returning to the charge perhaps Lady Theobald will
think this is improper

He put his hand up and stroked his mustache lightly without replying

But it is not she added emphatically it is not

No he admitted with a touch of irony it is not

Are you any the worse for it she demanded

Well really I think notas yet he replied

Then we wont go in she said the smile returning to her lips again




CHAPTER XII

AN INVITATION


In the mean time Mr Burmistone was improving his opportunities within
doors He had listened to the music with the most serious attention and
on its conclusion he had turned to Mrs Burnham and made himself very
agreeable indeed At length however he arose and sauntered across the
room to a table at which Lucia Gaston chanced to be standing alone
having just been deserted by a young lady whose mamma had summoned her
She wore Mr Burmistone regretted to see as he advanced a troubled and
anxious expression the truth being that she had a moment before remarked
the exit of Miss Belindas niece and her companion It happened oddly
that Mr Burmistones first words touched upon the subject of her
thought He began quite abruptly with it

It seems to me he said that Miss Octavia Bassett

Lucia stopped him with a courage which surprised herself

Oh if you please she implored dont say any thing unkind about
her

Mr Burmistone looked down into her soft eyes with a good deal of
feeling

I was not going to say any thing unkind he answered Why should I

Everybody seems to find a reason for speaking severely of her Lucia
faltered I have heard so many unkind things tonight that I am quite
unhappy I am sureI am sure she is very candid and simple

Yes answered Mr Burmistone I am sure she is very candid and
simple

Why should we expect her to be exactly like ourselves Lucia went on
How can we be sure that our way is better than any other Why should
they be angry because her dress is so expensive and pretty Indeed I
only wish I had such a dress It is a thousand times prettier than any we
ever wear Look around the room and see if it is not And as to her not
having learned to play on the piano or to speak Frenchwhy should she
be obliged to do things she feels she would not be clever at I am not
clever and have been a sort of slave all my life and have been scolded
and blamed for what I could not help at all until I have felt as if I
must be a criminal How happy she must have been to be let alone

She had clasped her little hands and though she spoke in a low
voice was quite impassioned in an unconscious way Her brief girlish
life had not been a very happy one as may be easily imagined and a
glimpse of the liberty for which she had suffered roused her to a
sense of her own wrongs

We are all cut out after the same pattern she said We learn the same
things and wear the same dresses one might say What Lydia Egerton has
been taught I have been taught yet what two creatures could be more
unlike each other by nature than we are

Mr Burmistone glanced across the room at Miss Egerton She was a fine
robust young woman with a high nose and a stolid expression of
countenance

That is true he remarked

We are afraid of every thing said Lucia bitterly Lydia Egerton is
afraidthough you might not think so And as for me nobody knows what
a coward I am but myself Yes I am a coward When grandmamma looks at
me I tremble I dare not speak my mind and differ with her when I know
she is unjust and in the wrong No one could say that of Miss Octavia
Bassett

That is perfectly true said Mr Burmistone and he even went so far as
to laugh as he thought of Miss Octavia trembling in the august presence
of Lady Theobald

The laugh checked Lucia at once in her little outburst of eloquence She
began to blush the color mounting to her forehead

Oh she began I did not mean toto say so much I

There was something so innocent and touching in her sudden timidity and
confusion that Mr Burmistone forgot altogether that they were not very
old friends and that Lady Theobald might be looking

He bent slightly forward and looked into her upraised alarmed eyes

Dont be afraid of me he said dont for pitys sake

He could not have hit upon a luckier speech and also he could not have
uttered it more feelingly than he did It helped her to recover herself
and gave her courage

There she said with a slight catch of the breath does not that
prove what I said to be true I was afraid the very moment I ceased to
forget myself I was afraid of you and of myself I have no courage at
all

You will gain it in time he said

I shall try to gain it she answered I am nearly twenty and it is
time that I should learn to respect myself I think it must be because I
have no selfrespect that I am such a coward

It seemed that her resolution was to be tried immediately for at that
very moment Lady Theobald turned and on recognizing the full
significance of Lucias position was apparently struck temporarily dumb
and motionless When she recovered from the shock she made a majestic
gesture of command

Mr Burmistone glanced at the girls face and saw that it changed color
a little Lady Theobald appears to wish to speak to you he said

Lucia left her seat and walked across the room with a steady air Lady
Theobald did not remove her eye from her until she stopped within three
feet of her Then she asked a rather unnecessary question

With whom have you been conversing

With Mr Burmistone

Upon what subject

We were speaking of Miss Octavia Bassett

Her ladyship glanced around the room as if a new idea had occurred to
her and said

Where is Miss Octavia Bassett

Here it must be confessed that Lucia faltered

She is on the terrace with Mr Barold

She is on

Her ladyship stopped short in the middle of her sentence This was too
much for her She left Lucia and crossed the room to Miss Belinda

Belinda she said in an awful undertone your niece is out upon the
terrace with Mr Barold Perhaps it would be as well for you to
intimate to her that in England it is not customarythatBelinda go
and bring her in

Miss Belinda arose actually looking pale She had been making such
strenuous efforts to converse with Miss Pilcher and Mrs Burnham that
she had been betrayed into forgetting her charge She could scarcely
believe her ears She went to the open window and looked out and then
turned paler than before

Octavia my dear she said faintly

Francis said Lady Theobald over her shoulder

Mr Francis Barold turned a rather bored countenance toward them but it
was evidently not Octavia who had bored him

Octavia said Miss Belinda how imprudent In that thin dressthe
night air How could you my dear how could you

Oh I shall not catch cold Octavia answered I am used to it I have
been out hours and hours on moonlight nights at home

But she moved toward them

You must remember said Lady Theobald that there are many things
which may be done in America which would not be safe in England

And she made the remark in an almost sepulchral tone of warning

How Miss Belinda would have supported herself if the coach had not been
announced at this juncture it would be difficult to say The coach was
announced and they took their departure Mr Barold happening to make
his adieus at the same time they were escorted by him down to the
vehicle from the Blue Lion

When he had assisted them in and closed the door Octavia bent forward
so that the moonlight fell full on her pretty lacecovered head and the
sparkling drops in her ears

Oh she exclaimed if you stay here at all you must come and see
usAunt Belinda ask him to come and see us

Miss Belinda could scarcely speak

I shall be mostmost happy she fluttered Anyfriend of dear Lady
Theobalds of course

Dont forget said Octavia waving her hand

The coach moved off and Miss Belinda sank back into a dark corner

My dear she gasped what will he think

Octavia was winding her lace scarf around her throat

Hell think I want him to call she said serenely And I do




CHAPTER XIII

INTENTIONS


The position in which Lady Theobald found herself placed after these
occurrences was certainly a difficult and unpleasant one It was Mr
Francis Barolds caprice for the time being to develop an intimacy with
Mr Burmistone He had it seemed chosen to become interested in him
during their sojourn at Broadoaks He had discovered him to be a
desirable companion and a clever amiable fellow This much he
condescended to explain incidentally to her ladyships self

I cant say I expected to meet a nice fellow or a companionable fellow
he remarked and I was agreeably surprised to find him both Never says
too much or too little Never bores a man

To this Lady Theobald could make no reply Singularly enough she had
discovered early in their acquaintance that her wonted weapons were
likely to dull their edges upon the steely coldness of Mr Francis
Barolds impassibility In the presence of this fortunate young man
before whom his world had bowed the knee from his tenderest infancy she
lost the majesty of her demeanor He refused to be affected by it he was
even implacable enough to show openly that it bored him and to insinuate
by his manner that he did not intend to submit to it He entirely ignored
the claim of relationship and acted according to the promptings of his
own moods He did not feel it at all incumbent upon him to remain at
Oldclough Hall and subject himself to the timehonored customs there
in vogue He preferred to accept Mr Burmistones invitation to become
his guest at the handsome house he had just completed in which he lived
in bachelor splendor Accordingly he installed himself there and thereby
complicated matters greatly

Slowbridge found itself in a position as difficult as and far more
delicate than Lady Theobalds The teadrinkings in honor of that
troublesome young person Miss Octavia Bassett having been inaugurated
by her ladyship must go the social rounds according to ancient custom
But what in discretions name was to be done concerning Mr Francis
Barold There was no doubt whatever that he must not be ignored and in
that case what difficulties presented themselves

The mamma of the two Misses Egerton who was a nervous and easily
subjugated person was so excited and overwrought by the prospect before
her that in contemplating it when she wrote her invitations she was
affected to tears

I can assure you Lydia she said that I have not slept for three
nights I have been so harassed Here on one hand is Mr Francis
Barold who must be invited and on the other is Mr Burmistone whom we
cannot pass over and here is Lady Theobald who will turn to stone the
moment she sees himthough goodness knows I am sure he seems a very
quiet respectable man and said some of the most complimentary things
about your playing And here is that dreadful girl who is enough to give
one cold chills and who may do all sorts of dreadful things and is
certainly a living example to all respectable welleducated girls And
the blindest of the blind could see that nothing would offend Lady
Theobald more fatally than to let her be thrown with Francis Barold
and how one is to invite them into the same room and keep them apart
Im sure I dont know how Lady Theobald herself could not do it and how
can we be expected to And the refreshments on my mind too and Forbes
failing on her teacakes and bringing up Sally Lunns like lead

That these misgivings were equally shared by each entertainer in
prospective might be adduced from the fact that the same afternoon Mrs
Burnham and Miss Pilcher appeared upon the scene to consult with Mrs
Egerton upon the subject

Miss Lydia and Miss Violet being dismissed upstairs to their practising
the three ladies sat in the darkened parlor and talked the matter over
in solemn conclave

I have consulted Miss Pilcher and mentioned the affair to Mrs Gibson
announced Mrs Burnham And really we have not yet been able to arrive
at any conclusion

Mrs Egerton shook her head tearfully

Pray dont come to me my dears she saiddont I beg of you I
have thought about it until my circulation has all gone wrong and Lydia
has been applying hotwater bottles to my feet all the morning I gave it
up at halfpast two and set Violet to writing invitations to one and
all let the consequences be what they may

Miss Pilcher glanced at Mrs Burnham and Mrs Burnham glanced at Miss
Pilcher

Perhaps Miss Pilcher suggested to her companion it would be as well
for you to mention your impressions

Mrs Burnhams manner became additionally cautious She bent forward
slightly

My dear she said has it struck you that Lady Theobald has
anyintentions so to speak

Intentions repeated Mrs Egerton

Yes with deep significanceso to speak With regard to Lucia

Mrs Egerton looked utterly helpless

Dear me she ejaculated plaintively I have never had time to think of
it Dear me With regard to Lucia

Mrs Burnham became more significant still

And she added Mr Francis Barold

Mrs Egerton turned to Miss Pilcher and saw confirmation of the fact in
her countenance

Dear dear she said That makes it worse than ever

It is certain put in Miss Pilcher that the union would be a
desirable one and we have reason to remark that a deep interest in Mr
Francis Barold has been shown by Lady Theobald He has been invited to
make her house his home during his stay in Slowbridge and though he has
not done so the fact that he has not is due only to some inexplicable
reluctance upon his own part And we all remember that Lady Theobald once
plainly intimated that she anticipated Lucia forming in the future a
matrimonial alliance

Oh commented Mrs Egerton with some slight impatience it is all
very well for Lady Theobald to have intentions for Lucia but if the
young man has none I really dont see that her intentions will be likely
to result in any thing particular And I am sure Mr Francis Barold is
not in the mood to be influenced in that way now He is more likely to
entertain himself with Miss Octavia Bassett who will take him out in the
moonlight and make herself agreeable to him in her American style

Miss Pilcher and Mrs Burnham exchanged glances again

My dear said Mrs Burnham he has called upon her twice since Lady
Theobalds tea They say she invites him herself and flirts with him
openly in the garden

Her conduct is such said Miss Pilcher with a shudder that the
blinds upon the side of the seminary which faces Miss Bassetts garden
are kept closed by my orders I have young ladies under my care whose
characters are in process of formation and whose parents repose
confidence in me

Nothing but my friendship for Belinda Bassett remarked Mrs Burnham
would induce me to invite the girl to my house Then she turned to Mrs
Egerton Butahemhave you included them all in your invitations
she observed

Mrs Egerton became plaintive again

I dont see how I could be expected to do any thing else she said
Lady Theobald herself could not invite Mr Francis Barold from Mr
Burmistones house and leave Mr Burmistone at home And after all I
must say it is my opinion nobody would have objected to Mr Burmistone
in the first place if Lady Theobald had not insisted upon it

Mrs Burnham reflected

Perhaps that is true she admitted cautiously at length And it must
be confessed that a man in his position is not entirely without his
advantagesparticularly in a place where there are but few gentlemen
and those scarcely desirable as

She paused there discreetly but Mrs Egerton was not so discreet

There are a great many young ladies in Slowbridge she said shaking
her heada great many And with five in a family all old enough to be
out of school I am sure it is flying in the face of Providence to
neglect ones opportunities

When the two ladies took their departure Mrs Burnham seemed reflective
Finally she saidPoor Mrs Egertons mind is not what it was and it
never was remarkably strong It must be admitted too that there is a
lack ofof delicacy Those great plain girls of hers must be a trial to
her

As she spoke they were passing the privet hedge which surrounded Miss
Bassetts house and garden and a sound caused both to glance around The
front door had just been opened and a gentleman was descending the
stepsa young gentleman in neat clerical garb his guileless
ecclesiastical countenance suffused with mantling blushes of confusion
and delight He stopped on the gravel path to receive the last words of
Miss Octavia Bassett who stood on the threshold smiling down upon him
in the prettiest way in the world

Tuesday afternoon she said Now dont forget because I shall ask Mr
Barold and Miss Gaston on purpose to play against us Even St James
cant object to croquet

Iindeed I shall be most happy andand delighted stammered her
departing guest if you will be so kind as toto instruct me and
forgive my awkwardness

Oh Ill instruct you said Octavia I have instructed people before
and I know how

Mrs Burnham clutched Miss Pilchers arm

Do you see who that is she demanded Would you have believed it

Miss Pilcher preserved a stony demeanor

I would believe any thing of Miss Octavia Bassett she replied There
would be nothing at all remarkable to my mind in her flirting with the
bishop himself Why should she hesitate to endeavor to entangle the
curate of St James




CHAPTER XIV

A CLERICAL VISIT


It was indeed true that the Rev Arthur Poppleton had spent the greater
part of his afternoon in Miss Belinda Bassetts front parlor and that
Octavia had entertained him in such a manner that he had been beguiled
into forgetting the clerical visits he had intended to make and had
finally committed himself by a promise to return a day or two later to
play croquet His object in calling had been to request Miss Belindas
assistance in a parochial matter His natural timorousness of nature had
indeed led him to put off making the visit for as long a time as
possible The reports he had heard of Miss Octavia Bassett had inspired
him with great dread Consequently he had presented himself at Miss
Belindas front door with secret anguish

Will you say he had faltered to Mary Anne that it is Mr Poppleton
to see Miss BassettMiss Belinda Bassett

And then he had been handed into the parlor the door had been closed
behind him and he had found himself shut up entirely alone in the room
with Miss Octavia Bassett herself

His first impulse was to turn and flee precipitately indeed he even
went so far as to turn and clutch the handle of the door but somehow a
second thought arrived in time to lead him to control himself

This second thought came with his second glance at Octavia

She was not at all what he had pictured her Singularly enough no one
had told him that she was pretty and he had thought of her as a gaunt
young person with a determined and manly air She struck him on the
contrary as being extremely girlish and charming to look upon She wore
the pale pink gown and as he entered he saw her give a furtive little
dab to her eyes with a lace handkerchief and hurriedly crush an open
letter into her pocket Then seeming to dismiss her emotion with
enviable facility she rose to greet him

If you want to see aunt Belinda she said perhaps you had better sit
down She will be here directly He plucked up spirit to take a seat
suddenly feeling his terror take wing He was amazed at his own courage

Ththank you he said I have the pleasure ofThere it is true he
stopped looked at her blushed and finished somewhat disjointedly
Miss Octavia Bassett I believe

Yes she answered and sat down near him

When Miss Belinda descended the stairs a short time afterward her ears
were greeted by the sound of brisk conversation in which the Rev Arthur
Poppleton appeared to be taking part with beforeunheardof spirit When
he arose at her entrance there was in his manner an air of mild buoyancy
which astonished her beyond measure When he reseated himself he seemed
quite to forget the object of his visit for some minutes and was thus
placed in the embarrassing position of having to refer to his notebook

Having done so and found that he had called to ask assistance for the
family of one of his parishioners he recovered himself somewhat As he
explained the exigencies of the case Octavia listened

Well she said I should think it would make you quite uncomfortable
if you see things like that often

I regret to say I do see such things only too frequently he answered

Gracious she said but that was all

He was conscious of being slightly disappointed at her apathy and
perhaps it is to be deplored that he forgot it afterward when Miss
Belinda had bestowed her mite and the case was dismissed for the time
being He really did forget it and was beguiled into making a very long
call and enjoying himself as he had never enjoyed himself before

When at length he was recalled to a sense of duty by a glance at the
clock he had already before his eyes an opening vista of delights
taking the form of future calls and games of croquet played upon Miss
Belindas neatlyshaven grassplat He had bidden the ladies adieu in the
parlor and having stepped into the hall was fumbling rather excitedly
in the umbrellastand for his own especially slender clerical umbrella
when he was awakened to new rapture by hearing Miss Octavias tone again

He turned and saw her standing quite near him looking at him with
rather an odd expression and holding something in her hand

Oh she said See herethose people

Ibeg pardon he hesitated I dont quite understand

Oh yes she answered Those desperately poor wretches you know with
fever and leaks in their house and all sorts of disagreeable things the
matter with them Give them this wont you

This was a pretty silk purse through whose meshes he saw the gleam of
gold coin

That he said You dont meanisnt there a good dealI beg
pardonbut really

Well if they are as poor as you say they are it wont be too much
she replied I dont suppose theyll object to it do you

She extended it to him as if she rather wished to get it out of her
hands

Youd better take it she said I shall spend it on something I dont
need if you dont Im always spending money on things I dont care for
afterward

He was filled with remorse remembering that he had thought her
apathetic

II really thought you were not interested at all he burst forth
Pray forgive me This is generous indeed

She looked down at some particularly brilliant rings on her hand instead
of looking at him

Oh well she said I think it must be simply horrid to have to do
without things I cant see how people live Besides I havent denied
myself any thing It would be worth talking about if I had I suppose
Oh By the by never mind telling any one will you

Then without giving him time to reply she raised her eyes to his face
and plunged into the subject of the croquet again pursuing it until the
final moment of his exit and departure which was when Mrs Burnham and
Miss Pilcher had been scandalized at the easy freedom of her adieus




CHAPTER XV

SUPERIOR ADVANTAGES


When Mr Francis Barold called to pay his respects to Lady Theobald
after partaking of her hospitality Mr Burmistone accompanied him and
upon almost every other occasion of his presenting himself to her
ladyship Mr Burmistone was his companion

It may as well be explained at the outset that the millowner of
Burmistone Mills was a man of decided determination of character and
that upon the evening of Lady Theobalds tea he had arrived at the
conclusion that he would spare no effort to gain a certain end he felt it
would add to his happiness to accomplish

I stand rather in awe of Lady Theobald as any ordinary man would he
had said dryly to Barold on their return to his house But my awe of
her is not so great yet that I shall allow it to interfere with any of
my plans

Have you any especial plan inquired Barold carelessly after a pause

Yes answered Mr Burmistoneseveral I should like to go to
Oldclough rather often

I feel it the civil thing to go to Oldclough oftener than I like Go
with me

I should like to be included in all the invitations to tea for the next
six months

I shall be included in all the invitations so long as I remain here and
it is not likely you will be left out in the cold After you have gone
the rounds once you wont be dropped

Upon the whole it appears so said Mr Burmistone Thanks

So at each of the teaparties following Lady Theobalds the two men
appeared together The small end of the wedge being inserted into the
social stratum the rest was not so difficult Mrs Burnham was at once
surprised and overjoyed by her discoveries of the many excellences of the
man they had so hastily determined to ignore Mrs Abercrombie found Mr
Burmistones manner all that could be desired Miss Pilcher expressed the
highest appreciation of his views upon feminine education and our duty
to the young in our charge Indeed after Mrs Egertons evening the
tide of public opinion turned suddenly in his favor

Public opinion did not change however as far as Octavia was concerned
Having had her anxiety set at rest by several encouraging paternal
letters from Nevada she began to make up her mind to enjoy herself and
was it is to be regretted betrayed by her youthful high spirits into
the committing of numerous indiscretions Upon each festal occasion she
appeared in a new and elaborate costume she accepted the attentions of
Mr Francis Barold as if it were the most natural thing in the world
that they should be offered she jokedin what Mrs Burnham designated
her Nevada waywith the Rev Arthur Poppleton who appeared more
frequently than had been his habit at the high teas She played croquet
with that gentleman and Mr Barold day after day upon the grassplat
before all the eyes gazing down upon her from the neighboring windows
she managed to coerce Mr Burmistone into joining these innocent orgies
and in fact to quote Miss Pilcher there was no limit to the
shamelessness of her unfeminine conduct

Several times much comment had been aroused by the fact that Lucia Gaston
had been observed to form one of the party of players She had indeed
played with Barold against Octavia and Mr Poppleton on the memorable
day upon which that gentleman had taken his first lesson

Barold had availed himself of the invitation extended to him by Octavia
upon several occasions greatly to Miss Belindas embarrassment He had
dropped in the evening after the curates first call

Is Lady Theobald very fond of you Octavia had asked in the course of
this visit

It is very kind of her if she is he replied with languid irony

Isnt she fond enough of you to do any thing you ask her Octavia
inquired

Really I think not he replied Imagine the degree of affection it
requires I am not fond enough of any one to do any thing they ask me

Octavia bestowed a long look upon him

Well she remarked after a pause I believe you are not I shouldnt
think so

Barold colored very faintly

I say he said is that an imputation or something of that character
It sounds like it you know

Octavia did not reply directly She laughed a little

I want you to ask Lady Theobald to do something she said

I am afraid I am not in such favor as you imagine he said looking
slightly annoyed

Well I think she wont refuse you this thing she went on If she
didnt loathe me so I would ask her myself

He deigned to smile

Does she loathe you he inquired

Yes nodding She would not speak to me if it werent for aunt
Belinda She thinks I am fast and loud Do you think I am fast and
loud

He was taken aback and not for the first time either She had startled
and discomposed him several times in the course of their brief
acquaintance and he always resented it priding himself in private as
he did upon his coolness and immobility He could not think of the right
thing to say just now so he was silent for a second

Tell me the truth she persisted I shall not caremuch

I do not think you would care at all

Well perhaps I shouldnt Go on Do you think I am fast

I am happy to say I do not find you slow

She fixed her eyes on him smiling faintly

That means I am fast she said Well no matter Will you ask Lady
Theobald what I want you to ask her

I should not say you were fast at all he said rather stiffly You
have not been educated asas Lady Theobald has educated Miss Gaston for
instance

I should rather think not she replied Then she added very
deliberately She has had what you might call very superior advantages
I suppose

Her expression was totally incomprehensible to him She spoke with the
utmost seriousness and looked down at the table That is derision I
suppose he remarked restively

She glanced up again

At all events she said there is nothing to laugh at in Lucia Gaston
Will you ask Lady Theobald I want you to ask her to let Lucia Gaston
come and play croquet with us on Tuesday She is to play with you against
Mr Poppleton and me

Who is Mr Poppleton he asked with some reserve He did not exactly
fancy sharing his entertainment with any ordinary outsider After all
there was no knowing what this little American might do

He is the curate of the church she replied undisturbed He is very
nice and little and neat and blushes all over to the toes of his
boots He came to see aunt Belinda and I asked him to come and be
taught to play

Who is to teach him

I am I have taught at least twenty men in New York and San Francisco

I hope he appreciates your kindness

I mean to try if I can make him forget to be frightened she said with
a gay laugh

It was certainly nettling to find his air of reserve and displeasure met
with such inconsequent lightness She never seemed to recognize the
subtle changes of temperature expressed in his manner Only his sense of
what was due to himself prevented his being very chilly indeed but as
she went on with her gay chat in utter ignorance of his mood and
indulged in some very pretty airy nonsense he soon recovered himself
and almost forgot his private grievance

Before going away he promised to ask Lady Theobalds indulgence in the
matter of Lucias joining them in their game One speech of Octavias
connected with the subject he had thought very pretty as well as kind

I like Miss Gaston she said I think we might be friends if Lady
Theobald would let us Her superior advantages might do me good They
might improve me she went on with a little laugh and I suppose I
need improving very much All my advantages have been of one kind

When he had left her she startled Miss Belinda by saying

I have been asking Mr Barold if he thought I was fast and I believe he
doesin fact I am sure he does

Ah my dear my dear ejaculated Miss Belinda what a terrible thing
to say to a gentleman What will he think

Octavia smiled one of her calmest smiles

Isnt it queer how often you say that she remarked I think I should
perish if I had to pull myself up that way as you do I just go right on
and never worry I dont mean to do any thing queer and I dont see why
any one should think I do




CHAPTER XVI

CROQUET


Lucia was permitted to form one of the players in the game of croquet
being escorted to and from the scene by Francis Barold Perhaps it
occurred to Lady Theobald that the contrast of English reserve and
maidenliness with the freeandeasy manners of young women from Nevada
might lead to some good result

I trust your conduct will be such as to show that you at least have
resided in a civilized land she said The men of the present day may
permit themselves to be amused by young persons whose demeanor might
bring a blush to the cheek of a woman of forty but it is not their habit
to regard them with serious intentions

Lucia reddened She did not speak though she wished very much for the
courage to utter the words which rose to her lips Lately she had found
that now and then at times when she was roused to anger speeches of
quite a clever and sarcastic nature presented themselves to her mind She
was never equal to uttering them aloud but she felt that in time she
might because of course it was quite an advance in spirit to think them
and face even in imagination the probability of astounding and striking
Lady Theobald dumb with their audacity

It ought to make me behave very well she was saying now to herself
to have before me the alternative of not being regarded with serious
intentions I wonder if it is Mr Poppleton or Francis Barold who might
not regard me seriously And I wonder if they are any coarser in America
than we can be in England when we try

She enjoyed the afternoon very much particularly the latter part of it
when Mr Burmistone who was passing came in being invited by Octavia
across the privet hedge Having paid his respects to Miss Belinda who
sat playing propriety under a laburnumtree Mr Burmistone crossed the
grassplat to Lucia herself She was awaiting her turn and laughing at
the ardent enthusiasm of Mr Poppleton who under Octavias direction
was devoting all his energies to the game her eyes were bright and she
had lost for the time being her timid air of feeling herself somehow in
the wrong

I am glad to see you here said Mr Burmistone

I am glad to be here she answered It has been such a happy
afternoon Every thing has seemed so bright andand different

Different is a very good word he said laughing

It isnt a very bad one she returned and it expresses a good deal

It does indeed he commented

Look at Mr Poppleton and Octavia she began

Have you got to Octavia he inquired

She looked down and blushed

I shall not say Octavia to grandmamma

Then suddenly she glanced up at him

That is sly isnt it she said Sometimes I think I am very sly
though I am sure it is not my nature to be so I would rather be open
and candid

It would be better he remarked

You think so she asked eagerly

He could not help smiling

Do you ever tell untruths to Lady Theobald he inquired If you do I
shall begin to be alarmed

I act them she said blushing more deeply I really dopaltry sorts
of untruths you know pretending to agree with her when I dont
pretending to like things a little when I hate them I have been trying
to improve myself lately and once or twice it has made her very angry
She says I am disobedient and disrespectful She asked me one day if it
was my intention to emulate Miss Octavia Bassett That was when I said I
could not help feeling that I had wasted time in practising

She sighed softly as she ended

In the mean time Octavia had Mr Poppleton and Mr Francis Barold upon
her hands and was endeavoring to do her duty as hostess by both of them
If it had been her intention to captivate these gentlemen she could not
have complained that Mr Poppleton was wary or difficult game His first
fears allayed his downward path was smooth and rapid in proportion
When he had taken his departure with the little silk purse in his
keeping he had carried under his clerical vest a warmed and thrilled
heart It was a heart which it must be confessed was of the most
inexperienced and susceptible nature A little man of affectionate and
gentle disposition he had been given from his earliest youth to
indulging in timid dreams of mild future blissof bliss represented by
some lovely being whose ideals were similar to his own and who preferred
the wealth of a true affection to the glitter of the giddy throng Upon
one or two occasions he had even worshipped from afar but as on each of
these occasions his hopes had been nipped in the bud by the union of
their object with some hollow worldling his dream had so far never
attained very serious proportions Since he had taken up his abode in
Slowbridge he had felt himself a little overpowered by circumstances It
had been a source of painful embarrassment to him to find his innocent
presence capable of producing confusion in the breasts of young ladies
who were certainly not more guileless than himself He had been conscious
that the Misses Egerton did not continue their conversation with freedom
when he chanced to approach the group they graced and he had observed
the same thing in their companionsan additional circumspection of
demeanor so to speak a touch of new decorum whose object seemed to be
to protect them from any appearance of imprudence

It is almost as if they were afraid of me he had said to himself once
or twice Dear me I hope there is nothing in my appearance to lead
them to

He was so much alarmed by this dreadful thought that he had ever
afterward approached any of these young ladies with a fear and trembling
which had not added either to his comfort or their own consequently his
path had not been a very smooth one

I respect the young ladies of Slowbridge he remarked to Octavia that
very afternoon There are some very remarkable young ladies herevery
remarkable indeed They are interested in the church and the poor and
the schools and indeed in every thing which is most unselfish and
amiable Young ladies have usually so much to distract their attention
from such matters

If I stay long enough in Slowbridge said Octavia I shall be
interested in the church and the poor and the schools

It seemed to the curate that there had never been any thing so delightful
in the world as her laugh and her unusual remarks She seemed to him so
beautiful and so exhilarating that he forgot all else but his
admiration for her He enjoyed himself so much this afternoon that he
was almost brilliant and excited the sarcastic comment of Mr Francis
Barold who was not enjoying himself at all

Confound it said that gentleman to himself as he looked on What did
I come here for This style of thing is just what I might have expected
She is amusing herself with that poor little cad now and I am left in
the cold I suppose that is her habit with the young men in Nevada

He had no intention of entering the lists with the Rev Arthur Poppleton
or of concealing the fact that he felt that this little Nevada flirt was
making a blunder The sooner she knew it the better for herself so he
played his game as badly as possible and with much dignity

But Octavia was so deeply interested in Mr Poppletons ardent efforts
to do credit to her teaching that she was apparently unconscious of
all else She played with great cleverness and carried her partner to
the terminus with an eager enjoyment of her skill quite pleasant to
behold She made little darts here and there advised directed and
controlled his movements and was quite dramatic in a small way when he
made a failure

Mrs Burnham who was superintending the proceeding seated in her own
easychair behind her windowcurtains was roused to virtuous indignation
by her energy

There is no repose whatever in her manner she said No dignity Is a
game of croquet a matter of deep moment It seems to me that it is almost
impious to devote ones mind so wholly to a mere means of recreation

She seems to be enjoying it mamma said Miss Laura Burnham with a
faint sigh Miss Laura had been looking on over her parents shoulder
They all seem to be enjoying it See how Lucia Gaston and Mr Burmistone
are laughing I never saw Lucia look like that before The only one who
seems a little dull is Mr Barold

He is probably disgusted by a freedom of manner to which he is not
accustomed replied Mrs Burnham The only wonder is that he has not
been disgusted by it before




CHAPTER XVII

ADVANTAGES


The game over Octavia deserted her partner She walked lightly and with
the air of a victor to where Barold was standing She was smiling and
slightly flushed and for a moment or so stood fanning herself with a gay
Japanese fan

Dont you think I am a good teacher she asked at length

I should say so replied Barold without enthusiasm I am afraid I am
not a judge

She waved her fan airily

I had a good pupil she said Then she held her fan still for a moment
and turned fully toward him I have done something you dont like she
said I knew I had

Mr Francis Barold retired within himself at once In his present mood
it really appeared that she was assuming that he was very much interested
indeed

I should scarcely take the liberty upon a limited acquaintance he
began

She looked at him steadily fanning herself with slow regular movements

Yes she remarked Youre mad I knew you were

He was so evidently disgusted by this observation that she caught at the
meaning of his look and laughed a little

Ah she said thats an American word aint it It sounds queer to
you You say vexed instead of mad Well then you are vexed

If I have been so clumsy as to appear illhumored he said I beg
pardon Certainly I have no right to exhibit such unusual interest in
your conduct

He felt that this was rather decidedly to the point but she did not seem
overpowered at all She smiled anew

Anybody has a right to be madI mean vexed she observed I should
like to know how people would live if they hadnt I am madI mean
vexedtwenty times a day

Indeed was his sole reply

Well she said I think its real mean in you to be so cool about it
when you remember what I told you the other day

I regret to say I dont remember just now I hope it was nothing very
serious

To his astonishment she looked down at her fan and spoke in a slightly
lowered voice

I told you that I wanted to be improved

It must be confessed that he was mollified There was a softness in her
manner which amazed him He was at once embarrassed and delighted But
at the same time it would not do to commit himself to too great a
seriousness

Oh he answered that was a rather good joke I thought

No it wasnt she said perhaps even half a tone lower I was
in earnest

Then she raised her eyes

If you told me when I did any thing wrong I think it might be a good
thing she said

He felt that this was quite possible and was also struck with the idea
that he might find the task of mentorso long as he remained entirely
noncommittalrather interesting Still he could not afford to descend
at once from the elevated stand he had taken

I am afraid you would find it rather tiresome he remarked

I am afraid you would she answered You would have to tell me of
things so often

Do you mean seriously to tell me that you would take my advice he
inquired

I mightnt take all of it was her reply but I should take
someperhaps a great deal

Thanks he remarked I scarcely think I should give you a great deal

She simply smiled
I have never had any advice at all she said I dont know that I
should have taken it if I hadjust as likely as not I shouldnt but I
have never had any Father spoiled me He gave me all my own way He said
he didnt care so long as I had a good time and I must say I have
generally had a good time I dont see how I could help itwith all my
own way and no one to worry I wasnt sick and I could buy any thing I
liked and all that so I had a good time Ive read of girls in books
wishing they had mothers to take care of them I dont know that I ever
wished for one particularly I can take care of myself I must say too
that I dont think some mothers are much of an institution I know girls
who have them and they are always worrying

He laughed in spite of himself and though she had been speaking with the
utmost seriousness and naivet she joined him

When they ceased she returned suddenly to the charge

Now tell me what I have done this afternoon that isnt right she
saidthat Lucia Gaston wouldnt have done for instance I say
that because I shouldnt mind being a little like Lucia Gastonin
some things

Lucia ought to feel gratified he commented

She does she answered We had a little talk about it and she was as
pleased as could be I didnt think of it in that way until I saw her
begin to blush Guess what she said

I am afraid I cant

She said she saw so many things to envy in me that she could scarcely
believe I wanted to be at all like her

It was a very civil speech said Barold ironically I scarcely thought
Lady Theobald had trained her so well

She meant it said Octavia You maynt believe it but she did I know
when people mean things and when they dont

I wish I did said Barold

Octavia turned her attention to her fan

Well I am waiting she said

Waiting he repeated

To be told of my faults

But I scarcely see of what importance my opinion can be

It is of some importance to mejust now

The last two words rendered him really impatient and it may be spurred
him up

If we are to take Lucia Gaston as a model he said Lucia Gaston would
possibly not have been so complaisant in her demeanor toward our clerical
friend

Complaisant she exclaimed opening her lovely eyes When I was
actually plunging about the garden trying to teach him to play Well I
shouldnt call that being complaisant

Lucia Gaston he replied would not say that she had been plunging
about the garden

She gave herself a moment for reflection

Thats true she remarked when it was over she wouldnt When I
compare myself with the Slowbridge girls I begin to think I must say
some pretty awful things

Barold made no reply which caused her to laugh a little again

You darent tell me she said Now do I Well I dont think I want
to know very particularly What Lady Theobald thinks will last quite a
good while Complaisant

I am sorry you object to the word he said

Oh I dont she answered I like it It sounds so much more polite
than to say I was flirting and being fast

Were you flirting he inquired coldly

He objected to her ready serenity very much

She looked a little puzzled

You are very like aunt Belinda she said

He drew himself up He did not think there was any point of resemblance
at all between Miss Belinda and himself

She went on without observing his movement

You think every thing means something or is of some importance You
said that just as aunt Belinda says What will they think It never
occurs to me that theyll think at all Gracious Why should they

You will find they do he said

Well she said glancing at the group gathered under the laburnumtree
just now aunt Belinda thinks we had better go over to her so suppose
we do it At any rate I found out that I was too complaisant to Mr
Poppleton

When the party separated for the afternoon Barold took Lucia home and
Mr Burmistone and the curate walked down the street together

Mr Poppleton was indeed most agreeably exhilarated His expressive
little countenance beamed with delight

What a very charming person Miss Bassett is he exclaimed after they
had left the gate What a very charming person indeed

Very charming said Mr Burmistone with much seriousness A
prettier young person I certainly have never seen and those wonderful
gowns of hers

Oh interrupted Mr Poppleton with natural confusion Ireferred to
Miss Belinda Bassett though really what you say is very true Miss
Octavia BassettindeedI thinkin fact Miss Octavia Bassett is
quite one might almost say even more charming than her aunt

Yes admitted Mr Burmistone perhaps one might She is less ripe it
is true but that is an objection time will remove

There is such a delightful gayety in her manner said Mr Poppleton
such an ingenuous frankness such aasuch spirit It quite carries me
away with itquite

He walked a few steps thinking over this delightful gayety and ingenuous
frankness and then burst out afresh

And what a remarkable life she has had too She actually told me that
once in her childhood she lived for months in a golddiggers campthe
only woman there She says the men were kind to her and made a pet of
her She has known the most extraordinary people

In the mean time Francis Barold returned Lucia to Lady Theobalds safe
keeping Having done so he made his adieus and left the two to
themselves Her ladyship was it must be confessed a little at a loss to
explain to herself what she saw or fancied she saw in the manner and
appearance of her young relative She was persuaded that she had never
seen Lucia look as she looked this afternoon She had a brighter color in
her cheeks than usual her pretty figure seemed more erect her eyes had
a spirit in them which was quite new She had chatted and laughed gayly
with Francis Barold as she approached the house and after his departure
she moved to and fro with a freedom not habitual to her

He has been making himself agreeable to her said my lady with grim
pleasure He can do it if he chooses and he is just the man to please a
girlgoodlooking and with a fine domineering air

How did you enjoy yourself she asked

Very much said Lucia never more thank you

Oh ejaculated my lady And which of her smart New York gowns did Miss
Octavia Bassett wear

They were at the dinnertable and instead of looking down at her soup
Lucia looked quietly and steadily across the table at her grandmother

She wore a very pretty one she said it was pale fawncolor and
fitted her like a glove She made me feel very oldfashioned and
badly dressed

Lady Theobald laid down her spoon

She made you feel oldfashioned and badly dressedyou

Yes responded Lucia she always does I wonder what she thinks of the
things we wear in Slowbridge And she even went to the length of smiling
a little

What she thinks of what is worn in Slowbridge Lady Theobald
ejaculated She may I ask what weight the opinion of a young woman from
Americafrom Nevadais supposed to have in Slowbridge

Lucia took a spoonful of soup in a leisurely manner

I dont think it is supposed to have any butbut I dont think she
minds that I feel as if I shouldnt if I were in her place I have
always thought her very lucky

You have thought her lucky cried my lady You have envied a Nevada
young woman who dresses like an actress and loads herself with jewels
like a barbarian A girl whose conduct toward men is of a character
toto chill ones blood

They admire her said Lucia simply more than they admire Lydia
Egerton and more than they admire me

Do you admire her demanded my lady

Yes grandmamma replied Lucia courageously I think I do

Never had my lady been so astounded in her life For a moment she could
scarcely speak When she recovered herself she pointed to the door

Go to your room she commanded This is American freedom of speech I
suppose Go to your room

Lucia rose obediently She could not help wondering what her ladyships
course would be if she had the hardihood to disregard her order She
really looked quite capable of carrying it out forcibly herself When the
girl stood at her bedroom window a few minutes later her cheeks were
burning and her hands trembling

I am afraid it was very badly done she said to herself I am sure it
was butbut it will be a kind of practice I was in such a hurry to try
if I were equal to it that I didnt seem to balance things quite
rightly I ought to have waited until I had more reason to speak out
Perhaps there wasnt enough reason then and I was more aggressive than I
ought to have been Octavia is never aggressive I wonder if I was at all
pert I dont think Octavia ever means to be pert I felt a little as if
I meant to be pert I must learn to balance myself and only be cool and
frank

Then she looked out of the window and reflected a little

I was not so very brave after all she said rather reluctantly I
didnt tell her Mr Burmistone was there I darent have done that I am
afraid I am slythat sounds sly I am sure




CHAPTER XVIII

CONTRAST


Lady Theobald will put a stop to it was the general remark It will
certainly not occur again

This was said upon the evening of the first gathering upon Miss Belindas
grassplat and at the same time it was prophesied that Mr Francis
Barold would soon go away

But neither of the prophecies proved true Mr Francis Barold did not
return to London and strange to say Lucia was seen again and again
playing croquet with Octavia Bassett and was even known to spend
evenings with her

Perhaps it might be that an appeal made by Miss Belinda to her ladyship
had caused her to allow of these things Miss Belinda had in fact made
a private call upon my lady to lay her case before her

I feel so very timid about every thing she said almost with tears
and so fearful of trusting myself that I really find it quite a trial
The dear child has such a kind heartI assure you she has a kind heart
dear Lady Theobaldand is so innocent of any intention to do wrongI
am sure she is innocentthat it seems cruel to judge her severely If
she had had the benefit of such training as dear Lucias I am convinced
that her conduct would have been most exemplary She sees herself that
she has faults I am sure she does She said to me only last night in
that odd way of hersshe had been sitting evidently thinking deeply
for some minutesand she said I wonder if I shouldnt be nicer if I
were more like Lucia Gaston You see what turn her mind must have taken
She admires Lucia so much

Yesterday evening at dinner said Lady Theobald severely Lucia
informed me that she admired your niece The feeling seems to be
mutual

Miss Belinda colored and brightened visibly

Did she indeed she exclaimed How pleased Octavia will be to hear
it Did she indeed Then warned by a chilliness and lack of response
in her ladyships manner she modified her delight and became apologetic
again These young people are moreare less critical than we are she
sighed Octavias great prettiness

I think Lady Theobald interposed that Lucia has been taught to feel
that the body is corruptible and subject to decay and that mere beauty
is of small moment

Miss Belinda sighed again

That is very true she admitted deprecatingly very true indeed

It is to be hoped that Octavias stay in Slowbridge will prove
beneficial to her said her ladyship in her most judicial manner The
atmosphere is wholly unlike that which has surrounded her during her
previous life

I am sure it will prove beneficial to her said Miss Belinda eagerly
The companionship of welltrained and refined young people cannot fail
to be of use to her Such a companion as Lucia would be if you would
kindly permit her to spend an evening with us now and then would
certainly improve and modify her greatly Mr Francis Barold isis I
think of the same opinion at least I fancied I gathered as much from a
few words he let fall

Francis Barold repeated Lady Theobald And what did Francis Barold
say

Of course it was but very little hesitated Miss Belinda butbut I
could not help seeing that he was drawing comparisons as it were
Octavia was teaching Mr Poppleton to play croquet and she was rather
exhilarated and perhaps exhibited morefreedom of manner in an
innocent wayquite in an innocent thoughtless waythan is exactly
customary and I saw Mr Barold glance from her to Lucia who stood near
and when I said You are thinking of the contrast between them he
answered Yes they differ very greatly it is true and of course I
knew that my poor Octavia could not have the advantage in his eyes She
feels this herself I know She shocked me the other day beyond
expression by telling me that she had asked him if he thought she was
really fast and that she was sure he did Poor child she evidently did
not comprehend the dreadful significance of such terms

A man like Francis Barold does understand their significance said Lady
Theobald and it is to be deplored that your niece cannot be taught what
her position in society will be if such a reputation attaches itself to
her The men of the present day fight shy of such characters

This dread clause so impressed poor Miss Belinda by its solemnity that
she could not forbear repeating it to Octavia afterward though it is to
be regretted that it did not produce the effect she had hoped

Well I must say she observed that if some men fought a little shyer
than they do I shouldnt mind it You always do have about half a
dozen dangling around who only bore you and who will keep asking you to
go to places and sending you bouquets and asking you to dance when they
cant dance at all and only tear your dress and stand on your feet If
they would fight shy it would be splendid

To Miss Belinda who certainly had never been guilty of the indecorum of
having any member of the stronger sex dangling about at all this was
very trying

My dear she said dont say you always have itit really seems to
make it so personal

Octavia turned around and fixed her eyes wonderingly upon her blushing
countenance For a moment she made no remark a marvellous thought
shaping itself slowly in her mind

Aunt Belinda she said at length did nobody ever

Ah no my dear No no I assure you cried Miss Belinda in the
greatest possible trepidation Ah dear no Suchsuch things
rarelyvery rarely happen inSlowbridge and besides I couldnt
possibly have thought of it I couldnt indeed

She was so overwhelmed with maidenly confusion at the appalling thought
that she did not recover herself for half an hour at least Octavia
feeling that it would not be safe to pursue the subject only uttered one
word of comment

Gracious




CHAPTER XIX

AN EXPERIMENT


Much to her own astonishment Lucia found herself allowed new liberty
She was permitted to spend the afternoon frequently with Octavia and on
several occasions that young lady and Miss Bassett were invited to
partake of tea at Oldclough in company with no other guest than Francis
Barold

I dont know what it means and I think it must mean something said
Lucia to Octavia but it is very pleasant I never was allowed to be so
intimate with any one before

Perhaps suggested Octavia sagely she thinks that if you see me
often enough you will get sick of me and it will be a lesson to you

The more I see of you answered Lucia with a serious little air the
fonder I am of you I understand you better You are not at all like what
I thought you at first Octavia

But I dont know that theres much to understand in me

There is a great deal to understand in you she replied You are a
puzzle to me often You seem so frank and yet one knows so little about
you after all For instance Lucia went on who would imagine that you
are so affectionate

Am I affectionate she asked

Yes answered Lucia I am sure you are very affectionate I have found
it out gradually You would suffer things for any one you loved

Octavia thought the matter over

Yes she said at length I would

You are very fond of Miss Bassett proceeded Lucia as if arraigning
her at the bar of justice You are very fond of your father and I am
sure there are other people you are very fond ofvery fond of indeed

Octavia pondered seriously again

Yes there are she remarked but no one would care about them here
and so Im not going to make a fuss You dont want to make a fuss over
people you llike

You dont said Lucia You are like Francis Barold in one way but
you are altogether different in another Francis Barold does not wish to
show emotion and he is so determined to hedge himself around that one
cant help suspecting that he is always guarding himself against one He
seems always to be resenting any interference but you do not appear to
care at all and so it is not natural that one should suspect you I did
not suspect you

What do you suspect me of now

Of thinking a great deal answered Lucia affectionately And of being
very clever and very good

Octavia was silent for a few moments

I think she said after the pauseI think youll find out that its
a mistake

No I shall not returned Lucia quite glowing with enthusiasm And I
know I shall learn a great deal from you

This was such a startling proposition that Octavia felt decidedly
uncomfortable She flushed rosy red

Im the one who ought to learn things I think she said Im always
doing things that frighten aunt Belinda and you know how the rest
regard me

Octavia said Lucia very naively indeed suppose we try to help each
other If you will tell me when I am wrong I will try toto have the
courage to tell you That will be good practice for me What I want most
is courage and frankness and I am sure it will take courage to make up
my mind to tell you of yourof your mistakes

Octavia regarded her with mingled admiration and respect

I think thats a splendid idea she said

Are you sure faltered Lucia are you sure you wont mind the
things I may have to say Really they are quite little things in
themselveshardly worth mentioning

Tell me one of them right now said Octavia pointblank

Oh no exclaimed Lucia starting Id rather notjust now

Well commented Octavia that sounds as if they must be pretty
unpleasant Why dont you want to They will be quite as bad tomorrow
And to refuse to tell me one is a bad beginning It looks as if you were
frightened and it isnt good practice for you to be frightened at such a
little thing

Lucia felt convicted She made an effort to regain her composure

No it is not she said But that is always the way I am continually
telling myself that I will be courageous and candid and the first
time any thing happens I fail I will tell you one thing

She stopped short here and looked at Octavia guiltily

It is somethingI think I would do ifif I were in your place Lucia
stammered A very little thing indeed

Well remarked Octavia anxiously

Lucia lost her breath caught it again and proceeded cautiously and
with blushes at her own daring

If I were in your place she said I thinkthat perhapsonly
perhaps you knowI would not wearmy hairquite so low downover
my forehead

Octavia sprang from her seat and ran to the pierglass over the mantle
She glanced at the reflection of her own startled pretty face and
then putting her hand up to the soft blonde bang which met her brows
turned to Lucia

Isnt it becoming she asked breathlessly

Oh yes Lucia answered Very

Octavia started

Then why wouldnt you wear it she cried What do you mean

Lucia felt her position truly a delicate one She locked her hands and
braced herself but she blushed vividly

It may sound rather silly when I tell you why Octavia she said but
I really do think it is a sort of reason You know in those absurd
pictures of actresses bangs always seem to be the principal feature I
saw some in the shopwindows when I went to Harriford with grandmamma
And they were such dreadful womensome of themand had so very few
clothes on that I cant help thinking I shouldnt like to look like
them and

Does it make me look like them

Oh very little answered Lucia very little indeed of course but

But its the same thing after all put in Octavia Thats what you
mean

It is so very little faltered Lucia thatthat perhaps it isnt
a reason

Octavia looked at herself in the glass again

It isnt a very good reason she remarked but I suppose it will do

She paused and looked Lucia in the face

I dont think thats a little thing she said To be told you look
like an opra bouffe actress

I did not mean to say so cried Lucia filled with the most poignant
distress I beg your pardon indeedIoh dear I was afraid you
wouldnt like it I felt that it was taking a great liberty

I dont like it answered Octavia but that cant be helped I didnt
exactly suppose I should But I wasnt going to say any thing about
your hair when I began glancing at poor Lucias coiffure though I
suppose I might

You might say a thousand things about it cried Lucia piteously I
know that mine is not only in bad taste but it is ugly and unbecoming


Yes said Octavia cruelly it is

And yours is neither the one nor the other protested Lucia You know
I told you it was pretty Octavia

Octavia walked over to the table upon which stood Miss Belindas
workbasket and took therefrom a small and gleaming pair of scissors
returning to the mantleglass with them

How short shall I cut it she demanded

Oh exclaimed Lucia dont dont

For answer Octavia raised the scissors and gave a snip It was a savage
snip and half the length and width of her lovelocks fell on the mantle
then she gave another snip and the other half fell

Lucia scarcely dared to breathe

For a moment Octavia stood gazing at herself with pale face and dilated
eyes Then suddenly the folly of the deed she had done seemed to reveal
itself to her

Oh she cried out Oh how diabolical it looks

She turned upon Lucia

Why did you make me do it she exclaimed Its all your faultevery
bit of it and flinging the scissors to the other end of the room she
threw herself into a chair and burst into tears

Lucias anguish of mind was almost more than she could bear For at least
three minutes she felt herself a criminal of the deepest dye after the
three minutes had elapsed however she began to reason and called to
mind the fact that she was failing as usual under her crisis

This is being a coward again she said to herself It is worse than to
have said nothing It is true that she will look more refined now one
can see a little of her forehead and it is cowardly to be afraid to
stand firm when I really think so Iyes I will say something to her

Octavia she began aloud I am sure you are making a mistake again
This as decidedly as possible which was not very decidedly Youyou
look very muchnicer

I look ghastly said Octavia who began to feel rather absurd

You do not Your foreheadyou have the prettiest forehead I ever saw
Octavia said Lucia eagerly and your eyebrows are perfect Iwish you
would look at yourself again

Rather to her surprise Octavia began to laugh under cover of her
handkerchief reaction had set in and though the laugh was a trifle
hysterical it was still a laugh Next she gave her eyes a final little
dab and rose to go to the glass again She looked at herself touched up
the short waving fringe left on her forehead and turned to Lucia with
a resigned expression

Do you think that any one who was used to seeing it the other way
wouldwould think I looked horrid she inquired anxiously

They would think you prettiera great deal Lucia answered earnestly
Dont you know Octavia that nothing could be really unbecoming to you
You have that kind of face

For a few seconds Octavia seemed to lose herself in thought of a
speculative nature

Jack always said so she remarked at length

Jack repeated Lucia timidly

Octavia roused herself and smiled with candid sweetness

He is some one I knew in Nevada she explained He worked in fathers
mine once

You must have known him very well suggested Lucia somewhat awed

I did she replied calmly Very well

She tucked away her pockethandkerchief in the jaunty pocket at the back
of her basque and returned to her chair Then she turned again to Lucia

Well she said I think you have found out that you were mistaken
havent you dear Suppose you tell me of something else

Lucia colored

No she answered that is enough for today




CHAPTER XX

PECULIAR TO NEVADA


Whether or not Lucia was right in accusing Octavia Bassett of being
clever and thinking a great deal is a riddle which those who are
interested in her must unravel as they read but whether the surmise was
correct or incorrect it seemed possible that she had thought a little
after the interview When Barold saw her next he was struck by a slight
but distinctly definable change he recognized in her dress and coiffure
Her pretty hair had a rather less professional appearance he had the
pleasure of observing for the first time how very white her forehead
was and how delicate the arch of her eyebrows her dress had a novel air
of simplicity and the diamond rings were nowhere to be seen

Shes better dressed than usual he said to himself And shes always
well dressedrather too well dressed fact is for a place like this
This sort of thing is in better form under the circumstances It was
so much better form and he so far approved of it that he quite
thawed and was very amiable and very entertaining indeed

Octavia was entertaining too She asked several most interesting
questions

Do you think she inquired that it is bad taste to wear diamonds

My mother wears themoccasionally

Have you any sisters

No

Any cousinsas young as I am

Yaas

Do they wear them

I must admit he replied that they dont In the first place you
know they havent any and in the second I am under the impression
that Lady Beauchamptheir mamma you knowwouldnt permit it if they
had

Wouldnt permit it said Octavia I suppose they always do as she
tells them

He smiled a little

They would be very courageous young women if they didnt he remarked

What would she do if they tried it she inquired She couldnt beat
them

They will never try it he answered dryly And though I have never
seen her beat them or heard their lamentations under chastisement I
should not like to say that Lady Beauchamp could not do any thing She is
a very determined personfor a gentlewoman

Octavia laughed

You are joking she said

Lady Beauchamp is a serious subject for jokes he responded My
cousins think so at least

I wonder if she is as bad as Lady Theobald Octavia reflected aloud
She says I have no right to wear diamonds at all until I am married But
I dont mind Lady Theobald she added as a cheerful afterthought I am
not fond enough of her to care about what she says

Are you fond of any one Barold inquired speaking with a languid air
but at the same time glancing at her with some slight interest from under
his eyelids

Lucia says I am she returned with the calmness of a young person who
wished to regard the matter from an unembarrassed point of view Lucia
says I am affectionate

Ah deliberately Are you

She turned and looked at him serenely

Should you think so she asked

This was making such a personal matter of the question that he did not
exactly enjoy it It was certainly not good form to pull a man up in
such cool style

Really he replied Iahhave had no opportunity of judging

He had not the slightest intention of being amusing but to his infinite
disgust he discovered as soon as he spoke that she was amused She
laughed outright and evidently only checked herself because he looked so
furious In consideration for his feelings she assumed an air of mild but
preternatural seriousness

No she remarked that is true you havent of course

He was silent He did not enjoy being amusing at all and he made no
pretence of appearing to submit to the indignity calmly

She bent forward a little

Ah she exclaimed you are mad againI mean you are vexed I am
always vexing you

There was a hint of appeal in her voice which rather pleased him but he
had no intention of relenting at once

I confess I am at a loss to know why you laughed he said

Are you she asked really letting her eyes rest upon him anxiously
for a moment Then she actually gave vent to a little sigh We look at
things so differently thats it she said

I suppose it is he responded still chillingly

In spite of this she suddenly assumed a comparatively cheerful aspect A
happy thought occurred to her

Lucia would beg your pardon she said I am learning good manners from
Lucia Suppose I beg your pardon

It is quite unnecessary he replied

Lucia wouldnt think so she said And why shouldnt I be as
wellbehaved as Lucia I beg your pardon

He felt rather absurd and yet somewhat mollified She had a way of
looking at him sometimes when she had been unpleasant which rather
soothed him In fact he had found of late a little to his private
annoyance that it was very easy for her either to soothe or disturb him

And now just as Octavia had settled down into one of the prettiest and
least difficult of her moods there came a knock at the front door
which being answered by Mary Anne was found to announce the curate of
St James

Enter consequently the Rev Arthur Poppletonblushing a trifle
timorous perhaps but happy beyond measure to find himself in Miss
Belindas parlor again with Miss Belindas niece

Perhaps the least possible shade of his joyousness died out when he
caught sight of Mr Francis Barold and certainly Mr Francis Barold was
not at all delighted to see him

What does the fellow want that gentleman was saying inwardly What
does he come simpering and turning pink here for Why doesnt he go and
see some of his old women and read tracts to them Thats his
business Octavias manner toward her visitor formed a fresh
grievance for Barold She treated the curate very well indeed She
seemed glad to see him she was wholly at her ease with him she made no
trying remarks to him she never stopped to fix her eyes upon him in
that inexplicable style and she did not laugh when there seemed nothing
to laugh at She was so gay and goodhumored that the Rev Arthur
Poppleton beamed and flourished under her treatment and forgot to
change color and even ventured to talk a good deal and make divers
quite presentable little jokes

I should like to know thought Barold growing sulkier as the others
grew merrierI should like to know what she finds so interesting in
him and why she chooses to treat him better than she treats me for she
certainly does treat him better

It was hardly fair however that he should complain for at times he
was treated extremely well and his intimacy with Octavia progressed
quite rapidly Perhaps if the truth were told it was always himself who
was the first means of checking it by some suddenly prudent instinct
which led him to feel that perhaps he was in rather a delicate position
and had better not indulge in too much of a good thing He had not been
an eligible and unimpeachable desirable parti for ten years without
acquiring some of that discretion which is said to be the better part of
valor The matteroffact air with which Octavia accepted his attentions
caused him to pull himself up sometimes If he had been Brown or Jones
or even Robinson she could not have appeared to regard them as more
entirely natural Whenhe had gone so far once or twicehe had deigned
to make a more than usually agreeable speech to her it was received with
none of that charming sensitive tremor to which he was accustomed
Octavia neither blushed nor dropped her eyes

It did not add to Barolds satisfaction to find her as cheerful and ready
to be amused by a mild little curate who blushed and stammered and was
neither brilliant graceful nor distinguished Could not Octavia see the
wide difference between the two Regarding the matter in this light and
watching Octavia as she encouraged her visitor and laughed at his jokes
and never once tripped him up by asking him a startling question did
not as already has been said improve Mr Francis Barolds temper and
by the time his visit was over he had lapsed into his coldest and most
haughty manner As soon as Miss Belinda entered and engaged Mr
Poppleton for a moment he rose and crossed the little room to Octavias
side

I must bid you goodafternoon he said

Octavia did not rise

Sit down a minute while aunt Belinda is talking about redflannel
nightcaps and lumbago she said I wanted to ask you something By the
way what is lumbago

Is that what you wished to ask me he inquired stiffly

No I just thought of that Have you ever had it and what is it like
All the old people in Slowbridge have it and they tell you all about it
when you go to see them Aunt Belinda says so What I wanted to ask you
was different

Possibly Miss Bassett might be able to tell you he remarked

About the lumbago Well perhaps she might Ill ask her Do you think
it bad taste in me to wear diamonds

She said this with the most delightful seriousness fixing her eyes upon
him with her very prettiest look of candid appeal as if it were the most
natural thing in the world that she should apply to him for information
He felt himself faltering again How white that bit of forehead was How
soft that blonde waving fringe of hair What a lovely shape her eyes
were and how large and clear as she raised them

Why do you ask me he inquired

Because I think you are an unprejudiced person Lady Theobald is not I
have confidence in you Tell me

There was a slight pause

Really he said after it I can scarcely believe that my opinion can
be of any value in your eyes I amcan only tell you that it is hardly
customary inanin England for young people to wear a profusion of
ornament

I wonder if I wear a profusion

You dont need any he condescended You are too young andall that
sort of thing

She glanced down at her slim unringed hands for a moment her expression
quite thoughtful

Lucia and I almost quarrelled the other day she saidat least I
almost quarrelled It isnt so nice to be told of things after all I
must say I dont like it as much as I thought I should

He kept his seat longer than he had intended and when he rose to go
the Rev Arthur Poppleton was shaking hands with Miss Belinda and so it
fell out that they left the house together

You know Miss Octavia Bassett well I suppose remarked Barold with
condescension as they passed through the gate You clergymen are
fortunate fellows

I wish that others knew her as well sir said the little gentleman
kindling I wish they knew herher generosity and kindness of heart and
ready sympathy with misfortune

Ah commented Mr Barold twisting his mustache with somewhat of an
incredulous air This was not at all the sort of thing he had expected to
hear For his own part it would not have occurred to him to suspect her
of the possession of such desirable and orthodox qualities

There are those whomisunderstand her cried the curate warming with
his subject who misunderstand andyes and apply harsh terms to her
innocent gayety and freedom of speech if they knew her as I do they
would cease to do so

I should scarcely have thoughtbegan Barold

There are many who scarcely think itif you will pardon my
interrupting you said the curate I think they would scarcely believe
it if I felt at liberty to tell them which I regret to say I do not I
am almost breaking my word in saying what I cannot help saying to
yourself The poor under my care are better off since she came and there
are some who have seen her more than once though she did not go as a
teacher or to reprove them for faults and her way of doing what she did
was new to them and perhaps much less serious than they were accustomed
to and they liked it all the better

Ah commented Barold again Flannel undergarments andthat sort
of thing

No with much spirit not at all sir but what as I said they liked
much better It is not often they meet a beautiful creature who comes
among them with open hands and the natural ungrudging way of giving
which she has Sometimes they are at a loss to understand as well as the
rest They have been used to what is narrower and moremore exacting

They have been used to Lady Theobald observed Barold with a faint
smile

It would not become me toto mention Lady Theobald in any disparaging
manner replied the curate but the best and most charitable among us
do not always carry out our good intentions in the best way I dare say
Lady Theobald would consider Miss Octavia Bassett too readily influenced
and too lavish

She is as generous with her money as with her diamonds perhaps said
Barold Possibly the quality is peculiar to Nevada We part here Mr
Poppleton I believe Goodmorning




CHAPTER XXI

LORD LANSDOWNE


One morning in the following week Mrs Burnham attired herself in her
secondbest black silk and leaving the Misses Burnham practising
diligently turned her steps toward Oldclough Hall Arriving there she
was ushered into the blue drawingroom by Dobson in his character of
footman and in a few minutes Lucia appeared

When Mrs Burnham saw her she assumed a slight air of surprise

Why my dear she said as she shook hands I should scarcely have
known you

And though this was something of an exaggeration there was some excuse
for the exclamation Lucia was looking very charming and several changes
might be noted in her attire and appearance The ugly twist had
disappeared from her delicate head and in its place were soft loose
waves and light puffs she had even ventured on allowing a few ringed
locks to stray on to her forehead her white morningdress no longer wore
the trademark of Miss Chickie but had been remodelled by some one of
more taste

What a pretty gown my dear said Mrs Burnham glancing at it
curiously A Watteau plait down the backisnt it a Watteau plaitand
little ruffles down the front and pale pink bows It is quite like some
of Miss Octavia Bassetts dresses only not so overtrimmed

I do not think Octavias dresses would seem overtrimmed if she wore
them in London or Paris said Lucia bravely It is only because we are
so very quiet and dress so little in Slowbridge that they seem so

And your hair remarked Mrs Burnham You drew your idea of that from
some style of hers I suppose Very becoming indeed Well well And how
does Lady Theobald like all this my dear

I am not sure thatLucia was beginning when her ladyship interrupted
her by entering

My dear Lady Theobald cried her visitor rising I hope you are well
I have just been complimenting Lucia upon her pretty dress and her new
style of dressing her hair Miss Octavia Bassett has been giving her the
benefit of her experience it appears We have not been doing her
justice Who would have believed that she had come from Nevada to improve
us

Miss Octavia Bassett said my lady sonorously has come from Nevada to
teach our young people a great many thingsnew fashions in duty and
demeanor and respect for their elders Let us hope they will be
benefited

If you will excuse me grandmamma said Lucia speaking in a soft
steady voice I will go and write the letters you wished written

Go said my lady with majesty and having bidden Mrs Burnham
goodmorning Lucia went

If Mrs Burnham had expected any explanation of her ladyships evident
displeasure she was doomed to disappointment That excellent and
rigorous gentlewoman had a stern sense of dignity which forbade her
condescending to the confidential weakness of mere ordinary mortals
Instead of referring to Lucia she broached a more commonplace topic

I hope your rheumatism does not threaten you again Mrs Burnham
she remarked

I am very well thank you my dear said Mrs Burnham so well that I
am thinking quite seriously of taking the dear girls to the gardenparty
when it comes off

To the gardenparty repeated her ladyship May I ask who thinks of
giving a gardenparty in Slowbridge

It is no one in Slowbridge replied this lady cheerfully Some one who
lives a little out of SlowbridgeMr Burmistone my dear Lady Theobald
at his new place

Mr Burmistone

Yes my dear and a most charming affair it is to be if we are to
believe all we hear Surely you have heard something of it from Mr
Barold

Mr Barold has not been to Oldclough for several days

Then he will tell you when he comes for I suppose he has as much to do
with it as Mr Burmistone

I have heard before announced my lady of men of Mr Burmistones
class securing the services of persons of established position in society
when they wished to spend their money upon entertainments but I should
scarcely have imagined that Francis Barold would have allowed himself to
be made a party to such a transaction

But put in Mrs Burnham rather eagerly it appears that Mr
Burmistone is not such an obscure person after all He is an Oxford man
and came off with honors he is quite a wellborn man and gives this
entertainment in honor of his friend and relation Lord Lansdowne

Lord Lansdowne echoed her ladyship sternly

Son of the Marquis of Lauderdale whose wife was Lady Honora Erroll

Did Mr Burmistone give you this information asked Lady Theobald with
ironic calmness

Mrs Burnham colored never so faintly

Ithat is to saythere is a sort of acquaintance between one of my
maids and the butler at the Burmistone place and when the girl was
doing Lydias hair she told her the story Lord Lansdowne and his father
are quite fond of Mr Burmistone it is said

It seems rather singular to my mind that we should not have known of
this before

But how should we learn We none of us know Lord Lansdowne or even the
marquis I think he is only a second or third cousin We are a
littlejust a little set in Slowbridge you know my dear at least I
have thought so sometimes lately

I must confess remarked my lady that I have not regarded the
matter in that light

That is because you have a better right toto be a little set than the
rest of us was the amiable response

Lady Theobald did not disclaim the privilege She felt the sentiment an
extremely correct one But she was not very warm in her manner during the
remainder of the call and incongruous as such a statement may appear
it must be confessed that she felt that Miss Octavia Bassett must have
something to do with these defections on all sides and that
gardenparties and all such swervings from established Slowbridge
custom were the natural result of Nevada frivolity and freedom of
manners It may be that she felt remotely that even Lord Lansdowne and
the Marquis of Lauderdale were to be referred to the same reprehensible
cause and that but for Octavia Bassett Mr Burmistone would not have
been educated at Oxford and have come off with honors and have turned
out to be related to respectable people but would have remained in
appropriate obscurity

I suppose she said afterward to Lucia that your friend Miss Octavia
Bassett is in Mr Burmistones confidence if no one else has been
permitted to have that honor I have no doubt she has known of this
approaching entertainment for some weeks

I do not know grandmamma replied Lucia putting her letters together
and gaining color as she bent over them She was wondering with inward
trepidation what her ladyship would say if she knew the whole truthif
she knew that it was her granddaughter and not Octavia Bassett who
enjoyed Mr Burmistones confidence

Ah she thought how could I ever dare to tell her

The same day Francis Barold sauntered up to pay them a visit and then
as Mrs Burnham had prophesied Lady Theobald heard all she wished to
hear and indeed a great deal more

What is this I am told of Mr Burmistone Francis she inquired
That he intends to give a gardenparty and that Lord Lansdowne is to
be one of the guests and that he has caused it to be circulated that
they are cousins

That Lansdowne has caused it to be circulatedor Burmistone

It is scarcely likely that Lord Lansdowne

Beg pardon he interrupted fixing his single glass dexterously in his
right eye and gazing at her ladyship through it Cant see why
Lansdowne should object Fact is he is a great deal fonder of Burmistone
than relations usually are of each other Now I often find that kind of
thing a bore but Lansdowne doesnt seem to They were at school
together it seems and at Oxford too and Burmistone is supposed to have
behaved pretty well towards Lansdowne at one time when he was rather a
wild fellowso the father and mother say As to Burmistone causing it
to be circulated that sort of thing is rather absurd The man isnt a
cad you know

Pray dont say you know Francis said her ladyship I know very
little but what I have chanced to see and I must confess I have not
been prepossessed in Mr Burmistones favor Why did he not choose to
inform us

That he was Lord Lansdownes second cousin and knew the Marquis of
Lauderdale grandmamma broke in Lucia with very pretty spirit Would
that have prepossessed you in his favor Would you have forgiven him for
building the mills on Lord Lansdownes account II wish I was related
to a marquis which was very bold indeed

May I ask said her ladyship in her most monumental manner when
you became Mr Burmistones champion




CHAPTER XXII

YOU HAVE MADE IT LIVELIER


When she had become Mr Burmistones champion indeed She could scarcely
have told when unless perhaps she had fixed the date at the first time
she had heard his name introduced at a high tea with every politely
opprobrious epithet affixed She had defended him in her own mind then
and felt sure that he deserved very little that was said against him and
very likely nothing at all And the first time she had seen and spoken
to him she had been convinced that she had not made a mistake and that
he had been treated with cruel injustice How kind he was how manly how
clever and how well he bore himself under the popular adverse criticism
She only wondered that anybody could be so blind and stupid and wilful as
to assail him

And if this had been the case in those early days imagine what she felt
now whenah wellwhen her friendship had had time and opportunity to
become a much deeper sentiment Must it be confessed that she had seen
Mr Burmistone even oftener than Octavia and Miss Belinda knew of Of
course it had all been quite accidental but it had happened that now and
then when she had been taking a quiet walk in the lanes about Oldclough
she had encountered a gentleman who had dismounted and led his horse by
the bridle as he sauntered by her side She had always been very timid
at such times and had felt rather like a criminal but Mr Burmistone
had not been timid at all and would indeed as soon have met Lady
Theobald as not for which courage his companion admired him more than
ever It was not very long before to be with this hero reassured her
and made her feel stronger and more selfreliant She was never afraid to
open her soft little heart to him and show him innocently all its
goodness and ignorance of worldliness She warmed and brightened under
his kindly influence and was often surprised in secret at her own simple
readiness of wit and speech

It is odd that I am such a different girl whenwhen I am with you she
said to him one day I even make little jokes I never should think of
making even the tiniest joke before grandmamma Somehow she never seems
quite to understand jokes She never laughs at them You always laugh
and I am sure it is very kind of you to encourage me so but you must not
encourage me too much or I might forget and make a little joke at
dinner and I think if I did she would choke over her soup

Perhaps when she dressed her hair and adorned herself with pale pink
bows and like appurtenances this artful young person had privately in
mind other beholders than Mrs Burnham and other commendation than that
to be bestowed by that most excellent matron

Do you mind my telling you that you have put on an enchanted garment
said Mr Burmistone the first time they met when she wore one of the
oldnew gowns I thought I knew before how

I dont mind it at all said Lucia blushing brilliantly I rather
like it It rewards me for my industry My hair is dressed in a new way
I hope you like that too Grandmamma does not

It had been Lady Theobalds habit to treat Lucia severely from a sense of
duty Her manner toward her had always rather the tone of implying that
she was naturally at fault and yet her ladyship could not have told
wherein she wished the girl changed In the good old school in which my
lady had been trained it was customary to regard young people as weak
foolish and if left to their own desires frequently sinful Lucia had
not been left to her own desires She had been taught to view herself as
rather a bad case and to feel that she was far from being what her
relatives had a right to expect To be thrown with a person who did not
find her silly or dull or commonplace was a new experience

If I had been clever Lucia said once to Mr Burmistoneif I had
been clever perhaps grandmamma would have been more satisfied with me I
have often wished I had been clever

If you had been a boy replied Mr Burmistone rather grimly and had
squandered her money and run into debt and bullied her you would have
been her idol and she would have pinched and starved herself to supply
your highnesss extravagance

When the gardenparty rumor began to take definite form and there was no
doubt as to Mr Burmistones intentions a discussion arose at once and
went on in every genteel parlor Would Lady Theobald allow Lucia to go
and if she did not allow her would not such a course appear very
pointed indeed It was universally decided that it would appear pointed
but that Lady Theobald would not mind that in the least and perhaps
would rather enjoy it than otherwise and it was thought Lucia would not
go And it is very likely that Lucia would have remained at home if it
had not been for the influence of Mr Francis Barold

Making a call at Oldclough he found his august relative in a very
majestic mood and she applied to him again for information

Perhaps she said you may be able to tell me whether it is true that
Belinda BassettBelinda Bassett with emphasis has been invited by
Mr Burmistone to assist him to receive his guests

Yes it is true was the reply I think I advised it myself
Burmistone is fond of her They are great friends Man needs a woman at
such times

And he chose Belinda Bassett

In the first place he is on friendly terms with her as I said before
replied Barold in the second shes just what he wantswellbred
kindhearted not likely to make rows et caetera There was a slight
pause before he finished adding quietly Hes not the man to submit to
being refusedBurmistone

Lady Theobald did not reply or raise her eyes from her work she knew he
was looking at her with calm fixedness through the glass he held in its
place so cleverly and she detested this more than any thing else
perhaps because she was invariably quelled by it and found she had
nothing to say

He did not address her again immediately but turned to Lucia dropping
the eyeglass and resuming his normal condition

You will go of course he said

Lucia glanced across at my lady

Ido not know Grandmamma

Oh interposed Barold you must go There is no reason for your
refusing the invitation unless you wish to imply something
unpleasantwhich is of course out of the question

But there may be reasonsbegan her ladyship

Burmistone is my friend put in Barold in his coolest tone and I am
your relative which would make my position in his house a delicate one
if he has offended you

When Lucia saw Octavia again she was able to tell her that they had
received invitations to the fte and that Lady Theobald had accepted
them

She has not spoken a word to me about it but she has accepted them
said Lucia I dont quite understand her lately Octavia She must be
very fond of Francis Barold He never gives way to her in the least and
she always seems to submit to him I know she would not have let me go
if he had not insisted on it in that takingitforgranted way of his

Naturally Mr Burmistones fte caused great excitement Miss Chickie
was never so busy in her life and there were rumors that her feelings
had been outraged by the discovery that Mrs Burnham had sent to
Harriford for costumes for her daughters

Slowbridge is changing mem said Miss Chickie with brilliant sarcasm
Our ladies is led in their fashions by a Nevada young person Were
improving most rapidmore rapid than Id ever have dared to hope Do you
prefer a frill or a flounce mem

Octavia was in great good spirits at the prospect of the gayeties in
question She had been in remarkably good spirits for some weeks She had
received letters from Nevada containing good news she said Shares had
gone up again and her father had almost settled his affairs and it
would not be long before he would come to England She looked so
exhilarated over the matter that Lucia felt a little aggrieved Will
you be so glad to leave us Octavia she asked We shall not be so glad
to let you go We have grown very fond of you

I shall be sorry to leave you and aunt Belinda is going with us You
dont expect me to be very fond of Slowbridge do you and to be sorry I
cant take Mrs Burnhamand the rest

Barold was present when she made this speech and it rather rankled

Am I one of the rest he inquired the first time he found himself
alone with her He was sufficiently piqued to forget his usual hauteur
and discretion

Would you like to be she said

Oh Very muchvery muchnaturally he replied severely

They were standing near a rosebush in the garden and she plucked a
rose and regarded it with deep interest

Well she said next I must say I think I shouldnt have had such a
good time if you hadnt been here You have made it livelier

Thaanks he remarked You are most kind

Oh she answered its true If it wasnt I shouldnt say it You and
Mr Burmistone and Mr Poppleton have certainly made it livelier

He went home in such a bad humor that his host who was rather happier
than usual commented upon his grave aspect at dinner

You look as if you had heard ill news old fellow he said Whats
up

Oh nothing he was answered sardonically nothing whateverunless
that I have been rather snubbed by a young lady from Nevada

Ah with great seriousness thats rather cool isnt it

Its her little way said Barold It seems to be one of the customs
of Nevada

In fact he was very savage indeed He felt that he had condescended a
good deal lately He seldom bestowed his time on women and when he did
so at rare intervals he chose those who would do the most honor to his
taste at the least cost of trouble And he was obliged to confess to
himself that he had broken his rule in this case Upon analyzing his
motives and necessities he found that after all he must have extended
his visit simply because he chose to see more of this young woman from
Nevada and that really upon the whole he had borne a good deal from
her Sometimes he had been much pleased with her and very well
entertained but often enoughin fact rather too oftenshe had made
him exceedingly uncomfortable Her manners were not what he was
accustomed to she did not consider that all men were not to be regarded
from the same point of view Perhaps he did not put into definite words
the noble and patriotic sentiment that an Englishman was not to be
regarded from the same point of view as an American and that though all
this sort of thing might do with fellows in New York it was scarcely
what an Englishman would stand Perhaps as I say he had not put this
sentiment into words but it is quite certain that it had been uppermost
in his mind upon more occasions than one As he thought their
acquaintance over this evening he was rather severe upon Octavia He
even was roused so far as to condescend to talk her over with Burmistone

If she had been well brought up he said she would have been a
different creature

Very different I have no doubt said Burmistone thoughtfully When
you say well brought up by the way do you mean brought up like your
cousin Miss Gaston

There is a medium said Barold loftily I regret to say Lady Theobald
has not hit upon it

Well as you say commented Mr Burmistone I suppose there is a
medium

A charming wife she would make for a man with a position to maintain
remarked Barold with a short and somewhat savage laugh

Octavia Bassett queried Burmistone Thats true But I am afraid she
wouldnt enjoy itif you are supposing the man to be an Englishman
brought up in the regulation groove

Ah exclaimed Barold impatiently I was not looking at it from her
point of view but from his

Mr Burmistone slipped his hands in his pockets and jingled his keys
slightly as he did once before in an earlier part of this narrative

Ah from his he repeated Not from hers His point of view would
differ from hersnaturally

Barold flashed a little and took his cigar from his mouth to knock off
the ashes

A man is not necessarily a snob he said because he is cool enough
not to lose his head where a woman is concerned You cant marry a woman
who will make mistakes and attract universal attention by her conduct

Has it struck you that Octavia Bassett would inquired Burmistone

She would do as she chose said Barold petulantly She would do things
which were unusual but I was not referring to her in particular Why
should I

Ah said Burmistone I only thought of her because it did not strike
me that one would ever feel she had exactly blundered She is not easily
embarrassed There is a sangfroid about her which carries things off

Ah deigned Barold she has sangfroid enough and to spare

He was silent for some time afterward and sat smoking later than usual
When he was about to leave the room for the night he made an
announcement for which his host was not altogether prepared

When the fte is over my dear fellow he said I must go back to
London and I shall be deucedly sorry to do it

Look here said Burmistone thats a new idea isnt it

No an old one but I have been putting the thing off from day to day
By Jove I did not think it likely that I should put it off the day I
landed here

And he laughed rather uneasily




CHAPTER XXIII

MAY I GO


The very day after this Octavia opened the fourth trunk She had had it
brought down from the garret when there came a summons on the door and
Lucia Gaston appeared

Lucia was very pale and her large soft eyes wore a decidedly frightened
look She seemed to have walked fast and was out of breath Evidently
something had happened

Octavia she said Mr Dugald Binnie is at Oldclough

Who is he

He is my granduncle explained Lucia tremulously He has a great deal
of money GrandmammaShe stopped short and colored and drew her
slight figure up I do not quite understand grandmamma Octavia she
said Last night she came to my room to talk to me and this morning she
came again andoh she broke out indignantly how could she speak to
me in such a manner

What did she say inquired Octavia

She said a great many things with great spirit It took her a long
time to say them and I do not wonder at it It would have taken me a
hundred years if I had been in her place II was wrong to say I did
not understand her I didbefore she had finished

What did you understand

She was afraid to tell me in plain wordsI never saw her afraid
before but she was afraid She has been arranging my future for me and
it does not occur to her that I dare object That is because she knows I
am a coward and despises me for itand it is what I deserve If I make
the marriage she chooses she thinks Mr Binnie will leave me his money
I am to run after a man who does not care for me and make myself
attractive in the hope that he will condescend to marry me because Mr
Binnie may leave me his money Do you wonder that it took even Lady
Theobald a long time to say that

Well remarked Octavia you wont do it I suppose I wouldnt worry
She wants you to marry Mr Barold I suppose

Lucia started

How did you guess she exclaimed

Oh I always knew it I didnt guess And she smiled ever so faintly
That is one of the reasons why she loathes me so she added

Lucia thought deeply for a moment she recognized all at once several
things she had been mystified by before

Oh it is It is she said And she has thought of it all the time
when I never suspected her

Octavia smiled a little again Lucia sat thinking her hands clasped
tightly

I am glad I came here she said at length I am angry now and I
see things more clearly If she had only thought of it because Mr Binnie
came I could have forgiven her more easily but she has been making
coarse plans all the time and treating me with contempt Octavia she
added turning upon her with flushing cheeks and sparkling eyes I
think that for the first time in my life I am in a passiona real
passion I think I shall never be afraid of her any more Her delicate
nostrils were dilated she held her head up her breath came fast There
was a hint of exultation in her tone Yes she said I am in a
passion And I am not afraid of her at all I will go home and tell her
what I think

And it is quite probable that she would have done so but for a trifling
incident which occurred before she reached her ladyship

She walked very fast after she left the house She wanted to reach
Oldclough before one whit of her anger cooled down though somehow she
felt quite sure that even when her anger died out her courage would
not take flight with it Mr Dugald Binnie had not proved to be a very
fascinating person He was an acrid dictatorial old man he contradicted
Lady Theobald flatly every five minutes and bullied his manservant But
it was not against him that Lucias indignation was aroused She felt
that Lady Theobald was quite capable of suggesting to him that Francis
Barold would be a good match for her and if she had done so it was
scarcely his fault if he had accepted the idea She understood now why
she had been allowed to visit Octavia and why divers other things had
happened She had been sent to walk with Francis Barold he had been
almost reproached when he had not called perhaps her ladyship had been
good enough to suggest to him that it was his duty to further her plans
She was as capable of that as of any thing else which would assist her to
gain her point The girls cheeks grew hotter and hotter her eyes
brighter at every step because every step brought some new thought her
hands trembled and her heart beat

I shall never be afraid of her again she said as she turned the
corner into the road Never never

And at that very moment a gentleman stepped out of the wood at her right
and stopped before her

She started back with a cry

Mr Burmistone she said Mr Burmistone

She wondered if he had heard her last words she fancied he had He took
hold of her shaking little hand and looked down at her excited face

I am glad I waited for you he said in the quietest possible tone
Something is the matter

She knew there would be no use in trying to conceal the truth and she
was not in the mood to make the effort She scarcely knew herself

She gave quite a fierce little laugh

I am angry she said You have never seen me angry before I am on my
way to myto Lady Theobald

He held her hand as calmly as before He understood a great deal more
than she could have imagined

What are you going to say to her he asked She laughed again

I am going to ask her what she means I am going to tell her she has
made a mistake I am going to prove to her that I am not such a coward
after all I am going to tell her that I dare disobey herthat is
what I am going to say to her she concluded decisively

He held her hand rather closer

Let us take a stroll in the copse and talk it over he said It is
deliciously cool there

I dont want to be cool she said But he drew her gently with him and
a few steps took them into the shade of the young oaks and pines and
there he paused

She has made you very angry he said

And then almost before she knew what she was doing she was pouring
forth the whole of her story even more of it than she had told Octavia
She had not at all intended to do it but she did it nevertheless

I am to marry Mr Francis Barold if he will take me she said with a
bitter little smileMr Francis Barold who is so much in love with
me as you know His mother approves of the match and sent him here to
make love to me which he has done as you have seen I have no money of
my own but if I make a marriage which pleases him Dugald Binnie will
probably leave me hiswhich it is thought will be an inducement to my
cousin who needs one If I marry him or rather he marries me Lady
Theobald thinks Mr Binnie will be pleased It does not even matter
whether Francis is pleased or not and of course I am out of the
question but it is hoped that it will please Mr Binnie The two ladies
have talked it over and decided the matter I dare say they have offered
me to Francis who has very likely refused me though perhaps he may be
persuaded to relent in timeif I am very humble and he is shown the
advantage of having Mr Binnies money added to his ownbut I have no
doubt I shall have to be very humble indeed That is what I learned from
Lady Theobald last night and it is what I am going to talk to her about
Is it enough to make one angry do you think Is it enough

He did not tell her whether he thought it enough or not He looked at
her with steady eyes

Lucia he said I wish you would let me go and talk with Lady
Theobald

You she said with a little start

Yes he answered Let me go to her Let me tell her that instead of
marrying Francis Barold you will marry me If you will say yes to
that I think I can promise that you need never be afraid of her any
more The fierce color died out of her cheeks and the tears rushed to
her eyes She raised her face with a pathetic look

Oh she whispered you must be very sorry for me I think you have
been sorry for me from the first

I am desperately in love with you he answered in his quietest way I
have been desperately in love with you from the first May I go

She looked at him for a moment incredulously Then she faltered

Yes

She still looked up at him and then in spite of her happiness or
perhaps because of it she suddenly began to cry softly and forgot she
had been angry at all as he took her into his strong kind arms




CHAPTER XXIV

THE GARDENPARTY


The morning of the gardenparty arose bright and clear and Slowbridge
awakened in a great state of excitement Miss Chickie having worked
until midnight that all her orders might be completed was so overpowered
by her labors as to have to take her tea and toast in bed

At Oldclough varied sentiments prevailed Lady Theobalds manner was
chiefly distinguished by an implacable rigidity She had chosen as an
appropriate festal costume a funerealblack moire antique enlivened
by massive fringes and ornaments of jet her jewelry being chains and
manacles of the latter which rattled as she moved with a sound somewhat
suggestive of bones

Mr Dugald Binnie who had received an invitation had as yet amiably
forborne to say whether he would accept it or not He had been out when
Mr Burmistone called and had not seen him

When Lady Theobald descended to breakfast she found him growling over
his newspaper and he glanced up at her with a polite scowl

Going to a funeral he demanded

I accompany my granddaughter to thisthis entertainment her ladyship
responded It is scarcely a joyous occasion to my mind

No need to dress yourself like that if it isnt ejaculated Mr
Binnie Why dont you stay at home if you dont want to go Mans all
right isnt he Once knew a man by the name of Burmistone myself One
of the few decent fellows Ive met If I were sure this was the same man
Id go myself When I find a fellow whos neither knave nor fool I stick
to him Believe Ill send to find out Wheres Lucia

What his opinion of Lucia was it was difficult to discover He had an
agreeable habit of staring at her over the top of his paper and over his
dinner The only time he had made any comment upon her was the first
time he saw her in the dress she had copied from Octavias Nice gown
that he blurted out didnt get it here Ill wager

Its an old dress I remodelled answered Lucia somewhat alarmed I
made it myself

Doesnt look like it he said gruffly

Lucia had touched up another dress and was very happy in the prospect of
wearing it at the gardenparty

Dont call on grandmamma until after Wednesday she had said to Mr
Burmistone perhaps she wouldnt let me go She will be very angry
I am sure

And you are not afraid

No she answered I am not afraid at all I shall not be afraid
again

In fact she had perfectly confounded her ladyship by her demeanor She
bore her fiercest glance without quailing in the least or making any
effort to evade it under her most scathing comments she was composed and
unmoved On the first occasion of my ladys referring to her plans for
her future she received a blow which fairly stunned her The girl rose
from her chair and looked her straight in the face unflinchingly and
with a suggestion of hauteur not easy to confront

I beg you will not speak to me of that again she said I will not
listen And turning about she walked out of the room

This her ladyship had said in sepulchral tones when she recovered her
breath this is one of the results of Miss Octavia Bassett And nothing
more had been said on the subject since

No one in Slowbridge was in more brilliant spirits than Octavia herself
on the morning of the fte Before breakfast Miss Belinda was startled
by the arrival of another telegram which ran as follows

Arrived today per Russia Be with you tomorrow evening Friend with
me

MARTIN BASSETT

On reading this communication Miss Belinda burst into floods of
delighted tears

Dear dear Martin she wept to think that we should meet again Why
didnt he let us know he was on the way I should have been so anxious
that I should not have slept at all

Well remarked Octavia I suppose that would have been an advantage

Suddenly she approached Miss Belinda kissed her and disappeared out of
the room as if by magic not returning for a quarter of an hour looking
rather soft and moist and brilliant about the eyes when she did return

Octavia was a marked figure upon the grounds at that gardenparty

Another dress my dear remarked Mrs Burnham And what a charming
color she has I declare She is usually paler Perhaps we owe this to
Lord Lansdowne

Her dress is becoming at all events privately remarked Miss Lydia
Burnham whose tastes had not been consulted about her own

It is she who is becoming said her sister it is not the dress so
much though her clothes always have a look some way Shes prettier
than ever today and is enjoying herself

She was enjoying herself Mr Francis Barold observed it rather gloomily
as he stood apart She was enjoying herself so much that she did not
seem to notice that he had avoided her instead of going up to claim her
attention Half a dozen men were standing about her and making
themselves agreeable and she was apparently quite equal to the
emergencies of the occasion The young men from Broadoaks had at once
attached themselves to her train

I say Barold they had said to him why didnt you tell us about
this Jolly good fellow you are to come mooning here for a couple of
months and keep it all to yourself

And then had come Lord Lansdowne who in crossing the lawn to shake
hands with his host had been observed to keep his eye fixed upon one
particular point

Burmistone he said after having spoken his first words who is that
tall girl in white

And in ten minutes Lady Theobald Mrs Burnham Mr Barold and divers
others too numerous to mention saw him standing at Octavias side
evidently with no intention of leaving it

Not long after this Francis Barold found his way to Miss Belinda who was
very busy and rather nervous

Your niece is evidently enjoying herself he remarked

Octavia is most happy today answered Miss Belinda Her father will
reach Slowbridge this evening She has been looking forward to his coming
with great anxiety

Ah commented Barold

Very few people understand Octavia said Miss Belinda Im not sure
that I follow all her moods myself She is more affectionate than people
fancy Sheshe has very pretty ways I am very fond of her She is not
as frivolous as she appears to those who dont know her well

Barold stood gnawing his mustache and made no reply He was not very
comfortable He felt himself illused by Fate and rather wished he had
returned to London from Broadoaks instead of loitering in Slowbridge He
had amused himself at first but in time he had been surprised to find
his amusement lose something of its zest He glowered across the lawn at
the group under a certain beechtree and as he did so Octavia turned
her face a little and saw him She stood waving her fan slowly and
smiling at him in a calm way which reminded him very much of the time he
had first caught sight of her at Lady Theobalds high tea

He condescended to saunter over the grass to where she stood Once there
he proceeded to make himself as disagreeable as possible in a silent and
lofty way He felt it only due to himself that he should He did not
approve at all of the manner in which Lansdowne kept by her

Its deucedly bad form on his part he said mentally What does he
mean by it

Octavia on the contrary did not ask what he meant by it She chose to
seem rather well entertained and did not notice that she was being
frowned down There was no reason why she should not find Lord Lansdowne
entertaining he was an agreeable young fellow with an inexhaustible
fund of good spirits and no nonsense about him

He was fond of all pleasant novelty and Octavia was a pleasant novelty
He had been thinking of paying a visit to America and he asked
innumerable questions concerning that country all of which Octavia
answered

I know half a dozen fellows who have been there he said And they all
enjoyed it tremendously

If you go to Nevada you must visit the mines at Bloody Gulch she
said

Where he ejaculated I say what a name Dont deride my youth and
ignorance Miss Bassett

You can call it LArgentville if you would rather she replied

I would rather try the other thank you he laughed It has a more
hilarious sound Will they despise me at Bloody Gulch Miss Bassett I
never killed a man in my life

Barold turned and walked away angry and more melancholy than he could
have believed

It is time I went back to London he chose to put it The place begins
to be deucedly dull

Mr Francis Barold seems rather out of spirits said Mrs Burnham to
Lady Theobald Lord Lansdowne interferes with his pleasure

I had not observed it answered her ladyship And it is scarcely
likely that Mr Francis Barold would permit his pleasure to be interfered
with even by the son of the Marquis of Lauderdale

But she glared at Barold as he passed and beckoned to him

Where is Lucia she demanded

I saw her with Burmistone half an hour ago he answered coldly Have
you any message for my mother I shall return to London tomorrow
leaving here early

She turned quite pale She had not counted upon this at all and it was
extremely inopportune

What has happened she asked rigidly

He looked slightly surprised

Nothing whatever he replied I have remained here longer than I
intended

She began to move the manacles on her right wrist He made not the
smallest profession of reluctance to go She said at last If you will
find Lucia you will oblige me She was almost uncivil to Miss Pilcher
who chanced to join her after he was gone She had not the slightest
intention of allowing her plans to be frustrated and was only roused to
fresh obstinacy by encountering indifference on one side and rebellion on
the other She had not brought Lucia up under her own eye for nothing
She had been disturbed of late but by no means considered herself
baffled With the assistance of Mr Dugald Binnie she could certainly
subdue Lucia though Mr Dugald Binnie had been of no great help so far
She would do her duty unflinchingly In fact she chose to persuade
herself that if Lucia was brought to a proper frame of mind there
could be no real trouble with Francis Barold




CHAPTER XXV

SOMEBODY ELSE


But Barold did not make any very ardent search for Lucia He stopped to
watch a game of lawntennis in which Octavia and Lord Lansdowne had
joined and finally forgot Lady Theobalds errand altogether

For some time Octavia did not see him She was playing with great spirit
and Lord Lansdowne was following her delightedly

Finally a chance of the game bringing her to him she turned suddenly
and found Barolds eyes fixed upon her

How long have you been there she asked

Some time he answered When you are at liberty I wish to speak to
you

Do you she said

She seemed a little unprepared for the repressed energy of his manner
which he strove to cover by a greater amount of coldness than usual

Well she said after thinking a moment the game will soon be ended
I am going through the conservatories with Lord Lansdowne in course of
time but I dare say he can wait

She went back and finished her game apparently enjoying it as much as
ever When it was over Barold made his way to her

He had resented her remaining oblivious of his presence when he stood
near her and he had resented her enjoyment of her surroundings and now
as he led her away leaving Lord Lansdowne rather disconsolate he
resented the fact that she did not seem nervous or at all impressed by
his silence

What do you want to say to me she asked Let us go and sit down in
one of the arbors I believe I am a little tirednot that I mind it
though Ive been having a lovely time

Then she began to talk about Lord Lansdowne

I like him ever so much she said Do you think he will really go to
America I wish he would but if he does I hope it wont be for a year
or soI mean until we go back from Europe Still its rather uncertain
when we shall go back Did I tell you I had persuaded aunt Belinda to
travel with us Shes horribly frightened but I mean to make her go
Shell get over being frightened after a little while

Suddenly she turned and looked at him

Why dont you say something she demanded Whats the matter

It is not necessary for me to say any thing

She laughed

Do you mean because I am saying every thing myself Well I suppose I
am I amawfully happy today and cant help talking It seems to make
the time go

Her face had lighted up curiously There was a delighted excitement in
her eyes puzzling him

Are you so fond of your father as all that

She laughed againa clear exultant laugh

Yes she answered of course I am as fond of him as all that Its
quite natural isnt it

I havent observed the same degree of enthusiasm in all the young ladies
of my acquaintance he returned dryly

He thought such rapture disproportionate to the cause and regarded it
grudgingly

They turned into an arbor and Octavia sat down and leaned forward on
the rustic table Then she turned her face up to look at the vines
covering the roof

It looks rather spidery doesnt it she remarked I hope it isnt
dont you

The light fell bewitchingly on her round little chin and white throat
and a bar of sunlight struck on her upturned eyes and the blonde rings
on her forehead

There is nothing I hate more than spiders she said with a little
shiver unless seriously its caterpillarsand caterpillars I
loathe

Then she lowered her gaze and gave her hata large white Rubens all
soft curling feathers and satin bowsa charming tip over her eyes

The brim is broad she said If any thing drops I hope it will drop
on it instead of on me Now what did you want to say He had not sat
down but stood leaning against the rustic woodwork He looked pale and
was evidently trying to be cooler than usual

I brought you here to ask you a question

Well she remarked I hope its an important one You look serious
enough

It is importantrather he responded with a tone of sarcasm You
will probably go away soon

That isnt exactly a question she commented and its not as
important to you as to me

He paused a moment annoyed because he found it difficult to go on
annoyed because she waited with such undisturbed serenity But at length
he managed to begin again

I do not think you are expecting the question I am going to ask he
said Ido not think I expected to ask it myselfuntil today I do
not know whywhy I should ask it so awkwardly and feelat such a
disadvantage I brought you here to ask youto marry me

He had scarcely spoken four words before all her airy manner had taken
flight and she had settled herself down to listen He had noticed this
and had felt it quite natural When he stopped she was looking straight
into his face Her eyes were singularly large and bright and clear

You did not expect to ask me to marry you she said Why didnt you

It was not at all what he had expected He did not understand her manner
at all

Imust confess he said stiffly that I felt at first that there
wereobstacles in the way of my doing so

What were the obstacles

He flushed and drew himself up

I have been unfortunate in my mode of expressing myself he said I
told you I was conscious of my own awkwardness

Yes she said quietly you have been unfortunate That is a good way
of putting it

Then she let her eyes rest on the table a few seconds and thought a
little

After all she said I have the consolation of knowing that you must
have been very much in love with me If you had not been very much in
love with me you would never have asked me to marry you You would have
considered the obstacles

I am very much in love with you he said vehemently his feelings
getting the better of his pride for once However badly I may have
expressed myself I am very much in love with you I have been wretched
for days

Was it because you felt obliged to ask me to marry you she inquired

The delicate touch of spirit in her tone and words fired him to fresh
admiration strange to say It suggested to him possibilities he had not
suspected hitherto He drew nearer to her

Dont be too severe on me he saidquite humbly considering all
things

And he stretched out his hand as if to take hers

But she drew it back smiling ever so faintly

Do you think I dont know what the obstacles are she said I will
tell you

My affection was strong enough to sweep them away he said or I
should not be here

She smiled slightly again

I know all about them as well as you do she said I rather laughed
at them at first but I dont now I suppose Im impressed by their
seriousness as aunt Belinda says I suppose they are pretty
seriousto you

Nothing would be so serious to me as that you should let them interfere
with my happiness he answered thrown back upon himself and bewildered
by her logical manner Let us forget them I was a fool to speak as I
did Wont you answer my question

She paused a second and then answered

You didnt expect to ask me to marry you she said And I didnt
expect you to

But nowhe broke in impatiently

NowI wish you hadnt done it

You wish

You dont want me she said You want somebody meekersomebody
who would respect you very much and obey you Im not used to obeying
people

Do you mean also that you would not respect me he inquired bitterly

Oh she replied you havent respected me much

Excuse mehe began in his loftiest manner

You didnt respect me enough to think me worth marrying she said I
was not the kind of girl you would have chosen of your own will

You are treating me unfairly he cried

You were going to give me a great deal I supposelooking at it in your
way she went on but if I wasnt exactly what you wanted I had
something to give too Im young enough to have a good many years to
live and I should have to live them with you if I married you Thats
something you know

He rose from his seat pale with wrath and wounded feeling

Does this mean that you refuse me he demanded that your answer is
no

She rose toonot exultant not confused neither pale nor flushed He
had never seen her prettier more charming or more natural

It would have been no even if there hadnt been any obstacle
she answered

Then he said I need say no more I see that I havehumiliated
myself in vain and it is rather bitter I must confess

It wasnt my fault she remarked

He stepped back with a haughty wave of the hand signifying that she
should pass out of the arbor before him

She did so but just as she reached the entrance she turned and stood
for a second framed in by the swinging vines and their blossoms

Theres another reason why it should be no she said I suppose I
may as well tell you of it Im engaged to somebody else




CHAPTER XXVI

JACK


The first person they saw when they reached the lawn was Mr Dugald
Binnie who had deigned to present himself and was talking to Mr
Burmistone Lucia and Miss Belinda

Ill go to them said Octavia Aunt Belinda will wonder where I have
been

But before they reached the group they were intercepted by Lord
Lansdowne and Barold had the pleasure of surrendering his charge and
watching her with some rather sharp pangs as she was borne off to the
conservatories

What is the matter with Mr Barold exclaimed Miss Pilcher Pray
look at him

He has been talking to Miss Octavia Bassett in one of the arbors put
in Miss Lydia Burnham Emily and I passed them a few minutes ago and
they were so absorbed that they did not see us There is no knowing what
has happened

Lydia exclaimed Mrs Burnham in stern reproof of such flippancy

But the next moment she exchanged a glance with Miss Pilcher

Do you thinkshe suggested Is it possible

It really looks very like it said Miss Pilcher though it is scarcely
to be credited See how pale and angry he looks

Mrs Burnham glanced toward him and then a slight smile illuminated her
countenance

How furious she remarked cheerfully how furious Lady Theobald will
be

Naturally it was not very long before the attention of numerous other
ladies was directed to Mr Francis Barold It was observed that he took
no share in the festivities that he did not regain his natural air of
enviable indifference to his surroundingsthat he did not approach
Octavia Bassett until all was over and she was on the point of going
home What he said to her then no one heard

I am going to London tomorrow Goodby

Goodby she answered holding out her hand to him Then she added
quickly in an undertone You oughtnt to think badly of me You wont
after a while

As they drove homeward she was rather silent and Miss Belinda remarked
it

I am afraid you are tired Octavia she said It is a pity that Martin
should come and find you tired

Oh Im not tired I was onlythinking It has been a queer day

A queer day my dear ejaculated Miss Belinda I thought it a charming
day

So it has been said Octavia which Miss Belinda thought rather
inconsistent

Both of them grew rather restless as they neared the house

To think said Miss Belinda of my seeing poor Martin again

Suppose said Octavia nervously as they drew up suppose they are
herealready

They exclaimed Miss Belinda Whobut she got no farther A cry
burst from Octaviaa queer soft little cry They are here she
said they are JackJack

And she was out of the carriage and Miss Belinda following her
closely was horrified to see her caught at once in the embrace of a
tall bronzed young man who a moment after drew her into the little
parlor and shut the door

Mr Martin Bassett who was big and sunburned and prosperouslooking
stood in the passage smiling triumphantly

MMMartin gasped Miss Belinda Whatoh what does this mean

Martin Bassett led her to a seat and smiled more triumphantly still

Never mind Belinda he said Dont be frightened Its Jack
Belasys and hes the finest fellow in the West And she hasnt seen
him for two years

Martin Miss Belinda fluttered it is not properit really isnt

Yes it is answered Mr Bassett for hes going to marry her before
we go abroad

It was an eventful day for all parties concerned At its close Lady
Theobald found herself in an utterly bewildered and thunderstruck
condition And to Mr Dugald Binnie more than to any one else her
demoralization was due That gentleman got into the carriage in rather a
better humor than usual

Same man I used to know he remarked Glad to see him I knew him as
soon as I set eyes on him

Do you allude to Mr Burmistone

Yes Had a long talk with him Hes coming to see you tomorrow Told
him he might come myself Appears hes taken a fancy to Lucia Wants to
talk it over Suits me exactly and suppose it suits her Looks as if it
does Glad she hasnt taken a fancy to some hawhaw fellow like that
fool Barold Girls generally do Burmistones worth ten of him

Lucia who had been looking steadily out of the carriagewindow turned
with an amazed expression Lady Theobald had received a shock which made
all her manacles rattle She could scarcely support herself under it

Do Ishe said Am I to understand that Mr Francis Barold does not
meet with your approval Mr Binnie struck his stick sharply upon the
floor of the carriage

Yes by George he said Ill have nothing to do with chaps like that
If shed taken up with him shed never have heard from me again Make
sure of that

When they reached Oldclough her ladyship followed Lucia to her room She
stood before her arranging the manacles on her wrists nervously

I begin to understand now she said I find I was mistaken in my
impressions of Mr Dugald Binnies tastesand in my impressions of
you You are to marry Mr Burmistone My rule is over Permit me to
congratulate you

The tears rose to Lucias eyes

Grandmamma she said her voice soft and broken I think I should have
been more frank ifif you had been kinder sometimes

I have done my duty by you said my lady

Lucia looked at her pathetically

I have been ashamed to keep things from you she hesitated And I have
often told myself thatthat it was sly to do itbut I could not help
it

I trust said my lady that you will be more candid with Mr
Burmistone

Lucia blushed guiltily

Ithink I shall grandmamma she said

It was the Rev Alfred Poppleton who assisted the rector of St James to
marry Jack Belasys and Octavia Bassett and it was observed that he was
almost as pale as his surplice

Slowbridge had never seen such a wedding or such a bride as Octavia It
was even admitted that Jack Belasys was a singularly handsome fellow and
had a dashing adventurous air which carried all before it There was a
rumor that he owned silvermines himself and had even done something in
diamonds in Brazil where he had spent the last two years At all
events it was ascertained beyond doubt that being at last a married
woman and entitled to splendors of the kind Octavia would not lack
them Her present to Lucia who was one of her bridesmaids dazzled all
beholders When she was borne away by the train with her father and
husband and Miss Belinda whose bonnetstrings were bedewed with tears
the Rev Alfred Poppleton was the last man who shook hands with her He
held in his hand a large bouquet which Octavia herself had given him out
of her abundance Slowbridge will miss you MissMrs Belasys he
faltered II shall miss you Perhaps wemay even meet again I have
thought that perhaps I should like to go to America

And as the train puffed out of the station and disappeared he stood
motionless for several seconds and a large and brilliant drop of
moisture appeared on the calyx of the lily which formed the centrepiece
of his bouquet
