      Mans family tree was awesome enough to give every galactic
      race an inferiority complexbut then he tried to climb it


In repose Taphetta the Ribboneer resembled a fancy giant bow on a
package His four flat legs looped out and in the ends tucked under
his wide thin body which constituted the knot at the middle His neck
was flat too arching out in another loop Of all his features only
his head had appreciable thickness and it was crowned with a dozen long
though narrower ribbons

Taphetta rattled the head fronds together in a surprisingly good
imitation of speech Yes Ive heard the legend

Its more than a legend said Sam Halden biologist The reaction was
not unexpectednonhumans tended to dismiss the data as convenient
speculation and nothing more There are at least a hundred kinds of
humans each supposedly originating in strict seclusion on as many
widely scattered planets Obviously there was no contact throughout the
ages before space traveland yet each planetary race can interbreed
with a minimum of ten others Thats more than a legendone hell of a
lot more

It is impressive admitted Taphetta But I find it mildly
distasteful to consider mating with someone who does not belong to my
species

Thats because youre unique said Halden Outside of your own
world theres nothing like your species except superficially and
thats true of all other creatures intelligent or not with the sole
exception of mankind Actually the four of us here though its
accidental very nearly represent the biological spectrum of human
development

Emmer a Neanderthal type and our archeologist is around the
beginning of the scale Im from Earth near the middle though on
Emmers side Meredith linguist is on the other side of the middle
And beyond her toward the far end is Kelburn mathematician Theres
a corresponding span of fertility Emmer just misses being able to
breed with my kind but theres a fair chance that Id be fertile with
Meredith and a similar though lesser chance that her fertility may
extend to Kelburn

                                   

Taphetta rustled his speech ribbons quizzically But I thought it was
proved that some humans did originate on one planet that there was an
unbroken line of evolution that could be traced back a billion years

Youre thinking of Earth said Halden Humans require a certain kind
of planet Its reasonable to assume that if men were set down on a
hundred such worlds theyd seem to fit in with native lifeforms on a
few of them Thats what happened on Earth when Man arrived there was
actually a manlike creature there Naturally our early evolutionists
stretched their theories to cover the facts they had

But there are other worlds in which humans who were there before the
Stone Age arent related to anything else there We have to conclude
that Man didnt originate on any of the planets on which he is now
found Instead he evolved elsewhere and later was scattered throughout
this section of the Milky Way

And so to account for the unique race that can interbreed across
thousands of lightyears youve brought in the big ancestor
commented Taphetta dryly It seems an unnecessary simplification

Can you think of a better explanation asked Kelburn

Something had to distribute one species so widely and its not the
result of parallel evolutionnot when a hundred human races are
involved and only the human race

I cant think of a better explanation Taphetta rearranged his
ribbons Frankly no one else is much interested in Mans theories
about himself

It was easy to understand the attitude Man was the most numerous
though not always the most advancedRibboneers had a civilization as
high as anything in the known section of the Milky Way and there were
othersand humans were more than a little feared If they ever got
togetherbut they hadnt except in agreement as to their common origin

Still Taphetta the Ribboneer was an experienced pilot and could be
very useful A clear statement of their position was essential in
helping him make up his mind Youve heard of the adjacency mating
principle asked Sam Halden

Vaguely Most people have if theyve been around men

Weve got new data and are able to interpret it better The theory is
that humans who can mate with each other were once physically close
Weve got a list of all our races arranged in sequence If planetary
race F can mate with race E back to A and forward to M and race G is
fertile only back to B but forward to O then we assume that whatever
their positions are now at once time G was actually adjacent to F but
was a little further along When we project back into time those star
systems on which humans existed prior to space travel we get a certain
pattern Kelburn can explain it to you

The normally pink body of the Ribboneer flushed slightly The color
change was almost imperceptible but it was enough to indicate that he
was interested

                                   

Kelburn went to the projector It would be easier if we knew all the
stars in the Milky Way but though weve explored only a small portion
of it we can reconstruct a fairly accurate representation of the past

He pressed the controls and stars twinkled on the screen Were
looking down on the plane of the Galaxy This is one arm of it as it is
today and here are the human systems He pressed another control and
for purposes of identification certain stars became more brilliant
There was no pattern merely a scattering of stars The whole Milky
Way is rotating And while stars in a given region tend to remain
together theres also a random motion Heres what happens when we
calculate the positions of stars in the past

Flecks of light shifted and flowed across the screen Kelburn stopped
the motion

Two hundred thousand years ago he said

There was a pattern of the identified stars They were spaced at fairly
equal intervals along a regular curve a horseshoe loop that didnt
close though if the ends were extended the lines would have crossed

Taphetta rustled The math is accurate

As accurate as it can be with a millionplus body problem

And thats the hypothetical route of the unknown ancestor

To the best of our knowledge said Kelburn And whereas there are
humans who are relatively near and not fertile they can always mate
with those they were adjacent to two hundred thousand years ago

The adjacency mating principle Ive never seen it demonstrated
murmured Taphetta flexing his ribbons Is that the only era that
satisfies the calculations

Plus or minus a hundred thousand years we can still get something
that might be the path of a spaceship attempting to cover a
representative section of territory said Kelburn However we have
other ways of dating it On some worlds on which there are no other
mammals were able to place the first human fossils chronologically
The evidence is sometimes contradictory but we believe weve got the
time right

Taphetta waved a ribbon at the chart And you think that where the two
ends of the curve cross is your original home

We think so said Kelburn Weve narrowed it down to several cubic
lightyearsthen Now its far more And of course if it were a
fastmoving star it might be completely out of the field of our
exploration But were certain weve got a good chance of finding it
this trip

It seems I must decide quickly The Ribboneer glanced out the
visionport where another ship hung motionless in space beside them
Do you mind if I ask other questions

Go ahead Kelburn invited sardonically But if its not math youd
better ask Halden Hes the leader of the expedition

Halden flushed the sarcasm wasnt necessary It was true that Kelburn
was the most advanced human type present but while there were
differences biological and in the scale of intelligence it wasnt
as great as once was thought Anyway nonhumans werent trained in
the fine distinctions that men made among themselves And higher or
lower he was as good a biologist as the other was a mathematician And
there was the matter of training hed been on several expeditions and
this was Kelburns first trip Damn it he thought that rated some
respect

The Ribboneer shifted his attention Aside from the sudden illness of
your pilot why did you ask for me

We didnt The man became sick and required treatment we cant give
him Luckily a ship was passing and we hailed it because its four
months to the nearest planet They consented to take him back and told
us that there was a passenger on board who was an experienced pilot We
have men who could do the job in a makeshift fashion but the region
were heading for while mapped is largely unknown Wed prefer to
have an expertand Ribboneers are famous for their navigational
ability

Taphetta crinkled politely at the reference to his skill I had other
plans but I cant evade professional obligations and an emergency
such as this should cancel out any previous agreements Still what are
the incentives

Sam Halden coughed The usual plus a little extra Weve copied the
Ribboneers standard nature simplifying it a little and adding a per
cent here and there for the crew pilot and scientists share of the
profits from any discoveries we may make

Im complimented that you like our contract so well said Taphetta
but I really must have our own unsimplified version If you want me
youll take my contract I came prepared He extended a tightly bound
roll that he had kept somewhere on his person

They glanced at one another as Halden took it

You can read it if you want offered Taphetta But it will take
you all dayits microprinting However you neednt be afraid that
Im defrauding you Its honored everywhere we go and we go nearly
everywhere in this sectorplaces men have never been

There was no choice if they wanted him and they did Besides the
integrity of Ribboneers was not to be questioned Halden signed

Good Taphetta crinkled Send it to the ship theyll forward it
for me And you can tell the ship to go on without me He rubbed his
ribbons together Now if youll get me the charts Ill examine the
region toward which were heading

                                   

Firmon of hydroponics slouched in a tall man with scanty hair and
an equal lack of grace He seemed to have difficulty in taking his
eyes off Meredith though since he was a notch or so above her in the
mating scale he shouldnt have been so interested But his planet had
been inexplicably slow in developing and he wasnt completely aware of
his place in the human hierarchy

Disdainfully Meredith adjusted a skirt that a few inches shorter
wouldnt have been a skirt at all revealing while doing so just how
long and beautiful a womans legs could be Her people had never given
much thought to physical modesty and with legs like that it was easy
to see why

Muttering something about primitive women Firmon turned to the
biologist The pilot doesnt like our air

Then change it to suit him Hes in charge of the ship and knows more
about these things than I do

More than a man Firmon leered at Meredith and when she failed
to smile added plaintively I did try to change it but he still
complains

                                   

Halden took a deep breath Seems all right to me

To everybody else too but the tapeworm hasnt got lungs He breathes
through a million tubes scattered over his body

It would do no good to explain that Taphetta wasnt a worm that his
evolution had taken a different course but that he was in no sense
less complex than Man It was a paradox that some biologically higher
humans hadnt developed as much as lower races and actually werent
prepared for the multitude of lifeforms theyd meet in space Firmons
reaction was quite typical

If he asks for cleaner air its because his system needs it said
Halden Do anything you can to give it to him

Cant This is as good as I can get it Taphetta thought you could do
something about it

Hydroponics is your job Theres nothing I can do Halden paused
thoughtfully Is there something wrong with the plants

In a way I guess and yet not really

What is it some kind of toxic condition

The plants are healthy enough but somethings chewing them down as
fast as they grow

Insects There shouldnt be any but if there are weve got sprays
Use them

Its an animal said Firmon We tried poison and got a few but now
they wont touch the stuff I had electronics rig up some traps The
animals seem to know what they are and weve never caught one that
way

Halden glowered at the man How long has this been going on

About three months Its not bad we can keep up with them

It was probably nothing to become alarmed at but an animal on the ship
was a nuisance doubly so because of their pilot

Tell me what you know about it said Halden

Theyre little things Firmon held out his hands to show how small
I dont know how they got on but once they did there were plenty of
places to hide He looked up defensively This is an old ship with
new equipment and they hide under the machinery Theres nothing we can
do except rebuild the ship from the hull inward

Firmon was right The new equipment had been installed in any place
just to get it in and now there were inaccessible corners and crevices
everywhere that couldnt be closed off without rebuilding

They couldnt set up a continuous watch and shoot the animals down
because there werent that many men to spare Besides the use of
weapons in hydroponics would cause more damage to the thing they were
trying to protect than to the pest Hed have to devise other ways

Sam Halden got up Ill take a look and see what I can do

Ill come along and help said Meredith untwining her legs and
leaning against him Your mistress ought to have some sort of
privileges

Halden started So she knew that the crew was calling her that
Perhaps it was intended to discourage Firmon but he wished she hadnt
said it It didnt help the situation at all

                                   

Taphetta sat in a chair designed for humans With a less flexible body
he wouldnt have fitted Maybe it wasnt sitting but his flat legs
were folded neatly around the arms and his head rested comfortably on
the seat The head ribbons which were his hands and voice were never
quite still

He looked from Halden to Emmer and back again The hydroponics tech
tells me youre contemplating an experiment I dont like it

Halden shrugged Weve got to have better air It might work

Pests on the ship Its filthy My people would never tolerate it

Neither do we

The Ribboneers distaste subsided What kind of creatures are they

I have a description though Ive never seen one Its a small
fourlegged animal with two antennae at the lower base of its skull A
typical pest

Taphetta rustled Have you found out how it got on

It was probably brought in with the supplies said the biologist
Considering how far weve come it may have been any one of a half
a dozen planets Anyway it hid and since most of the places it had
access to were near the outer hull it got an extra dose of hard
radiation or it may have nested near the atomic engines both are
possibilities Either way it mutated became a different animal Its
developed a tolerance for the poisons we spray on plants Other things
it detects and avoids even electronic traps

Then you believe it changed mentally as well as physically that its
smarter

Id say that yes It must be a fairly intelligent creature to be
so hard to get rid of But it can be lured into traps if the baits
strong enough

Thats what I dont like said Taphetta curling Let me think it
over while I ask questions He turned to Emmer Im curious about
humans Is there anything else you can tell me about the hypothetical
ancestor

Emmer didnt look like the genius he wasa Neanderthal genius but
nonetheless a real one In his field he rated very high He raised a
stubbleflecked cheek from a large thickfingered paw and ran shaggy
hands through shaggier hair

I can speak with some authority he rumbled I was born on a world
with the most extensive relics As a child I played in the ruins of
their camp

I dont question your authority crinkled Taphetta To me all
humanslate or early and male or femalelook remarkably alike If you
are an archeologist thats enough for me He paused and flicked his
speech ribbons Camp did you say

                                   

Emmer smiled unsheathing great teeth Youve never seen any pictures
Impressive but just a camp monolithic onestory structures and
wed give something to know what theyre made of Presumably my world
was one of the first they stopped at They werent used to roughing
it so they built more elaborately than they did later on Onestory
structures and thats how we can guess at their size The doorways were
forty feet high

Very large agreed Taphetta It was difficult to tell whether he was
impressed What did you find in the ruins

Nothing said Emmer There were buildings there and that was all
not a scrap of writing or a tool or a single picture They covered
a route estimated at thirty thousand lightyears in less than five
thousand yearsand not one of them died that we have a record of

A fasterthanlight drive and an extremely long life mused Taphetta
But they didnt leave any information for their descendants Why

Who knows Their mental processes were certainly far different from
ours They may have thought wed be better off without it We do know
they were looking for a special kind of planet like Earth because
they visited so many of that type yet different from it because they
never stayed They were pretty special people themselves big and
longlived and maybe they couldnt survive on any planet they found
Perhaps they had ways of determining there wasnt the kind of planet
they needed in the entire Milky Way Their science was tremendously
advanced and when they learned that they may have altered their germ
plasm and left us hoping that some of us would survive Most of us
did

This special planet sounds strange murmured Taphetta

Not really said Emmer Fifty human races reached space travel
independently and those who did were scattered equally among early and
late species Its well known that individuals among my people are
often as bright as any of Haldens or Merediths but as a whole we
dont have the total capacity that later Man does and yet were as
advanced in civilization The difference It must lie somewhere in the
planets we live on and its hard to say just what it is

What happened to those who didnt develop space travel asked
Taphetta

We helped them said Emmer

And they had no matter who or what they were biologically late
or early in the depths of the bronze age or the threshold of
atomicbecause they were human That was sometimes a frightening thing
for nonhumans that the race stuck together They werent actually
aggressive but their total number was great and they held themselves
aloof The unknown ancestor again Who else had such an origin and it
was tacitly assumed such a destiny

                                   

Taphetta changed his questioning What do you expect to gain from this
discovery of the unknown ancestor

It was Halden who answered him Theres the satisfaction of knowing
where we came from

Of course rustled the Ribboneer But a lot of money and equipment
was required for this expedition I cant believe that the educational
institutions that are backing you did so purely out of intellectual
curiosity

Cultural discoveries rumbled Emmer How did our ancestors live
When a creature is greatly reduced in size as we are more than
physiology is changedthe pattern of life itself is altered Things
that were easy for them are impossible for us Look at their life span

No doubt said Taphetta An archeologist would be interested in
cultural discoveries

Two hundred thousand years ago they had an extremely advanced
civilization added Halden A fasterthanlight drive and weve
achieved that only within the last thousand years

But I think we have a better one than they did said the Ribboneer
There may be things we can learn from them in mechanics or physics
but wouldnt you say they were better biologists than anything else

Halden nodded Agreed They couldnt find a suitable planet So
working directly with their germ plasm they modified themselves and
produced us They were master biologists

I thought so said Taphetta I never paid much attention to your
fantastic theories before I signed to pilot this ship but youve built
up a convincing case He raised his head speech ribbons curling
fractionally and ceaselessly I dont like to but well have to risk
using bait for your pest

Hed have done it anyway but it was better to have the pilots
consent And there was one question Halden wanted to ask it had been
bothering him vaguely Whats the difference between the Ribboneer
contract and the one we offered you Our terms are more liberal

To the individual they are but it wont matter if you discover as
much as you think you will The difference is this My terms dont
permit you to withhold any discovery for the benefit of one race

Taphetta was wrong there had been no intention of withholding
anything Halden examined his own attitudes He hadnt intended but
could he say that was true of the institutions backing the expedition
He couldnt and it was too late nowwhatever knowledge they acquired
would have to be shared

That was what Taphetta had been afraid ofthere was one kind of
technical advancement that multiplied unceasingly The race that could
improve itself through scientific control of its germ plasm had a start
that could never be headed The Ribboneer neednt worry now

                                   

Why do we have to watch it on the screen asked Meredith glancing
up Id rather be in hydroponics

Halden shrugged They may or may not be smarter than planetbound
animals but theyre warier They dont come out when anyones near

Lights dimmed in the distant hydroponic section and the screen with
it until he adjusted the infrared frequencies He motioned to the
two crew members each with his own peculiar screen below which was a
miniature keyboard

Ready

When they nodded Halden said Do as youve rehearsed Keep noise at
a minimum but when you do use it be vague Dont try to imitate them
exactly

At first nothing happened on the big screen and then a gray shape
crept out It slid through leaves listened intently before coming
forward It jumped off one hydroponic section and fled across the open
floor to the next It paused eyes glittering and antennae twitching

Looking around once it leaped up seizing the ledge and clawing up the
side of the tank Standing on top and rising to its haunches it began
nibbling what it could reach

Suddenly it whirled Behind it and hitherto unnoticed was another
shape like it but larger The newcomer inched forward The small one
retreated skittering nervously Without warning the big one leaped
and the small one tried to flee In a few jumps the big one caught up
and mauled the other unmercifully

It continued to bite even after the little one lay still At last it
backed off and waited watching for signs of motion There was none
Then it turned to the plant When it had chewed off everything within
reach it climbed into the branches

The little one twitched moved a leg and cautiously began dragging
itself away It rolled off the raised section and surprisingly made no
noise as it fell It seemed to revive shaking itself and scurrying
away still within range of the screen

Against the wall was a small platform The little one climbed on top
and there found something that seemed to interest it It sniffed
around and reached and felt the discovery Wounds were forgotten as
it snatched up the object and frisked back to the scene of its recent
defeat

This time it had no trouble with the raised section It leaped and
landed on top and made considerable noise in doing so The big animal
heard and twisted around It saw and clambered down hastily jumping
the last few feet Squealing it hit the floor and charged

The small one stood still till the last instantand then a paw
flickered out and an inchlong knife blade plunged into the throat of
the charging creature Red spurted out as the bigger beast screamed
The knife flashed in and out until the big animal collapsed and stopped
moving

The small creature removed the knife and wiped it on the pelt of its
foe Then it scampered back to the platform on which the knife had been
foundand laid it down

                                   

At Haldens signal the lights flared up and the screen became too
bright for anything to be visible

Go in and get them said Halden We dont want the pests to find out
that the bodies arent flesh

It was realistic enough said Meredith as the crewmen shut off their
machines and went out Do you think it will work

It might We had an audience

Did we I didnt notice Meredith leaned back Were the puppets
exactly like the pests And if not will the pests be fooled

The electronic puppets were a good imitation but the animals dont
have to identify them as their species If theyre smart enough
theyll know the value of a knife no matter who uses it

What if theyre smarter Suppose they know a knife cant be used by a
creature without real hands

Thats part of our precautions Theyll never know until they tryand
theyll never get away from the trap to try

Very good I never thought of that said Meredith coming closer I
like the way your primitive mind works At times I actually think of
marrying you

Primitive he said alternately frozen and thawed though he knew
that in relation to her he was not advanced

Its almost a curse isnt it She laughed and took the curse away by
leaning provocatively against him But barbaric lovers are often nice

Here we go again he thought drearily sliding his arm around her To
her Im merely a passionate savage

They went to his cabin

She sat down smiling Was she pretty Maybe For her own race she
wasnt tall only by Terran standards Her legs were disproportionately
long and well shaped and her face was somewhat bland and featureless
except for a thin straight short nose It was her eyes that made
the difference he decided A notch or two up the scale of visual
development her eyes were larger and she could see an extra color on
the violet end of the spectrum

She settled back and looked at him It might be fun living with you on
primeval Earth

He said nothing she knew as well as he that Earth was as advanced as
her own world She had something else in mind

I dont think I will though We might have children

Would it be wrong he asked Im as intelligent as you We wouldnt
have subhuman monsters

It would be a step upfor you Under her calm there was tension
It had been there as long as hed known her but it was closer to the
surface now Do I have the right to condemn the unborn Should I make
them start lower than I am

The conflict was not new nor confined to them In one form or another
it governed personal relations between races that were united against
nonhumans but held sharp distinctions themselves

I havent asked you to marry me he said bluntly

Because youre afraid Id refuse

It was true no one asked a member of a higher race to enter a
permanent union

Why did you ever have anything to do with me demanded Halden

Love she said gloomily Physical attraction But I cant let it
lead me astray

Why not make a play for Kelburn If youre going to be scientific
about it hed give you children of the higher type

Kelburn It didnt sound like a name the way she said it I dont
like him and he wouldnt marry me

He wouldnt but hed give you children if you were humble enough
Theres a fifty per cent chance you might conceive

                                   

She provocatively arched her back Not even the women of Kelburns race
had a body like hers and she knew it

Racially there should be a chance she said Actually Kelburn and
I would be infertile

Can you be sure he asked knowing it was a poor attempt to act
unconcerned

How can anyone be sure on a theoretical basis she asked an oblique
smile narrowing her eyes I know we cant

His face felt anesthetized Did you have to tell me that

She got up and came to him She nuzzled against him and his reaction
was purely reflexive His hand swung out and he could feel the flesh
give when his knuckles struck it

She fell back and dazedly covered her face with her hand When she took
it away blood spurted She groped toward the mirror and stood in front
of it She wiped the blood off examining her features carefully

Youve broken my nose she said factually Ill have to stop the
blood and pain

She pushed her nose back into place and waggled it to make sure She
closed her eyes and stood silent and motionless Then she stepped back
and looked at herself critically

Its set and partially knitted Ill concentrate tonight and have it
healed by morning

She felt in the cabinet and attached an invisible strip firmly across
the bridge Then she came over to him

I wondered what youd do You didnt disappoint me

He scowled miserably at her Her face was almost plain and the bandage
invisible or not didnt improve her appearance any How could he still
feel that attraction to her

Try Emmer he suggested tiredly Hell find you irresistible and
hes even more savage than I am

Is he She smiled enigmatically Maybe in a biological sense Too
much though Youre just right

He sat down on the bed Again there was only one way of knowing what
Emmer would doand she knew She had no concept of love outside of
the physical to make use of her body so as to gain an advantagewhat
advantagefor the children she intended to have Outside of that
nothing mattered and for the sake of alloying the lower with the
higher she was as cruel to herself as she was to him And yet he
wanted her

I do think I love you she said And if loves enough I may marry
you in spite of everything But youll have to watch out whose children
I have She wriggled into his arms

The racial disparity was great and she had provoked him but it was not
completely her fault Besides

Besides what She had a beautiful body that could bear superior
childrenand they might be his

He twisted away With those thoughts he was as bad as she was Were
they all that way every one of them crawling upward out of the slime
toward the highest goal they could conceive of Climbing overno
througheverybody they could coerce seduce or marryonward and
upward He raised his hand but it was against himself that his anger
was turned

Careful of the nose she said pressing against him Youve already
broken it once

He kissed her with sudden passion that even he knew was primitive

                                   

There were no immediate results from the puppet performance and so
it was repeated at intervals After the third time Firmon reported
coming in as Halden pored over the meager biological data hed gathered
on the unknown ancestor Wild guesses mostly not one real fact in all
the statistics After two hundred thousand years there wasnt much
left to work with

Firmon slouched down It worked he said Got three a few hours ago

Halden looked at him he had hoped it wouldnt work There was
satisfaction in being right but he would rather face something less
intelligent Wariness was one thing the shyness and slyness of an
unseen animal but intelligence was more difficult to predict

Where are they he asked

Did you want them Firmon seemed surprised at the idea

Halden sighed it was his own fault Firmon had a potentially good
mind but he hadnt been trained to use it and that counted for more
than people thought Any animal smart enough to appreciate the value
of a knife is worth study on that account That goes double when its a
pest

Ill change the cremation setting said Firmon Next time well
just stun them

The trap setting was changed and several animals were taken
Physically they were very much as Halden had described them to
Taphetta small fourlegged creatures with fleshy antennae Dissection
revealed a fairly large brain capacity while behavior tests indicated
an intelligence somewhat below what he had assumed Still it was more
than he wanted a pest to have especially since it also had hands

The biological mechanism of the hands was simple It walked on the back
of the front paws on the fingers of which were fleshy pads When it
sat upright as it often did the flexibility of the wrists permitted
the forepaws to be used as hands Clumsy but because it had a thumb
it could handle such tools as a knife

He had made an error there He had guessed the intelligence but he
hadnt known it could use the weapon he had put within reach A tiny
thing with an inchlong knife was not much more dangerous than the
animal alone but he didnt like the idea of it loose on the ship

The metal knife would have to be replaced with something else
Technicians could compound a plastic that would take a keen edge for a
while and deteriorate to a soft mass in a matter of weeks Meanwhile
he had actually given the animal a dangerous weaponthe concept
of a tool There was only one way to take that away from them by
extermination But that would have to wait

Fortunately the creature had a short life and a shorter breeding
period The actual replacement rate was almost negligible In attaining
intelligence it had been shortchanged in fertility and as a
consequence only in the specialized environment of this particular
ship was it any menace at all

They were lucky a slightly higher fertility and the thing could
threaten their existence As it was the ship would have to be
deverminized before it could land on an inhabited planet

Halden took the data to the Ribboneer pilot and after some discussion
it was agreed that the plastic knife should supplant the metal one It
was also decided to allow a few to escape with the weapon there had
to be some incentive if the creature was to visit the trap more than a
few times Besides with weapons there was always the chance of warfare
between different groups They might even exterminate each other

Gradually over a period of weeks the damage to hydroponics subsided
the pests were under control There was nothing to worry about unless
they mutated again which was unlikely

                                   

Kelburn scowled at the pilot Where are we now he challenged his
face creased with suspicion

You have access to all the instruments so you should know said
Taphetta He was crouching and seemed about to spring but he was
merely breathing relaxedly through a million air tubes

I do know My calculations show one star as the most probable We
should have reached it two days agoand were nowhere near it

True admitted Taphetta Were heading toward what you would
consider the fifth or sixth most likely star

Kelburn caught the implication They all did Then you know where it
is he asked suspicion vanishing

Not in the sense youre askingno Im not sure its what youre
looking for But there was once a great civilization there

You knew this and didnt tell us

Why should I Taphetta looked at him in mild astonishment
Before you hired me I wouldnt tell you for obvious reasons And
afterwardwell you engaged all my skill and knowledge and I used them
to bring you here by the shortest route I didnt think it necessary to
tell you until we actually arrived Is that wrong

It wasnt wrong it merely illustrated the difference in the way an
alien mind worked Sooner or later they would have found the place
but he had saved them months

Whats it like Emmer asked

Taphetta jiggled his ribbons I dont know I was passing near here
and saw the planet off to one side

And you didnt stop Emmer was incredulous

Why should I Were great navigators because we do so much of it We
would never get very far if we stopped to examine everything that
looks interesting Besides its not a good policy in a strange region
especially with an unarmed ship

They wouldnt have that problem The ship was armed well enough to keep
off uncivilized marauders who had very recently reached the spaceship
age and only such people were apt to be inhospitable

When will we land asked Halden

In a few hours but you can see the planet on our screens Taphetta
extended a head ribbon toward a knob and a planet came into view

There werent two civilizations in the Milky Way that built on such
a large scale even from the distance that they could see it Great
distinctive cities were everywhere There was no question as to what
they had found

Now youll learn why they ran away said Taphetta

A new theory Kelburn said though it wasnt for they had left
What makes you think they were afraid

No air If your calculations are right there must have been an
extensive atmosphere a few hundred thousand years ago and now there
isnt any A planet this size doesnt lose air that fast Therefore
its an artificial condition Who takes the trouble to leave a planet
uninhabitable except someone whos afraid others will use itand who
else runs away

They may have done it to preserve what they left suggested Halden

Perhaps said Taphetta but it was obvious he didnt think so

                                   

The lack of air had one thing to recommend itthey neednt worry
about their pests escaping The disadvantage was that they had to wear
spacesuits They landed on top of a great building that was intact
after thousands of years and still strong enough to support the added
weight And then

Then there was nothing

Buildings an enormous number and variety of them huge not one of
them less than five stories high all with ramps instead of stairs
This was to be expected considering the great size of the people who
had lived there and it followed the familiar pattern

But there was nothing in those buildings On this airless world there
was no decay no rust or corrosionand nothing to decay or corrode
No pictures tools nothing that resembled sculpture and while there
were places where machines had stood none were there now Here and
there in inaccessible locations were featureless blobs of metal The
implication was clear Where they hadnt been able to remove a
machine they had melted in down on the spot

The thoroughness was bewildering It wasnt done by some enemy he
would have stood off and razed the cities But there was no rubble and
the buildings were empty The inhabitants themselves had removed all
that was worth taking along

A whole people had packed and moved away leaving behind only massive
echoing structures

There was plenty to learn but nothing to learn it from Buildings can
indicate only so much and then there must be something elseat least
some of the complex artifacts of a civilizationand there was none
Outside the cities on the plains there were the remains of plants
and animals that indicated by their condition that airlessness had
come suddenly Sam Halden the biologist had examined them but he
discovered no clues The unknown ancestor was still a mystery

And the othersEmmer the archeologist and Meredith the
linguisthad nothing to work on though they searched It was Kelburn
who found the first hint Having no specific task now that the planet
was located he wandered around in a scout ship On the other side
of the planet he signaled that there was a machine and that it was
intact

The crew was hurriedly recalled the equipment brought back into the
ship and they took off for the plain where Kelburn waited

And there was the machine immense like everything on the planet It
stood alone tapering toward the sky At the base was a door which
when open was big enough to permit a spaceship to enter easilyonly
it was closed

Kelburn stood beside the towering entrance a tiny figure in a
spacesuit He gazed up at it as the three came near All we have to do
is open it he said

How asked Meredith She seemed to have forgotten that she disliked
him He had made a chance discovery because he had nothing to do while
the others were busy but she regarded it as further proof of his
superiority

                                   

It was hard to watch the happiness that her face directed toward
Kelburn Halden turned away

Just press the button he said

Emmer noticed his expression Its such a big button he objected
Its going to be hard to know when we find it

Theres an inscription of some sort said Kelburn loftily This
thing was left for a purpose Somewhere there must be operating
instructions

From here it looks like a complex waveform a voice crinkled in
their radioTaphetta from the spaceship All we have to do is to find
the right base in the electromagnetic spectrum and duplicate it on a
beam broadcast and the door should open Youre too close to see it as
clearly as I can

                                   

Perhaps they were too close to the big ancestor decided Halden moodily
as they went back It had overshadowed much of their thinking and who
really knew what the ancestor was like and what had motivated him

But the Ribboneer was right about the signal though it took several
days to locate it And then the huge door swung open and air whistled
out

Inside was another disappointment a bare hall with a ramp leading
upward closed off at the ceiling They could have forced through but
they had no desire to risk using a torch to penetrate the barrierin
view of the number of precautions theyd already encountered it was
logical to assume that there were more waiting for them

It was Emmer who found the solution In appearance it resembles a
spaceship Lets assume it is minus engines It was never intended to
fly Listen

Theres no air so you cant hear said Emmer impatiently But you
could if there were air Put your hands against the wall

A distinct vibration ran through the whole structure It hadnt been
there before the door opened Some mechanism had been triggered The
rumbling went on came to a stop and began again Was it some kind of
communication

Hastily rigged machines were hauled inside the chamber to generate
an air supply so that sounds would be produced for the recorders
Translating equipment was set up and focused and after some
experimentation with signals the door was slowly closed No one
remained inside there was no guarantee that it would be as easy to get
out as it had been to get in

They waited a day and a half while the sounds were being recorded
The delay seemed endless The happiest of the crew was Kelburn
Biologically the highest human on the expedition he was stimulated
He wandered aimlessly and smiled affably patting Meredith when he
came to her in the friendliest fashion Startled she smiled back and
looked around wanly Halden was behind her

If I had not been there thought Haldenand thereafter made it a
point to be there

                                   

Meredith was excited but not precisely happy The work was out of her
hands until the translating equipment was retrieved As the second
highest biological type she too was affected until she pointedly
went to her room and locked it from the inside

Halden kept himself awake with antifatigue pills in part because
Meredith could change her mind about Kelburn and because of that
locked door

Emmer tried to be phlegmatic and seemed to succeed Taphetta alone
was unconcerned to him it was an interesting and perhaps profitable
discovery but important only because of that He would not be changed
at all by whatever he learned

Hours crawled by and at last the door opened the air came rushing
out again The translating equipment was brought back to the ship and
Meredith was left alone with it

It was half a day before she admitted the others to the laboratory

The machine is still working she said There seems to have been
some attempt to make the message hard to decode But the methods they
used were exactly the clues that the machine needed to decipher it
My function as a linguist was to help out with the interpretation of
key words and phrases I havent got even a little part of the message
Youll know what it is as soon as I do After the first part the
translator didnt seem to have much trouble

They sat down facing itTaphetta Kelburn Meredith Halden and
Emmer Meredith was midway between Kelburn and himself Was there any
significance in that wondered Halden or was he reading more in her
behavior than was actually there

The translation is complete announced the machine

Go ahead Meredith ordered

The words will be speeded up to human tempo said the translator
Insofar as possible speech mannerisms of the original will be
imitated Please remember that it is only an imitation however

The translator coughed stuttered and began We have purposely made
access to our records difficult If you can translate this message
youll find at the end instructions for reaching the rest of our
culture relics As an advanced race youre welcome to them Weve
provided a surprise for anyone else

For ourselves theres nothing left but an orderly retreat to a place
where we can expect to live in peace That means leaving this Galaxy
but because of our life span were capable of it and we wont be
followed

Taphetta crinkled his ribbons in amusement Kelburn frowned at the
interruption but no one else paid any attention

The translator went on Our metabolic rate is the lowest of any
creature we know of We live several thousand revolutions of any
recorded planet and our rate of increase is extremely low under the
most favorable circumstances we can do no more than double our numbers
in two hundred generations

This doesnt sound as if they were masters of biological science
rustled Taphetta

                                   

Halden stirred uneasily It wasnt turning out at all the way he had
expected

At the time we left the message continued we found no other
intelligent race though there were some capable of further evolution
Perhaps our scout ships long ago met your ancestors on some remote
planet We were never very numerous and because we move and multiply
so slowly we are in danger of being swept out of existence in the
foreseeable future We prefer to leave while we can The reason we
must go developed on our own planet deep beneath the cities in the
underworks which we had ceased to inspect because there was no need
to This part was built to last a million generations which is long
even for us

Emmer sat upright annoyed at himself Of course There are always
sewers and I didnt think of looking there

In the last several generations we sent out four expeditions
leisurely trips because we then thought we had time to explore
thoroughly With this planet as base of operations the successive
expeditions fanned out in four directions to cover the most
representative territory

Kelburn stiffened mingled pride and chagrin on his face His math
had been correct as far as he had figured it But had there been any
reason to assume that they would confine their exploration to one
direction No they would want to cover the whole Milky Way

Taphetta paled Four times as many humans to contend with He hadnt
met the other threefourths yetand for him it wasnt at all a
pleasant thought

After long preparation we sent several ships to settle one of the
nearer planets that wed selected on the first expedition To our
dismay we found that the plague was therethough it hadnt been on
our first visit

Halden frowned They were proving themselves less and less expert
biologists And this plaguethere had to be a reason to leave and
sickness was as good as anybut unless he was mistaken plague wasnt
used in the strict semantic sense It might be the fault of the
translation

The colonists refused to settle they came back at once and reported
We sent out our fastest ships heavily armed We didnt have the time
to retrace our path completely for wed stopped at innumerable places
What we did was to check a few planets the outward and return parts
of all four voyages In every place the plague was there too and we
knew that we were responsible

We did what we could Exhausting our nuclear armament we obliterated
the nearest planets on each of the four spans of our journeys

I wondered why the route came to an end crinkled Taphetta but
there was no comment no answer

We reconstructed what had happened For a long time the plague had
lived in our sewers subsisting on wastes At night because they are
tiny and move exceedingly fast they were able to make their way into
our ships and were aboard on every journey We knew they were there
but because they were so small it was difficult to dislodge them from
their nesting places And so we tolerated their existence

                                   

They werent so smart said Taphetta We figured out that angle long
ago True our ship is an exception but we havent landed anywhere
and wont until we deverminize it

We didnt guess that next to the hull in outer space and consequently
exposed to hard radiation the message went on those tiny creatures
would mutate dangerously and escape to populate the planets we landed
on They had always been loathsome little beasts that walked instead of
rolling or creeping but now they became even more vicious spawning
explosively and fighting with the same incessant violence They had
always harbored diseases which spread to us but now theyve become
hothouses for still smaller parasites that also are able to infect us
Finally we are now allergic to them and when they are within miles of
us it is agony to roll or creep

Taphetta looked around Who would have thought it You were completely
mistaken as to your origin Kelburn was staring vacantly ahead but
didnt see a thing Meredith was leaning against Halden her eyes were
closed The woman has finally chosen now that she knows she was once
vermin clicked the Ribboneer But there are tears in her eyes

The intelligence of the beast has advanced slightly though there
isnt much difference between the highest and the lowestand weve
checked both ends of all four journeys But before it was relatively
calm and orderly Now it is malignantly insane

Taphetta rattled his ribbons Turn it off You dont have to listen
to this We all are of some origin or other and it wasnt necessarily
pretty This being was a slug of some kindand are you now what it
describes Perhaps mentally a little out of pride but the pride was
false

We cant demolish all the planets we unthinkingly let it loose on
there are too many and it lives too fast The stars drift and we
would lose some and before we could eliminate the last one it would
develop space travelit has little intelligence but it could get that
farand it would escape ahead of us We know an impossible task when
we see it And so were leaving first making sure that this animal
will never make use of the products of our civilization It may reach
this planet but it will not be able to untangle our codeits too
stupid You who will have to face it please forgive us Its the only
thing that were ashamed of

Dont listen said the Ribboneer and bending his broad thin body
he sprang to the translator shook it and banged with his ribbons until
the machine was silent You dont have to tell anyone crackled
Taphetta Dont worry about meI wont repeat it He looked around
at the faces But I can see that you will report to everyone exactly
what you found That pride youve developedyoull need it

Taphetta sat on top of the machine looking like nothing so much as a
huge fancy bow on a giftwrapped package

They noted the resemblance vaguely But each of them knew that as a
member of the most numerous race in the Milky Way no longer feared
for their mysterious qualitiesdespised insteadwherever they went
there would never be any gifts for themfor any man

Project Gutenbergtm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete old middleaged and new computers  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenbergtms
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenbergtm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come  In  the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenbergtm and future generations

Section   General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone  For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included  Thus we do not necessarily
