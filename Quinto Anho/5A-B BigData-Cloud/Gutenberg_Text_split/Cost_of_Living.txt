 Cost
 of
 Living

 If easy payment plans were
     to be really efficient patrons
         lifetimes had to be extended

 By ROBERT SHECKLEY


Carrin decided that he could trace his present mood to Millers suicide
last week But the knowledge didnt help him get rid of the vague
formless fear in the back of his mind It was foolish Millers suicide
didnt concern him

But why had that fat jovial man killed himself Miller had had
everything to live forwife kids good job and all the marvelous
luxuries of the age Why had he done it

Good morning dear Carrins wife said as he sat down at the breakfast
table

Morning honey Morning Billy

His son grunted something

You just couldnt tell about people Carrin decided and dialed his
breakfast The meal was gracefully prepared and served by the new
Avignon Electric Autocook

His mood persisted annoyingly enough since Carrin wanted to be in top
form this morning It was his day off and the Avignon Electric finance
man was coming This was an important day

He walked to the door with his son

Have a good day Billy

His son nodded shifted his books and started to school without
answering Carrin wondered if something was bothering him too He hoped
not One worrier in the family was plenty

See you later honey He kissed his wife as she left to go shopping

At any rate he thought watching her go down the walk at least shes
happy He wondered how much shed spend at the A E store

Checking his watch he found that he had half an hour before the A E
finance man was due The best way to get rid of a bad mood was to drown
it he told himself and headed for the shower

                                   

The shower room was a glittering plastic wonder and the sheer luxury of
it eased Carrins mind He threw his clothes into the A E automatic
Kleenpresser and adjusted the shower spray to a notch above brisk
The fivedegreesaboveskintemperature water beat against his thin
white body Delightful And then a relaxing rubdry in the A E
Autotowel

Wonderful he thought as the towel stretched and kneaded his stringy
muscles And it should be wonderful he reminded himself The A E
Autotowel with shaving attachments had cost three hundred and thirteen
dollars plus tax

But worth every penny of it he decided as the A E shaver came out of
a corner and whisked off his rudimentary stubble After all what good
was life if you couldnt enjoy the luxuries

His skin tingled when he switched off the Autotowel He should have
been feeling wonderful but he wasnt Millers suicide kept nagging at
his mind destroying the peace of his day off

Was there anything else bothering him Certainly there was nothing wrong
with the house His papers were in order for the finance man

Have I forgotten something he asked out loud

The Avignon Electric finance man will be here in fifteen minutes his
A E bathroom Wallreminder whispered

I know that Is there anything else

The Wallreminder reeled off its memorized dataa vast amount of
minutiae about watering the lawn having the Jetlash checked buying
lamb chops for Monday and the like Things he still hadnt found time
for

All right thats enough He allowed the A E Autodresser to dress
him skillfully draping a new selection of fabrics over his bony frame
A whiff of fashionable masculine perfume finished him and he went into
the living room threading his way between the appliances that lined the
walls

A quick inspection of the dials on the wall assured him that the house
was in order The breakfast dishes had been sanitized and stacked the
house had been cleaned dusted polished his wifes garments had been
hung up his sons model rocket ships had been put back in the closet

Stop worrying you hypochondriac he told himself angrily

The door announced Mr Pathis from Avignon Finance is here

Carrin started to tell the door to open when he noticed the Automatic
Bartender

Good God why hadnt he thought of it

The Automatic Bartender was manufactured by Castile Motors He had
bought it in a weak moment A E wouldnt think very highly of that
since they sold their own brand

                                   

He wheeled the bartender into the kitchen and told the door to open

A very good day to you sir Mr Pathis said

Pathis was a tall imposing man dressed in a conservative tweed drape
His eyes had the crinkled corners of a man who laughs frequently He
beamed broadly and shook Carrins hand looking around the crowded
living room

A beautiful place you have here sir Beautiful As a matter of fact I
dont think Ill be overstepping the companys code to inform you that
yours is the nicest interior in this section

Carrin felt a sudden glow of pride at that thinking of the rows of
identical houses on this block and the next and the one after that

Now then is everything functioning properly Mr Pathis asked
setting his briefcase on a chair Everything in order

Oh yes Carrin said enthusiastically Avignon Electric never goes
out of whack

The phone all right Changes records for the full seventeen hours

It certainly does Carrin said He hadnt had a chance to try out the
phone but it was a beautiful piece of furniture

The Solidoprojector all right Enjoying the programs

Absolutely perfect reception He had watched a program just last
month and it had been startlingly lifelike

How about the kitchen Autocook in order Recipemaster still knocking
em out

Marvelous stuff Simply marvelous

Mr Pathis went on to inquire about his refrigerator his vacuum
cleaner his car his helicopter his subterranean swimming pool and
the hundreds of other items Carrin had bought from Avignon Electric

Everything is swell Carrin said a trifle untruthfully since he
hadnt unpacked every item yet Just wonderful

Im so glad Mr Pathis said leaning back with a sigh of relief You
have no idea how hard we try to satisfy our customers If a product
isnt right back it comes no questions asked We believe in pleasing
our customers

I certainly appreciate it Mr Pathis

                                   

Carrin hoped the A E man wouldnt ask to see the kitchen He
visualized the Castile Motors Bartender in there like a porcupine in a
dog show

Im proud to say that most of the people in this neighborhood buy from
us Mr Pathis was saying Were a solid firm

Was Mr Miller a customer of yours Carrin asked

That fellow who killed himself Pathis frowned briefly He was as a
matter of fact That amazed me sir absolutely amazed me Why just
last month the fellow bought a brandnew Jetlash from me capable of
doing three hundred and fifty miles an hour on a straightaway He was as
happy as a kid over it and then to go and do a thing like that Of
course the Jetlash brought up his debt a little

Of course

But what did that matter He had every luxury in the world And then he
went and hung himself

Hung himself

Yes Pathis said the frown coming back Every modern convenience in
his house and he hung himself with a piece of rope Probably unbalanced
for a long time

The frown slid off his face and the customary smile replaced it But
enough of that Lets talk about you

The smile widened as Pathis opened his briefcase Now then your
account You owe us two hundred and three thousand dollars and
twentynine cents Mr Carrin as of your last purchase Right

Right Carrin said remembering the amount from his own papers
Heres my installment

He handed Pathis an envelope which the man checked and put in his
pocket

Fine Now you know Mr Carrin that you wont live long enough to pay
us the full two hundred thousand dont you

No I dont suppose I will Carrin said soberly

He was only thirtynine with a full hundred years of life before him
thanks to the marvels of medical science But at a salary of three
thousand a year he still couldnt pay it all off and have enough to
support a family on at the same time

Of course we would not want to deprive you of necessities which in
any case is fully protected by the laws we helped formulate and pass To
say nothing of the terrific items that are coming out next year Things
you wouldnt want to miss sir

Mr Carrin nodded Certainly he wanted new items

Well suppose we make the customary arrangement If you will just sign
over your sons earnings for the first thirty years of his adult life
we can easily arrange credit for you

                                   

Mr Pathis whipped the papers out of his briefcase and spread them in
front of Carrin

If youll just sign here sir

Well Carrin said Im not sure Id like to give the boy a start in
life not saddle him with

But my dear sir Pathis interposed this is for your son as well He
lives here doesnt he He has a right to enjoy the luxuries the
marvels of science

Sure Carrin said Only

Why sir today the average man is living like a king A hundred years
ago the richest man in the world couldnt buy what any ordinary citizen
possesses at present You mustnt look upon it as a debt Its an
investment

Thats true Carrin said dubiously

He thought about his son and his rocket ship models his star charts
his maps Would it be right he asked himself

Whats wrong Pathis asked cheerfully

Well I was just wondering Carrin said Signing over my sons
earningsyou dont think Im getting in a little too deep do you

Too deep My dear sir Pathis exploded into laughter Do you know
Mellon down the block Well dont say I said it but hes already
mortgaged his grandchildrens salary for their full lifeexpectancy
And he doesnt have half the goods hes made up his mind to own Well
work out something for him Service to the customer is our job and we
know it well

Carrin wavered visibly

And after youre gone sir theyll all belong to your son

That was true Carrin thought His son would have all the marvelous
things that filled the house And after all it was only thirty years
out of a life expectancy of a hundred and fifty

He signed with a flourish

Excellent Pathis said And by the way has your home got an A E
Masteroperator

It hadnt Pathis explained that a Masteroperator was new this year a
stupendous advance in scientific engineering It was designed to take
over all the functions of housecleaning and cooking without its owner
having to lift a finger

Instead of running around all day pushing half a dozen different
buttons with the Masteroperator all you have to do is push one A
remarkable achievement

Since it was only five hundred and thirtyfive dollars Carrin signed
for one having it added to his sons debt

Rights right he thought walking Pathis to the door This house will
be Billys some day His and his wifes They certainly will want
everything uptodate

Just one button he thought That would be a timesaver

                                   

After Pathis left Carrin sat back in an adjustable chair and turned on
the solido After twisting the Ezidial he discovered that there was
nothing he wanted to see He tilted back the chair and took a nap

The something on his mind was still bothering him

Hello darling He awoke to find his wife was home She kissed him on
the ear Look

She had bought an A E Sexitizernegligee He was pleasantly surprised
that that was all she had bought Usually Leela returned from shopping
laden down

Its lovely he said

She bent over for a kiss then giggleda habit he knew she had picked
up from the latest popular solido star He wished she hadnt

Going to dial supper she said and went to the kitchen Carrin
smiled thinking that soon she would be able to dial the meals without
moving out of the living room He settled back in his chair and his son
walked in

Hows it going Son he asked heartily

All right Billy answered listlessly

Whatsa matter Son The boy stared at his feet not answering Come
on tell Dad whats the trouble

Billy sat down on a packing case and put his chin in his hands He
looked thoughtfully at his father

Dad could I be a Master Repairman if I wanted to be

Mr Carrin smiled at the question Billy alternated between wanting to
be a Master Repairman and a rocket pilot The repairmen were the elite
It was their job to fix the automatic repair machines The repair
machines could fix just about anything but you couldnt have a machine
fix the machine that fixed the machine That was where the Master
Repairmen came in

But it was a highly competitive field and only a very few of the best
brains were able to get their degrees And although the boy was bright
he didnt seem to have an engineering bent

Its possible Son Anything is possible

But is it possible for me

I dont know Carrin answered as honestly as he could

Well I dont want to be a Master Repairman anyway the boy said
seeing that the answer was no I want to be a space pilot

A space pilot Billy Leela asked coming in to the room But there
arent any

Yes there are Billy argued We were told in school that the
government is going to send some men to Mars

Theyve been saying that for a hundred years Carrin said and they
still havent gotten around to doing it

They will this time

Why would you want to go to Mars Leela asked winking at Carrin
There are no pretty girls on Mars

Im not interested in girls I just want to go to Mars

You wouldnt like it honey Leela said Its a nasty old place with
no air

Its got some air Id like to go there the boy insisted sullenly I
dont like it here

Whats that Carrin asked sitting up straight Is there anything you
havent got Anything you want

No sir Ive got everything I want Whenever his son called him
sir Carrin knew that something was wrong

Look Son when I was your age I wanted to go to Mars too I wanted to
do romantic things I even wanted to be a Master Repairman

Then why didnt you

Well I grew up I realized that there were more important things
First I had to pay off the debt my father had left me and then I met
your mother

Leela giggled

and I wanted a home of my own Itll be the same with you Youll pay
off your debt and get married the same as the rest of us

                                   

Billy was silent for a while then he brushed his dark hairstraight
like his fathersback from his forehead and wet his lips

How come I have debts sir

Carrin explained carefully About the things a family needed for
civilized living and the cost of those items How they had to be paid
How it was customary for a son to take on a part of his parents debt
when he came of age

Billys silence annoyed him It was almost as if the boy were
reproaching him After he had slaved for years to give the ungrateful
whelp every luxury

Son he said harshly have you studied history in school Good Then
you know how it was in the past Wars How would you like to get blown
up in a war

The boy didnt answer

Or how would you like to break your back for eight hours a day doing
work a machine should handle Or be hungry all the time Or cold with
the rain beating down on you and no place to sleep

He paused for a response got none and went on You live in the most
fortunate age mankind has ever known You are surrounded by every wonder
of art and science The finest music the greatest books and art all at
your fingertips All you have to do is push a button He shifted to a
kindlier tone Well what are you thinking

I was just wondering how I could go to Mars the boy said With the
debt I mean I dont suppose I could get away from that

Of course not

Unless I stowed away on a rocket

But you wouldnt do that

No of course not the boy said but his tone lacked conviction

Youll stay here and marry a very nice girl Leela told him

Sure I will Billy said Sure He grinned suddenly I didnt mean
any of that stuff about going to Mars I really didnt

Im glad of that Leela answered

Just forget I mentioned it Billy said smiling stiffly He stood up
and raced upstairs

Probably gone to play with his rockets Leela said Hes such a
little devil

                                   

The Carrins ate a quiet supper and then it was time for Mr Carrin to
go to work He was on night shift this month He kissed his wife
goodby climbed into his Jetlash and roared to the factory The
automatic gates recognized him and opened He parked and walked in

Automatic lathes automatic presseseverything was automatic The
factory was huge and bright and the machines hummed softly to
themselves doing their job and doing it well

Carrin walked to the end of the automatic washing machine assembly line
to relieve the man there

Everything all right he asked

Sure the man said Havent had a bad one all year These new models
here have builtin voices They dont light up like the old ones

Carrin sat down where the man had sat and waited for the first washing
machine to come through His job was the soul of simplicity He just sat
there and the machines went by him He pressed a button on them and
found out if they were all right They always were After passing him
the washing machines went to the packaging section

The first one slid by on the long slide of rollers He pressed the
starting button on the side

Ready for the wash the washing machine said

Carrin pressed the release and let it go by

That boy of his Carrin thought Would he grow up and face his
responsibilities Would he mature and take his place in society Carrin
doubted it The boy was a born rebel If anyone got to Mars it would be
his kid

But the thought didnt especially disturb him

Ready for the wash Another machine went by

Carrin remembered something about Miller The jovial man had always been
talking about the planets always kidding about going off somewhere and
roughing it He hadnt though Hed committed suicide

Ready for the wash

Carrin had eight hours in front of him and he loosened his belt to
prepare for it Eight hours of pushing buttons and listening to a
machine announce its readiness

Ready for the wash

He pressed the release

Ready for the wash

Carrins mind strayed from the job which didnt need much attention in
any case He wished he had done what he had longed to do as a youngster

It would have been great to be a rocket pilot to push a button and go
to Mars

Section   Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment  Many small donations
 to  are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all  states of the United
States  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States  US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section   General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone  For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included  Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility
