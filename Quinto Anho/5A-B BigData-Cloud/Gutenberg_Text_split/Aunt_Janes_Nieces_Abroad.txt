PREFATORY


The author is pleased to be able to present a sequel to Aunt Janes
Nieces the book which was received with so much favor last year Yet
it is not necessary one should have read the first book to fully
understand the present volume the characters being taken to entirely
new scenes

The various foreign localities are accurately described so that those
who have visited them will recognize them at once while those who have
not been so fortunate may acquire a clear conception of them It was my
good fortune to be an eye witness of the recent great eruption of
Vesuvius

Lest I be accused of undue sensationalism in relating the somewhat
dramatic Sicilian incident I will assure my reader that the story does
not exaggerate present conditions in various parts of the island In
fact Il Duca and Tato are drawn from life although they did not have
their mountain lair so near to Taormina as I have ventured to locate
it Except that I have adapted their clever system of brigandage to the
exigencies of this story their history is truly related Many who have
travelled somewhat outside the beaten tracks in Sicily will frankly
vouch for this statement

Italy is doing its best to suppress the Mafia and to eliminate
brigandage from the beautiful islands it controls but so few of the
inhabitants are Italians or in sympathy with the government that the
work of reformation is necessarily slow Americans especially must
exercise caution in travelling in any part of Sicily yet with proper
care not to tempt the irresponsible natives they are as safe in Sicily
as they are at home

Aunt Janes nieces are shown to be as frankly adventurous as the average
clear headed American girl but their experiences amid the environments
of an ancient and still primitive civilization are in no wise
extraordinary

CHAPTER I

THE DOYLES ARE ASTONISHED


It was Sunday afternoon in Miss Patricia Doyles pretty flat at 
Willing Square In the small drawing room Patriciaor Patsy as she
preferred to be calledwas seated at the piano softly playing the one
piece the music teacher had succeeded in drilling into her flighty
head by virtue of much patience and perseverance In a thick cushioned
morrischair reclined the motionless form of Uncle John a chubby little
man in a gray suit whose features were temporarily eclipsed by the
newspaper that was spread carefully over them Occasionally a gasp or a
snore from beneath the paper suggested that the little man was
snoozing as he sometimes gravely called it instead of listening to
the music

Major Doyle sat opposite stiffly erect with his admiring eyes full
upon Patsy At times he drummed upon the arms of his chair in unison
with the music nodding his grizzled head to mark the time as well as to
emphasize his evident approbation Patsy had played this same piece from
start to finish seven times since dinner because it was the only one
she knew but the Major could have listened to it seven hundred times
without the flicker of an eyelash It was not that he admired so much
the piece the girl was playing as the girl who was playing the
piece His pride in Patsy was unbounded That she should have
succeeded at all in mastering that imposing looking instrumentmaking
it actually play chuneswas surely a thing to wonder at But then
Patsy could do anything if she but tried

Suddenly Uncle John gave a dreadful snort and sat bolt upright gazing
at his companions with a startled look that melted into one of benign
complacency as he observed his surroundings and realized where he was
The interruption gave Patsy an opportunity to stop playing the tune She
swung around on the stool and looked with amusement at her newly
awakened uncle

Youve been asleep she said

No indeed quite a mistake replied the little man seriously Ive
only been thinking

An such beautchiful thoughts observed the Major testily for he
resented the interruption of his Sunday afternoon treat You thought
em aloud sir and the sound of it was a bad imithation of a bullfrog
in a marsh Youll have to give up eating the salad sir

Bah dont I know asked Uncle John indignantly

Well if your knowledge is better than our hearing I suppose you do
retorted the Major But to an ignorant individual like meself the
impression conveyed was that you snored like a man that has forgotten
his manners an gone to sleep in the prisence of a lady

Then no one has a better right to do that declared Patsy soothingly
and Im sure our dear Uncle Johns thoughts were just the most
beautiful dreams in the world Tell us of them sir and well prove the
Major utterly wrong

Even her father smiled at the girls diplomacy and Uncle John who was
on the verge of unreasonable anger beamed upon her gratefully

Im going to Europe he said

The Major gave an involuntary start and then turned to look at him
curiously

And Im going to take Patsy along he continued with a mischievous
grin

The Major frowned

Conthrol yourself sir until you are fully awake said he Youre
dreaming again

Patsy swung her feet from side to side for she was such a little thing
that the stool raised her entirely off the floor There was a thoughtful
look on her round freckled face and a wistful one in her great blue
eyes as the full meaning of Uncle Johns abrupt avowal became apparent

The Major was still frowning but a half frightened expression had
replaced the one of scornful raillery For he too knew that his
eccentric brotherinlaw was likely to propose any preposterous thing
and then carry it out in spite of all opposition But to take Patsy to
Europe would be like pulling the Majors eye teeth or amputating his
good right arm Worse far worse It would mean taking the sunshine out
of her old fathers sky altogether and painting it a grim despairing
gray

But he resolved not to submit without a struggle

Sir said he sternlyhe always called his brotherinlaw sir when
he was in a sarcastic or reproachful moodIve had an idea for some
time that you were plotting mischief You havent looked me straight in
the eye for a week and youve twice been late to dinner I will ask you
to explain to us sir the brutal suggestion you have just advanced

Uncle John laughed In the days when Major Doyle had thought him a poor
man and in need of a helping hand the grizzled old Irishman had been as
tender toward him as a woman and studiously avoided any speech or
epithet that by chance might injure the feelings of his dead wifes
only brother But the Majors invariable courtesy to the poor or
unfortunate was no longer in evidence when he found that John Merrick
was a multimillionaire with a strongly defined habit of doing good to
others and striving in obscure and unconventional ways to make everybody
around him happy His affection for the little man increased mightily
but his respectful attitude promptly changed and a chance to reprove or
discomfit his absurdly rich brotherinlaw was one of his most
satisfactory diversions Uncle John appreciated this and holding the
dignified Major in loving regard was glad to cross swords with him now
and then to add variety to their pleasant relations

Its this way Major Doyle he now remarked coolly Ive been
worried to death lately over business matters and I need a change

Phoo All your business is attended to by Isham Marvin  Co Youve no
worry at all Why weve just made you a quarter of a million in CH 
Ds

The we is explained by stating that the Major held an important
position in the great banking housea position Mr Merrick had secured
for him some months previously

Thats it said Uncle John Youve made me a quarter of a million
that I dont want The CH  D stocks were going to pieces when I
bought them and I had reason to hope Id lose a good round sum on them
But the confounded luck turned and the result is an accumulation of all
this dreadful money So my dear Major before Im tempted to do
someother foolish thing Ive determined to run away where business
cant follow me and where by industry and perseverance I can scatter
some of my illgotten gains

The Major smiled grimly

Thats Europe right enough he said And I dont object John to
your going there whenever you please Youre disgracefully countryfied
and uninformed for a man of means and Europell open your eyes and
prove to you how insignificant you really are I advise you to visit
Ireland sor which Im reliably informed is the centhral jewel in
Europes crown of beauty Go and go whinever you please sor but
forbear the wickedness of putting foolish thoughts into our Patsys
sweet head She cant go a step and you know it Its positive cruelty
to her sir to suggest such a thing

The Majors speech had a touch of the brogue when he became excited but
recovered when he calmed down

Why you selfish old humbug cried Uncle John indignantly Why cant
she go when theres money and time to spare Would you keep her here to
cuddle and spoil a vigorous man like yourself when she can run away and
see the world and be happy

Its a great happiness to cuddle the Major said Patsy softly and
the poor man needs it as much as he does his slippers or his oatmeal for
breakfast

And Patsy has the house to look after added the Major complacently

Uncle John gave a snort of contempt

For an unreasonable man show me an Irishman he remarked Here
youve been telling me how Europe is an education and a delight and in
the next breath you deliberately deprive your little daughter whom you
pretend to love of the advantages she might gain by a trip abroad And
why Just because you want her yourself and might be a bit lonesome
without her But Ill settle that foolishness sir in short order You
shall go with us

Impossible ejaculated the Major Its the time of year Im most
needed in the office and Mr Marvin has been so kind and considerate
that I wont play him a dirty trick by leaving him in the lurch

Patsy nodded approval

Thats right daddy she said

Uncle John lay back in the chair and put the newspaper over his face
again Patsy and her father stared at one another with grave intentness
Then the Major drew out his handkerchief and mopped his brow

Youd like to go mavourneen he asked softly

Yes daddy but I wont of course

Tuttut dont you go putting yourself against your old fathers will
Patsy Its not so far to Europe he continued thoughtfully and you
wont be away much longer than you were when you went to Elmhurst after
Aunt Janes moneywhich you didnt get Mary takes fine care of our
little rooms and doubtless I shall be so busy that I wont miss you at
all at all

Daddy

She was in his lap now her chubby arms clasped around his neck and her
soft cheek laid close beside his rough and ruddy one

And when ye get back Patsy darlin he whispered tenderly stroking
her hair the joy of the meeting will make up for all that weve
suffered Its the way of life mavourneen Unless a couple happens to
be Siamese twins theyre bound to get separated in the course of
events more or less if not frequently

I wont go daddy

Oh yes you will Its not like you to be breakin my heart by stayin
home Next week said that wicked old unclehe remoinds me of the one
that tried to desthroy the Babes in the Woods Patsy dear You must try
to reclaim him to humanity for Im hopin theres a bit of good in the
old rascal yet And he looked affectionately at the round little man
under the newspaper

Uncle John emerged again It was wonderful how well he understood the
Doyle family His face was now smiling and wore a look of supreme
satisfaction

Your selfishness my dear Major said he is like the husk on a
cocoanut When you crack it theres plenty of milk withinand in your
case its the milk of human kindness Come lets talk over the trip




CHAPTER II

UNCLE JOHN MAKES PLANS


The thought came to me a long time ago Uncle John resumed but it
was only yesterday that I got all the details fixed and settled in my
mind Ive been a rough old duffer Patsy and in all my hard working
life never thought of such a thing as travelling or enjoying myself
until I fell in with you and you taught me how pleasant it is to
scatter sunshine in the hearts of others For to make others happy means
a lot of joy for yourselfa secret you were trying to keep from me you
crafty young woman until I discovered it by accident Now here I am
with three nieces on my hands

You may say two sir interrupted the Major Patsy can take care of
herself

Hold your tongue said Uncle John I say Ive got three niecesas
fine a trio of intelligent sweet and attractive young women as youll
run across in a month of Sundays I dare you to deny it sir And they
are all at an age when an European trip will do them a world of good So
off we go a week from Tuesday in the firstclass steamer Princess
Irene bound from New York for the Bay of Naples

Patsys eyes showed her delight They fairly danced

Have you told Beth and Louise she asked

His face fell

Not yet he said Id forgotten to mention it to them

For my part continued the girl I can get ready in a week easily
But Beth is way out in Ohio and we dont know whether she can go or
not

Ill telegraph her and find out said Uncle John

Do it today suggested the Major

I will

And tomorrow you must see Louise added Patsy Im not sure shell
want to go dear Shes such a social butterfly you know that her
engagements may keep her at home

Do you mean to say shes engaged asked Mr Merrick aghast

Only for the parties and receptions Uncle But it wouldnt surprise me
if she was married soon Shes older than Beth or me and has a host of
admirers

Perhaps shes old enough to be sensible suggested the Major

Well Ill see her and her mother tomorrow morning decided Uncle
John and if she cant find time for a trip to Europe at my expense
you and Beth shall go anyhowand well bring Louise a wedding present

With this declaration he took his hat and walking stick and started for
the telegraph station leaving Patsy and her father to canvass the
unexpected situation

John Merrick was sixty years old but as hale and rugged as a boy of
twenty He had made his vast fortune on the Pacific Coast and during his
years of busy activity had been practically forgotten by the Eastern
members of his family who never had credited him with sufficient
ability to earn more than a precarious livelihood But the man was
shrewd enough in a business way although simple almost to childishness
in many other matters When he returned quite unheralded to end his
days at home and employ his ample wealth to the best advantage he for
a time kept his success a secret and so learned much of the
dispositions and personal characteristics of his three nieces

They were at that time visiting his unmarried sister Jane at her
estate at Elmhurst whither they had been invited for the first time
and in the race for Aunt Janes fortune he watched the three girls
carefully and found much to admire in each one of them Patsy Doyle
however proved exceptionally frank and genuine and when Aunt Jane at
last died and it was found she had no estate to bequeath Patsy proved
the one bright star in the firmament of disappointment Supposing Uncle
John to be poor she insisted upon carrying him to New York with her and
sharing with him the humble tenement room in which she lived with her
fathera retired veteran who helped pay the family expenses by keeping
books for a mercantile firm while Patsy worked in a hairdressers
shop

It was now that Uncle John proved a modern fairy godfather to Aunt
Janes nieceswho were likewise his own nieces The three girls had
little in common except their poverty Elizabeth De Graf being the
daughter of a music teacher in Cloverton Ohio while Louise Merrick
lived with her widowed mother in a social atmosphere of the second class
in New York where the two women frankly intrigued to ensnare for Louise
a husband who had sufficient means to ensure both mother and daughter a
comfortable home In spite of this worldly and unlovely ambition which
their circumstances might partially excuse Louise who was but
seventeen had many good and womanly qualities could they have been
developed in an atmosphere uninfluenced by the schemes of her vain and
selfish mother

Uncle John casting aside the mask of poverty came to the relief of all
three girls He settled the incomes of substantial sums of money upon
both Beth and Louise making them practically independent For Patsy he
bought a handsome modern flat building located at  Willing Square
and installed her and the Major in its cosiest apartment the rents of
the remaining flats giving the Doyles an adequate income for all time to
come Here Uncle John believing himself cordially welcome as indeed he
was made his own home and it required no shrewd guessing to arrive at
the conclusion that little Patsy was destined to inherit some day all
his millions

The great banking and brokerage firm of Isham Marvin  Co had long
managed successfully John Merricks vast fortune and at his
solicitation it gave Major Doyle a responsible position in its main
office with a salary that rendered him independent of his daughters
suddenly acquired wealth and made him proud and selfrespecting

Money had no power to change the nature of the Doyles The Major
remained the same simple honest courteous yet brusque old warrior who
had won Uncle Johns love as a hard working bookkeeper and Patsys
bright and sunny disposition had certain power to cheer any home
whether located in a palace or a hovel

Never before in his life had Uncle John been so supremely happy and
never before had Aunt Janes three nieces had so many advantages and
pleasures It was to confer still further benefits upon these girls that
their eccentric uncle had planned this unexpected European trip

His telegram to Elizabeth was characteristic

Patsy Louise and I sail for Europe next Tuesday Will you join us as
my guest If so take first train to New York where I will look after
your outfit Answer immediately

That was a message likely to surprise a country girl but it did not
strike John Merrick as in any way extraordinary He thought he could
depend upon Beth She would be as eager to go as he was to have her and
when he had paid for the telegram he dismissed the matter from further
thought

Next morning Patsy reminded him that instead of going down town he must
personally notify Louise Merrick of the proposed trip so he took a
crosstown line and arrived at the Merricks home at nine oclock

Mrs Merrick was in a morning wrapper sipping her coffee in an upper
room But she could not deny herself to Uncle John her dead husbands
brother and her only daughters benefactor which meant indirectly her
own benefactor so she ordered the maid to show him up at once

Louise is still sweetly sleeping she said and wont waken for hours
yet

Is anything wrong with her he asked anxiously

Oh dear no but everyone does not get up with the milkman as you do
John and the dear child was at the opera last night which made her
late in getting home

Doesnt the opera let out before midnight the same as the theatres
he asked

I believe so but there is the supper afterward you know

Ah yes he returned thoughtfully Ive always noticed that the
opera makes folks desperately hungry for they flock to the restaurants
as soon as they can get away Singular isnt it

Why I never thought of it in that light

But Louise is well

Quite well thank you

Thats a great relief for Im going to take her to Europe with me next
week he said

Mrs Merrick was so astonished that she nearly dropped her coffeecup
and could make no better reply than to stare blankly at her
brotherinlaw

We sail Tuesday continued Uncle John and you must have my niece
ready in time and deliver her on board the Princess Irene at Hoboken
at nine oclock sharp

But JohnJohn gasped Mrs Merrick feebly it will take a month at
least to make her gowns and

Stuff and rubbish he growled That shows Martha how little you
know about European trips No one makes gowns to go abroad with you buy
em in Paris to bring home

Ah yes to be sure she muttered Perhaps then it can be done if
Louise has no other engagements

Just what Patsy said See here Martha do you imagine that any girl
who is half human could have engagements that would keep her from
Europe

But the requirements of society

Youll get me riled pretty soon Martha and if you do youll wish you
hadnt

This speech frightened the woman It wouldnt do to provoke Uncle John
however unreasonable he happened to be So she said meekly

Ive no doubt Louise will be delighted to go and so will I

You

Whywhywhom do you intend taking

Just the three girlsAunt Janes three nieces Also mine

But youll want a chaperone for them

Why so

Propriety requires it and so does ordinary prudence Louise I know
will be discreet for it is her nature but Patsy is such a little
flyaway and Beth so deep and demure that without a chaperone they might
cause you a lot of trouble

Uncle John grew red and his eyes flashed

A chaperone he cried contemptuously not any in mine Martha
Merrick Either we young folks go alone without any deaths head to
perpetually glower at us or we dont go at all Three better girls
never lived and Ill trust em anywhere Besides that we arent going
to any of your confounded social functions were going on a reglar
picnic and if I dont give those girls the time of their lives my name
aint John Merrick A chaperone indeed

Mrs Merrick held up her hands in horror

Im not sure John she gasped that I ought to trust my dear child
with an uncle who disregards so openly the proprieties

Well Im sure and the things settled he said more calmly Dont
worry maam Ill look after Patsy and Beth and Louise will look after
all of usjust as she does after youbecause shes so discreet Talk
about your being a chaperone Why you dont dare say your souls your
own when Louise is awake That chaperone business is all
humbuggeryunless an old uncle like me can be a chaperone Anyhow Im
the only one thats going to be appointed I wont wait for Louise to
wake up Just tell her the news and help her to get ready on time And
now Im off Good morning Martha

She really had no words of protest ready at hand and it was long after
queer old John Merrick had gone away that she remembered a dozen
effective speeches that she might have delivered

After all she sighed taking up her cup again it may be the best
thing in the world for Louise We dont know whether that young Weldon
who is paying her attentions just now is going to inherit his fathers
money or not Hes been a bit wild Ive heard and it is just as well
to postpone any engagement until we find out the facts I can do that
nicely while my sweet child is in Europe with Uncle John and away from
all danger of entanglements Really its an ill wind that blows no
good Ill go talk with Louise




CHAPTER III

ALL ASHORE


Beth De Graf was a puzzle to all who knew her She was a puzzle even to
herself and was wont to say indifferently that the problem was not
worth a solution For this beautiful girl of fifteen was somewhat bitter
and misanthropic a condition perhaps due to the uncongenial atmosphere
in which she had been reared She was of dark complexion and her big
brown eyes held a sombre and unfathomable expression Once she had
secretly studied their reflection in a mirror and the eyes awed and
frightened her and made her uneasy She had analyzed them much as if
they belonged to someone else and wondered what lay behind their mask
and what their capabilities might be

But this morbid condition mostly affected her when she was at home
listening to the unpleasant bickerings of her father and mother who
quarrelled constantly over trifles that Beth completely ignored Her
parents seemed like two ill tempered animals confined in the same cage
she thought and their snarls had long since ceased to interest her

This condition had of course been infinitely worse in all those
dreadful years when they were poverty stricken Since Uncle John had
settled a comfortable income on his niece the grocer was paid promptly
and Mrs De Graf wore a silk dress on Sundays and held her chin a little
higher than any other of the Cloverton ladies dared do The Professor
no longer harrassed by debts devoted less time to the drudgery of
teaching and began the composition of an oratorio that he firmly
believed would render his name famous So there being less to quarrel
about Beths parents indulged more moderately in that pastime but
their natures were discordant and harmony in the De Graf household was
impossible

When away from home Beths disposition softened Some of her
schoolfriends had seen her smilea wonderful and charming phenomenon
during which her expression grew sweet and bewitchingly animated and her
brown eyes radiant with mirthful light It was not the same Beth at all

Sometimes when the nieces were all at Aunt Janes Beth had snuggled in
the arms of her cousin Louise who had a way of rendering herself
agreeable to all with whom she came in contact and tried hard to win
the affection of the frankly antagonistic girl At such times the
gentleness of Elizabeth her almost passionate desire to be loved and
fondled completely transformed her for the moment Louise shrewd at
reading others told herself that Beth possessed a reserve force of
tenderness amiability and fond devotion that would render her adorable
if she ever allowed those qualities full expression But she did not
tell Beth that The girl was so accustomed to despise herself and so
suspicious of any creditable impulses that at times unexpectedly
obtruded themselves that she would have dismissed such a suggestion as
arrant flattery and Louise was clever enough not to wish to arouse her
cousin to a full consciousness of her own possibilities

The trained if not native indifference of this strange girl of fifteen
was demonstrated by her reception of Uncle Johns telegram She quietly
handed it to her mother and said as calmly as if it were an invitation
to a church picnic

I think I shall go

Nothing like that ever happened to me remarked Mrs De Graf
enviously If John Merrick had an atom of common sense hed have taken
me to Europe instead of a troop of stupid school girls But John always
was a fool and always will be When will you start Beth

Tomorrow morning Theres nothing to keep me Ill go to Patsy and
stay with her until we sail

Are you glad asked her mother looking into the expressionless face
half curiously

Yes returned Beth as if considering her reply a change is always
interesting and I have never travelled except to visit Aunt Jane at
Elmhurst So I think I am pleased to go to Europe

Mrs De Graf sighed There was little in common between mother and
daughter but that to a grave extent was the womans fault She had
never tried to understand her childs complex nature and somewhat
resented Beths youth and good looks which she considered contrasted
unfavorably with her own deepening wrinkles and graying hair For Mrs
De Graf was vain and selfimportant and still thought herself
attractive and even girlish It would really be a relief to have Beth
out of the way for a few months

The girl packed her own trunk and arranged for it to be taken to the
station In the morning she entered the music room to bid the Professor
goodbye He frowned at the interruption for the oratorio was
especially engrossing at the time Mrs De Graf kissed her daughter
lightly upon the lips and said in a perfunctory way that she hoped Beth
would have a good time

The girl had no thought of resenting the lack of affection displayed by
her parents It was what she had always been accustomed to and she had
no reason to expect anything different

Patsy met her at the train in New York and embraced her rapturously
Patsy was really fond of Beth but it was her nature to be fond of
everyone and her cousin escaping from her smacking and enthusiastic
kisses told herself that Patsy would have embraced a cat with the same
spontaneous ecstacy That was not strictly true but there was nothing
half hearted or halfway about Miss Doyle If she loved you there would
never be an occasion for you to doubt the fact It was Patsys way

Uncle John also was cordial in his greetings He was very proud of his
pretty niece and discerning enough to realize there was a broad strata
of womanliness somewhere in Elizabeths undemonstrative character He
had promised himself to dig it out some day and perhaps the European
trip would give him his opportunity

Patsy and Elizabeth shopped for the next few days most strenuously and
delightfully Sometimes their dainty cousin Louise joined them and the
three girls canvassed gravely their requirements for a trip that was as
new to them as a flight to the moon Naturally they bought much that
was unnecessary and forgot many things that would have been useful You
have to go twice to Europe to know what to take along

Louise needed less than the others for her wardrobe was more extensive
and she already possessed all that a young girl could possibly make use
of This niece the eldest of Uncle Johns trio was vastly more
experienced in the ways of the world than the others although as a
traveller she had no advantage of them Urged thereto by her worldly
mother she led a sort of trivial butterfly existence and her
character was decidedly superficial to any close observer Indeed her
very suavity and sweetness of manner was assumed because it was so much
more comfortable and effective to be agreeable than otherwise She was
now past seventeen years of age tall and well formed with a delicate
and attractive face which without being beautiful was considered
pleasant and winning Her eyes were good though a bit too shrewd and
her light brown hair was fluffy as spun silk Graceful of carriage
gracious of manner yet affecting a languor unsuited to her years
Louise Merrick was a girl calculated to draw from the passing throng
glances of admiration and approval and to convey the impression of good
breeding and feminine cleverness

All this however was outward Neither Patsy nor Beth displayed any
undue affection for their cousin although all of the girls exhibited a
fair amount of cousinly friendship for one another They had once been
thrown together under trying circumstances when various qualities of
temperament not altogether admirable were liable to assert themselves
Those events were too recent to be already forgotten yet the girls were
generous enough to be considerate of each others failings and had
resolved to entertain no sentiment other than good will on the eve of
their departure for such a charming outing as Uncle John had planned for
them

Mr Merrick being a man saw nothing radically wrong in the dispositions
of any of his nieces Their youth and girlishness appealed to him
strongly and he loved to have them by his side It is true that he
secretly regretted Louise was not more genuine that Beth was so
cynical and frank and that Patsy was not more diplomatic But he
reflected that he had had no hand in molding their characters although
he might be instrumental in improving them so he accepted the girls as
they were thankful that their faults were not glaring and happy to
have found three such interesting nieces to cheer his old age

At last the preparations were complete Tuesday arrived and Uncle John
corralled his females as he expressed it and delivered them safely
on board the staunch and comfortable ocean greyhound known as the
Princess Irene together with their bags and baggage their flowers
and fruits and candy boxes and all those other useless accessories to a
voyage so eagerly thrust upon the departing travellers by their
affectionate but illadvised friends

Mrs Merrick undertook the exertion of going to Hoboken to see her
daughter off and whispered in the ear of Louise many worldly
admonitions and such bits of practical advice as she could call to mind
on the spur of the moment

Major Gregory Doyle was there pompous and straight of form and wearing
an assumed smile that was meant to assure Patsy he was delighted at her
going but which had the effect of scaring the girl because she at first
thought the dreadful expression was due to convulsions

The Major had no admonitions for Patsy but she had plenty for him and
gave him a long list of directions that would as he said cause him to
walk mighty sthraight if by good luck he managed to remember them all

Having made up his mind to let the child go to Europe the old fellow
allowed no wails or bemoanings to reach Patsys ears to deprive her of a
moments joyful anticipation of the delights in store for her He
laughed and joked perpetually during that last day and promised the
girl that he would take a vacation while she was gone and visit his old
colonel in Virginia which she knew was the rarest pleasure he could
enjoy And now he stood upon the deck amusing them all with his quaint
sayings and appearing so outwardly jolly and unaffected that only Patsy
herself suspected the deep grief that was gripping his kindly old
heart

Uncle John guessed perhaps for he hugged the Major in a tight embrace
whispering that Patsy should be now as ever the apple of his eye and
the subject of his most loving care

An dont be forgetting to bring me the meerschaum pipe from Sicily an
the leathern pocketbook from Florence the Major said to Patsy
impressively Its little enough for ye to remember if ye go that way
an to tell the truth Im sending ye abroad just for to get them An
dont be gettin off the boat till it stops at a station an remember
that Uncle John is full of rheumatics an cant walk more n thirty mile
an hour an

Its a slander said Uncle John stoutly I never had rheumatics in
my life

Major observed Patsy her blue eyes full of tears but her lips trying
to smile do have the tailor sponge your vest every Saturday Its full
of spots even now and Ive been too busy lately to look after you
properly Youreyourejust disgraceful Major

All ashore called a loud voice

The Major gathered Patsy into an embrace that threatened to crush her
and then tossed her into Uncle Johns arms and hurried away Mrs
Merrick followed with good wishes for all for a pleasant journey and
then the four voyagers pressed to the rail and waved their handkerchiefs
frantically to those upon the dock while the band played vociferously
and the sailors ran here and there in sudden excitement and the great
ship left her moorings and moved with proud deliberation down the bay to
begin her long voyage to Gibraltar and the blue waters of the
Mediterranean




CHAPTER IV

SOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES AND A WARNING


For an inexperienced tourist Uncle John managed their arrangements most
admirably He knew nothing at all about ocean travel or what was the
proper method to secure comfortable accommodations but while most of
the passengers were writing hurried letters in the second deck gallery
which were to be sent back by the pilot Mr Merrick took occasion to
interview the chief steward and the deck steward and whatever other
official he could find and purchased their good will so liberally that
the effect of his astute diplomacy was immediately apparent

His nieces found that the sunniest deck chairs bore their names the
most desirable seats in the dining hall were theirs when half famished
because breakfast had been disregarded they trooped in to luncheon the
best waiters on the ship attended to their wants and afterward their
cabins were found to be cosily arranged with every comfort the heart of
maid could wish for

At luncheon it was found that the steward had placed a letter before
Uncle Johns plate The handwriting of the address Louise who sat next
her uncle at once recognized as that of her mother but she said
nothing

Mr Merrick was amazed at the contents of the communication especially
as he had so recently parted with the lady who had written it

It said I must warn you John that my daughter has just escaped a
serious entanglement and I am therefore more grateful than I can
express that you are taking her far from home for a few weeks A young
man named Arthur Weldona son of the big railroad president you
knowhas been paying Louise marked attentions lately but I cautioned
her not to encourage him because a rumor had reached me that he has
quarrelled with his father and been disinherited My informant also
asserted that the young man is wild and headstrong and cannot be
controlled by his parent but he always seemed gentlemanly enough at
our house and my greatest objection to him is that he is not likely to
inherit a dollar of his fathers money Louise and I decided to keep him
dangling until we could learn the truth of this matter for you can
easily understand that with her exceptional attractions there is no
object in Louise throwing herself away upon a poor man or one who
cannot give her a prominent position in society Imagine my horror
John when I discovered last evening that my only child whom I have so
fondly cherished has ungratefully deceived me Carried away by the
impetuous avowals of this young scapegrace whom his own father disowns
she has confessed her love for himlove for a pauperand only by the
most stringent exercise of my authority have I been able to exact from
Louise a promise that she will not become formally engaged to Arthur
Weldon or even correspond with him until she has returned home By
that time I shall have learned more of his history and prospects when I
can better decide whether to allow the affair to go on Of course I have
hopes that in case my fears are proven to have been well founded I can
arouse Louise to a proper spirit and induce her to throw the fellow
over Meantime I implore you as my daughters temporary guardian not
to allow Louise to speak of or dwell upon this young man but try to
interest her in other gentlemen whom you may meet and lead her to
forget if possible her miserable entanglement Consider a loving
mothers feelings John Try to help me in this emergency and I shall
be forever deeply grateful

Its from mother isnt it asked Louise when he had finished reading
the letter

Yes he answered gruffly as he crumpled the missive and stuffed it
into his pocket

What does she say Uncle

Nothing but rubbish and nonsense Eat your soup my dear its getting
cold

The girls sweet low laughter sounded very pleasant and served to calm
his irritation From her demure yet amused expression Uncle John guessed
that Louise knew the tenor of her mothers letter as well as if she had
read it over his shoulder and it comforted him that she could take the
matter so lightly Perhaps the poor child was not so deeply in love as
her mother had declared

He was greatly annoyed at the confidence Mrs Merrick had seen fit to
repose in him and felt she had no right to burden him with any
knowledge of such an absurd condition of affairs just as he was starting
for a holiday Whatever might be the truth of the girls
entanglementand he judged that it was not all conveyed in Martha
Merricks subtle letterLouise would surely be free and unhampered by
either love or maternal diplomacy for some time to come When she
returned home her mother might conduct the affair to suit herself He
would have nothing to do with it in any way

As soon as luncheon was finished they rushed for the deck and you may
imagine that chubby little Uncle John with his rosy smiling face and
kindly eyes surrounded by three eager and attractive girls of from
fifteen to seventeen years of age was a sight to compel the attention
of every passenger aboard the ship

It was found easy to make the acquaintance of the interesting group
and many took advantage of that fact for Uncle John chatted brightly
with every man and Patsy required no excuse of a formal introduction to
confide to every woman that John Merrick was taking his three nieces to
Europe to see the sights and have the time of their lives

Many of the business men knew well the millionaires name and accorded
him great respect because he was so enormously wealthy and successful
But the little man was so genuinely human and unaffected and so openly
scorned all toadyism that they soon forgot his greatness in the
financial world and accepted him simply as a good fellow and an
invariably cheerful comrade

The weather was somewhat rough for the latter part of Marchthey had
sailed the twentyseventhbut the Irene was so staunch and rode the
waves so gracefully that none of the party except Louise was at all
affected by the motion The eldest cousin however claimed to be
indisposed for the first few days out and so Beth and Patsy and Uncle
John sat in a row in their steamer chairs with the rugs tucked up to
their waists and kept themselves and everyone around them merry and
light hearted

Next to Patsy reclined a dark complexioned man of about thirtyfive
with a long thin face and intensely black grave eyes He was
carelessly dressed and wore a flannel shirt but there was an odd look
of mingled refinement and barbarity about him that arrested the girls
attention He sat very quietly in his chair reserved both in speech and
in manner but when she forced him to talk he spoke impetuously and with
almost savage emphasis in a broken dialect that amused her immensely

You cant be American she said

I am Sicilian was the proud answer

Thats what I thought Sicilian or Italian or Spanish but Im glad
its Sicilian which is the same as Italian I cant speak your lingo
myself she continued although I am studying it hard but you manage
the English pretty well so we shall get along famously together

He did not answer for a moment but searched her unconscious face with
his keen eyes Then he demanded brusquely

Where do you go

Why to Europe she replied as if surprised

Europe Pah It is no answer at all he responded angrily Europe is
big To what part do you journey

Patsy hesitated The magic word Europe had seemed to sum up their
destination very effectively and she had heretofore accepted it as
sufficient for the time being at least Uncle John had bought an
armful of guide books and Baedeckers but in the hurry of departure she
had never glanced inside them To go to Europe had been enough to
satisfy her so far but perhaps she should have more definite knowledge
concerning their trip So she turned to Uncle John and said

Uncle dear to what part of Europe are we going

What part he answered Why it tells on the ticket Patsy I cant
remember the name just now Its where the ship stops of course

That is Napoli said the thin faced man with a scarcely veiled sneer
And then

And then repeated Patsy turning to her Uncle

Then Oh some confounded place or other that I cant think of Im not
a timetable Patsy but the trip is all arranged in beautiful style
by a friend of mine who has always wanted to go abroad and so has the
whole programme mapped out in his head

Is it in his head yet enquired Patsy anxiously

No dear its in the left hand pocket of my blue coat all written
down clearly So whats the use of bothering We arent there yet By
and bye well get to Europe an do it up brown Whatever happens and
wherever we go its got to be a spree and a jolly good time so take it
easy Patsy dear and dont worry

Thats all right Uncle she rejoined with a laugh Im not worrying
the least mite But when folks ask us where were going what shall we
say

Europe

And then mischievously

And then home again of course Its as plain as the nose on your face
Patsy Doyle and a good bit straighter

That made her laugh again and the strange Italian who was listening
growled a word in his native language He wasnt at all a pleasant
companion but for that very reason Patsy determined to make him talk
and be sociable By degrees he seemed to appreciate her attention and
always brightened when she came to sit beside him

Youll have to tell me your name you know she said to him because
I cant be calling you Sir every minute

He glanced nervously around Then he answered slowly

I am called ValdiVictor Valdi

Oh thats a pretty name Mr Valdior should I say Signor

You should

Do I pronounce it right

No

Well never mind if I dont youll know what I mean and that I
intend to be proper and polite she responded sweetly

Beth while she made fewer acquaintances than Patsy seemed to have cast
off her sullen reserve when she boarded the ship In truth the girl was
really happy for the first time in her life and it softened her so
wonderfully and made her so attractive that she soon formed a select
circle around her A young lady from Cleveland who had two big
brothers was impelled to introduce herself to Beth because of the young
mens intense admiration for the girls beautiful face When it was
found that they were all from Ohio they formed a friendly alliance at
once Marion Horton was so frank and agreeable that she managed to draw
out all that was best in Beths nature and the stalwart young Hortons
were so shyly enthusiastic over this their first trip abroad that they
inspired the girl with a like ardor which resulted in the most cordial
relations between them

And it so happened that several other young men who chanced to be aboard
the Princess Irene marked the Hortons intimacy with Beth and
insisted on being introduced by them so that by the time Louise had
conquered her maldemer and appeared on deck she found an admiring
group around her cousin that included most of the desirable young
fellows on the ship Beth sat enthroned like a queen listening to her
courtiers and smiling encouragement now and then but taking little part
in the conversation herself because of her inexperience Such adoration
was new to the little country girl and she really enjoyed it Nor did
the young men resent her silence All that they wanted her to do as Tom
Horton tersely expressed it was to sit still and look pretty

As for Uncle John he was so delighted with Beths social success that
he adopted all the boys on the spot and made them a part of what he
called his family circle

Louise discovering this state of affairs gave an amused laugh and
joined the group She was a little provoked that she had isolated
herself so long in her cabin when there was interesting sport on deck
but having lost some valuable time she straightway applied herself to
redeem the situation

In the brilliance of her conversation in her studied glances in a
thousand pretty ways that were skillfully rendered effective she had a
decided advantage over her more beautiful cousin When Louise really
desired to please she was indeed a charming companion and young men are
not likely to detect insincerity in a girl who tries to captivate them

The result was astonishing to Uncle John and somewhat humiliating to
Beth for a new queen was presently crowned and Louise by some magnetic
power assembled the court around herself Only the youngest Horton boy
in whose susceptible heart Beths image was firmly enshrined refused to
change his allegiance but in truth the girl enjoyed herself more
genuinely in the society of one loyal cavalier than when so many were
clamoring for her favors The two would walk the deck together for hours
without exchanging a single word or sit together silently listening to
the band or watching the waves without the need as Tom expressed it
of jabbering every blessed minute in order to be happy

Patsy was indignant at the artfulness of Louise until she noticed that
Beth was quite content then she laughed softly and watched matters take
their course feeling a little sorry for the boys because she knew
Louise was only playing with them

The trip across the Atlantic was all too short On the fifth of April
they passed the Azores running close to the islands of Fayal and San
Jorge so that the passengers might admire the zigzag rows of white
houses that reached from the shore far up the steep hillsides On the
sixth day they sighted Gibraltar and passed between the Moorish and
Spanish lighthouses into the lovely waters of the Mediterranean The
worldfamed rock was now disclosed to their eyes and when the ship
anchored opposite it Uncle John assisted his nieces aboard the lighter
and took them for a brief excursion ashore

Of course they rode to the fortress and wandered through its gloomy
impressive galleries seeing little of the armament because visitors are
barred from the real fortifications The fortress did not seem
especially impregnable and was taken altogether a distinct
disappointment to them but the ride through the town in the low basket
phaetons was wholly delightful The quaint narrow streets and stone
arches the beautiful vistas of sea and mountain the swarthy darkeyed
Moors whose presence lent to the town an oriental atmosphere and the
queer marketplaces crowded with Spaniards Frenchmen Jews and
redcoated English soldiers altogether made up a panorama that was
fascinating in the extreme

But their stay was short and after a rush of sightseeing that almost
bewildered them they returned to the ship breathless but elated at
having seen an done as Uncle John declared their first foreign
port

And now through waters so brightly blue and transparent that they
aroused the girls wonder and admiration the good ship plowed her way
toward the port of Naples passing to the east of Sardinia and Corsica
which they viewed with eager interest because these places had always
seemed so far away to them and had now suddenly appeared as if by
magic directly before their eyes

Patsy and the big whiskered captain had become such good friends that he
always welcomed the girl on his own exclusive deck and this afternoon
she sat beside him and watched the rugged panorama slip by

When will we get to Naples she asked

Tomorrow evening probably answered the captain See it is over in
that direction where the gray cloud appears in the sky

And what is the gray cloud Captain

I do not know said he gravely Perhaps smoke from Vesuvius At
Gibraltar we heard that the volcano is in an ugly mood I hope it will
cause you no inconvenience

Wouldnt it be fine if we could see an eruption exclaimed the girl

The captain shook his head

Interesting perhaps he admitted but no great calamity that causes
thousands of people to suffer can be called fine

Ah that is true she said quickly I had forgotten the suffering

Next morning all the sky was thick with smoke and the sun was hidden
The waters turned gray too and as they approached the Italian coast
the gloom perceptibly increased A feeling of uneasiness seemed to
pervade the ship and even the captain had so many things to consider
that he had no time to converse with his little friend

Signor Valdi forsook his deck chair for the first time and stood at the
rail which overlooked the steerage with his eyes glued to the grim skies
ahead When Uncle John asked him what he saw he answered eagerly

Death and destruction and a loss of millions of lira to the bankrupt
government I know for I have studied Etna for years and Vesuvio is a
second cousin to Etna

Hm said Uncle John You seem pleased with the idea of an eruption

The thin faced man threw a shrewd look from his dark eyes and smiled
Uncle John frowned at the look and stumped away He was not at all easy
in his own mind He had brought three nieces for a holiday to this
foreign shore and here at the outset they were confronted by an
intangible danger that was more fearful because it was not understood
It was enough to make his round face serious although he had so strong
an objection to unnecessary worry

Afternoon tea was served on deck amidst an unusual quiet People soberly
canvassed the situation and remarked upon the fact that the darkness
increased visibly as they neared the Bay of Naples Beth couldnt drink
her tea for tiny black atoms fell through the air and floated upon the
surface of the liquid Louise retired to her stateroom with a headache
and found her white serge gown peppered with particles of lava dust
which had fallen from the skies

The pilot guided the ship cautiously past Capri and into the bay The
air was now black with volcanic dross and a gloom as of midnight
surrounded them on every side The shore the mountain and the water of
the bay itself were alike invisible




CHAPTER V

VESUVIUS RAMPANT


It was Saturday night the seventh day of April nineteen hundred and
sixa night never to be forgotten by those aboard the ship a night
which has its place in history

At dinner the captain announced that he had dropped anchor at the
Immacollatella Nuova but at a safe distance from the shore and that no
passengers would be landed under any circumstances until the fall of
ashes ceased and he could put his people ashore in a proper manner

A spirit of unrest fell upon them all Big Tom Horton whispered to Beth
that he did not intend to leave her side until all danger was over The
deck was deserted all the passengers crowding into the smoking room and
saloons to escape the lava dust

Few kept their rooms or ventured to sleep At intervals a loud
detonation from the volcano shook the air and the mystery and awe of
the enveloping gloom were so palpable as almost to be felt

Toward midnight the wind changed driving the cloud of ashes to the
southward and sufficiently clearing the atmosphere to allow the angry
glow of the crater to be distinctly seen Now it shot a pillar of fire
thousands of feet straight into the heavens then it would darken and
roll skyward great clouds that were illumined by the showers of sparks
accompanying them

The windows of every cabin facing the volcano were filled with eager
faces and in the smoking room Uncle John clasped Beth around the waist
with one arm and Patsy with the other and watched the wonderful
exhibition through the window with a grave and anxious face Tom Horton
had taken a position at one side of them and the dark Italian at the
other The latter assured Patsy they were in no danger whatever Tom
secretly hoped they were and laid brave plans for rescuing Beth or
perishing at her side Louise chose to lie in her berth and await
events with calm resignation If they escaped she would not look haggard
and holloweyed when morning came If a catastrophy was pending she
would have no power to prevent it

It was four oclock on Sunday morning when Vesuvius finally reached the
climax of her travail With a deep groan of anguish the mountain burst
asunder and from its side rolled a great stream of molten lava that
slowly spread down the slope consuming trees vineyards and dwellings
in its path and overwhelming the fated city of BoscoTrecase

Our friends marked the course of destruction by watching the thread of
fire slowly wander down the mountain slope They did not know of the
desolation it was causing but the sight was terrible enough to inspire
awe in every breast

The volcano was easier after that final outburst but the black clouds
formed thicker than ever and soon obscured the sky again




CHAPTER VI

UNDER A CLOUD


After all said Uncle John next morning we may consider ourselves
very lucky Your parents might have come to Naples a hundred times my
dears and your children may come a hundred times more and yet never
see the sights that have greeted us on our arrival If the confounded
old hill was bound to spout it did the fair thing by spouting when we
were around Eh Patsy

I quite agree with you said the girl I wouldnt have missed it for
anythingif it really had to behave so

But youll pay for it growled Signor Valdi who had overheard these
remarks You will pay for it with a thousand discomfortsand Im glad
that is so Vesuvio is hell let loose and it amuses you Hundreds are
lying dead and crushed and you are lucky to be here Listen he
dropped his voice to a whisper if these Neapolitans could see the
rejoicing in my heart they would kill me And you Pah you are no
better You also rejoiceand they will welcome you to Naples I have
advice Do not go on shore It is useless

They were all startled by this strange speech and the reproof it
conveyed made them a trifle uncomfortable but Uncle John whispered that
the man was mad and to pay no attention to him

Although ashes still fell softly upon the ship the day had somewhat
lightened the gloom and they could see from deck the dim outlines of the
shore A crowd of boats presently swarmed around them their occupants
eagerly clamoring for passengers to go ashore or offering fruits
flowers and souvenirs to any who might be induced to purchase Their
indifference to their own and their citys danger was astonishing It
was their custom to greet arriving steamers in this way for by this
means they gained a livelihood Nothing short of absolute destruction
seemed able to interfere with their established occupations

A steam tender also came alongside and after a cordial farewell to the
ships officers and their travelling acquaintances Uncle John placed
his nieces and their baggage aboard the tender which shortly deposited
them safely upon the dock

Perhaps a lot of passengers more dismal looking never before landed on
the beautiful shores of Naplesbeautiful no longer but presenting an
appearance gray and grewsome Ashes were ankle deep in the streetsa
fine flourlike dust that clung to your clothing filled your eyes and
lungs and seemed to penetrate everywhere The foliage of the trees and
shrubbery drooped under its load and had turned from green to the
allpervading gray The grass was covered the cornices and balconies of
the houses were banked with ashes

Bless me said Uncle John Its as bad as Pompey or whatever that
city was called that was buried in the Bible days

Oh not quite Uncle answered Patsy in her cheery voice but it may
be before Vesuvius is satisfied

It is certainly bad enough observed Louise pouting as she marked the
destruction of her pretty cloak by the grimy deposit that was fast
changing its color and texture

Well let us get under shelter as soon as possible said Uncle John

The outlines of a carriage were visible a short distance away He walked
up to the driver and said

We want to go to a hotel

The man paid no attention

Ask him how much he charges Uncle You know you mustnt take a cab in
Naples without bargaining

Why not

The driver will swindle you

Ill risk that he answered Just now were lucky if we get a
carriage at all He reached up and prodded the jehu in the ribs with
his cane How much to the Hotel Vesuvius he demanded loudly

The man woke up and flourished his whip at the same time bursting into
a flood of Italian

The girls listened carefully They had been trying to study Italian
from a small book Beth had bought entitled Italian in Three Weeks
without a Master but not a word the driver of the carriage said seemed
to have occurred in the vocabulary of the book He repeated Vesuvio
many times however with scornful angry or imploring intonations and
Louise finally said

He thinks you want to go to the volcano Uncle The hotel is the
Vesuve not the Vesuvius

Whats the difference

I dont know

All right you girls just hop in and leave the rest to me

He tumbled them all into the vehicle bag and baggage and then said
sternly to the driver

Hotel VesuveVesuvehotel Vesuve Drive there darned quick or
Ill break your confounded neck

The carriage started It plowed its way jerkily through the dustladen
streets and finally stopped at an imposing looking structure The day
was growing darker and an electric lamp burned before the entrance
But no one came out to receive them

Uncle John climbed out and read the sign Hotel du Vesuve It was the
establishment he had been advised to stop at while in Naples He
compared the sign with a card which he drew from his pocket and knew
that he had made no mistake

Entering the spacious lobby he found it deserted In the office a man
was hastily making a package of some books and papers and did not
respond or even look up when spoken to At the concierges desk a big
whiskered man sat staring straight ahead of him with a look of abject
terror in his eyes

Good morning said Uncle John Fine day isnt it

Did you hear it whispered the concierge as a dull boom like that of
a distant cannon made the windows rattle in their casements

Of course replied Mr Merrick carelessly Old Vesuve seems on a
rampage But never mind that now Weve just come from America where
the mountains are more polite and were going to stop at your hotel

The concierges eyes wandered from the man to the three girls who had
entered and grouped themselves behind him Then they fell upon the
driver of the carriage who burst into a torrent of vociferous but
wholly unintelligible exclamations which Uncle John declared must be an
excuseand a mighty poor onefor talking

The whiskered man whose cap was elaborately embroidered in gold with
the words Hotel du Vesuve seemed to understand the driver He sighed
drearily and said to Mr Merrick

You must pay him thirty lira

How much is that

Six dollars

Not by a jugfull

You made no bargain

I couldnt He cant talk

He claims it is you who cannot talk

What

And prices are advanced during these awful days What does it matter
Your money will do you no good when we are all buried deep in ash and
scoria

The big man shuddered at this gloomy picture and added listlessly
Youll have to pay

Uncle John paid but the driver wouldnt accept American money The
disconsolate concierge would though He unlocked a drawer put the six
dollars into one section and drew from another two tenlira notes The
driver took them bowed respectfully to the whiskered man shot a
broadside of invective Italian at the unconscious Americans and left
the hotel

How about rooms asked Uncle John

Take any you please answered the concierge All our guests are gone
but twotwo mad Americans like yourselves The servants are also gone
the chef has gone the elevator conductors are gone If you stay youll
have to walk up

Where have they all gone asked Uncle John wonderingly

Fled sir fled to escape destruction They remember Pompeii Only
Signor Floriano the proprietor and myself are left We stick to the
last We are brave

So I see Now look here my manly hero Its possible we shall all
live through it Ill bet you a thousand to ten that we do And then
youll be glad to realize youve pocketed a little more American money
Come out of that box and show us some rooms and Ill help to build up
your fortune

The concierge obeyed Even the horrors of the situation could not
eliminate from his carefully trained nature that desire to accumulate
which is the prime qualification of his profession The Americans walked
up one flight and found spacious rooms on the first floor of which they
immediately took possession

Send for our trunks said Mr Merrick and the man consented to do so
provided he could secure a proper vehicle

You will be obliged to pay high for it he warned but that will not
matter To witness the destruction of our beautiful Naples is an unusual
sight It will be worth your money

Well settle that in the dim hereafter replied Uncle John You get
the trunks and Ill take care of the finances

When the concierge had retired the girls began to stuff newspapers into
the cracks of the windows of their sitting room where the fine ash was
sifting in and forming little drifts several inches in thickness Also
the atmosphere of the room was filled with impalpable particles of dust
which rendered breathing oppressive and unpleasant

Uncle John watched them for a time and his brow clouded

See here girls he exclaimed lets hold a council of war Do you
suppose we are in any real danger

They grouped around him with eager interest

Its something new to be in danger and rather exciting dont you
think said Beth But perhaps were as safe as we would be at home

Once said Louise slowly there was a great eruption of Vesuvius
which destroyed the cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii Many of the
inhabitants were buried alive Perhaps they thought there was no real
danger

Uncle John scratched his head reflectively

I take it he observed that the moral of your story is to light out
while we have the chance

Not necessarily observed the girl smiling at his perplexity It is
likewise true that many other eruptions have occurred when little
damage was done

Forewarned is forearmed declared Patsy Naples isnt buried more
than six inches in ashes as yet and it will take days for them to
reach to our windows provided theyre falling at the same rate they do
now I dont see any use of getting scared before tomorrow anyhow

Its a big hill said Uncle John gravely and Ive no right to take
foolish chances with three girls on my hands

Im not frightened Uncle John

Nor I

Nor I the least bit

Everyone has left the hotel but ourselves said he

How sorry they will be afterward remarked Beth

He looked at them admiringly and kissed each one

You stay in this room and dont move a peg till I get back he
enjoined them Im going out to look over the situation




CHAPTER VII

A FRIEND IN NEED


Some of Mr Merricks business friends in New York hearing of his
proposed trip had given him letters of introduction to people in
various European cities He had accepted themquite a bunch
altogetherbut had firmly resolved not to use them Neither he nor the
nieces cared to make superficial acquaintances during their wanderings
Yet Uncle John chanced to remember that one of these letters was to a
certain Colonel Angeli of the Twelfth Italian Regiment occupying the
barracks on the Pizzofalcone hill at Naples This introduction tendered
by a relative of the Colonels American wife was now reposing in Mr
Merricks pocket and he promptly decided to make use of it in order to
obtain expert advice as to the wisdom of remaining in the stricken city

Enquiring his way from the still dazed concierge he found that the
Pizzofalcone barracks were just behind the hotel but several hundred
feet above it so he turned up the Strada St Lucia and soon came upon
the narrow lane that wound upward to the fortifications It was a long
and tedious climb in the semidarkness caused by the steady fall of
ashes and at intervals the detonations from Vesuvius shook the huge
rock and made its massive bulk seem insecure But the little man
persevered and finally with sweating brow arrived at the barracks

A soldier carried in the letter to his colonel and presently returned to
usher Uncle John through the vast building up a flight of steps and so
to a large covered balcony suspended many hundred feet above the Via
Partenope where the hotel was situated

Here was seated a group of officers watching intently the cloud that
marked the location of the volcano Colonel Angeli big and bluff his
uniform gorgeous his dark heavy moustaches carefully waxed his
handsome face as ingenuous and merry as a schoolboys greeted the
American with a gracious courtesy that made Uncle John feel quite at
his ease When he heard of the nieces the Italian made a grimace and
then laughed

I am despairing signore said he in English sufficiently
strangulated to be amusing but nevertheless quite comprehensible that
you and the sweet signorini are to see our lovely Naples under
tribulations so very great But yesterday in all the world is no city
so enchanting so brilliant so gay Todaylook is it not horrible
Vesuvio is sick and Naples mourns until the tyrant is well again

But the danger said Uncle John What do you think of the wisdom of
our staying here Is it safe to keep my girls in Naples during this
eruption

Ah Why not This very morning the mountain asunder burst and we who
love our people dread the news of devastation we shall hear From the
observatory where His Majestys faithful servant still remains come
telegrams that the great pebbleswhat we call scoriahave ruined
Ottajano and San Guiseppe Perhaps they are overwhelmed But the beast
has vomited he will feel better now and ever become more quiet

I suppose remarked Mr Merrick thoughtfully that no one knows
exactly what the blamed hill may do next I dont like to take chances
with three girls on my hands They are a valuable lot Colonel and
worth saving

The boyish Italian instantly looked grave Then he led Uncle John away
from the others although doubtless he was the only officer present able
to speak or understand English and said to him

Where are you living

At the hotel named after your sick mountainthe Vesuve

Very good In the bay not distant from your hotel lies a government
launch that is under my command At my home in the Viala Elena are a
wife and two children who should danger that is serious arise will be
put by my soldiers on the launch to carry them to safety Admirable is
it not

Very good arrangement said Uncle John

It renders me content to know that in any difficulty they cannot be
hurt I am not scare myself but it is pleasant to know I have what you
call the side that is safe From my American wife I have many of your
excellent speech figures But now The launch is big Remain happy in
Napleshappy as Vesuvio will let youand watch his vast his gigantic
exhibition If danger come you all enter my launch and be saved If no
danger you have a marvelous experience The serious look glided from
his face and was replaced by a smile as bright as before

Thank you very much responded Uncle John gratefully I shall go
back to the girls well satisfied

Make the signorini stay in today warned the colonel It is bad
just now and so black one can nothing at all observe Tomorrow it will
be better and all can go without I will see you myself then and tell
you what to do

Then he insisted that Uncle John clear his parched throat with a glass
of vermoutha harmless drink of which all Italians are very fondand
sent him away much refreshed in body and mind

He made his way through the ashy rain back to the hotel People were
holding umbrellas over their heads and plodding through the dust with
seeming unconcern At one corner a street singer was warbling stopping
frequently to cough the lava dust from his throat or shake it from his
beloved mandolin A procession of peasants passed chanting slowly and
solemnly a religious hymn At the head of the column was borne aloft a
gilded statuette of the Virgin and although Uncle John did not know it
these simple folks were trusting in the sacred image to avert further
disaster from the angry mountain

On arriving home Mr Merrick told the girls with great elation of his
new friend and how they were to be taken aboard the launch in case of
emergency

But how will we know when danger threatens asked Louise

While Uncle John tried to think of an answer to this puzzling query
someone knocked upon the door The concierge was standing in the
passage and beside him was a soldier in uniform a natty cocks plume
upon his beaver hat and a short carbine over his arm

A guard from Colonel Angeli Signor said the concierge
respectfullythe first respectful tone he had yet employed

The soldier took off his hat with a flourish and bowed low

He is to remain in the hotel sir yet will not disturb you in any
way continued the whiskered one But should he approach you at any
time and beckon you to follow him do so at once and without
hesitation It is Colonel Angelis wish You are in the charge of this
brave man who will watch over your welfare

That settles it my dears said Uncle John cheerfully when the
soldier and the concierge had withdrawn This Italian friend doesnt do
things by halves and I take it we are perfectly safe from this time
on




CHAPTER VIII

ACROSS THE BAY


Tom Horton called an hour later He was in despair because his party had
decided to leave Naples for Rome and he feared Beth would be engulfed
by the volcano unless he was present to protect her

Mr Merrick said the boy earnestly youll take good care of Miss
De Graf sir wont you We both live in Ohio you know and weve just
got acquainted andand Id like to see her again some time if she
escapes

Uncle Johns eyes twinkled but he drew a long face

My dear Tom he said dont ask me to take care of anyoneplease
dont I brought these girls along to take care of methree of em
sirand theyve got to do their duty Dont you worry about the girls
just you worry about me

That was not much consolation for the poor fellow but he could do
nothing more than wring their handsBeths twice by mistakeand wish
them good luck before he hurried away to rejoin his family

Im sorry to see him go said Beth honestly Tom is a nice boy

Quite right agreed Uncle John I hope we shall meet no worse fellows
than Tom Horton

At noon they were served a modest luncheon in their rooms for Signor
Floriano having sent his important papers to a place of safety had
resolved to stick to his hotel and do his duty by any guests that chose
to remain with him in defiance of the existent conditions He had
succeeded in retaining a few servants who had more courage than those
that had stampeded at the first alarm and while the hotel service for
the next few days was very inadequate no one was liable to suffer any
great privation

During the afternoon the gloom grew denser than before while thicker
than ever fell the rain of ashes This was the worst day Naples
experienced during the great eruption and Uncle John and his nieces
were content to keep their rooms and live in the glare of electric
lights Owing to their wise precautions to keep out the heavily laden
air they breathed as little lava dust into their lungs as any people
perhaps in the city but to escape all was impossible Their eyes and
throats became more or less inflamed by the floating atoms and the
girls declared they felt as if they were sealed up in a tomb

Well my chickens how do you like being abroad and actually in
Europe enquired Uncle John cheerfully

Beth and Patsy smiled at him but Louise looked up from the Baedecker
she was studying and replied

Its simply delightful Uncle and Im glad we happened here during
this splendid eruption of Vesuvius Onlyonly

Only what my dear

Only it is such hard work to keep clean answered his dainty niece
Even the water is full of lava and Im sure my face looks like a
chimneysweeps

And you Beth

I dont like it Uncle Im sure Id prefer Naples in sunshine
although this is an experience we can brag about when we get home

That is the idea exactly said Louise and the only thing that
reconciles me to the discomforts Thousands see Naples in sunshine but
few can boast seeing Vesuvius in eruption It will give us considerable
prestige when we return home

Ah that is why I selected this time to bring you here declared Uncle
John with a comical wink I ordered the eruption before I left home
and I must say theyve been very prompt about it and done the thing up
brown Eh Patsy

Right you are Uncle But you might tell em to turn off the eruption
now because weve had enough

Dont like Europe eh

Why if I thought all Europe was surrounded by volcanoes Id go home
at once if I had to walk But the geographies dont mention many of
these spouters so we may as well stick out our present experience and
hope the rest of the continent will behave better The Majorll be
worried to death when he hears of this

Ive sent him a cable said Uncle John

What did you say asked Patsy eagerly

All safe and well and enjoying the fireworks

Im glad you did that replied the girl deeply grateful at this
evidence of thoughtfulness Its bad enough for the Major to have me
away without making him worry into the bargain

Well no one is likely to worry about me said Beth philosophically

Mother seldom reads the papers except to get the society news
remarked Louise I doubt if shell hear of the eruption unless the
Major happens to tell her

Ive cabled them all said Uncle John Theyre entitled to know that
their kidiwinkles are in good shape

The evening was a tedious one although they tried to enliven it with a
game of bridge in which Uncle John and Louise were quite proficient
and the others dreadfully incompetent Once in a while the volcano
thundered a deep detonation that caused the windows to shiver but the
Americans were getting used to the sound and paid little heed to it

In the morning the wind had shifted and although the air was still full
of dust all nearby objects were clearly visible and even the outline of
Vesuvius could be seen sending skyward its pillar of black smoke

Colonel Angeli appeared soon after breakfast his uniform fresh and
bright and his boyish face beaming as pleasantly as ever

Vesuvio is better said he but the rascal has badly acted and done
much harm to our poor people Like Herculaneum our Boscatrecase is
covered with lava like Pompeii our Ottajano is buried in ashes Let me
advise you Today go to Sorrento and there stay for a time until we
can the dust brush from our streets and prepare to welcome you with the
comfort more serene I must myself ride to the villages that are
suffering My men are already gone with the RedCross corps to succor
whom they can I will send to you word when you may return Just now
should you stay you will be able to see nothing at all

I believe that is wise counsel replied Uncle John

Sorrento has no ashes continued the Colonel and from there you may
watch the volcano better than from Naples Today come the Duke and
Duchess dAosta to render assistance to the homeless and hungry
tomorrow His Majesty the King will be here to discover what damage has
been caused Alas we have no sackcloth but we are in ashes I trust
you will pardon my poor Naples for her present inhospitality

Sure thing said Uncle John The city may be under a cloud but her
people are the right stuff and we are greatly obliged to you for all
your kindness to us

But that is so little said the colonel deprecatingly

They decided to leave their heavy baggage at the Hotel du Vesuve and
carried only their suitcases and light luggage aboard the little
steamer that was bound across the bay for Sorrento The decks were
thronged with people as eager to get away from the stricken city as were
our friends and Uncle John was only enabled to secure seats for his
girls by bribing a steward so heavily that even that modern brigand was
amazed at his good fortune

The ride was short but very interesting for they passed under the
shadow of the smoking mountain and came into a fresh sweet atmosphere
that was guiltless of a speck of the disagreeable lava dust that had so
long annoyed them The high bluffs of Sorrento with their picturesque
villas and big hotels seemed traced in burnished silver by the strong
sunshine and every member of Uncle Johns party was glad that Colonel
Angeli had suggested this pleasant change of condition

Small boats took them ashore and an elevator carried them swiftly to the
top of the cliff and deposited them on the terrace of the Victoria a
beautiful inn that nestled in a garden brilliant with splendid flowers
and shrubbery Here they speedily established themselves preparing to
enjoy their first real experience of Sunny Italy




CHAPTER IX

COUNT FERRALTI


At dinner it was announced that the famous Tarantella would be danced in
the lower hall of the hotel at nine oclock and the girls told Uncle
John that they must not miss this famous sight which is one of the most
unique in Sorrento or indeed in all Italy

As they entered the pretty circular hall devoted to the dance Louise
gave a start of surprise A goodly audience had already assembled in the
room and among them the girl seemed to recognize an acquaintance for
after a brief hesitation she advanced and placed her hand in that of a
gentleman who had risen on her entrance and hastened toward her

He was a nice looking young fellow Beth thought and had a foreign and
quite distinguished air

Presently Louise turned with cheeks somewhat flushed and brought the
gentleman to her party introducing him to Uncle John and her cousins as
Count Ferralti whom she had once met in New York while he was on a
visit to America

The Count twirled his small and slender moustaches in a way that Patsy
thought affected and said in excellent English

It delights me to meet Mr Merrick and the young ladies May I express
a hope that you are pleased with my beautiful country

Are you Italian asked Uncle John regarding the young man critically

Surely Mr Merrick But I have resided much in New York and may well
claim to be an adopted son of your great city

New York adopts a good many said Uncle John drily It has even been
thoughtless enough to adopt me

The dancers entered at that moment and the Americans were forced to seat
themselves hastily so as not to obstruct the view of others Count
Ferralti found a place beside Louise but seemed to have little to say
to her during the course of the entertainment

The dances were unique and graceful being executed by a troup of
laughing peasants dressed in native costume who seemed very proud of
their accomplishment and anxious to please the throng of tourists
present The Tarantella originated in Ischia but Sorrento and Capri
have the best dancers

Afterward Uncle John and his nieces stood upon the terrace and watched
the volcano rolling its dense clouds mingled with sparks of redhot
scoria toward the sky The Count clung to Louises side but also tried
to make himself agreeable to her cousins In their rooms that night
Patsy told Beth that the young foreigner was too highfalutin to suit
her and Beth replied that his manners were so like those of their
Cousin Louise that the two ought to get along nicely together

Uncle John liked his nieces to make friends and encouraged young men
generally to meet them but there was something in the appearance of
this callow Italian nobleman that stamped his character as artificial
and insincere He resolved to find out something about his antecedents
before he permitted the young fellow to establish friendly relations
with his girls

Next morning after breakfast he wandered through the lobby and paused at
the little office where he discovered that the proprietor of this hotel
was a brother of that Floriano who managed the Hotel du Vesuve That
gave him an excuse to talk with the man who spoke very good English and
was exceedingly courteous to his guestsespecially when they were
American

I see you have Count Ferralti with you remarked Uncle John

Whom sir

FerraltiCount Ferralti The young man standing by the window
yonder

II did not know he said hesitatingly The gentleman arrived last
evening and I had not yet learned his name Let me see he turned to
his list of guests who register by card and not in a book and
continued Ah yes he has given his name as Ferralti but added no
title A count did you say

Yes replied Uncle John

The proprietor looked curiously toward the young man whose back only
was visible Then he remarked that the eruption of Vesuvius was waning
and the trouble nearly over for this time

Are the Ferraltis a good family asked Uncle John abruptly

That I cannot tell you Signor Merrick

Oh Perhaps you know little about the nobility of your country

I I know little of the nobility answered Floriano indignantly My
dear signor there is no man better posted as to our nobility in all
Italy

Yet you say you dont know the Ferralti family

The proprietor reached for a book that lay above his desk

Observe signor Here is our record of nobility It is the same as the
Blue Book or the Peerage of England Either fortunately or
unfortunatelyI cannot sayyou have no need of such a book in
America

He turned the pages and ran his finger down the line of Fs

Find me if you can a Count Ferralti in the list

Uncle John looked He put on his glasses and looked again The name of
Ferralti was no place in the record

Then there is no such count Signor Floriano

And no such noble family Signor Merrick

Uncle John whistled softly and walked away to the window The young man
greeted him with a smile and a bow

I misunderstood your name last evening he said I thought you were
Count Ferralti

And that is right sir was the prompt reply Allow me to offer you
my card

Uncle John took the card and read

     CONTE LEONARDI FERRALTI
                     Milano Italia

He carefully placed the card in his pocketbook

Thank you said he Its a fine morning Count

Charming Mr Merrick

Uncle John walked away He was glad that he had not suspected the young
man unjustly When an imposture is unmasked it is no longer dangerous

He joined his nieces who were all busily engaged in writing letters
home and remarked casually

Youve been deceived in your Italian friend Louise He is neither a
count nor of noble family although I suppose when you met him in New
York he had an object in posing as a titled aristocrat

The girl paused examining the point of her pen thoughtfully

Are you sure Uncle John

Quite sure my dear Ive just been through the list of Italian counts
and his name is not there Floriano the proprietor who knows every
aristocrat in Italy has never before heard of him

How singular exclaimed Louise I wonder why he has tried to deceive
us

Oh the world is full of impostors but when you are on to their game
they are quite harmless Of course we wont encourage this young man in
any way It will be better to avoid him

Hehe seems very nice and gentlemanly said Louise with hesitation

The other girls exchanged glances but made no remark Uncle John hardly
knew what to say further He felt he was in an awkward position for
Louise was the most experienced in worldly ways of his three nieces and
he had no desire to pose as a stern guardian or to deprive his girls of
any passing pleasure they might enjoy Moreover Louise being in love
with that young Weldon her mother so strongly objected to she would not
be likely to care much for this Italian fellow and Mrs Merrick had
enjoined him to keep her daughters mind from dwelling on her
entanglement

Oh well my dear he said to her you must act as you see fit I do
not imagine we shall see much of this young man in any event and now
that you are well aware of the fact that he is sailing under false
colors you will know how to handle him better than I can advise you

I shall be very careful said Louise slowly as she resumed her
writing

Well then girls what do you say to a stroll around the village
asked their uncle Im told its a proper place to buy silk stockings
and inlaid woodwork They come assorted I suppose

Beth and Patsy jumped up with alacrity but Louise pleaded that she had
several more letters to write so the others left her and passed the
rest of the forenoon in rummaging among the quaint shops of Sorrento
staring at the statue of Tasso and enjoying the street scenes so
vividly opposed to those of America It was almost their first glimpse
of foreign manners and customs In Naples they had as yet seen nothing
but darkness and falling ashes




CHAPTER X

THE ROAD TO AMALFI


The Hotel Victoria faces the bay of Naples Back of it are the famous
gardens and as you emerge from these you find yourself upon the narrow
main street of Sorrento not far from the Square of Tasso

As our little party entered this street they were immediately espied by
the vetturini or cabmen who rushed toward them with loud cries while
they waved their whips frantically to attract attention One tall fellow
was dressed in a most imposing uniform of blue and gold with a high hat
bearing a cockade a la Inglese and shiny top boots His long legs
enabled him to outstrip the others and in an almost breathless voice he
begged Uncle John to choose his carriage the besta carrozza ina town

We dont want to ride was the answer

The cabman implored Certainly they must make the Amalfi drive or to
Massa Lubrense or Saint Agata or at least Il Deserto The others stood
by to listen silently to the discussion yielding first place to the
victor in the race

Uncle John was obdurate

All we want today is to see the town he declared Were not going
to ride but walk

Ah but the Amalfi road signore Surely you will see that

Tomorrow perhaps not now

Tomorrow signore It is good At what hour tomorrow
illustrissimo

Oh dont bother me

We may as well drive to Amalfi tomorrow suggested Beth It is the
proper thing to do Uncle

All right well go then

You take my carrozza signore begged the cabman It is besta ina
town

Let us see it

Instantly the crowd scampered back to the square followed more
leisurely by Uncle John and the girls There the uniformed vetturio
stood beside the one modern carriage in the group It was new it was
glossy it had beautiful carefully brushed cushions it was drawn by a
pair of splendid looking horses

Is not bellissima signore asked the man proudly

All right announced Uncle John nodding approval Be ready to start
at nine oclock tomorrow morning

The man promised whereat his confreres lost all interest in the matter
and the strangers were allowed to proceed without further interruption

They found out all about the Amalfi drive that evening and were glad
indeed they had decided to go Even Louise was pleased at the
arrangement and as eager as the others to make the trip It is one of
the most famous drives in the world along a road built upon the rocky
cliff that overhangs the sea and continually winds in and out as it
follows the outlines of the crags

They had an early breakfast and were ready at nine oclock but when
they came to the gate of the garden they found only a dilapidated
carriage standing before it

Do you know where my rig is Uncle John asked the driver at the same
time peering up and down the road

It is me sir signore I am engage by you Is it not so

Mr Merrick looked at the driver carefully It was longlegs sure
enough but shorn of his beautiful regalia

Wheres your uniform he asked

Ah I have leave it home The road is dusty very I must not ruin a
nice dress when I work answered the man smiling unabashed

But the carriage What has become of the fine carriage and the good
horses sir

Ah it is dreadful it is horrible signore I find me the carrozza is
not easy it is not perfect it do not remain good for a long ride So I
leave him home for I am kind I do not wish the signorini bella to tire
and weep But see the fine vetture you now have Is he not easy like
feathers an strong an molto buena

It may be a bird but it dont look it said Uncle John doubtfully
I rented the best looking rig in town and you bring me the worst

Only try signore Others may look it is only you who must ride You
will be much please when we return

Well I suppose we may as well take it said the little man in a
resigned tone Hop in my dears

They entered the crazy looking vehicle and found the seats ample and
comfortable despite the appearance of dilapidation everywhere prevalent
The driver mounted the box cracked his whip and the lean nags ambled
away at a fair pace

They passed near to the square where the first thing that attracted
Uncle Johns attention was the beautiful turnout he had hired yesterday
It was standing just as it had before and beside it was another man
dressed in the splendid uniform his driver had claimed that he had left
at home

Herestop Stop I say he yelled at the man angrily But the fellow
seemed suddenly deaf and paid no heed He cracked his whip and rattled
away through the streets without a glance behind him The girls laughed
and Uncle John stopped waving his arms and settled into his seat with a
groan

Weve been swindled my dears he said swindled most beautifully
But I suppose we may as well make the best of it

Better agreed Patsy This rig is all right Uncle It may not be as
pretty as the other but I expect that one is only kept to make
engagements with When it comes to actual use we dont get it

Thats true enough he returned But Ill get even with this rascal
before Ive done with him never fear

It was a cold raw morning but the portiere at the Victoria had told
them the sun would be out presently and the day become more genial
Indeed the sun did come out but only to give a discouraged look at the
landscape and retire again During this one day in which they rode to
Amalfi and back Uncle John afterward declared that they experienced
seven different kinds of weather They had sunshine rain hail snow
and a tornado and then rain again and more sunshine Sunny Italy
seemed a misnomer that day as indeed it does many days in winter and
spring when the climate is little better than that prevailing in the
eastern and central portions of the United States And perhaps one
suffers more in Italy than in America owing to the general lack of
means to keep warm on cold days The Italian shivering and blue will
tell you it is not cold at all for he will permit no reproach to lie on
his beloved land but the traveller frequently becomes discouraged and
the American contingent especially blames those misleading English
writers who finding relief from their own bleak island in Italian
climes exaggerated the conditions by apostrophizing the country as
Sunny Italy and for more than a century uttered such rhapsodies in its
praise that the whole world credited themuntil it acquired personal
experience of the matter

Italy is beautiful it is charming and delightful but seldom is this
true in winter or early spring

The horses went along at a spanking pace that was astonishing They
passed through the picturesque lanes of Sorrento climbed the further
slope and brought the carriage to the other side of the peninsula
where the girls obtained their first view of the Gulf of Salerno with
the lovely Isles of the Sirens lying just beneath them

And now they were on the great road that skirts the coast as far as
Salerno and has no duplicate in all the known world For it is cut from
the solid rock of precipitous cliffs rising straight from the sea which
the highway overhangs at an average height of five hundred feet the
traveller being protected only by a low stone parapet from the vast gulf
that yawns beneath And on the other side of the road the cliffs
continue to ascend a like distance toward the sky their irregular
surfaces dotted with wonderful houses that cling to the slopes and
vineyards that look as though they might slip down at any moment upon
the heads of timorous pilgrims

When it rained they put up the carriage top which afforded but partial
shelter The shower was brief but was shortly followed by hail as big
as peas which threatened to dash in the frail roof of their carrozza
While they shrank huddled beneath the blankets the sun came out
suddenly and the driver shed his leathern apron cracked his whip and
began singing merrily as the vehicle rolled over the smooth road

Our travellers breathed again and prepared to enjoy once more the
wonderful vistas that were unfolded at every turn of the winding way
Sometimes they skirted a little cove where hundreds of feet below the
fishermen sat before their tiny huts busily mending their nets From
that distance the boats drawn upon the sheltered beach seemed like mere
toys Then they would span a chasm on a narrow stone bridge or plunge
through an arch dividing the solid mountain But ever the road returned
in a brief space to the edge of the seacliff and everywhere it was
solid as the hills themselves and seemingly as secure

They had just sighted the ancient town of Positano and were circling a
gigantic point of rock when the great adventure of the day overtook
them Without warning the wind came whistling around them in a great
gale which speedily increased in fury until it drove the blinded horses
reeling against the low parapet and pushed upon the carriage as if
determined to dash it over the precipice

As it collided against the stone wall the vehicle tipped dangerously
hurling the driver from his seat to dive headforemost into the space
beneath But the man clung to the reins desperately and they arrested
his fall leaving him dangling at the end of them while the maddened
horses jerked at the bits by the weight of the man reared and plunged
as if they would in any instant tumble themselves and the carriage over
the cliff

At this critical moment a mounted horseman who unobserved had been
following the party dashed to their rescue The rider caught the
plunging steeds by their heads and tried to restrain their terror at
his own eminent peril while the carriage lay wedged against the wall
and the driver screamed pitifully from his dangerous position midway
between sea and sky

Then Beth slipped from her seat to the flat top of the parapet stepped
boldly to where the reins were pulling upon the terrified horses and
seized them in her strong grasp

Hold fast she called calmly to the driver and began dragging him
upward inch by inch

He understood instantly the task she had undertaken and in a moment his
courage returned and he managed to get his foot in a crack of the rock
and assist her by relieving her of part of his weight Just above was a
slight ledge he could reach it now and then she had him by the arm so
that another instant found him clinging to the parapet and drawing
himself into a position of safety

The wind had died away as suddenly as it came upon them The horses as
soon as the strain upon their bits was relaxed were easily quieted
Before those in the carriage had quite realized what had occurred the
adventure was accomplished the peril was past and all was well again

Uncle John leaped from the carriage followed by Louise and Patsy The
young horseman who had come to their assistance so opportunely was none
other than Count Ferralti whom they had such good reason to distrust
He was sitting upon his horse and staring with amazement at Beth at
whose feet the driver was grovelling while tears flowed down his bronzed
cheeks and he protested in an absurd mixture of English and Italian by
every saint in the calendar that the girl had saved him from a
frightful death and he would devote his future life to her service

It is wonderful murmured Ferralti However could such a slip of a
girl do so great a deed

Why its nothing at all returned Beth flushing were trained to
do such things in the gymnasium at Cloverton and Im much stronger than
I appear to be

Twas her head mostly said Patsy giving her cousin an admiring hug
she kept her wits while the rest of us were scared to death

Uncle John had been observing the Count One of the young mans hands
hung limp and helpless

Are you hurt sir he asked

Ferralti smiled and his eyes rested upon Louise

A little perhaps Mr Merrick but it is unimportant The horses were
frantic at the time and wrenched my wrist viciously as I tried to hold
them I felt something snap a small bone perhaps But I am sure it is
nothing of moment

Wed better get back to Sorrento said Uncle John abruptly

Not on my account I beg of you returned Ferralti quickly We are
half way to Amalfi now and you may as well go on For my part if the
wrist troubles me I will see a surgeon at Amalfithat is if you
permit me to accompany you

He said this with a defferent bow and a glance of inquiry

Uncle John could not well refuse The young fellow might be a sham
count but the manliness and courage he had displayed in their grave
emergency surely entitled him to their grateful consideration

You are quite welcome to join us said Uncle John

The driver had by now repaired a broken strap and found his equippage
otherwise uninjured

The horses stood meekly quiescent as if they had never known a moments
fear in their lives So the girls and their uncle climbed into the
vehicle again and the driver mounted the box and cracked his whip with
his usual vigor

The wind had subsided as suddenly as it had arisen and as they passed
through Positanowhich is four hundred feet high the houses all up and
down the side of a cliff like swallows nestsbig flakes of snow were
gently falling around them

Count Ferralti rode at the side of the carriage but did not attempt much
conversation His lips were tight set and the girls slyly observing his
face were sure his wrist was hurting him much more than he cared to
acknowledge

Circling around the cliff beyond Positano the sun greeted them shining
from out a blue sky and they wondered what had become of the bad
weather they had so lately experienced

From now on past Prajano and into Amalfi the day was brilliant and the
temperature delightful It was full noon by the time they alighted at
the little gatehouse of the ancient CappucciniConvento now a hotel
much favored by the tourist Count Ferralti promised to join them later
and rode on to the town to find a surgeon to look after his injured
hand while the others slowly mounted the long inclines leading in a
zigzag fashion up to the old monastery which was founded in the year


From the arbored veranda of this charming retreat is obtained one of the
finest views in Europe and while the girls sat enjoying it Uncle John
arranged with a pleasant faced woman who had once lived in America for
their luncheon

An hour later and just as they were sitting down to the meal Count
Ferralti rejoined them His hand was bandaged and supported by a sling
and in answer to Louises gentle inquiries he said simply

It was as I had feared a small bone snapped But my surgeon is
skillful and says time will mend the wrist as good as new

In spite of his courage he could eat no luncheon but merely sipped a
glass of wine so Uncle John alarmed at his pallor insisted that he
take a seat in the carriage on the return journey Beth wanted to ride
the Counts horse home but there was no side saddle to be had so they
led the animal by a halter fastened behind the ricketty carriage and
Beth mounted the box and rode beside her friend the driver

The pleasant weather lasted until they neared Sorrento when another
shower of rain came up They reached their hotel damp and bedraggled
but enthusiastic over their wonderful trip and the interesting adventure
it had incidentally developed




CHAPTER XI

THE EAGLE SCREAMS


Despite the glories of the Amalfi road our tourists decided it was more
pleasant to loiter around Sorrento for a time than to undertake further
excursions The mornings and evenings were chill but during the middle
of the day the air was warm and delicious so the girls carried their
books and fancywork into the beautiful gardens or wandered lazily
through the highwalled lanes that shut in the villas and orange groves
Sometimes they found a gate open and were welcomed to the orchards and
permitted to pluck freely the fragrant and rich flavored fruit which is
excelled in no other section of the south country Also Uncle John with
Beth and Patsy frequented the shops of the woodworkers and watched
their delicate and busy fingers inlaying the various colored woods but
Louise mostly kept to the garden where Count Ferralti being a
semiinvalid was content to sit by her side and amuse her

In spite of her uncles discovery of the false position assumed by this
young man Louise seemed to like his attentions and to approve his
evident admiration for her His ways might be affected and effeminate
and his conversational powers indifferent but his bandaged wrist was a
constant reminder to all the nieces that he possessed courage and ready
wit and it was but natural that he became more interesting to them
because just now he was to an extent helpless and his crippled hand had
been acquired in their service

Uncle John watched the young fellow shrewdly but could discover little
harm in him except his attempt to deceive them in regard to his name and
position Yet in his mature eyes there was not much about Ferralti to
arouse admiration and the little man considered his girls too sensible
to be greatly impressed by this youthful Italians personality So he
allowed him to sit with his nieces in the gardens as much as he
pleased believing it would be ungrateful to deprive the count of that
harmless recreation

A reglar chaperone might think differently he reflected but thank
goodness there are no dragons swimming in our cup of happiness

One day they devoted to Capri and the Blue Grotto and afterward they
lunched at the Quisisana and passed the afternoon in the town But the
charms of Sorrento were too great for Capri to win their allegiance and
they were glad to get back to their quaint town and delightful gardens
again

The week passed all too swiftly and then came a letter from Colonel
Angeli telling them to return to Naples and witness the results of the
eruption This they decided to do and bidding goodbye to Signor
Floriano and his excellent hotel they steamed across the bay and found
the Vesuve a vastly different hostelry from the dismal place they had
left in their flight from Naples It was now teeming with life for all
danger being past the tourists had flocked to the city in droves The
town was still covered with ashes but under the brilliant sunshine it
did not look as gloomy as one might imagine and already thousands of
carts were busily gathering the dust from the streets and dumping it in
the waters of the bay It would require months of hard work though
before Naples could regain a semblance of its former beauty

Their friend the Colonel personally accompanied them to the towns that
had suffered the most from the eruption At Boscatrecasa they walked
over the great beds of lava that had demolished the townbanks of
cinders looking like lumps of pumice stone and massed from twenty to
thirty feet in thickness throughout the valley The lava was still so
hot that it was liable to blister the soles of their feet unless they
kept constantly moving It would be many more days before the interior
of the mass became cold

Through the forlorn dustcovered vineyards they drove to San Guiseppe
where a church roof had fallen in and killed one hundred and forty
people maiming many more The RedCross tents were pitched in the
streets and the whole town was one vast hospital Ottajano a little
nearer to the volcano had been buried in scoria and ninetenths of
the roofs had fallen in rendering the dwellings untenable

From here a clear view of Mt Vesuvius could be obtained The shape of
the mountain had greatly altered and the cone had lost sixtyfive feet
of its altitude But when one gazed upon the enormous bulk of volcanic
deposit that littered the country for miles around it seemed to equal a
dozen mountains the size of Vesuvius The marvel was that so much ashes
and cinders could come from a single crater in so short a period

Naples was cleaning house but slowly and listlessly The people seemed
as cheerful and lighthearted as ever The volcano was one of their
crosses and they bore it patiently The theatres would remain closed
for some weeks to come but the great Museo Nationale was open and
Uncle John and his nieces were much interested in the bronze and marble
statuary that here form the greatest single collection in all the world

It was at the Museum that Mr Merrick was arrested for the first time
in his life an experience he never afterward forgot

Bad money is so common in Naples that Uncle John never accepted any
change from anyone but obtained all his silver coins and notes directly
from the Banca Commerciale Italiana a government institution One
morning he drove with the girls to the museum and paid the cabman a
lira but before he could ascend the steps the man was after him and
holding out a leaden coin claiming that his fare had given him bad
money and must exchange it for good This is so common a method of
swindling that Uncle John paid no heed to the demands of the cabman
until one of the Guard Municipale in his uniform of dark blue with
yellow buttons and cap placed a restraining hand upon the Americans
shoulder

Uncle John angrily shook him off but the man persisted and an
interpreter employed by the museum stepped forward and explained that
unless the cabman was given a good coin in exchange for the bad one the
guarde would be obliged to take him before a commissionaire or
magistrate

But I gave him a good coina lira direct from the bank declared
Uncle John

He exhibits a bad one returned the interpreter calmly

Hes a swindler

He is a citizen of Naples and entitled to a just payment said the
other shrugging his shoulders

You are all leagued together said Uncle John indignantly But you
will get no more money out of me I promise you

The result was that the stubborn American was placed under arrest
Leaving the girls at the museum in charge of Ferralti who had made no
attempt to interfere in the dispute but implored Uncle John to pay and
avoid trouble the angry prisoner was placed in the same cab he had
arrived in and with the officer seated beside him was publicly driven
to the office of the magistrate

This official understood no English but he glowered and frowned
fiercely when the American was brought before him The guarde and the
cabman stood with bared bowed heads and in low tones preferred the
charge against the prisoner but Uncle John swaggered up to the desk and
pounded his clinched fist upon it while he roared a defiance of Italian
injustice and threatened to bring over a few warships and blow Naples
into kingdom come

The magistrate was startled and ordered the prisoner searched for
concealed weapons Uncle John doubled his fists and dared the guarde to
touch him

Then the cabman was dispatched for someone who could speak English and
when an interpreter arrived the American told him to send for the United
States consul and also to inform the magistrate that nothing but war
between America and Italy could wipe out the affront that had been
thrust upon him

The magistrate was disturbed and preferred not to send for the consul
He offered to release Uncle John if he would give the cabman a good lira
in exchange for the bad one The official fee would be five liraor say
three liraor even two Uncle John flatly refused to pay anything to
anybody Only war could settle this international complicationbloody
and bitter war The consul must cable at once for warships and troops
He would insist upon it All compromise was now impossible

The magistrate was frightened The guardes eyes bulged with horror and
he trembled visibly It was evident they had made a grave mistake in
arresting this mad American who was evidently a personage of great
importance and able to declare war at a moments notice The cabman the
magistrate the guarde and the interpreter put their heads together and
chattered voluble Italianall speaking at once in excited toneswhile
Uncle John continued to warn them at the top of his lungs that their
country was doomed to sudden annihilation and they were the culprits
responsible for the coming calamity

As a result they bundled the irate American into the carriage again and
drove him poste haste back to the museum where they deposited him upon
the steps Then in a flash the guarde and the cabman disappeared from
sight and were seen no more

The victor smiled proudly as his nieces rushed toward him

Did you have to pay another lira Uncle asked Patsy anxiously

Not on your life my dear mopping his brow vigorously Theyre a lot
of cutthroats and assassinspolicemen magistrates and allbut when
the eagle screams theyre wise enough to duck

The girls laughed

And did the eagle scream then Patsy enquired

Just a little my dear but if it whispered it would sound mighty loud
in this mummified old world But weve lost enough time for one day
Come lets go see Narcissus and the Dancing Faun




CHAPTER XII

MOVING ON


Heres a letter from my dear old friend Silas Watson said Uncle John
delightedly Its from Palermo where he has been staying with his
wardand your friend girlsKenneth Forbes and he wants me to lug you
all over to Sicily at once

Thats jolly said Patsy with a bright smile Id like to see
Kenneth again

I suppose he is a great artist by this time said Beth musingly

How singular exclaimed Louise Count Ferralti told me only this
morning that he had decided to go to Palermo

Really said Uncle John

Yes Uncle Isnt it a coincidence

Why as for that he answered slowly Im afraid it will prevent our
seeing the dear countor whatever he isagain at least for some
time For Mr Watson and Kenneth are just leaving Palermo and he asks
us to meet him in another place altogether a town calledcalledlet
me see Tormenti or Terminal or something

Give me the letter dear said Patsy I dont believe its Terminal
at all Of course not consulting the pages its Taormina

Is that in Sicily he asked

Yes Listen to what Mr Watson says Im told it is the most beautiful
spot in the world which is the same thing you hear about most beautiful
places It is eight hundred feet above the Mediterranean and nestles
peacefully in the shadow of Mount Etna

Etna cried Uncle John with a start Isnt that another volcano

To be sure said Beth the geographer Etna is the biggest volcano in
the world

Does it spout he asked anxiously

All the time they say But it is not usually dangerous

The proper thing when you go to Europe declared Uncle John
positively is to do Venice where the turpentine comes from and
Switzerland where they make chocolate and goats milk and Paris and
Monte Carlo where they kick high and melt pearls in champagne
Everybody knows that Thats what goin to Europe really means But
Sicily isnt on the programme that I ever heard of So well just tell
Silas Watson that well see him laterwhich means when we get home
again

But Sicily is beautiful protested Patsy Id as soon go there as
anywhere

Its a very romantic place added Louise reflectively

Everybody goes to France and Switzerland remarked Beth But its
because they dont know any better Lets be original Uncle and keep
out of the beaten track of travel

But the volcano exclaimed Mr Merrick Is it necessary to stick to
volcanoes to be original

Etna wont hurt us Im sure said Patsy

Isnt there a Greek theatre at Taormina asked Louise

Ive never heard of it but I suppose the Greeks have if its there
he replied But why not wait till we get home and then go to Kieths
or Hammersteins

You dont understand dear This theatre is very ancient

Playing minstrel shows in it yet I suppose Well girls if you say
Sicily Sicily it is All Im after is to give you a good time and if
you get the volcano habit it isnt my fault

It is possible the Count said Taormina instead of Palermo remarked
Louise plaintively I wasnt paying much attention at the time Ill
ask him

The others ignored this suggestion Said Patsy to her uncle

When do we go sir

Whenever you like my dears

Then I vote to move on at once decided the girl Weve got the best
out of Naples and its pretty grimey here yet

The other nieces agreed with her so Uncle John went out to enquire the
best way to get to Sicily and to make their arrangements

The steamer Victor Emmanuel of the Navigazione General Italiana line
was due to leave Naples for Messina the next evening arriving at its
destination the following morning Uncle John promptly booked places
The intervening day was spent in packing and preparing for the journey
and like all travellers the girls were full of eager excitement at the
prospect of seeing something new

Im told Sicily is an island grumbled Uncle John Here we are on a
trip to Europe and emigrating to an island the first thing we do

Sicily is Europe all right Uncle answered Patsy At least it
isnt Asia or Africa

That assertion seemed to console him a little and he grew cheerful
again

The evening was beautiful as they embarked but soon after leaving the
bay the little tubshaped steamer began to tumble and toss vigorously
so that all the passengers aboard speedily sought their berths

Uncle John found himself in a stuffy little cabin that smelled of tar
and various other flavors that were too mixed to be recognizable As a
result he passed one of the most miserable nights of his life

Toward morning he rolled out and dressed himself preferring the deck to
his bed and the first breath of salt air did much to restore him Day
was just breaking and to the right he could see a tongue of fire
flaming against the dark sky

What is that sir he enquired of an officer who passed

That is Stromboli signor the great volcano of Lipari It is always in
eruption

Uncle John groaned

Volcanoes to right of us volcanoes to left of us volleyed and
thundered he muttered dismally as he fell back in his chair

The sky brightened and the breath of the breeze changed and came to him
laden with delicious fragrance

See signore called the officer passing again before us is mighty
Etnayou can see it clearly from the bow

Volcanoes in front of us volcanoes behind us wailed the little man
But he walked to the bow and saw the shores of Sicily looming in
advance with the outline of the stately mountain rising above and
dominating it

Then the sun burst forth flooding all with a golden radiance that was
magical in its gorgeous effects Patsy came on deck and stood beside her
uncle lost in rapturous admiration Beth soon followed her

Before long they entered the Straits of Messina and passed between the
classic rock of Scylla on the Calabrian coast and the whirlpool of
Charybdis at the point of the promontory of Faro which forms the end of
the famous Golden Sickle enclosing the Bay of Messina

If this is really Europe Im glad we came said Uncle John drawing
a long breath as the ship came to anchor opposite the Palazzo
Municipale I dont remember seeing anything prettier since we left New
York

Presently they had loaded their trunks and hand baggage and
incidentally themselves into the boat of the Hotel Trinacria which came
alongside in charge of a sleepy porter After a brief examination at the
customhouse where Uncle John denied having either sugar tobacco or
perfumery they followed on foot the truck laden with their worldly
possessions and soon reached the hotel

A pleasant breakfast followed which they ate before a window
overlooking the busy marina and then they drove about the town for a
time to see in a casual way the sights In the afternoon they took the
train for Taormina Messina seemed a delightful place but if they were
going to settle in Taormina for a time it would not pay them to unpack
or linger on the way

So they rolled along the coast for a couple of hours in a quaint
oldfashioned railway carriage and were then deposited upon the
platform of the little station at Giardini

Im afraid there has been a mistake said the little man gazing
around him anxiously Theres no town here and I told the guard to put
us off at Taorminanot this forlorn place

Just then Beth discovered a line of carriages drawn up back of the
station The drivers were mostly asleep inside them although several
stood in a group arguing in fluent Italian the grave question as to
whether Signora Ganis cow had a black patch over its left shoulder or
not

Some of the carriages bore signs Hotel Timeo Grand Hotel San
Domenico Hotel CastelloaMare Grand Hotel Metropole and so
forth In that of the CastelloaMare the man was awakening and rubbing
his eyes Uncle John said to him

Good morning Had a nice rest

I thank you signore I am well refreshed was the reply

By the way can you tell us where the town of Taormina is I hate to
trouble you but wed like to know

The man waved an arm upward and following the motion with their eyes
they saw a line of precipitous cliffs that seemed impossible to scale

Do you desire to go to the Grand Hotel CastelloaMare enquired the
driver politely

Is it in Taormina

Most certainly signore

And you will take us

With pleasure signore

Oh I didnt know I supposed you were going to sleep again

The man looked at him reproachfully

It is my business signore I am very attentive to my duties If you
permit me to drive you to our splendideour magnifico hotelyou will
confer a favor

How about the baggage

The trunks signor we will send for later There is really no hurry
about them The small baggage will accompany us You will remark how
excellent is my English I am Frascatti Vietri perhaps you have heard
of me in America

If I have it has escaped my memory said Uncle John gravely

Have you been to America asked Beth

Surely signorina I lived in Chicago which as you are aware is
America My uncle had a fruit shop in South Water a via which is
Chicago Is it not so You will find few in Taormina who can the English
speak and none at all who can so perfectly speak it as Frascatti
Vietri

You are wonderful said Patsy delighted with him But Uncle John
grew impatient to be off

I hate to interrupt you Mr Vietri he hinted but if you can spare
the time we may as well make a start

The driver consented He gracefully swung the suitcases and travelling
bags to the top of the vehicle and held the door open while his fares
entered Then he mounted to his seat took the reins and spoke to the
horses Some of the other drivers nodded at him cheerfully but more as
if they were sorry he must exert himself than with any resentment at his
success in getting the only tourists who had alighted from the train

As they moved away Uncle John said Observe the difference between the
cabdrivers here and those at home In America they fight like beasts to
get a job here they seem anxious to avoid earning an honest penny If
there could be a happy medium somewhere Id like it

Are we going to the best hotel asked Louise who had seemed a trifle
disconsolate because she had not seen Count Ferralti since leaving
Naples

I dont know my dear It wasnt a question of choice but of
necessity No other hotel seemed willing to receive us

They were now winding upward over a wonderful road cut in the solid
rock It was broad and smooth and protected by a parapet of dressed
limestone Now and then they passed pleasant villas set in orchards of
golden oranges or groves of olives and almonds but there was no sign of
life on any side

The road was zigzag making a long ascent across the face of the cape
then turning abruptly to wind back again but always creeping upward
until an open space showed the station far below and a rambling stone
building at the edge of the cliff far above

Behold cried Frascatti pointing up the Grand Hotel
CastelloaMare is it not the excellenza location

Has it a roof asked Uncle John critically

Of a certainty signore But it does not show from below was the
grave reply

At times Frascatti stopped his horses to allow them to rest and then he
would turn in his seat to address his passengers in the open victoria
and descant upon the beauties of the panorama each turn unfolded

This road is new said he because we are very progressive and the
old road was most difficulty Then it was three hours from the bottom to
the top Now it is but a short hour for our energy climbs the three
miles in that brief time Shall I stop here for the sunset or will your
excellenzi hasten on

If your energy approves we will hasten returned Uncle John We love
a sunset because its bound to set anyway and we may as well make the
best of it but we have likewise an objection to being out after dark
Any brigands around here

Brigands Ah the signor is merry Never since the days of Naxos have
brigands infested our fair country

When were the days of Naxos

Some centuries before Christ signor bowing his head and making the
sign of the cross

Very good The brigands of those days must of course be dead by this
time Now sir when you have leisure let us hasten

The horses started and crept slowly upward again None of the party was
in a hurry Such beautiful glimpses of scenery were constantly visible
from the bends of the road that the girls were enraptured and could
have ridden for hours in this glorious fairyland

But suddenly the horses broke into a trot and dragged the carriage
rapidly forward over the last incline A moment later they dashed into
the court of the hotel and the driver with a loud cry of Ooah and a
crack of his whip drew up before the entrance

The portiere and the padrone or landlordthe latter being also the
proprietairecame out to greet them extending to their guests a
courteous welcome The house was very full All of the cheaper rooms
were taken but of course the Signor Americain would wish only the best
and be glad to pay

Uncle John requested them to rob him as modestly as possible without
conflicting with their sense of duty and they assured him they would do
so

The rooms were adorable They faced the sea and had little balconies
that gave one a view of the blue Mediterranean far beneath with lovely
Isola Bella and the Capo San Andrea nestling on its bosom To the right
towered the majestic peak of Etna its crest just now golden red in the
dying sunset

The girls drew in deep breaths and stood silent in a very ecstacy of
delight At their feet was a terraced garden running downward two
hundred feet to where the crag fell sheer to the sea It was glorious
with blooming flowers of every sort that grows and the people on the
balconies imagined at the moment they had been transferred to an earthly
paradise too fair and sweet for ordinary mortals And then the glow of
the sun faded softly and twilight took its place Far down the winding
road could be seen the train of carriages returning from the station
the vetturini singing their native songs as the horses slowly ascended
the slope An unseen organ somewhere in the distance ground out a
Neapolitan folk song and fresh and youthful voices sang a clear high
toned accompaniment

Even practical Uncle John stood absorbed and admiring until the soft
voice of the facchino called to ask if he wanted hot water in which to
bathe before dinner

Its no use said Patsy smiling at him from the next balcony with
tears in her eyes Theres not another Taormina on earth Here we are
and here we stay until we have to go home again

But my dear think of Paris of Venice of

Ill think of nothing but this Uncle John Unless you settle down with
us here Ill turn milkmaid and live all my days in Sicily

Beth laughed and drew her into their room

Dont be silly Patsy dear she said calmly although almost as
greatly affected as her cousin There are no cows here so you cant be
a milkmaid

Cant I milk the goats then

Why the men seem to do that dear But cheer up Weve only seen the
romance of Taormina yet doubtless it will be commonplace enough
tomorrow




CHAPTER XIII

IL DUCA


Beths prediction however did not come true The morning discovered
nothing commonplace about Taormina Their hotel was outside the walls
but a brief walk took them to the Messina Gate a quaint archway through
which they passed into the narrow streets of one of the oldest towns in
Sicily Doorways and windows of Saracen or Norman construction faced
them on every side and every inch of the ancient buildings was
picturesque and charming

Some of the houses had been turned into shops mostly for the sale of
curios Uncle John and his nieces had scarcely passed a hundred yards
into the town when one of these shops arrested their attention It was
full of antique jewelry antique furniture antique laces and antique
potteryall of the most fascinating description The jewelry was
tarnished and broken the lace had holes in it and the furniture was
decrepit and unsteady but the proprietor cared nothing for such
defects All was very old and he knew the tourist was eager to buy So
he scattered his wares inside and outside his salesroom much as the
spider spreads his web for the unwary and waited for the inevitable
tourist with a desire to acquire something ancient and useless

The girls could not be induced to pass the shop They entered the
square low room and flooded the shopman with eager questions
Notwithstanding Frascattis assertion that few in Taormina could speak
English this man was quite intelligible and fixed his prices according
to the impression his wares made upon the artistic sense of the young
American ladies

It was while they were intently inspecting some laces that the
proprietor suddenly paused in his chatter removed his hat and bowed
almost to the floor his face assuming at the same time a serious and
most humble expression

Turning around they saw standing outside the door a man whom they
recognized at once as their fellow passenger aboard the Princess
Irene

Oh Signor Valdi cried Patsy running toward him how strange to
find you again in this outoftheway place

The Italian frowned but in a dignified manner took the hand of all
three girls in turn and then bowed a greeting to Mr Merrick

Uncle John thought the fellow had improved in appearance Instead of the
flannel shirt and Prince Albert coat he had affected on shipboard he now
wore a native costume of faded velvet while a cloak of thin but
voluminous cloth swung from his shoulders and a soft felt hat shaded
his dark eyes

His appearance was entirely in keeping with the place and the American
noticed that the villagers who passed doffed their hats most
respectfully to this seemingly wellknown individual But mingled with
their polite deference was a shyness half fearful and none stopped to
speak but hurried silently on

And how do we happen to find you here Signor Valdi Patsy was
saying Do you live in Taormina

I am of this district but not of Taormina he replied It is chance
that you see me here Eh Signor Bruggi is it not so casting one of
his characteristic fierce glances at the shopkeeper

It is so your excellency

But I am glad you have come to the shadow of Etna he continued
addressing the Americans with slow deliberation Here the grandeur of
the world centers and life keeps time with Nature You will like it
You will stay

Oh for a time anyway said Patsy

We expect to meet some friends here explained Uncle John They are
coming down from Palermo but must have been delayed somewhere on the
way

Who are they asked Valdi brusquely

Americans of course Silas Watson and Kenneth Forbes Do you know of
them

No said the other He cast an uneasy glance up and down the street
I will meet you again signorini he added Which is your hotel

The CastelloaMare It is delightful said Beth

He nodded as if pleased Then folding his cloak about him he murmured
adios and stalked away without another word or look

Queer fellow remarked Uncle John

The shopkeeper drew a long breath and seemed relieved

Il Duca is unusual signore he replied

Duke cried the girls in one voice

The man seemed startled

II thought you knew him you seemed friends he stammered

We met Signor Valdi on shipboard said Uncle John

Valdi Ah yes of course the duke has been to America

Isnt his name Valdi asked Beth looking the man straight in the
eyes Has he another name here where he lives

The shopman hesitated

Who knows was the evasive reply Il Duca has many names but we do
not speak them When it is necessary to mention him we use his
titlethe duke

Why asked the girl

Why signorina Why Perhaps because he does not like to be talked
about Yes that is it I am sure

Where does he live asked Patsy

The man seemed uneasy under so much questioning

Somewhere in the mountains he said briefly His estates are there
He is said to be very rich and powerful I know nothing more
signorini

Realizing that little additional information could be gleaned from this
source they soon left the shop and wandered into the Piazzo Vittorio
Emanuele and from thence by the narrow lane to the famous Teatro Greco

For a time they admired this fascinating ruin which has the best
preserved stage of any Greek theatre now in existence From the top of
the hill is one of the most magnificent views in Sicily and here our
travellers sat in contemplative awe until Uncle John declared it was
time to return to their hotel for luncheon

As they passed the portieres desk Mr Merrick paused to ask that
important official

Tell me if you please who is Signor Victor Valdi

Valdi signore

Yes the Duke di Valdi I suppose you call him

I have never heard of him replied the man

But every one seems to know him in Taormina

Is it so We have but one duke near to us and he But never mind I
do not know this Valdi

A thin faced man with black eyes We met him on the steamer coming
from America

The portiere dropped his eyes and turned toward his desk

Luncheon is served signore he remarked Also here is a letter for
you which arrived this morning

Uncle John took the letter and walked on to rejoin the girls

It seems hard work to find out anything about this Valdi he said
Either the folks here do not know him or they wont acknowledge his
acquaintance We may as well follow suit and avoid him

I dont like his looks a bit observed Beth He seems afraid and
defiant at the same time and his temper is dreadful It was only with
great difficulty he could bring himself to be polite to us

Oh I always got along with him all right said Patsy Im sure
Signor Valdi isnt as bad as he appears And hes a duke too girlsa
real duke

So it seems Uncle John rejoined yet there is something queer about
the fellow I agree with Beth I dont like him

Did Mr Watson say when he would join us here enquired Louise when
they were seated at the little round table

No but heres a letter from him Id quite forgotten it

He tore open the envelope and carefully read the enclosure

Too bad said he We might have stayed a few days in Messina Watson
says he and Kenneth have stopped at Girgentiwherever that isto study
the temples Wonder if theyre Solomons They wont get to Taormina
before Saturday

It wont matter declared Patsy so long as they arrive then And Id
a good deal rather be here than in Messina or any other place Of
course well all be glad to see Kenneth

Mr Watson wants us to be very careful while we are in Sicily
continued Uncle John referring to the letter Listen to this Dont
let the girls wear jewelry in public places or display their watches
openly and take care all of you not to show much money If you buy
anything have it sent to your hotel to be paid for by the hall porter
And it is wise not to let anyone know who you are or how long you intend
to remain in any one place This may strike you as an absurd precaution
but you must remember that you are not in America but in an isolated
Italian province where government control is inefficient The truth is
that the terrible Mafia is still all powerful on this island and
brigandage is by no means confined to the neighborhood of
Castrogiovanni as the guide books would have you believe The people
seem simple and harmless enough but Kenneth and I always keep our
revolvers handy and believe it is a reasonable precaution I dont want
to frighten you John merely to warn you Sicily is full of tourists
and few are ever molested but if you are aware of the conditions
underlying the public serenity you are not so liable to run yourself and
your nieces into needless dangers Hows that for a haircurler
girls

It sounds very romantic said Louise smiling Mr Watson is such a
cautious man

But its all rubbish about there being danger in Taormina declared
Patsy indignantly Mr Watson has been in the wilds of the interior
which Baedecker admits is infested with brigands Here everyone smiles
at us in the friendliest way possible

Except the duke added Beth with a laugh

Oh the duke is sour by nature Patsy answered but if there really
was danger Im sure hed protect us for he lives here and knows the
country

You are sure of a lot of things dear said her cousin smiling But
it will do no harm to heed the advice and be careful

They all agreed to that and Uncle John was glad to remember he had two
brand new revolvers in the bottom of his trunk which he could use in an
emergency if he could manage to find the cartridges to load them with

He got them out next morning and warned his nieces not to touch the
dangerous things when they entered his room But Patsy laughed at him
saying

You are behind the times Uncle Beth has carried a revolver ever since
we started

Beth he cried horrified

Just as a precaution said that young lady demurely

But youre only a child

Even so Uncle I have been taught to shoot in Cloverton as a part of
my education Once I won a medalthink of that So I brought my pet
revolver along although I may never have need to use it

Uncle John looked thoughtful

It doesnt seem like a girlish accomplishment exactly he mused
When I was young and went into the West the times were a bit
unsettled and I used to carry a popgun myself But I never shot at a
human being in my life There were women in the camps that could shoot
too but the safest place was always in front of them If Beth has won a
medal though she might hit something

Dont try Beth said Louise you ought to make a hit without
shooting

Thank you dear

As they left their hotel for a walk they came upon Count Ferralti who
was standing in the court calmly smoking a cigarette His right hand was
still in a sling

No one was greatly surprised at his appearance but Uncle John uttered
an exclamation of impatience It annoyed him that this fellow whose
antecedents were decidedly cloudy should be chasing around after one
of his nieces Beth and Patsy smiled at each other significantly as the
young man was discovered but Louise with a slight blush advanced to
greet Ferralti in her usual pleasant and cordial way

There was no use resenting the intrusion They owed a certain
consideration to this boyish Italian for his assistance on the Amalfi
road But Uncle John almost wished he had left them to escape as best
they might for the obligation was getting to be decidedly onerous

While Ferralti was expressing his astonishment at so unexpectedly
meeting again his American friends Uncle John discovered their English
speaking cocchiere Frascatti Vietri lolling half asleep on the box of
his victoria

Would your energy like to drive us this morning he asked

It is my duty signore if you wish to go was the reply

Then you are engaged Come girls hop in if you want to ride

The three nieces and Uncle John just filled the victoria The count was
disconsolate at being so cleverly dropped from the party but could
only flourish his hat and wish them a pleasant drive

They descended the winding road to the coast where Frascatti took the
highway to Sant Alessio a charming drive leading to the Taormina Pass

By the way Uncle John asked the driver do you know of a duke that
lives in this neighborhood

The laughing face of the Sicilian suddenly turned grave

No signore There is the Prince di Scaletta but no duke on this side
the town

But on the other side

Oh in the mountains To be sure there are noblemen there old estates
almost forgotten in our great civilization of today We are very
progressive in Taormina signore There will be a fountain of the ice
cream soda established next summer Quite metropolitan ne ce

Quite But tell me Frascatti have you a duke in the mountains back
of Taormina

Signore I beg you to pay no attention to the foolish stories you may
hear from our peasants There has been no brigandage here for
centuries I assure you the country is perfectionly safeespecial if
you stay within the town or take me on your drives They know me
signore and even Il Duca dares not trifle with my friends

Why should he Frascatti if there is no brigandage Is it the Mafia

Ah I have heard that Mafia spoken of but mostly when I lived in
America which is Chicago Here we do not know of the Mafia

But you advise us to be careful

Everywhere illustrissimo signore it is well to be what you call the
circumspection I remember that in the State street of Chicago which is
America peaceful citizens were often killed by bandits Eh is it not
so

Quite probable said Uncle John soberly

Then what will you Are we worse than Americans that you fear us
Never mind Il Duca or the tales they foolishly whisper of him Here you
may be as safe and happy as in Chicagowhich is America

He turned to his horses and urged them up a slope The girls and Uncle
John eyed one another enquiringly

Our duke seems to bear no good reputation said Beth in a tone so low
that Frascatti could not overhear Everyone fears to speak of him

Singular said Uncle John that Patsys friend turns out to be a
mystery even in his own home I wonder if he is a leader of the Mafia
or just a common brigand

In either case said Patsy he will not care to injure us I am sure
We all treated him very nicely and I just made him talk and be
sociable whether he wanted to or not That ought to count for something
in our favor But my opinion is that hes just a gruff old nobleman who
lives in the hills and makes few friends

And hasnt a name any more than Louises count has Is it customary
my dear for all Italian noblemen to conceal their identity

I do not know Uncle answered Louise casting down her eyes




CHAPTER XIV

UNCLE JOHN DISAPPEARS


Uncle John grew to love Taormina Its wildness and ruggedness somehow
reminded him of the Rockies in the old pioneer days and he wandered
through all the lanes of the quaint old town until he knew every cornice
and cobblestone familiarly and the women who sat weaving or mending
before their squalid but picturesque hovels all nodded a greeting to the
cheery little American as he passed by

He climbed Malo too a high peak crowned by a ruined castle and also
Mt Venere on the plateau of which an ancient city had once stood His
walking tours did him good and frequently while the girls lay stretched
upon the grass that lined the theatre enclosure to idle the time or
read or write enthusiastic letters home Uncle John scorning such
laziness would take his stick and climb mountains or follow the rough
paths that diverged from the highway just beyond the Catania Gate

The tax gatherer whose tiny office was just inside the gate came to know
the little gentleman very well and although he could speak no English
he would bob his grizzled head and murmur Buon giorno signore as
the stranger passed out on his daily stroll

One afternoon Mr Merrick went down the hill path leading from the
CastelloaMare to Capo di San Andrea and as he passed around a narrow
ledge of rock came full upon two men seated upon a flat stone One was
Valdi and the other Ferralti and they seemed engaged in earnest
conversation when he interrupted them The Count smiled frankly and
doffed his hat the Duke frowned grimly but also nodded

Uncle John passed on The path was wild and little frequented He felt
in his side pocket and grasped the handle of his revolver but there was
no attempt to follow or molest him Nevertheless when he returned from
the beach he came up the longer winding roadway and was glad of the
company of a ragged goatherd who having no English entertained Il
Signore by singing ditties as he drove his goats before him

The misgivings Uncle John had originally conceived concerning Count
Ferralti returned in full force with this incident but he resolved to
say nothing of it to his nieces Silas Watson would be with them in a
couple of days more and he would consult the shrewd lawyer before he
took any decisive action

Next morning after breakfast he left his nieces in the garden and said
he would take a walk through the town and along the highway west toward
Kaggi

Ill be back in an hour or so he remarked for I have some letters
to write and I want them to catch the noon mail

So the girls sat on the terrace overlooking the sea and Etna and
breathed the sweet air and enjoyed the caressing sunshine until they
noticed the portiere coming hastily toward them

Pardon signorini he said breathlessly but it will be to oblige me
greatly if you will tell me where Signor Ferralti is

He is not of our party answered Patsy promptly but Louise looked up
as if startled and said I have been expecting him to join us here

Then you do not know exclaimed the portiere in an anxious tone

Know what sir asked the girl

That Signor Ferralti is gone He has not been seen by any after last
evening He did not occupy his room But worse far worse will I break
you the news gentlyhis baggage is gone with him

His baggage gone echoed Louise greatly disturbed And he did not
tell you You did not see him go

Alas no signorina His bill is still unsettled He possessed two
large travelling cases which must have been carried out at the side
entrance with stealth most deplorable The padrone is worried Signor
Ferralti is American and Americans seldom treat us wrongfully

Signor Ferralti is Italian answered Louise stiffly

The name is Italian perhaps but he speaks only the English declared
the portiere

He is not a rogue however Assure your master of that fact When Mr
Merrick returns he will settle Count Ferraltis bill

Oh Louise gasped Patsy

I dont understand it in the least continued Louise looking at her
cousins as if she were really bewildered I left him in the courtyard
last evening to finish his cigar and he said he would meet us in the
garden after breakfast I am sure he had no intention of going away And
for the honor of American travellers his account here must be taken care
of

One thing is singular observed Beth calmly There has been no train
since last you saw him If Count Ferralti has left the hotel where
could he be

The portiere brightened

Gia sintende he exclaimed he must still be in
Taorminadoubtless at some other hotel

Will you send and find out asked Louise

I will go myself and at once he answered And thank you
signorina for the kind assurance regarding the account It will relieve
the padrone very much

He hurried away again and an uneasy silence fell upon the nieces

Do you care for this young man Louise asked Beth pointedly after
the pause had become awkward

He is very attentive and gentlemanly and I feel you have all wronged
him by your unjust suspicions she replied with spirit

That does not answer my question dear persisted her cousin Are you
especially fond of him

What right have you to question me in this way Beth

No right at all dear I am only trying to figure out our doubtful
position in regard to this young mana stranger to all of us but you

It is really none of our business observed Patsy quickly Were
just a lot of gossips to be figuring on Count Ferralti at all And
although this sudden disappearance looks queer on the face of it the
gentleman may simply have changed his boarding place

I do not think so said Louise He liked this hotel very much

And he may have liked some of its guests added Patsy smiling Well
Uncle John will soon be back and then we will talk it over with him

Uncle John was late The portiere returned first He had been to every
hotel in the little town but none of them had received a guest since
the afternoon train of yesterday Count Ferralti had disappeared as if
by magic and no one could account for it

Noon arrived but no Uncle John The girls became dispirited and
anxious for the little man was usually very prompt in keeping his
engagements and always had returned at the set time

They waited until the last moment and then entered the salle a manger
and ate their luncheon in gloomy silence hoping every moment to hear
the sound of their uncles familiar tread

After luncheon they held a hurried consultation and decided to go into
town and search for him So away they trooped asking eager questions
in their uncertain Italian but receiving no satisfactory reply until
they reached the little office of the tax gatherer at the Catania Gate

Ah si signorini mia he answered cheerfully il poco signore
passato da stamattini

But he had not returned

Not yet

They looked at one another blankly

See here said Patsy Uncle John must have lost his way or met with
an accident You go back to the hotel Louise and wait there in case he
returns home another way Beth and I will follow some of these paths and
see if we can find him

He may have sprained an ankle and be unable to walk suggested Beth
I think Patsys advice is good

So Louise returned through the town and the other girls began exploring
the paths that led into the mountains from every turn of the highway
But although they searched eagerly and followed each path a mile or more
of its length no sign of life did they encountermuch less a sight of
their missing uncle The paths were wild and unfrequented only on the
Catania road itself a peasant now and then being found patiently
trudging along or driving before him a donkey laden with panniers of
oranges or lemons for the markets of Taormina

On some of the solitary rocky paths they called to Uncle John by name
hoping that their voices might reach him but only the echoes replied
Finally they grew discouraged

It will be sunset before we get back even if we start this minute
said Beth finally Let us return and get some one to help us

Patsy burst into tears

Oh Im sure hes lost or murdered or kidnapped she wailed Dear
dear Uncle John Whatever shall we do Beth

Why he may be at home waiting for us to get back Dont give way
Patsy it will do no good you know

They were thoroughly tired when just at sunset they reached the hotel
Louise came to meet them and by the question in her eyes they knew
their uncle had not returned

Something must be done and at once said Beth decidedly She was the
younger of the three girls but in this emergency took the lead because
of her calm and unruffled disposition and native good sense Is
Frascatti in the courtyard

Patsy ran to see and soon brought the vetturino into their sitting
room He could speak English and knew the neighborhood thoroughly He
ought to be able to advise them

Frascatti listened intently to their story He was very evidently
impressed

Tell me then signorini he said thoughtfully is Senor Merreek
very rich

Why do you ask returned Beth suspiciously She remembered the
warning conveyed in Mr Watsons letter

Of course I know that all the Americans who travel are rich
continued Frascatti I have myself been in Chicago which is America
But is Signor Merreek a very rich and well acquainted man in his own
country Believe me it is well that you answer truly

I think he is

The man looked cautiously around and then came nearer and dropped his
voice to a whisper

Are you aware that Il Duca knows this he asked

Beth thought a moment

We met the man you call Il Duca but who told us he was Signor Victor
Valdi on board the ship where many of the passengers knew my uncle
well If he listened to their conversation he would soon know all about
John Merrick of course

Frascatti wagged his head solemnly

Then signorina he said still speaking very softly I assure you
there is no need to worry over your uncles safety

What do you mean demanded Beth

People do not lose their way in our mountains he replied The paths
are straight and lead all to the highways And there is little danger
of falling or of being injured ButI regret to say it signoriniit
is a reflection upon our advanced civilization and the good name of our
peoplebut sometimes a man who is rich disappears for a time and no
one knows how it is or where he may be He always returns but then he
is not so rich

I understand My uncle is captured by brigands you think

There are no brigands signorina

Or the Mafia then

I do not know the Mafia All I know is that the very rich should keep
their riches secret when they travel In Chicago which is America they
will knock you upon the head for a few miserable dollars here my
countrymen scorn to attack or to rob the common people But when a man
is so very rich that he does not need all of his money there are I
regret to say some lawless ones in Sicily who insist that he divide
with them But the prisoner is always well treated and when he pays he
is sent away very happy

Suppose he does not pay

Ah signorina will not a drowning man clutch the raft that floats by
And the lawless ones do not take his allmerely a part

The girls looked at one another helplessly

What must we do Frascatti asked Patsy

Wait In a daytwo days perhapsyou will hear from your uncle He
will tell you how to send money to the lawless ones You will follow his
instructions and he will come home with smiles and singing I know It
is very regrettable but it is so

It will not be so in this case said Beth indignantly I will see
the American consul

I am sorry but there is none here

I will telegraph to Messina for the military They will search the
mountains and bring your brigands to justice

Frascatti smiled sadly

Oh yes perhaps they will come But the military is Italiannot
Sicilianand has no experience in these parts The search will find
nothing except perhaps a dead body thrown upon the rocks to defy
justice It is very regrettable signorina but it is so

Patsy was wringing her hands frantic with terror Louise was white and
staring Beth puckered her pretty brow in a frown and tried to think

Ferralti is also gone murmured Louise in a hoarse voice They will
rob or murder him with Uncle John

I am quite convinced said Beth coldly that your false count is a
fellow conspirator of the brigand called Il Duca He has been following
us around to get a chance to ensnare Uncle John

Oh no no Beth It is not so I know better than that

He would lie to you of course returned the girl bitterly As soon
as the trap was set he disappeared bag and baggage and left the simple
girl he had fooled to her own devices

You do not know what you are saying retorted Louise turning her back
to Beth and walking to a window From where they stood they could hear
her sobbing miserably

Whether Frascatti is right or not said Patsy drying her eyes and
trying to be brave we ought to search for Uncle John at once

I think so too agreed Beth Then turning to the Sicilian she said
Will you get together as many men as possible and search the hills
with lanterns for my uncle You shall be well paid for all you do

Most certainly signorina if it will please you he replied How
long do you wish us to search

Until you find him

Then must we grow old in your service Non fa niente It is
regrettable but

Will you go at once stamping her foot angrily

Most certainly signorina

Then lose no time I will go with you and see you start

She followed the man out and kept at his side until he had secured
several servants with lanterns for the search The promise of high
caparra or earnest money made all eager to join the band but the
padrone could only allow a half dozen to leave their stations at the
hotel In the town however whither Beth accompanied them a score of
sleepy looking fellows were speedily secured and under the command of
Frascatti who had resolved to earn his money by energy and good will
because there was no chance of success they marched out of the Catania
Gate and scattered along the mountain paths

If you find Uncle John before morning I will give you a thousand lira
additional promised Beth

We will search faithfully replied her captain but the signorina
must not be disappointed if the lawless ones evade us They have a way
of hiding close in the caves where none may find them It is
regrettable very but it is so

Then he followed his men to the mountains and as the last glimmer from
his lantern died away the girl sighed heavily and returned alone through
the deserted streets to the hotel

Clouds hid the moon and the night was black and forbidding but it did
not occur to her to be afraid




CHAPTER XV

DAYS OF ANXIETY


Uncle Johns nieces passed a miserable night Patsy stole into his room
and prayed fervently beside his bed that her dear uncle might be
preserved and restored to them in health and safety Beth meantime
paced the room she shared with Patsy with knitted brows and flashing
eyes the flush in her cheeks growing deeper as her anger increased An
ungovernable temper was the girls worst failing the abductors of her
uncle were arousing in her the most violent passions of which she was
capable and might lead her to adopt desperate measures She was only a
country girl and little experienced in life yet Beth might be expected
to undertake extraordinary things if as she expressed it if she got
good and mad

No sound was heard during the night from the room occupied by Louise
but the morning disclosed a white drawn face and reddened eyelids as
proof that she had rested as little as her cousins

Yet singularly enough Louise was the most composed of the three when
they gathered in the little sitting room at daybreak and tried
earnestly to cheer the spirits of her cousins Louise never conveyed the
impression of being especially sincere but the pleasant words and
manners she habitually assumed rendered her an agreeable companion and
this faculty of masking her real feelings now stood her in good stead
and served to relieve the weight of anxiety that oppressed them all

Frascatti came limping back with his tired followers in the early dawn
and reported that no trace of the missing man had been observed There
were no brigands and no Mafia on that point all his fellow townsmen
agreed with him fully But it was barely possible some lawless ones who
were all unknown to the honest Taorminians had made the rich American a
prisoner

Il Duca Oh no signorini A thousand times no Il Duca was queer and
unsociable but not lawless He was of noble family and a native of the
district It would be very wrong and foolish to question Il Ducas
integrity

With this assertion Frascatti went to bed He had not shirked the
search because he was paid for it and he and his men had tramped the
mountains faithfully all night well knowing it would result in nothing
but earning their money

On the morning train from Catania arrived Silas Watson and his young
ward Kenneth Forbes the boy who had so unexpectedly inherited Aunt
Janes fine estate of Elmhurst on her death The discovery of a will
which gave to Kenneth all the property their aunt had intended for her
nieces had not caused the slightest estrangement between the young
folks then or afterward On the contrary the girls were all glad that
the gloomy neglected boy with his artistic highstrung temperament
would be so well provided for Without the inheritance he would have
been an outcast now he was able to travel with his guardian the kindly
old Elmhurst lawyer and fit himself for his future important position
in the world More than all this however Kenneth had resolved to be a
great landscape painter and Italy and Sicily had done much in the past
year to prepare him for this career

The boy greeted his old friends with eager delight not noticing for the
moment their anxious faces and perturbed demeanor But the lawyers
sharp eyes saw at once that something was wrong

Where is John Merrick he asked

Oh Im so glad youve come cried Patsy clinging to his hand

We are in sore straits indeed Mr Watson said Louise

Uncle John is lost explained Beth and were afraid he is in the
hands of brigands

Then she related as calmly as she could all that had happened The
relation was clear and concise She told of their meeting with Valdi on
the ship of Count Ferraltis persistence in attaching himself to their
party and of Uncle Johns discovery that the young man was posing under
an assumed name She did not fail to mention Ferraltis timely
assistance on the Amalfi drive or his subsequent devoted attentions to
Louise but the latter Beth considered merely as an excuse for following
them around

In my opinion said she we have been watched ever since we left
America by these two spies who had resolved to get Uncle John into
some unfrequented place and then rob him If they succeed in their vile
plot Mr Watson we shall be humiliated and disgraced forever

Tuttut said he dont think of that Let us consider John Merrick
and nothing else

Louise protested that Beth had not been fair in her conclusions The
Count was an honorable man she would vouch for his character herself

But Mr Watson did not heed this defense The matter was very
serioushow serious he alone realizedand his face was grave indeed as
he listened to the descriptions of that terrible Il Duca whom the
natives all shrank from and refused to discuss

When he had learned all the nieces had to tell he hastened into the town
and telegraphed the American consul at Messina Then he found the
questura or police office and was assured by the officer in attendance
that the disappearance of Mr Merrick was already known to the
authorities and every effort was being made to find him

Do you think he has been abducted by brigands asked the lawyer

Brigands signore was the astonished reply There are no brigands in
this district at all We drove them out many years ago

How about Il Duca

And who is that signore

Dont you know

I assure you we have no official knowledge of such a person There are
dukes in Sicily to be sure but Il Duca means nothing Perhaps you
can tell me to whom you refer

See here said the lawyer brusquely I know your methods questore
mia but they wont prove effective in this case If you think an
American is helpless in this country you are very much mistaken But to
save time I am willing to submit to your official requirements I will
pay you well for the rescue of my friend

All shall be done that is possible

But if you do not find him at once and return him to us unharmed I
will have a regiment of soldiers in Taormina to search your mountains
and break up the bands of brigands that infest them When I prove that
brigands are here and that you were not aware of them you will be
disgraced and deposed from your office

The official shrugged his shoulders a gesture in which the Sicilian is
as expert as the Frenchman

I will welcome the soldiery said he but you will be able to prove
nothing The offer of a reward may accomplish moreif it is great
enough to be interesting

How great is that

Can I value your friend You must name the reward yourself But even
then I can promise nothing In the course of our duty every effort is
now being made to find the missing American But we work in the dark as
you know Your friend may be a suicide he may have lost his mind and
wandered into the wilderness he may have committed some crime and
absconded How do I know You say he is missing but that is no reason
the brigands have him even did brigands exist which I doubt Rest
assured signore that rigid search will be made It is my boast that I
leave no duty unfulfilled

Mr Watson walked back to the telegraph office and found an answer to
his message The American consul was ill and had gone to Naples for
treatment When he returned his clerk stated the matter of the
disappearance of John Merrick would immediately be investigated

Feeling extremely helpless and more fearful for his friend than before
the lawyer returned to the hotel for a conference with the nieces

How much of a reward shall I offer he asked That seems to be the
only thing that can be depended upon to secure results

Give them a millionUncle John wont mind cried Patsy earnestly

Dont give them a penny sir said Beth If they are holding him for
a ransom Uncle is in no personal danger and we have no right to assist
in robbing him

But you dont understand my dear asserted the lawyer These
brigands never let a victim go free unless they are well paid That is
why they are so often successful If John Merrick is not ransomed he
will never again be heard of

But this is not a ransom sir You propose to offer a reward to the
police

Let me explain The ways of the Italian police are very intricate They
know of no brigandage here and cannot find a brigand But if the reward
is great enough to divide they know where to offer a share of it in
lieu of a ransom and will force the brigands to accept it In that way
the police gets the glory of a rescue and a share of the spoils If we
offer no reward or an insignificant one the brigands will be allowed
to act as they please

That is outrageous exclaimed Beth

Yes The Italian government deplores it It is trying hard to break up
a system that has existed for centuries but has not yet succeeded

Then Id prefer to deal directly with the brigands

So would I if

If what sir

If we were sure your uncle is in their hands Do you think the party
you sent out last night searched thoroughly

I hope so

I will send out more men at once They shall search the hills in every
direction Should they find nothing our worst fears will be confirmed
and then

Well Mr Watson

Then we must wait for the brigands to dictate the terms of a ransom
and make the best bargain we can

That seems sensible said Kenneth and both Patsy and Louise agreed
with him although it would be tedious waiting

But Beth only bit her lip and frowned

Mr Watsons searching party was maintained all dayfor two days and
three but without result Then they waited for the brigands to act
But a week dragged painfully by and no word of John Merricks
whereabouts reached the ears of the weary watchers




CHAPTER XVI

TATO


When Uncle John passed through the west gate for a tramp along the
mountain paths he was feeling in an especially happy and contented mood
The day was bright and balmy the air bracing the scenery unfolded step
by step magnificent and appealing To be in this little corner of the
old world amid ruins antedating the Christian era and able to wholly
forget those awful stock and market reports of Wall street was a
privilege the old gentleman greatly appreciated

So away he trudged exploring this path or that leading amongst the
rugged cliffs until finally he began to take note of his erratic
wanderings and wonder where he was Climbing an elevated rock near the
path he poised himself upon its peak and studied the landscape spread
out beneath him

There was a patch of sea with the dim Calabrian coast standing sentry
behind it The nearer coast was hidden from view but away at the left
was a dull white streak marking the old wall of Taormina and above this
the ruined citadel and the ancient castle of Molaeach on its separate
peak

I must be getting back he thought and sliding down the surface of
the rock he presently returned to the path from whence he had climbed

To his surprise he found a boy standing there and looking at him with
soft brown eyes that were both beautiful and intelligent Uncle John was
as short as he was stout but the boy scarcely reached to his shoulder
He was slender and agile and clothed in a grey corduroy suit that was
better in texture than the American had seen other Sicilian youths wear
As a rule the apparel of the children in this country seemed sadly
neglected

Yet the most attractive thing about this child was his face which was
delicate of contour richly tinted to harmonize with his magnificent
brown eyes and so sensitive and expressive that it seemed able to
convey the most subtle shades of emotion He seemed ten or twelve years
of age but might have been much older

As soon as the American had returned to the path the boy came toward him
in an eager excited way and exclaimed

Is it not Signor Merrick

The English was fluent and only rendered softer by the foreign
intonation

It is said Uncle John cheerfully Where did you drop from my lad
I thought these hills were deserted until now

I am sent by a friend answered the boy speaking rapidly and
regarding the man with appealing glances He is in much trouble
signore and asks your aid

A friend Who is it

The name he gave me is Ferralti signore He is near to this place in
the hills yonder and unable to return to the town without assistance

Ferralti Hmm Is he hurt

Badly signore from a fall on the rocks

And he sent for me

Yes signore I know you by sightwho does notand as I hurried
along I saw you standing on the rock It is most fortunate Will you
hasten to your friend then I will lead you to him

Uncle John hesitated He ought to be getting home instead of
penetrating still farther into these rocky fastnesses And Ferralti was
no especial friend to claim his assistance But then the thought
occurred that this young Italian had befriended both him and his nieces
in an extremity and was therefore entitled to consideration when
trouble in turn overtook himself The natural impulse of this thought
was to go to his assistance

All right my lad said he Lead on and Ill see what can be done
for Ferralti Is it far

Not far signore

With nervous impatient steps the child started up the narrow path and
Uncle John followednot slowly but scarcely fast enough to satisfy his
zealous guide

What is your name little one

Tato signore

Where do you live

Near by signore

And how did you happen to find Ferralti

By chance signore

Uncle John saved his remaining breath for the climb He could ask
questions afterward

The path was in a crevasse where the rocks seemed once to have split It
was narrow and steep and before long ended in a cul de sac The
little man thought they had reached their destination then but without
hesitation the boy climbed over a boulder and dropped into another path
on the opposite side holding out a hand to assist the American

Uncle John laughed at the necessity but promptly slid his stout body
over the boulder and then paused to mop his brow

Much farther Tato

Just a step signore

It is lucky you found Ferralti or he might have died in these wilds
without a soul knowing he was here

That is true signore

Well is this the path

Yes signore Follow me please

The cliffs were precipitous on both sides of them It was another
crevasse but not a long one Presently the child came to a halt because
the way ended and they could proceed no farther He leaned against the
rock and in a highpitched sweet voice sang part of a Sicilian ditty
neither starting the verse nor ending it but merely trilling out a
fragment

Uncle John regarded him wonderingly and then with a sudden suspicion
he demanded

You are not playing me false Tato

I signore smiling frankly into the mans eyes you need never fear
Tato signore To be your friend and Signor Ferraltis friend makes me
very proud

The rock he leaned against fell inward noiselessly and disclosed a
passage It was short for there was light at the other end

The strange child darted in at once

This way signore He is here

Uncle John drew back He had forgotten until now that these mountains
are dangerous And something strange in the present proceedings the
loneliness of the place and the elfish character of his guide suddenly
warned him to be cautious

See here my lad he called Ill go no farther

Instantly Tato was at his side again grasping the mans hand in his
tiny brown one and searching his face with pleading eyes

Ah signore you will not fail your friend when he is so near you and
in such great trouble See I who am a stranger and not even his
countryman even I weep for the poor young man and long to comfort him
Do you his friend refuse him aid because you have fear of the wild
mountains and a poor peasant boy

Tears really stood in the beautiful brown eyes They rolled down his
cheeks as with both hands he pressed that of Uncle John and urged him
gently forward

Oh well lead on Tato Ill see the other side of your tunnel
anyhow But if you play me tricks my lad

He paused for a wonderful vision had opened before him Coming through
the short passage hewn in the rocks the American stood upon a ledge
facing a most beautiful valley that was hemmed in by precipitous cliffs
on every side From these stern barriers of the outside world the ground
sloped gradually toward the center where a pretty brook flowed its
waters sparkling like diamonds in the sunlight as it tumbled over its
rocky bed Groves of oranges and of olive lemon and almond trees
occupied much of the vale and on a higher point at the right its back
to the wall of rock that towered behind it stood a substantial yet
picturesque mansion of stone with several outbuildings scattered on
either side

The valley seemed indeed a toy kingdom sequestered from the great
outside world yet so rich and productive within itself that it was
independent of all else

Uncle John gazed with amazement Who could have guessed this delightful
spot was hidden safe within the heart of the bleak bare mountain
surrounding it But suddenly he bethought himself

What place is this Tato he asked and where is our friend
Ferralti who needs me

There was no reply

He turned around to find the boy had disappeared Moreover the passage
had disappeared Only a wall of rock was behind him and although his
eyes anxiously searched the rifts and cracks of its rough surface no
indication of the opening through which he had passed could be
discovered




CHAPTER XVII

THE HIDDEN VALLEY


Uncle Johns first inspiration was to sit down upon a stone to think He
drew out his pipe and lighted it to assist his meditations

These were none too pleasant That he had been cleverly entrapped and
that by a child scarcely in its teens was too evident to need
reflection And what a secure trap it was The mountains ranged all
around the valley were impossible to scale even by an Alpine climber
and to one who was not informed of its location the existence of the
valley itself was unimaginable

I had not believed Ferralti was so shrewd he muttered wonderingly
That something was wrong about the fellow I knew of course but I had
not suspected such a thing as this Now then first of all let me mark
this spot so that I will remember it Just back of where I now stand is
the entrance or outlet to the tunnel through the wall It is closed I
suppose by a swinging stone like the one on the opposite side I saw
that one openedopened by some person concealed from view as soon as
the boy sang his bit of song which was the signal agreed upon And I was
fool enough after that warning to walk straight through the tunnel
Youre getting old John Merrick thats the only way I can account for
your folly But Ferralti hasnt won the odd trick yet and if I keep my
wits about me he isnt likely to win

Thus ruminating Uncle John searched the rocky wall carefully and
believed he would know the place again although which of the rough
stones of its surface formed the doorway to the tunnel he could not
guess

A ledge of rock served as a path leading to right and left around this
end of the valley or pocket in the mountain as it could more
properly be called Uncle John turned to the right striding along with
his usual deliberation smoking his pipe and swinging his cane as he
approached the stone dwelling that formed the center of the little
settlement As yet no sign of human life had he observed since Tato had
disappeared although a few cows were standing in a green meadow and
some goats scrambled among the loose rocks at the further end of the
enclosure

Around the house the grounds had been laid out in gardens with flowers
and shrubbery hedges and shade trees scattered about Chickens clucked
and strutted along the paths and an air of restfulness and peace brooded
over all

Uncle John was plainly mystified until he drew quite close to the
dwelling which had many verandas and balconies and bore every evidence
of habitation Then to his astonishment he beheld the form of a man
stretched lazily in a wicker chair beside the entrance and while he
paused hesitating the man sat up and bowed politely to him

Good morning Signor Merreek

It was Victor Valdi or ignoring the fictitious name the mysterious
personage known as Il Duca

Behold my delight Signor Merreek to receive you in my poor home
continued the man Will you not be seated caro amico

The words were soft and fair but the dark eyes gleamed with triumph and
a sneer curled the thin lips

Thank you said Uncle John I believe I will

He stepped upon the veranda and sat down opposite his host

I came to see Count Ferralti who is hurt I understand he continued

It is true signore but not badly The poor count is injured mostly in
his mind Presently you shall see him

No hurry observed Uncle John Pleasant place you have here Duke

It is very good of you to praise it signore It is my most ancient
patrimony and quite retired and exclusive

So I see

The house you have honored by your presence signore was erected some
three hundred and thirty years ago by an ancestor who loved
retirement It has been in my family ever since We all love
retirement

Very desirable spot for a brigand Im sure remarked the American
puffing his pipe composedly

Brigand Ah it pleases you to have humor signore mia Brigand But I
will be frank It is no dishonor to admit that my great ancestors of
past centuries were truly brigands and from this quiet haven sallied
forth to do mighty deeds They were quite famous I am told those olden
Dukes dAlcanta

I do not question it

Our legends tell of how my great ancestors demanded tribute of the rich
who passed through their domainfor all this end of Sicily was given to
us by Peter of Aragon and remained in our possession until the second
Ferdinand robbed us of it Those times were somewhat wild and barbarous
signore and a gentleman who protected his estates and asked tribute of
strangers was termed a brigand and became highly respected But now it
is different We are civilized and meek and ruled most lovingly by
Italy They will tell you there is no brigandage in all Sicily

So I understand

Today I am nobody My very name is forgotten Those around this
mountain know nothing of my little estate and I am content I desire
not glory I desire not prominence to live my life in seclusion with
the occasional visit of a friend like yourself is enough to satisfy
me

You seem well known in Taormina

Quite a mistake signore

And the natives must have climbed these peaks at times and looked down
into your secluded kingdom

If so they have forgotten it

I see

I give to the churches and the poor but in secret If I have an enemy
he disappearsI do not know how no one knows

Of course not You are an improvement on your ancestors Duke Instead
of being a brigand you belong to the Mafia and perform your robberies
and murders in security Very clever indeed

But again you are wrong signore replied the Duke with a frown I
have never known of this Mafia of which you speak nor do I believe it
exists For myself I am no robber but a peaceful merchant

A merchant returned Uncle John surprised by the statement

To be sure I have some ancient and very valuable relics in my
possession treasured most carefully from the medival days These I
sell to my friendswho are fortunately all foreigners like yourself and
can appreciate such treasuresand so obtain for myself and my family a
modest livelihood

And you expect to sell something to me asked Uncle John
understanding very well the Sicilians meaning

It is my earnest hope signore

The American fell silent thinking upon the situation The fierce
looking brigand beside him was absurd enough in his way but doubtless
a dangerous man to deal with Uncle John was greatly interested in the
adventure It was such a sharp contrast to the humdrum unromantic
American life he had latterly known that he derived a certain enjoyment
from the novel experience If the girls did not worry over his absence
he would not much regret his visit to Il Ducas secluded valley

It was already midday and his nieces would be expecting him to
luncheon When he did not appear they would make enquiries and try to
find him It occurred to him how futile all such attempts must prove
Even to one acquainted with the mountain paths the entrance to the
dukes domain was doubtless a secret and the brigand had plainly hinted
that the native Sicilians were too cautious to spy upon him or molest
him in any way

So far the only person he had seen was Il Duca himself The child who
had decoyed him was of course somewhere about and so also was
Ferralti How many servants or followers the brigand might have was as
yet a mystery to the new arrival

In the side pocket of Uncle Johns loose coat lay a loaded revolver
which he had carried ever since he had received Mr Watsons warning
letter He had never imagined a condition of danger where he could not
use this weapon to defend himself and as long as it remained by him he
had feared nothing But he had been made a prisoner in so deft a manner
that he had no opportunity to expostulate or offer any sort of
resistance Later there might be a chance to fight for his liberty and
the only sensible action was to wait and bide his time

For example the Duke was saying in his labored broken English I
have here a priceless treasurevery antique very beautiful It was in
one time owned by Robert the Norman who presented it to my greatest
ancestor

He drew an oddshaped ring from his pocket and handed it to the
American It was of dull gold and set with a half dozen flatcut
garnets Perhaps antique perhaps not but of little intrinsic value

This ring I have decided to sell and it shall be yours Signor
Merreek at a price far less than is represented by its historic worth
I am sure you will be glad to buy it

For how much asked Uncle John curiously

A trifle a mere hundred thousand lira

Twenty thousand dollars

The ring of King Roger How cheap But nevertheless you shall have it
for that sum

Uncle John smiled

My dear Duke he replied you have made a sad mistake I am a
comparatively poor man My fortune is very modest

The brigand lay back in his chair and lighted a fresh cigarette

I fear you undervalue yourself my dear guest he said Recently have
I returned from America where I was told much of the wealth of Signor
John Merreek who is many times a millionaire See drawing a paper
from his pocket here is a list of the stocks and securities you own
Also of government and railway bonds of real estate and of manufactures
controlled by your money I will read and you will correct me if an
error occurs

Uncle John listened and was amazed The schedule was complete and its
total was many millions It was a better list of holdings than Uncle
John possessed himself

You foreigners make queer mistakes Duke said he taking another
tack This property belongs to another John Merrick It is a common
name and that is doubtless why you mistook me for the rich John
Merrick

I have noticed returned the Duke coldly that this strange delusion
of mind is apt to overtake my guests But do not be alarmed it will
pass away presently and then you will realize that you are yourself
Remember that I crossed the Atlantic on your steamship signore Many
people there on board spoke of you and pointed you out to me as the
great man of finance Your own niece that is called Patsy she also told
me much about you and of your kindness to her and the other young
signorini Before I left New York a banker of much dignity informed me
you would sail on the ship Princess Irene If a mistake has been made
signore it is yours and not mine Is your memory clearer now

Uncle John laughed frankly The rascal was too clever for him to dispute
with

Whoever I am said he I will not buy your ring

I am pained replied the brigand lightly But there is ample time
for you to reflect upon the matter Do not decide hastily I implore
you I may have been too liberal in making my offer and time may assist
me in fixing a just price for the relic But we have had enough of
business just now It is time for our midday collation Oblige me by
joining us signore

He blew a shrill whistle and a man stepped out of a doorway He was an
enormous Sicilian tall sinewy and with a countenance as dark and
fierce as his masters In his belt was a long knife such as is known
as a stilleto

Tommaso said the Duke kindly show Signor Merreek to his room and
ask Guido if luncheon is ready to be served

Va bene padrone growled the man and turned obediently to escort
the American

Uncle John entered the house traversed a broad and cool passage
mounted to the second floor and found himself in a pleasant room with a
balcony overlooking the valley It was comfortably furnished and with
a bow that was not without a certain grim respect the man left him alone
and tramped down the stairs again There had been no attempt to restrain
his liberty or molest him in any way yet he was not slow to recognize
the fact that he was a prisoner Not in the house perhaps but in the
valley There was no need to confine him more closely He could not
escape

He bathed his hands and face dried them on a fresh towel and found his
toilet table well supplied with conveniences In the next room some one
was pacing the floor like a caged beast growling and muttering angrily
at every step

Uncle John listened The brigand seems to have more than one guest he
thought and smiled at the others foolish outbursts

Then he caught a word or two of English that made him start He went to
the door between the two rooms and threw it open finding himself face
to face with Count Ferralti




CHAPTER XVIII

GUESTS OF THE BRIGAND


Good morning Count said Uncle John cheerfully

The other stared at him astonished

Good heavens Have they got you too he exclaimed

Why Im visiting his excellency Il Duca if thats what you mean
replied Mr Merrick But whether hes got me or Ive got him I
havent yet decided

The young mans jaw was tied in a bandage and one of his eyes was black
and discolored He looked agitated and miserable

Sir you are in grave danger we are both in grave danger he
announced unless we choose to submit to being robbed by this rascally
brigand

Then observed Uncle John lets submit

Never Not in a thousand years cried Ferralti wildly And then this
singular young man sank into a chair and burst into tears

Uncle John was puzzled The slender youthfor he was but a youth in
spite of his thin moustachesexhibited a queer combination of courage
and weakness but somehow Uncle John liked him better at that moment
than he ever had before Perhaps because he now realized he had unjustly
suspected him

You seem to have been hurt Count he remarked

Why I was foolish enough to struggle and that brute Tommaso pounded
me was the reply You were wise to offer no resistance sir

As for that I hadnt a choice said Uncle John smiling When did
they get you Ferralti

Last evening I walked in the garden of the hotel and they threw a sack
over my head I resisted and tried to cry out They beat me until I was
insensible and then brought me here together with my travelling cases
which they removed from my room to convey the impression that I had gone
away voluntarily When I awakened from my swoon I was in this room
with the doctor bending over me

The doctor

Oh they have a doctor in this accursed den as well as a priest and a
lawyer The Duke entreated my pardon He will punish his men for abusing
me But he holds me a safe prisoner just the same

Why

He wants a ransom He will force me to purchase an ancient brass
candlestick for fifty thousand lira

Uncle John looked at his companion thoughtfully

Tell me Count Ferralti he said who you really are I had believed
you were Il Ducas accomplice until now But if he has trapped you and
demands a ransom it is because you are a person of some consequence
and able to pay May I not know as much about your position in life as
does this brigand duke

The young man hesitated Then he spread out his hands with an appealing
gesture and said

Not yet Mr Merrick Do not press me now I implore you Perhaps I
have done wrong to try to deceive you but in good time I will explain
everything and then you will understand me better

You are no count

That is true Mr Merrick

You are not even an Italian

That is but partly true sir

You have seen fit to deceive us by

Tommaso threw wide the door

Il dejun  servito he said gruffly

What does that mean asked Uncle John

Luncheon is ready Shall we go down

Yes Im hungry

They followed the man to the lower floor where he ushered them into a
low cool room where a long table was set The walls were whitewashed
and bore some religious prints gaudily colored A white cloth covered
the table which was well furnished with modern crockery and glass and
antique silverware

At the head of the table were two thronelike chairs one slightly
larger and more elevated than the other In the more important seat was
a withered old woman with a face like that of a mummy except that it
was supplied with two small but piercing jet eyes that seemed very much
alive as they turned shrewdly upon the strangers She was the only one
of the company they found seated The Duke stood behind the smaller
chair beside her and motioned the Americans to occupy two places at the
side of the table next him Opposite them in the places adjoining the
elevated dais were two remarkable individuals whom Uncle John saw for
the first time One was a Cappuccin monk with shaven crown and coarse
cassock fastened at the waist by a cord He was blind in one eye and the
lid of the other drooped so as to expose only a thin slit Fat awkward
and unkempt he stood holding to the back of his chair and swaying
slightly from side to side Next to him was a dandified appearing man
who was very slight and thin of form but affected the dress and manners
of extreme youth Ferralti whispered to Uncle John that this was the
doctor

The table dropped a step in heighth from these places and the balance
of its length was occupied by several stalwart Sicilians clothed in
ordinary peasant costume and a few silent heavyfeatured women Tato
was not present

Signori said the Duke to the Americans allow me to present you to
my mother the head of our illustrious family one who is known admired
and feared throughout Sicily as her Excellenza la Duchessa dAlcanta

With the words the Duke bowed low to the old woman Uncle John and
Ferralti also bowed low The lines of servitors humbly bent themselves
double But the Duchessa made no acknowledgment Her bead like eyes
searched the faces of the guests with disconcerting boldness and then
dropped to her plate

At this signal the fat priest mumbled a blessing upon the food the Duke
waved his hand and all the company became seated

Uncle John felt as if he were taking part in a comic opera and enjoyed
the scene immensely But now his attention was distracted by the
stewards bringing in steaming platters of macaroni and stewed mutton
from which they first served the Duchessa and then the Duke and
afterward the guests The servants waited hungryeyed until these
formalities were completed and then swept the platters clean and ate
ravenously

Uncle John plied his knife and fork busily and found the food
excellently prepared Ferralti seemed to have little appetite Some of
his teeth had been knocked out and his broken wrist which had but
partially healed had been wrenched in the scrimmage of the night before
so that it caused him considerable pain

The Duke attempted little conversation doubtless through deference to
the aged Duchessa who remained absolutely silent and unresponsive to
her surroundings He praised his wine however which he said was from
their own vineyards and pressed the Americans to drink freely

When she had finished her meal the Duchessa raised a hand and at the
signal the whole company arose and stood at their places while two of
the women assisted her to retire She leaned upon their shoulders being
taller than her son but displayed surprising vigor for one so advanced
in years

When she had gone the others finished at their leisure and the
conversation became general the servants babbling in their voluble
Italian without any restraint whatever

Then the Duke led his prisoners to the veranda and offered them cigars
These were brought by Tato who then sat in the dukes lap and curled up
affectionately in his embrace while the brigands expression softened
and he stroked the boys head with a tender motion

Uncle John watched the little scene approvingly It was the first time
he had seen Tato since the child had lured him through the tunnel

Your son Duke he asked

Yes signore my only child The heir to my modest estate

And a very good brigand already for his years added Mr Merrick
Ah Tato Tato shaking his head at the child how could you be so
cruel as to fool an innocent old chap like me

Tato laughed

I did not deceive you signore You but misunderstood me I said
Signor Ferralti was hurt and so he was

But you said he needed my assistance

Does he not signore

How do you speak such good English

Father Antoine taught me

The monk

Yes signore

My child is a linguist remarked the Duke complacently Shhe has
been taught English German and French even from the days of infancy
It is very good for me for now Tato can entertain my guests

Have you no Italian guests then asked Uncle John

No since Italy owns Sicily and I am a loyal subject Neither have I
many Germans or Frenchmen although a few wander my way now and then
But the Americans I love and often they visit me There were three last
year and now here are two more to honor me with their presence

The Americans make easier victims I suppose

Oh the Americans are very rich and they purchase my wares liberally
By the way Signor Ferralti turning to the young man have you
decided yet the little matter of your own purchase

I will not buy your candlestick if that is what you refer to was the
response

No

By no means Fifty thousand lira for a miserable bit of brass

But I forgot to tell you signore the candlestick is no longer for
sale observed the Duke with an evil smile Instead I offer you a
magnificent bracelet which is a hundred years old

Thank you Whats the price

A hundred thousand lira signore

Ferralti started Then in turn he smiled at his captor

That is absurd said he I have no wealth at all sir but live on a
small allowance that barely supplies my needs I cannot pay

I will take that risk signore said the brigand coolly You have
but to draw me an order on Mr Edward Leighton of New York for one
hundred thousand liraor say twenty thousand dollarsand the bracelet
is yours

Edward Leighton My fathers attorney How did you know of him sir

I have an agent in New York answered the Duke and lately I have
been in your city myself

Then if you know so much you scoundrelly thief you know that my
father will not honor a draft for such a sum as you demand I doubt if
my father would pay a single dollar to save me from assassination

We will not discuss that signore for I regret to say that your father
is no longer able to honor drafts However your attorney can do so and
will without question

Ferralti stared at him blankly

What do you mean by that he demanded

The Duke shook the ashes from his cigar and examined the glowing end
with interest

Your father was the deliberate reply was killed in a railway
accident four days ago I have just been notified of the fact by a
cable from America

Ferralti sat trembling and regarding the man with silent horror

Is this true sir asked Uncle John quickly or is it only a part of
your cursed game

It is quite true signore I regret being obliged to break the ill news
so abruptly but this gentleman thought himself too poor to purchase my
little bracelet and it was necessary to inform him that he is suddenly
made wealthynot yet so great a Croesus as yourself Signor Merreek
but still a very rich man

Ferralti ceased trembling but the horror still clung to his eyes

A railway wreck he muttered hoarsely Where was it sir Tell me I
beseech you And are you sure my father is dead

Very sure signore My informant is absolutely reliable But the
details of the wreck I do not know I am only informed of the fact of
your fathers death and that his will leaves you his entire fortune

Ferralti arose and staggered away to his room and Uncle John watched
him go pityingly but knew no way to comfort him When he had gone he
asked gently

His father was an American Duke

Yes signore

And wealthy you say

Exceedingly wealthy signore

What was his name

Ah about that ring my dear guest Do you think a hundred and fifty
thousand lira too much for it

You said a hundred thousand

That was this morning signore The ring has increased in value since
Tomorrow without doubt it will be worth two hundred thousand

Tato laughed at the rueful expression on the victims face and a
moment after Uncle John joined in his laughter

Very good duke he said I dont wish to rob you Let us wait until
tomorrow

The brigand seemed puzzled

May I ask why Signor Merreeksince you are warned he enquired

Why its this way Duke Im just a simple commonplace American
and have lived a rather stupid existence for some time We have no
brigands at home nor any hidden valleys or protected criminals like
yourself The romance of my surroundings interests me your methods are
unique and worth studying if I am so rich as you think me a few extra
hundred thousand lira will be a cheap price to pay for this experience
Is it not so

The Duke frowned

Do you play with me he asked menacingly

By no means Im just the spectator I expect you to make the
entertainment Im sure it will be a good show although the price is
rather high

Il Duca glared but made no reply at the moment Instead he sat
stroking Tatos hair and glowering evilly at the American

The child whispered something in Italian and the man nodded

Very well signore he said more quietly Tomorrow then if it so
pleases you

Then taking Tatos hand he slowly arose and left the veranda

For a moment the American looked after them with a puzzled expression
Then he said to himself with a smile Ah I have solved one mystery
at any rate Tato is a girl




CHAPTER XIX

A DIFFICULT POSITION


And now Uncle John finding himself left alone took his walkingstick
and started out to explore the valley

He felt very sorry for young Ferralti but believed his sympathy could
in no way lighten the blow caused by the abrupt news of his parents
death He would wish to be alone with his grief for a time By and by
Mr Merrick intended to question his fellow prisoner and try to find out
something of his history

The dale was very beautiful as it lay basking in the afternoon sun Near
the house was a large vegetable garden which being now shaded by the
overhanging cliffs was being tended by a sourvisaged Sicilian Uncle
John watched him for a time but the fellow paid no heed to him Every
servant connected with the dukes establishment seemed surly and morose
and this was the more remarkable because the country folk and villagers
Uncle John had met were usually merry and lighthearted

Down by the brook were green meadows and groves of fruit trees The
little gentleman followed the stream for some distance and finally came
upon a man seated on the bank above a broad pool intently engaged in
fishing It proved to be the dandified old doctor who wore gloves to
protect his hands and a broadrimmed straw hat to shade his face

Uncle John stood beside the motionless figure for a moment watching the
line Then forgetting he was in a foreign country he asked carelessly

Any luck

Not yet was the quiet reply in clear English It is too early to
interest the fishes An hour later they will bite

Then why did you come so soon

To escape that hellhole yonder nodding his head toward the house

Uncle John was surprised

But you are not a prisoner doctor he ventured to say

Except through the necessity of earning a livelihood Il Duca pays
wellor rather the Duchessa does for she is the head of this
household I am skillful and worth my price and they know it

You say the Duchessa is the head of the house

Assuredly signore Il Duca is her slave She plans and directs
everything and her son but obeys her will

Did she send him to America

I think so But do not misunderstand me The Duke is clever on his own
account and almost as wicked as his old mother And between them they
are training the child to be as bad as they are It is dreadful

Have you been here long

For seven years signore

But you can resign whenever you please

Why not But the doubt makes me uneasy sometimes In another year I
would like to go to Venice and retire from professional life I am a
Venetian you observe no dastardly brigand of a Sicilian And in
another year I shall have sufficient means to retire and end my days in
peace Here I save every centessimo I make for I can spend nothing

Uncle John sat down upon the bank beside the confiding Venetian

Doctor said he I am somewhat puzzled by this man you call Il Duca
as well as by my audacious capture and the methods employed to rob me
Id like your advice What shall I do

The only possible thing signore Submit

Why is it the only possible thing

Have you not yet discovered Unless you pay your friends will never
hear from you again Il Duca by his mothers favor is king here He
will murder you if you oppose his demands

Really

It is quite certain signore He has murdered several obstinate people
since I have been here and the outside world will never know their
fate It is folly to oppose the king Were you not rich you would not be
here Il Duca knows the exact wealth of every American who travels
abroad and is likely to visit Sicily Many escape him but a few wander
into his toils for he is wonderfully sagacious Mark you he does not
demand your all he merely takes tribute leaving his victims sufficient
to render life desirable to them If he required their all many would
as soon forfeit life as make the payment but a tithe they will spare
for the privilege of living That is why he is so successful And that
is why he remains undisturbed For an American being robbed so simply
never tells of his humiliating experience He goes home and avoids
Sicily ever after

Hmm I understand

But if you do not pay you are not permitted to leave this place You
are killed at once and the incident is over Il Duca does not love to
murder but he takes no chances

I see But suppose I pay and then make complaint to the Italian
government

It has been done signore But the government is very blind It does
not know Il Duca d Alcanta Its officials are convinced he does not
exist They investigate carefully and declare the tale is all a myth

Then there is no way of escape

Absolutely none Such a condition is almost inconceivable is it not
and in this enlightened age But it exists and is only harmful when its
victims are stubborn and rebellious To be cheerful and pay promptly is
the only sensible way out of your difficulty

Thank you said Uncle John I shall probably pay promptly But tell
me to satisfy my curiosity how does your duke murder his victims

He does not call it murder as I do he says they are suicides or the
victims of accident They walk along a path and fall into a pit It is
deep and they are killed The pit is also their tomb They are
forgotten and the trap is already set for their successors

Rather a gloomy picture doctor

Yes I tell you this because my nature is kind I abhor all crime and
much prefer that you should live But if you die my salario
continues I am employed to guard the health of the Dukes
familyespecially the old Duchessaand have no part in this detestable
business

Isnt that a bite

No signore It is the current It is not time for the fish to bite

Uncle John arose

Good afternoon doctor

Good afternoon signore

He left the old fellow sitting there and walked on The valley was about
a half mile long and from a quarter to a third of a mile in width It
resembled a huge amphitheatre in shape

The American tramped the length of the brook which disappeared into the
rocky wall at the far end Then he returned through the orchards to the
house

The place was silent and seemed deserted There was a languor in the
atmosphere that invited sleep Uncle John sought his room and lay down
for an afternoon nap soon falling into a sound slumber

When he awoke he found Ferralti seated beside his bed The young man was
pale but composed

Mr Merrick said he what have you decided to do

Uncle John rubbed his eyes and sat up

Im going to purchase that ring he answered at the best price the
Duke will make me

I am disappointed returned Ferralti stiffly I do not intend to
allow myself to be robbed in this way

Then write a farewell letter and Ill take it to your friends

It may not be necessary sir

Uncle John regarded him thoughtfully

What can you do he asked

Ferralti leaned forward and whispered softly I have a stout
pocketknife with a very long blade I shall try to kill the Duke Once
he is dead his people will not dare to oppose us but will fly in
terror It is only Il Ducas audacity and genius that enables this
robbers den to exist

You would rather attempt this than pay

Sir I could not bear the infamy of letting this scoundrel triumph over
me

Well Ferralti you are attempting a delicate and dangerous task but
so far as I can I will help you

He took the revolver from his pocket and handed it to his companion

Its loaded in every chamber he whispered Perhaps it will serve
your purpose better than a knife

Ferraltis eyes sparkled

Good he exclaimed concealing the weapon I shall watch for my
opportunity so as to make no mistake Meantime do you bargain with the
Duke but postpone any agreement to pay

All right my lad Ill wait to see what happens It may add a good
deal to the cost of that ring if you fail but Ill take the chances of
that for the sake of the game

He paused a moment and then added

Is your father really dead Count

Yes the Duke has sent me the cablegram he received from his agent I
cannot doubt his authority My father and I have not been friendly of
late years He was a severe man cold and unsympathetic but I am sorry
we could not have been reconciled before this awful fate overtook him
However it is now too late for vain regrets I tried not to disobey or
antagonize my one parent but he did not understand my nature and
perhaps I failed to understand his

He sighed and rising from his chair walked to the window to conceal his
emotion

Uncle John remained silent and presently Tommaso entered to notify them
that dinner would be served in a half hour and the Duke expected them
to join him at the table

The next morning Mr Merrick bargained pleasantly with his jailer who
seemed not averse to discussing the matter at length but no conclusion
was reached Ferralti took no part in the conversation but remained
sullen and silent and the Duke did not press him

The day after however he insisted that he had dallied long enough
although after much argument on the part of his enforced guests he
agreed to give them three days to decide with the understanding that
each day they delayed would add a goodly sum to their ransom If at the
end of the three days the Americans remained obdurate he would invite
them to take a little walk and the affair would be terminated

Ferralti hugged his revolver and awaited his opportunity It seemed to
Uncle John that he might have had a hundred chances to shoot the
brigand who merited no better fate than assassination at their hands
but although Ferralti was resolved upon the deed he constantly hesitated
to accomplish it in cold blood and the fact that he had three days
grace induced him to put off the matter as long as possible

He came to regret most bitterly his indecision for something in the
young mans eyes must have put the brigand on his guard When they awoke
on the third morning which was the fifth since their imprisonment some
one had searched their rooms thoroughly The revolver and the knife were
both gone and the loss rendered them absolutely helpless




CHAPTER XX

UNCLE JOHN PLAYS EAVESDROPPER


It now seemed to Uncle John that further resistance to the demands of Il
Duca was as useless as it was dangerous He resented the necessity of
paying a ransom as much as any man could but imprisoned as he was in a
veritable robbers den without means of communicating with the
authorities or the outside world and powerless to protect his life from
the vengeance of the unprincipled scoundrel who held him the only safe
and sane mode of procedure was to give in as gracefully as possible

He formed this conclusion during a long walk around the valley during
which he once more noted the absolute seclusion of the place and the
impossibility of escape by scaling the cliffs The doctor was fishing
again by the brook but paid no heed when Uncle John tramped by The
sight of the dapper little man gave Mr Merrick a thought and
presently he turned back and sat down beside the fisherman

I want to get out of this he said bluntly It was fun at first
and rather interesting but Ive had enough of it

The physician kept his eye on the line and made no reply

I want you to tell me how to escape continued Uncle John Its no
use saying that it cant be done for nothing is impossible to a clever
man such as I believe you to be

Still no reply

You spoke the other day of earning enough money to go home and live
in peace for the rest of your days Here sir is your opportunity to
improve upon that ambition The brigand is trying to exact a large
ransom from me Ill give it to you willinglyevery pennyif youll
show me how to escape

Why should you do that enquired the doctor still intent upon his
line Does it matter to you who gets your money

Of course was the prompt reply In one case I pay it for a service
rendered and do it gladly On the other hand I am robbed and that
goes against the grain Il Duca has finally decided to demand fifty
thousand dollars It shall be yours instead if you give me your
assistance

Signore said the other calmly I would like this money and I
regret that it is impossible for me to earn it But there is no means of
escape from this place except by the passage through the rocks which
passage only three people know the secret of openingIl Duca himself
the child Tato and the old Duchessa Perhaps Tommaso also knows I am
not certain but he will not admit he has such knowledge You see
signore I am as much a prisoner as yourself

There ought to be some way to climb these cliffs some secret path or
underground tunnel remarked Uncle John musingly

It is more than a hundred years since this valley was made secure by a
brigand ancestor of our Duchessa was the reply It may be two or
three centuries ago for all I know And ever since it has been used for
just this purpose to hold a prisoner until he was ransomedand no
such man has ever left the place alive unless he paid the price

Then you cannot help me asked Uncle John who was weary of hearing
these pessimistic declarations

I cannot even help myself for I may not resign my position here unless
the Duke is willing I should go

Good morning doctor

The prisoner returned slowly toward the dwelling with its group of
outhouses By chance he found a path leading to the rear of these which
he had not traversed before and followed it until he came to a hedge of
thickly set trees of some variety of cactus which seemed to have been
planted to form an enclosure Cautiously pushing aside the branches
bordering a small gap in this hedge Uncle John discovered a charming
garden lying beyond so he quickly squeezed himself through the opening
and entered

The garden was rudely but not badly kept There was even some attempt at
ornamentation and many of the shrubs and flowers were rare and
beautiful Narrow walks traversed the masses of foliage and several
leafy bowers invited one to escape the heat of the midday sun in their
shelter It was not a large place and struck one as being overcrowded
because so many of the plants were taller than a mans head

Uncle John turned down one path which after several curves and turns
came to an abrupt ending beneath the spreading branches of an acacia
tree which had been converted into a bower by a thick climbing vine
whose matted leaves and purple blossoms effectually screened off the
garden beyond

While he stood gazing around him to find a way out without retracing his
steps a clear voice within a few feet of him caused him to start The
voice spoke in vehement Italian and came from the other side of the
screen of vines It was sharp and garrulous in tone and although Uncle
John did not understand the words he recognized their dominating accent

The Duke replied slowly and sullenly and whatever he said had the
effect of rousing the first speaker to fierce anger

The American became curious He found a place where the leaves were
thinner than elsewhere and carefully pressing them apart looked through
the opening Beyond was a clear space well shaded and furnished with
comfortable settles tables and chairs It adjoined a wing of the
dwelling which stood but a few paces away and was evidently occupied by
the women of the household The old Duchessa her face still like a
death mask but her eyes glittering with the brightness of a serpents
sat enthroned within a large chair in the center of a family group It
was her sharp voice that had first aroused the Americans attention
Opposite her sat the Duke his thin face wearing an expression of gloom
and dissatisfaction The child Tato occupied a stool at her fathers
feet and in the background were three serving women sewing or
embroidering Near the Duke stood the tall brigand known as Pietro

Answering the old womans fierce tirade Tato said

It is foolish to quarrel in Italian The servants are listening

Let us then speak in English returned the Duchessa These are
matters the servants should not gossip about

The Duke nodded assent Both Tato and her grandmother spoke easily the
foreign tongue the Duke was more uncertain in his English but
understood it perfectly

I am still the head of this family resumed the Duchessa in a more
moderate tone I insist that my will be obeyed

Your dignity I have the respect for replied the Duke laboredly but
you grow old and foolish

Foolish I

Yes you are absurd You live in past centuries You think today we
must do all that your ancestors did

Can you do better

Yes the world has change It has progress With it I advance but you
do not You would murder rob torture today as the great Duke your
grandfather did You think we still are of the world independent You
think we are powerful and great Bah we are nothingwe are as a speck
of dust But still we are the outlaws and the outcasts of Sicily and
some day Italy will crush us and we will be forgotten

I dare them to molest us

Because you are imbecile The world you do not know I have travel I
see many countries and I am wise

But you are still my vassal my slave and I alone rule here Always
have you rebelled and wanted to escape Only my iron will has kept you
here and made you do your duty

Since you my brother Ridolfo killed I have little stomach for the
trade of brigand It is true But no longer is this trade necessary We
are rich Had I a son to inherit your business a different thought
might prevail but I have only Tato and a girl cannot be a successful
brigand

Why not cried the old Duchessa contemptuously It is the
girlalways the girlyou make excuses for But have I not ruled our
domainI who am a woman

Tato herself answered in a quiet voice

And what have you become nonna more than an outcast she enquired
What use to you is money or a power that the world would sneer at did
the world even suspect that you exist You are a failure in life my
nonna and I will not be like you

The Duchessa screamed an epithet and glared at the child as if she would
annihilate her but no fitting words to reply could she find

Uncle John smiled delightedly He felt no sense of humiliation or revolt
at eavesdropping in this den of thieves and to be able to gain so fair
a revelation of the inner life of this remarkable family was a diversion
not lightly to be foregone

So far we have managed to escape the law resumed the Duke But
always it may not be our fortune to do this if we continue this life
It is now a good time to stop Of one American we will gain a quarter of
a million liraa fortuneand of the other one hundred and fifty
thousand lira With what we already have it is enough and more Quietly
we will disband our men and go away In another land we live the
respectable life in peace with all and Tato shall be the fine lady
and forget she once was a brigands daughter

The child sprang up in glee and clasping her fathers neck with both
arms kissed him with passionate earnestness

Silently the Duchessa watched the scene Her face was as pallid and
immobile as ever even the eyes seemed to have lost expression But the
next words showed that she was still unconquered

You shall take the money of the fat pig of an American it is well to
do so But the youth who boldly calls himself Ferralti shall make no
tribute to this family He shall die as I have declared

I will not take the risk asserted the Duke sourly

Have the others who lie in the pit told tales she demanded

No but they died alone Here are two Americans our prisoners and
they have many and powerful friends both at Taormina and at Naples The
man Merrick when he goes will tell that Ferralti is here To obtain
his person alive or dead the soldiers will come here and destroy us
all It is folly and shows you are old and imbecile

Then go she cried fiercely Go you and Tato take your money and
escape And leave me my valley and the youth Ferralti and my revenge
Then if I die if the soldiers destroy me it is my own doing

In this new world of which you know nothing escape is not possible
replied the duke after a moments thought Ferralti must be accounted
for and because I captured him they would accuse me of his death and
even Tato might be made to suffer No madame Both the Americans must
be killed or both set free for ransom

Uncle John gave a start of dismay Here was a development he had not
expected

Then said the old woman positively let them both die

Oh no exclaimed Tato Not that grandmother

Certainly not so agreed the Duke We want their money

You are already rich said the Duchessa You have yourself said so
and I know it is truth

This new world explained the Duke contains of luxuries many that
you have no understanding of To be rich today requires more money than
in your days madre mia With these ransoms which already we have won
we shall have enough Without this money my Tato would lack much that I
desire for her So of new murders I will take no risk for the bambinas
sake

And my revenge

Bah of what use is it Because the boys father married my sister
Bianca and illtreated her must we kill their offspring

He is his fathers son The father you say is dead and so also is my
child Bianca Then my hatred falls upon the son Arturo and he must die
to avenge the wrong to our race

More proof that you are imbecile said the Duke calmly He shall not
die He is nothing to us except a mine from whence to get gold

He is my grandson I have a right to kill him

He is my nephew He shall live

Do you defy me

With certainty I defy you The new world permits no crazy nonna to
rule a family That is my privilege If you persist it is you who shall
go to the pit If you have reason you shall remain in your garden in
peace Come Tato we will retire

He arose and took the childs hand The old woman sat staring at them in
silence but with an evil glint in her glistening eyes

Uncle John turned around and softly made his retreat from the garden
His face wore a startled and horrified expression and on his forehead
stood great beads of sweat that the sultriness of the day did not
account for

But he thought better of Il Duca




CHAPTER XXI

THE PIT


They met an hour later at luncheon all but the Duchessa who sulked in
her garden Tato was bright and smiling filled with a suppressed joy
which bubbled up in spite of the little ones effort to be dignified and
sedate When her hand stole under the table to find and press that of
her father Uncle John beamed upon her approvingly for he knew what had
occurred and could sympathize with her delight

The Duke however was more sombre than usual He had defied his mother
successfully so far but he feared the terrible old woman more than did
Tato because he knew more of her history and of the bold and wicked
deeds she had perpetrated in years gone by Only once had a proposed
victim escaped her and that was when her own daughter Bianca had fallen
in love with an American held for ransom and spirited him away from the
valley through knowledge of the secret passage It was well Bianca had
fled with her lover otherwise her mother would surely have killed her
But afterward when the girl returned to die in the old home all was
forgiven and only the hatred of her foreign husband whose cruelty had
driven her back to Sicily remained to rankle in the old Duchessas
wicked heart

No one knew her evil nature better than her son He entertained a
suspicion that he had not conquered her by his recent opposition to her
will Indeed he would never have dared to brave her anger except for
Tatos sake Tato was his idol and in her defense the cowardly brigand
had for the moment become bold

Tato laughed and chatted with Uncle John all through the meal even
trying at times to cheer the doleful Ferralti who was nearly as glum
and unsociable as her father The servants and brigands at the lower end
of the table looked upon the little one admiringly It was evident she
was a general favorite

On the porch after luncheon the Duke broached the subject of the
ransoms again still maintaining the fable of selling his antique
jewelry

Sir said Uncle John Im going to submit gracefully but upon one
condition

The Duke scowled

I allow no conditions he said

Youd better allow this one Uncle John replied because it will make
it easier for all of us Of my own free will and accord I will make a
present to Tato of fifty thousand dollars and she shall have it for her
dowry when she marries

Tato clapped her hands

How did you know I am a girl when I wear boys clothes she asked

Even the duke smiled at that but the next moment he shook his head
solemnly

It will not do signore he declared answering Uncle Johns
proposition This is a business affair altogether You must purchase
the ring and at once

The little American sighed It had been his last hope

Very well he said have your own way

You will send to your friends for the money

Whenever you say Duke Youve got me in a hole and I must wiggle out
the best way I can

The brigand turned to Ferralti

And you signore he asked

I do not know whether I can get the money you demand

But you will make the attempt as I shall direct

Yes

Then signori it is all finished In a brief time you will leave my
hospitable roof

The sooner the better declared Ferralti

They sat for a time in silence each busy with his thoughts

Go to your grandmother Tato said the Duke and try to make your
peace with her If she is too angry do not remain Tomorrow you must
go into town with letters from these gentlemen to their friends

The child kissed him and went obediently to do his will Then the
brigand spoke to Tommaso who brought writing material from the house
and placed it upon a small table

Uncle John without further demur sat down to write The Duke dictated
what he should say although he was allowed to express the words in his
own characteristic style and he followed his instructions implicitly
secretly admiring the shrewdness of the brigands methods

It was now Ferraltis turn He had just seated himself at the table and
taken the pen when they were startled by a shrill scream from the rear
of the house It was followed by another and another in quick
succession

It was Tatos voice and the duke gave an answering cry and sprang from
the veranda to dart quickly around the corner of the house Uncle John
followed him nearly as fearful as the childs father

Tommaso seized a short rifle that stood near and ran around the house in
the other direction when Ferralti who for a moment had seemed dazed by
the interruption followed Tommaso rather than the others

As they came to the rear they were amazed to see the old Duchessa whom
they had known to be feeble and dependent upon her women rush through
the garden hedge with the agility of a man bearing in her arms the
struggling form of little Tato

The child screamed pitifully but the woman glared upon Tommaso and
Ferralti as she passed them with the ferocity of a tiger

She is mad cried Ferralti Quick Tommaso let us follow her

The brigand bounded forward with the young man scarce a pace behind
him The woman running with wonderful speed in spite of her burden
began to ascend a narrow path leading up the face of a rugged cliff

A yell of anguish from behind for a moment arrested Ferraltis rapid
pursuit Glancing back he saw the Duke running frantically toward them
at the same time waving his arms high above his head

The pit he shouted She is making for the pit Stop her for the
love of God

Ferralti understood and dashed forward again at full speed Tommaso
also understood for his face was white and he muttered terrible oaths
as he pressed on Yet run as they might the mad duchessa was inspired
with a strength so superhuman that she kept well in advance

But the narrow path ended half way up the cliff It ended at a deep
chasm in the rocks the edge of which was protected by a large flat
stone like the curb of a well

With a final leap the old woman gained this stone and while the
dreadful pit yawned at her feet she turned and with a demoniacal laugh
faced her pursuers hugging the child close to her breast

Tommaso and Ferralti who were nearest paused instinctively It was now
impossible for them to prevent the tragedy about to be enacted The
Duke spurred on by fear was yet twenty paces in their rear and in a
moment he also stopped clasping his hands in a gesture of vain
entreaty

Listen Lugui his mother called to him in a dear high voice This
is the child that has come between us and turned you from a man into a
coward Here alone is the cause of our troubles Behold I will remove
it forever from our path

With the words she lifted Tato high above her head and turned toward the
pitthat terrible cleft in the rocks which was believed to have no
bottom

At her first movement Tommaso had raised his gun and the Duke
perceiving this called to him in an agonized voice to fire But either
the brigand wavered between his loyalty to the Duke or the Duchessa or
he feared to injure Tato for he hesitated to obey and the moments were
precious

The childs fate hung in the balance when Ferralti snatched the weapon
from the brigands hands and fired it so hastily that he scarcely seemed
to take aim

A wild cry echoed the shot The woman collapsed and fell dropping Tato
at her feet where they both tottered at the edge of the pit The child
however clung desperately to the outer edge of the flat stone while
the Duchessas inert form seemed to hesitate for an instant and then
disappeared from view

Tommaso ran forward and caught up the child returning slowly along the
path to place it in the fathers arms Ferralti was looking vaguely from
the weapon he held to the pit and then back again as if not fully
understanding what he had done

Thank you signore said the Duke brokenly for saving my precious
child

But I have slain your mother cried the young man horrified

The obligation is even replied the duke She was also your
grandmother

Ferralti stood motionless his face working convulsively his tongue
refusing to utter a sound

But he did not shoot my grandmother at all said Tato who was sobbing
against her fathers breast for I heard the bullet strike the rock
beside us My grandmothers strength gave way and she fainted It was
that that saved me padre mia




CHAPTER XXII

NEWS AT LAST


Kenneth Forbes had always been an unusual boy He had grown up in an
unfriendly atmosphere unloved and uncared for and resented this
neglect with all the force of his impetuous nature He had hated Aunt
Jane and regarded her as cruel and selfisha fair estimate of her
characteruntil Aunt Janes nieces taught him to be more considerate
and forgiving Patricia especially had exercised a gentler influence
upon the arbitrary youth and as a consequence they had become staunch
friends

When the unexpected inheritance of a fortune changed the boys condition
from one of dependence to one of importance he found he had no longer
any wrongs to resent therefore his surly and brusque moods gradually
disappeared and he became a pleasant companion to those he cared for
With strangers he still remained reserved and suspicious and
occasionally the old sullen fits would seize him and it was well to
avoid his society while they lasted

On his arrival at Taormina Kenneth had entered earnestly into the
search for Uncle John whom he regarded most affectionately and having
passed the day tramping over the mountains he would fill the evening
with discussions and arguments with the nieces concerning the fate of
their missing uncle

But as the days dragged wearily away the search slackened and was
finally abandoned Kenneth set up his easel in the garden and began to
paint old Etna with its wreath of snow and the soft gray cloud of vapor
that perpetually hovered over it

Anyone with half a soul could paint that said Patsy and as a proof
of her assertion the boy did very well indeed except that his
uneasiness on Mr Merricks account served to distract him more or less

Nor was Kenneth the only uneasy one Mr Watson hardheaded man of
resource as he was grew more and more dejected as he realized the
impossibility of interesting the authorities in the case The Sicilian
officials were silent and uncommunicative the Italians wholly
indifferent If strangers came to Taormina and got into difficulties
the government was in no way to blame It was their duty to tolerate
tourists but those all too energetic foreigners must take care of
themselves

Probably Mr Watson would have cabled the State Department at Washington
for assistance had he not expected each day to put him in communication
with his friend and in the end he congratulated himself upon his
patience The close of the week brought a sudden and startling change in
the situation

The girls sat on the shaded terrace one afternoon watching the picture
of Etna grow under Kenneths deft touches when they observed a child
approaching them with shy diffidence It was a beautiful Sicilian boy
with wonderful brown eyes and a delicate profile After assuring himself
that the party of young Americans was quite separate from any straggling
guest of the hotel the child came near enough to say in a low tone

I have a message from Signor Merrick

They crowded around him eagerly then raining questions from every side
but the boy shrank away and said warningly

If we are overheard signorini mia it will be very bad No one must
suspect that I am here

Is my uncle well asked Patsy imploringly

Quite well mees

And have you also news of Count Ferralti anxiously enquired Louise

Oh Ferralti He is better Some teeth are knocked out but he eats
very well without them replied the child with an amused laugh

Where are our friends my lad Kenneth asked

I cannot describe the place signore but here are letters to explain
all The child produced a bulky package and after a glance at each in
turn placed it in Patsys hands Read very secretly signorini and
decide your course of action Tomorrow I will come for your answer In
the meantime confide in no one but yourselves If you are indiscreet
you alone will become the murderers of Signor Merrick and the sad young
Ferralti

Who are you asked Beth examining the child closely

I am called Tato signorina mia

Where do you live

It is all explained in the letters believe me

Beth glanced at Patricia who was examining the package and now all
crowded around for a glimpse of Uncle Johns wellknown handwriting The
wrapper was inscribed

     To Miss Doyle Miss De Graf and Miss Merrick
                                 Hotel CastelloaMare Taormina
       By the safe hands of Tato

Inside were two letters one addressed to Louise personally She seized
this and ran a little distance away while Beth took Uncle Johns letter
from Patsys trembling hands and having opened it read aloud in a
clear and composed voice the following

     My dear Nieces and also my dear friends Silas Watson and
     Kenneth Forbes if they are with you Greeting You have
     perhaps been wondering at my absence which I will explain
     by saying that I am visiting a noble acquaintance in a very
     cozy and comfortable retreat which I am sure would look
     better from a distance My spirits and health are A No 
     and it is my intention to return to you as soon as you have
     executed a little commission for me which I want you to do
     exactly as I hereby instruct you In other words if you
     dont execute the commission you will probably execute me

     I have decided to purchase a valuable antique ring from my
     host at a price of fifty thousand dollars which trifling
     sum I must have at once to complete the transaction for
     until full payment is made I cannot rejoin you Therefore
     you must hasten to raise the dough Heres the programme my
     dear girls One of you must go by first train to Messina and
     cable Isham Marvin  Co to deposit with the New York
     correspondents of the Banca Commerciale Italiana fifty
     thousand dollars and have instructions cabled to the
     Messina branch of that bank to pay the sum to the written
     order of John Merrick This should all be accomplished
     within twentyfour hours Present the enclosed order
     together with my letter of credit and passport which will
     identify my signature and draw the money in cash Return
     with it to Taormina and give it secretly to the boy Tato
     who will bring it to me I will rejoin you within three
     hours after I have paid for the ring

     This may seem a strange proceeding to you my dears but
     you must not hesitate to accomplish itif you love me
     Should my old friend Silas Watson be now with you as I
     expect him to be he will assist you to do my bidding for
     he will be able to realize better than I can now explain
     how important it is to me

     Also I beg you to do a like service for Count Ferralti who
     is entrusting his personal commission to Louise He also
     must conclude an important purchase before he can return to
     Taormina

     More than this I am not permitted to say in this letter
     Confide in no stranger or official of any sort and act as
     secretly and quietly as possible I hope soon to be with
     you

     Very affectionately         UNCLE JOHN

What does it all mean asked Patsy bewildered when Beth had finished
reading

Why it is clear enough Im sure said Kenneth Uncle John is
imprisoned by brigands and the money he requires is his ransom We must
get it as soon as possible you know and luckily he is so rich that he
wont miss this little draft at all

Beth sat silent angrily staring at the letter

I suppose said Patsy hesitating the robbers will do the dear uncle
some mischief if he doesnt pay

Just knock him on the head thats all said the boy But theres no
need to worry We can get the money easily

Suddenly Beth jumped up

Wheres that girl she demanded sharply

What girl

Tato

Tato my dear coz is a boy answered Kenneth and he disappeared
ages ago

You must be blind said Beth scornfully not to recognize a girl
when you see one A boy indeed

Why he dressed like a boy replied Kenneth hesitatingly

So much the more disgraceful sniffed Beth She belongs to those
brigands I suppose

Looks something like Victor Valdi said Patsy thoughtfully

Il Duca Of course I see it myself now Patricia it is that wicked
duke who has captured Uncle John

I had guessed that declared Patsy smiling

He must be a handsome rascal observed Kenneth for the child is
pretty as a picture

He isnt handsome at all replied Beth but there is a look about the
childs eyes that reminds me of him

Thats it exactly agreed Patsy

Louise now approached them with a white frightened face

Isnt it dreadful she moaned They are going to kill Ferralti unless
he gives them thirty thousand dollars

And I dont believe he can raise thirty cents said Patsy calmly

Oh yes he can answered Louise beginning to cry Hihisfather
is ddead and has left himafortune

Dont blubber Lou said the boy chidingly in that case your dago
friend is as well off as need be But I suppose youre afraid the
noaccount Count wont figure his life is worth thirty thousand dollars
It does seem like an awful price to pay for a foreigner

It isnt that said Louise striving to control her emotion He says
he hates to be robbed He wouldnt pay a penny if he could help it

Good for the Count I dont blame him a bit exclaimed Beth It is a
beastly shame that free born Americans should be enslaved by a crew of
thieving Sicilians and obliged to purchase their freedom

True for you said Kenneth nodding But what are we going to do
about it

Pay of course decided Patsy promptly Our Uncle John is too
precious to be sacrificed for all the money in the world Come lets go
and find Mr Watson We ought not to lose a moments time

The lawyer read Uncle Johns letter carefully as well as the one from
Count Ferralti which Louise confided to him with the request that he
keep the young mans identity a secret for a time until he could reveal
it to her cousins in person

The only thing to be done announced Mr Watson is to carry out
these instructions faithfully We can send the cable messages from here
and in the morning Louise and I will take the train for Messina and
remain there until we get the money

Its an outrage cried Beth

Of course my dear But it cant be helped And your uncle is wise to
take the matter so cheerfully After all it is little enough to pay
for ones life and liberty and our friend is so wealthy that he will
never feel the loss at all

It isnt that its the principle of the thing that I object to said
the girl Its downright disgraceful to be robbed so easily

To be sure but the disgrace is Italys not ours Object all you want
to Beth dear continued the old lawyer smiling at her but
nevertheless well pay as soon as possible and have done with it What
we want now is your Uncle John and we want him mighty badly

Really the pirates didnt charge enough for him added Patsy

So Mr Watson sent the cables to John Merricks bankers and Count
Ferraltis attorney and the next morning went with Louise to Messina

Frascatti drove all the party down the road to the station at Giardini
and as the train pulled out Beth who had remained seated in the
victoria with Patricia and Kenneth suddenly stood up to pull the
vetturinos sleeve

Tell me Frascatti she whispered isnt that Il Ducas child
Lookthat little one standing in the corner

Why yes it is really Tato answered the man before he thought to
deny it

Very well you may now drive us home returned Beth a shade of
triumph in her voice




CHAPTER XXIII

BETH BEGINS TO PLOT


Once back in their sittingroom behind closed doors Beth Patsy and
Kenneth got their three heads together and began eagerly to discuss a
plot which Beth had hinted of on the way home and now unfolded in
detail And while they still whispered together a knock at the door
startled them and made them look rather guilty until the boy answered
the call and admitted little Tato

The childs beautiful face wore a smile of demure satisfaction as Tato
bowed respectfully to the young Americans

Kenneth winked at Beth from behind the visitors back

As you have a guest he remarked with a yawn that was somewhat rude
I shall now go and take my nap

What do you sleep so early in the day you lazybones asked Patsy
brightly

Any time my dear is good enough for an overworked artist he
replied Au revoir my cousins See you at luncheon

With this he strolled away and when he had gone Beth said to Tato

Wont you sit down signorina

Do you mean me asked the child as if surprised

Yes I can see plainly that you are a girl

And a pretty one too my dear added Patsy

Tato blushed as if embarrassed but in a moment smiled upon the American
girls

Do you think me immodest then she asked anxiously

By no means my dear Beth assured her I suppose you have an
excellent reason for wearing boys clothes

So I have signorina I live in the mountains where dresses catch in
the crags and bother a girl And my father has always been heartbroken
because he had no son and likes to see me in this attire He has many
errands for me too where a boy may go unnoticed yet a girl would
attract too much attention This is one of the errands signorini But
now tell me if you please how have you decided to answer the letters
of Signor Merrick and Signor Ferralti

Oh there was but one way to answer them Tato replied Beth
composedly We have sent Mr Watson and our cousin Louise Merrick to
Messina to get the money If our friends in America act promptly Mr
Watson and Louise will return by tomorrow afternoons train and be
prepared to make the payment

That is well signorina responded Tato

We are to give the money to you I suppose said Patsy

Yes I will return for it tomorrow afternoon answered the child
with businesslike gravity Then she looked earnestly from one to the
other of the two girls You must act discreetly in the meantime you
know You must not talk to anyone or do anything to imperil your
uncles safety

Of course not Tato

I beg you not signorini The uncle is a good man and brave I do not
wish him to be injured

Nor do we Tato

And the young man is not a coward either He has been kind to me But
he is sad and not so pleasant to talk with as the uncle

True enough Tato said Beth

Patsy had been examining the child with curious intentness The little
one was so lovely and graceful and her voice sounded so soft and
womanly that Patsy longed to take her in her arms and hug her

How old are you dear she asked

Tato saw the friendly look and answered with a smile

Perhaps as old as you signorina although I am so much smaller I
shall be fifteen in a month

So old

Tato laughed merrily

Ah you might well say so young amico mia To be grown up is much
nicer do you not think so And then I shall not look such a baby as
now and have people scold me when I get in the way as they do little
bambini

But when you are grown you cannot wear boys clothing either

Tato sighed

We have a saying in Sicily that each year has its sunshine and rain
which means its sorrow and its joy she answered Perhaps I sometimes
think more of the tears than of the laughter although I know that is
wrong Not always shall I be a mountaineer and then the soft dresses of
the young girls shall be my portion Will I like them better I do not
know But I must go now instead of chattering here Farewell
signorini until tomorrow

Will you not remain with us

Oh no although you are kind I am expected home But tomorrow I will
come for the money You will be silent

Surely Tato

The child smiled upon them pleasantly It was a relief to deal with two
tender girls instead of cold and resentful men such as she had
sometimes met At the door she blew a kiss to them and darted away

In the courtyard Frascatti saw her gliding out and discreetly turned his
head the other way

Tato took the old road circling around the theatre and through the
narrow winding streets of the lower town to the Catania Gate She
looked back one or twice but no one noticed her If any of the
villagers saw her approaching they slipped out of her path

Once on the highway however Tato became lost in reflection Her
mission being successfully accomplished it required no further thought
but the sweet young American girls had made a strong impression upon the
lonely Sicilian maid and she dreamed of their pretty gowns and ribbons
their fresh and comely faces and the gentleness of their demeanor

Tato was not gentle She was wild and free and boyish and had no pretty
gowns whatever But what then She must help her father to get his
fortune and then he had promised her that some day they would go to
Paris or Cairo and live in the world and be brigands no longer

She would like that she thought as she clambered up the steep paths
and perhaps she would meet these American girls again or others like
them and make them her friends She had never known a girl friend as
yet

These ambitions would yesterday have seemed far in the dim future but
now that her stern old grandmother was gone it was possible her father
would soon fulfill his promises While the Duchessa lived she ruled them
all and she was a brigand to the backbone Now her fathers will
prevailed and he could refuse his child nothing

Kenneth was not an expert detective but he had managed to keep Tato in
sight without being suspected by her He had concealed himself near the
Catania Gate through which he knew she must pass and by good luck she
had never looked around once so intent were her musings

When she came to the end of the path and leaned against the rock to sing
the broken refrain which was the open sesame to the valley the boy
was hidden snug behind a boulder where he could watch her every
movement

Then the rock opened Tato passed in and the opening closed behind her

Kenneth found a foothold and climbed up the wall of rock higher and
higher until at last he crept upon a high ridge and looked over

The hidden valley lay spread before him in all its beauty but the
precipice at his feet formed a sheer drop of a hundred feet or more and
he drew back with a shudder

Then he took courage to look again and observed the house on the porch
of which stood Tato engaged in earnest conversation with a tall dark
Sicilian Uncle John was nowhere to be seen but the boy understood that
he was there nevertheless and realized that his prison was so secure
that escape was impossible

And now he climbed down again a much more difficult feat than getting
up But although he was forced to risk his life several times he was
agile and clearheaded and finally dropped to the path that led to the
secret door of the passage

His next thought was to mark the exact location of the place so that he
could find it again and as he returned slowly along the paths through
the rocky fissures he took mental note of every curve and communication
and believed he could now find his way to the retreat of the brigands at
any time he chose




CHAPTER XXIV

PATSYS NEW FRIEND


I must say that I dont like the job said Patsy the next morning as
she stood by the window and faced Beth and Kenneth Suppose we fail

In the bright lexicon of youth

Shut up Ken If we fail said Beth we will be no worse off than
before

And if we win added the boy theyll think twice before they try to
rob Americans again

Well Im with you anyhow declared Patricia I can see its risky
all right but as you say no great harm will be done if we slip up

You announced Beth gravely must be the captain

It isnt in me dear You figured the thing out and Ken and I will
follow your lead

No said Beth decidedly Im not quick enough either in thought or
action to be a leader Patsy And theres a bit of deception required
that I couldnt manage That clever little thing Tato would know at
once I was up to some mischief but she would never suspect you

I like that compliment replied Patricia I may deserve it of
course but it strikes me Louise is the one best fitted for such work

We cant let Louise into this plot said the boy positively shed
spoil it all

Dont be silly Patsy said Beth Youre genuine and frank and the
child likes you I could see that yesterday All you have to do is to be
nice to her and win her confidence and then when the climax comes you
must be the spokesman and talk straight out from the shoulder You can
do that all right

Ill bet on her cried Kenneth with an admiring look at the girl

Then said Patsy it is all arranged and Im the captain And is it
agreed that we wont lisp a word to Mr Watson or Louise

Not a word

Here said Kenneth drawing a revolver from his pocket is Uncle
Johns popgun Its the only one I could find in his room so he must
have taken the other with him Be careful of it Patsy for its loaded
all round Can you shoot

No but I suppose the pistol can I know enough to pull the trigger

And when you do remember to point it away from your friends Now hide
it my dear and be careful of it

Patsy concealed the weapon in the bosom of her dress not without making
a wry face and shivering a bit

Have you got your revolver Beth asked the boy

Yes

And she can shoot just wonderfully exclaimed Patsy Yesterday she
picked an orange off a tree with a bullet You should have seen her

I know said Ken nodding Ive seen Beth shoot before and shes our
main reliance in this conspiracy For my part I can hit a mark
sometimes and sometimes I cant See here He exhibited a beautiful
pearl and silvermounted weapon which he drew from his pocket Mr
Watson and I have carried revolvers ever since we came to Sicily but
weve never had occasion to use them I can hardly believe even now
that this beautiful place harbors brigands Its such a romantic
incident in our prosaic world of today And now young ladies we are
armed to the teeth and can defy an army Eh Captain Pat

If youre not more respectful said the girl Ill have you
courtmarshalled and drummed out of camp

On the afternoon train came Louise and Mr Watson from Messina The
American agents had responded promptly and the bank had honored the
orders and delivered the money without delay

It is all safe in my satchel said the lawyer as they rode together
to the hotel and our dear friends are as good as rescued already Its
pretty bulky Kennethfour hundred thousand lirabut it is all in
notes on the Banca dItalia for we couldnt manage gold

Quite a haul for the brigand observed Kenneth thoughtfully

True but little enough for the lives of two men That is the way I
look at the transaction And since our friends can afford the loss we
must be as cheerful over the thing as possible It might have been a
tragedy you know

Louise shivered

Im glad it is all over she said gratefully

The conspirators looked at one another and smiled but held their peace

Arriving at the hotel Beth and Kenneth at once disappeared saying they
were going to town as they would not be needed longer Patsy
accompanied their cousin and the lawyer to the sittingroom where
presently Tato came to them

Well little one said the lawyer pleasantly We have secured the
money required to enable Mr Merrick to purchase the ring and
MrerCount Ferralti to buy his bracelet Will you count it

Yes signore if you please replied Tato with a sober face

Mr Watson drew out two packages of bank notes and placed them upon the
table The child realizing the importance of the occasion carefully
counted each bundle and then replaced the wrappers

The amounts are correct signore she said I thank you for making my
task so easy And now I will go

The lawyer brought a newspaper and wrapped the money in it once again

It is always dangerous to carry so much money said he but now no
one will be likely to suspect the contents of your package

Tato smiled

No one would care to molest me she said for they fear those that
protect me Good afternoon signore Your friends will be with you in
time to dine in your company Good afternoon signorini turning to
Patsy and Louise

Ill walk a little way with you may I asked Patsy smiling into
Tatos splendid eyes

To be sure signorina was the quick response

Patricia caught up a sunshade and followed the child out at the side
entrance which was little used Tato took the way along the old road
and Patsy walked beside her chatting brightly of the catacombs the
Norman villa that showed its checkered tower above the trees and the
ancient wall that still hemmed in the little village

I love Taormina she said earnestly and shall be sorry to leave it
You must be very happy Tato to be able to live here always

It is my birthplace she said but I long to get away from it and see
other countries The view is fine they say but it tires me The air is
sweet and pure but it oppresses me The climate is glorious but I have
had enough of it In other places there is novelty and many things that
Sicily knows nothing of

That is true replied Patsy tucking the little ones arm underneath
her own with a sympathetic gesture I know just how you feel Tato
You must come to America some day and visit me I will make you very
welcome dear and you shall be my friend

The child looked into her face earnestly

You do not hate me signorina becausebecause

Because why

Because my errand to you has been so lawless andandunfriendly

Ah Tato you do not choose this life do you

No signorina

It is forced on you by circumstances is it not

Truly signorina

I know You would not long so wistfully to change your condition if you
enjoyed being a little brigand But nothing that has passed must
interfere with our friendship dear If I were in your place you see I
would do just as you have done It is not a very honest life Tato nor
one to be proud of but Im not going to blame you one bit

They had passed the Catania Gate and reached the foot of one of the
mountain paths Tato paused hesitatingly

Oh Ill go a little farther said Patsy promptly No one will
notice two girls you know Shall I carry your parcel for a time

No replied the child hugging it close with her disengaged arm But
she offered no objection when Patsy continued to walk by her side

Have you any brothers or sisters Tato

No signorina

Have you a mother

No signorina My father and I are alone

I know him well Tato We were on the ship together crossing the
ocean He was gruff and disagreeable but I made him talk to me and
smile

I know he has told me of the Signorina Patsy He is fond of you

Yet he robbed my uncle

The child flushed and drew away her arm

That is it That is why you should hate me she replied bitterly I
know it is robbery and brigandage although my father masks it by
saying he sells antiques Until now I have seen nothing wrong in this
life signorina but you have made me ashamed

Why dear

Because you are so good and gentle and so forgiving

Patsy laughed

In reality Tato I am resentful and unforgiving You will find out
soon that I am a very human girl and then I will not make you ashamed
But your fathers business is shameful nevertheless

Tato was plainly puzzled and knew not what to reply But just then they
reached the end of the crevasse and the child said

You must return now Signorina Patsy

But why cannot I go on with you and come back with my uncle

Tato hesitated Accustomed as she was to duplicity and acting in her
capacity as lure for her thieving father the child was just now
softened by Patsys kindly manner and the successful accomplishment of
her mission She had no thought of any treachery or deception on the
part of the American girl and the request seemed to her natural
enough

If you like she decided you may come as far as the barrier and
there wait for your uncle It will not be long

Very well dear

Tato clambered over the dividing rock and dropped into the path beyond
Patsy sprang lightly after her A short distance farther and they
reached the barrier

This is the place signorina You will sit upon that stone and wait
until your uncle appears She hesitated and then added softly I may
not see you again But you will not forget me

Never Tato And if you come to America you must not forget to visit
me Remember whatever happens that we are friends and must always
remain so

The child nodded gratefully Then leaning against the face of the
cliff she raised her voice and warbled clearly the bit of song that
served as the signal to her father




CHAPTER XXV

TURNING THE TABLES


No sooner had the notes ceased than Kenneth sprang from behind a rock
that had concealed him and grasped the child in his strong arms trying
to cover her mouth at the same time to prevent her from crying out

Tato developed surprising strength The adventure of yesterday had so
thoroughly frightened her that when she found herself again seized she
struggled madly The boy found that he could scarcely hold her so he
enfolded her in both his arms and letting her scream as she might
picked up her tiny form and mounted the slope of the hill leaping from
rock to rock until he came to a broad boulder twenty feet or more above
the path Here he paused panting and awaited results

The rock doors had opened promptly Even while Kenneth struggled with
the brigands daughter Patsy could see straight through the tunnel and
into the valley beyond The child had dropped her bundle in the effort
to escape and while Kenneth was leaping with her up the crags Patsy ran
forward and secured the money returning quickly to her position facing
the tunnel

And now they heard shouts and the sound of hastening feet as Il Duca ran
from the tunnel followed closely by two of his brigands They paused a
moment at the entrance as if bewildered but when the father saw his
child in the grasp of a stranger and heard her screams he answered with
a roar of fury and prepared to scramble up the rock to rescue her

That was where Patsy showed her mettle She hastily covered the brigand
with her revolver and shouted warningly

Stop or you are a dead man

It was wonderfully dramatic and effective

Il Duca shrank back scowling for he had no weapon at hand Leaning
against the entrance to his valley he glared around to determine the
number of his foes and the probable chance of defeating them

Kenneth laughed boyishly at his discomfiture Kneeling down the youth
grasped Tato by both wrists and lowered her body over the edge of the
rock so that her feet just touched a little ledge beneath He continued
to hold fast to her wrists though and there she remained stretched
against the face of the rock fronting the path in full view of all but
still unable to move

From this exasperating sight Il Duca glanced at Patsy She was holding
the revolver rigidly extended and her blue eyes blazed with the
excitement of the moment It was a wonder she did not pull the trigger
inadvertently and the thought that she might do so caused the brigand
to shudder

Turning half around he beheld a third enemy quietly seated upon the
rocks directly across the path from Kenneth her pose unconcerned as she
rested her chin lightly upon her left hand It was Beth who held her
revolver nonchalantly and gazed upon the scene below her with calm
interest

The Duke gave a cough to clear his throat His men hung back of him
silent and motionless for they did not like this absolute and dangerous
defiance of their chief

Tell me then Tato he called in English what is the cause of this
trouble

I do not know my father except that these are friends of Signor
Merrick who have secretly followed me here

The carefully arranged programme gave Patsy a speech at this point but
she had entirely forgotten it

Let me explain said Beth coldly You have dared to detain in your
robbers den the persons of Mr Merrick and Count Ferralti You have
also demanded a ransom for their release That is brigandage which is
denounced by the laws of Sicily We have appealed to the authorities
but they are helpless to assist us Therefore being Americans we have
decided to assist ourselves We command you to deliver to us on this
spot safe and uninjured the persons of our friends and that without
any unnecessary delay

The Duke listened with a sneer

And if we refuse signorina

If you refuseif you do not obey at onceI swear that I will shoot
your child Tato whose body yonder awaits my bullet And afterward I
shall kill you

As she spoke she levelled the revolver and aimed it carefully at the
exposed body of the child

The brigand paled and grasped the rock to steady himself

Bah No girl can shoot from that distance he exclaimed scornfully

Indeed Take care of your finger called Beth and a shot echoed
sharply along the mountain side

The brigand jumped and uttered a yell at the same time whipping his
right hand underneath his left arm for Beths bullet had struck one of
his fingers and then flattened itself against the cliff

That settled all argument as far as Il Duca was concerned for he now
had ample evidence that the sterneyed girl above him could shoot and
was not to be trifled with All his life he had ruled by the terror of
his threats today he was suddenly vanquished by a determination he
dared not withstand

Enough he cried Have your way

He spoke to his men in Italian and they hastened through the tunnel
glad to escape

Following their departure there was a brief silence during which all
stood alert Then Tato still half suspended against the cliff said in
a clear soft voice

Father if you think you can escape let them shoot me and keep your
prisoners The money for their ransom I brought to this place and they
will pay it even yet to save their friends from your vengeance Do not
let these wild Americans defeat us I beg of you I am not afraid Save
yourself and let them shoot me if they will

Kenneth afterward declared that he thought the jig was up then for
they had no intention whatever of harming Tato It was all merely a bit
of American bluff and it succeeded because the brigand was a coward
and dared not emulate his daughters courage

No no Tato cried the Duke brokenly as he wrung his hands in
anguish There is more money to be had but I have only one child They
shall not harm a hair of your head my pretty one

Patsy wanted to yell bravo but wisely refrained Her eyes were full
of tears though and her resolution at ebb tide

Fortunately the men had made haste They returned with surprising
promptness pushing the amazed prisoners before them

Uncle John as he emerged from the tunnel looked around upon the tragic
scene and gasped

Well I declare

Count Ferralti was more composed if equally surprised He lifted his
hat politely to Beth and Patsy and smiled with great satisfaction

You are free said Il Duca harshly Go

They lost no time in getting the brigands between themselves and the
mouth of the tunnel and then Kenneth gently drew Tato to a place beside
him and assisted her to clamber down the path

Good bye little one he said pleasantly youre what we call a
brick in our country I like you and Im proud of you

Tato did not reply With streaming eyes she was examining her fathers
shattered hand and sobbing at sight of the blood that dripped upon the
rocks at his feet

Get inside called Beth sharply and close up that rock Lively
now

The girl who could shoot still sat toying with her revolver and the
mountaineers obeyed her injunction The rock promptly closed and the
group of Americans was left alone

Then Beth came slowly down to where Patsy was hugging Uncle John in a
wild frenzy of delight and Count Ferralti was shaking Kenneths hand
with a face eloquent of emotion

Come said she her voice sounding faint and weary let us get away
from here It was a pretty game while it lasted but Ill feel safer
when we are home again Wheres the money

Ive got it said Kenneth holding up the package

What didnt you pay demanded Uncle John astounded

Of course not dear said Patsy gleefully Did you think your nieces
would let you be robbed by a bunch of dagoes

Ferralti caught hold of Beths swaying form

Look after your cousin he said sharply I think she has fainted




CHAPTER XXVI

THE COUNT UNMASKS


And now said Uncle John as he sat in their cosy sittingroom
propped in an easy chair with his feet upon a stool its about time
for you to give an account of yourselves you young rascals

They had eaten a late but very satisfactory dinner at the
CastelloaMare where the return of the missing ones was hailed with
joy by the proprietor and his assistants Even the little bewhiskered
headwaiter who resembled a jackinthebox more than he did a man
strove to celebrate the occasion by putting every good thing the house
afforded before the returned guests For although they dared not
interfere to protect the victims of the terrible Il Duca the hotel
people fully recognized the fact that brigandage was not a good
advertisement for Taormina and hoped the little incident would not
become generally known

Old Silas Watson dignified lawyer as he was actually danced a hornpipe
when he beheld his old friend safe and sound But he shook his head
reproachfully when he learned of the adventure his ward and the two
girls had undertaken with such temerity but marvelous success

Beth had quickly recovered from her weakness although Kenneth had
insisted on keeping her arm all the way home But the girl had been
silent and thoughtful and would eat nothing at dinner

When they had gathered in their room to talk it all over the lawyer
thought his young friends deserved a reproof

The money wasnt worth the risk you crazy lunatics he said

It wasnt the money at all replied Patsy demurely

No

It was the principle of the thing And wasnt Beth just wonderful
though

Shucks said Kenneth She had to go and faint like a ninny and she
cried all the way home because she had hurt the brigands finger

The girls eyes were still red but she answered the boys scornful
remark by saying gravely

I am sorry it had to be done Ill never touch a revolver again as long
as I live

Uncle John gathered his brave niece into an ample embrace

Im very proud of you my dear he said stroking her hair lovingly
and you mustnt pay any attention to that silly boy Ive always known
you were true blue Beth and now you have proved it to everyone It may
have been a reckless thing to do as Mr Watson says but you did it
like a major and saved our selfesteem as well as our money

Hurrah for Beth yelled the boy changing his colors without a blush

If you dont shut up Ill box your ears said his guardian sternly

Uncle John and young Ferralti were the heroes of the evening The little
old gentleman smoked a big cigar and beamed upon his nieces and friends
with intense satisfaction while Ferralti sat glum and silent beside
Louise until an abrupt challenge from Mr Merrick effectually aroused
him

Ive only one fault to find with this young man was the observation
referred to that he made our acquaintance under false pretenses When
a fairly decent fellow becomes an impostor there is usually reason for
it and I would like Count Ferraltior whatever his name isto give us
that reason and make a clean breast of his deception

Ferralti bowed with a serious face but looked significantly toward the
other members of the company

Whatever you have to say should be heard by all declared Uncle John
answering the look

Perhaps you are right Mr Merrick and all present are entitled to an
explanation answered the young man slowly I may have been foolish
but I believe I have done nothing that I need be ashamed of
Fortunately there is now no further reason for concealment on my part
and in listening to my explanation I hope you will be as considerate as
possible

They were attentive enough by this time and every eye was turned not
unkindly upon the youth who had so long been an enigma to them
allexcept perhaps to Louise

I am an American by birth and my name is Arthur Weldon

In the pause that followed Uncle John gave a soft whistle and Patsy
laughed outright to the undisguised indignation of Louise

Years ago resumed the youth my father who was a rich man made a
trip to Sicily and although I did not know this until recently was
seized by brigands and imprisoned in the hidden valley we have just
left There he fell in love with a beautiful girl who was the daughter
of the female brigand known as the Duchess of Alcanta and who assisted
him to escape and then married him It was a pretty romance at the time
but when my father had taken his bride home to New York and became
immersed in the details of his business his love grew cold and he began
to neglect his wife cruelly He became a railway president and amassed
a great fortune but was not so successful a husband as he was a
financier The result was that the Sicilian girl after some years of
unhappiness and suffering deserted him and returned to her own country
leaving her child then three years old behind her To be frank with
you it was said at the time that my mothers mind had become
unbalanced or she would not have abandoned me to the care of a loveless
father but I prefer to think that she had come to hate her husband so
bitterly that she could have no love for his child or else she feared
that her terrible mother would kill me if I came into her power Her
flight mattered little to my father except that it made him more stern
and tyrannical toward me He saw me very seldom and confided my
education to servants So I grew up practically unloved and uncared for
and when the proper time arrived I was sent to college My father now
gave me an ample allowance and at the close of my college career called
me into his office and ordered me to enter the employ of the railway
company I objected to this I did not like the business and had other
plans for my future But he was stubborn and dictatorial and when I
continued unsubmissive he threatened to cast me off entirely and leave
his fortune to charity since he had no other near relatives He must
have thought better of this decision afterward for he gave me a year to
decide whether or not I would obey him At the end of that time he
declared I would become either a pauper or his heir at my option

It was during this year that I formed the acquaintance of your niece
Miss Merrick and grew to love her devotedly Louise returned my
affection but her mother learning of my quarrel with my father
refused to sanction our engagement until I was acknowledged his heir I
was forbidden her house but naturally we met elsewhere and when I knew
she was going to Europe with you sir who had never seen me we hit
upon what we thought was a happy and innocent plan to avoid the long
separation I decided to go to Europe also and without you or your
other nieces suspecting my identity attach myself to your party and
enjoy the society of Louise while she remained abroad So I followed
you on the next ship and met you at Sorrento where I introduced myself
as Count Ferraltia name we had agreed I should assume before we parted
in America

The rest of my story you know My father was killed in an accident on
his own railroad and I received the news while we were prisoners of the
brigand whom I discovered to be my uncle but who had no mercy upon me
because of the relationship Tonight on my return here I found a
letter from my fathers attorney forwarded from my bankers in Paris
Through my fathers sudden death I have inherited all his wealth as he
had no time to alter his will Therefore Mrs Merricks objection to me
is now removed and Louise has never cared whether I had a penny or
not

He halted as if not knowing what more to say and the little group of
listeners remained quiet because it seemed that no remark from them was
necessary Young Weldon however was ill at ease and after hitching
nervously in his chair he addressed Uncle John in these words

Sir you are the young ladys guardian for the present as she is in
your charge I therefore ask your consent to our formal engagement

Not any said Uncle John decidedly Ill sanction no engagement of
any children on this trip You are wrong in supposing I am Louises
guardianIm just her chum and uncle Its like cradlesnatching to
want to marry a girl of sixteen and you ought to be ashamed of
yourself for you cant be much more than twentyone yourself While
Louise is in my care I wont have any entanglements of any sort so
youll have to wait till you get home and settle the business with her
mother

Very wise and proper sir said Mr Watson nodding gravely

Louises cheeks were flaming

Do you intend to drive Arthur away Uncle she asked

Why should I my dear except that youve both taken me for a blind old
idiot and tried to deceive me Let the boy stay with us if he wants
to but hell have to cut out all lovemaking and doubledealing from
this time onor Ill take you home in doublequick time

The young man seemed to resent the indictment

The deception seemed necessary at the time sir he said and you
must not forget the old adage that alls fair in love and war But I
beg that you will forgive us both and overlook our fault if fault it
was Hereafter it is our desire to be perfectly frank with you in all
things

That was a good way to disarm Uncle Johns anger and the result was
immediately apparent

Very good said the old gentleman if you are proper and obedient
children Ive no objection to your being together I rather like you
Arthur Weldon and most of your failings are due to the foolishness of
youth But youve got to acquire dignity now for you have suddenly
become a man of consequence in the world Dont think youve got to
marry every girl that attracts you by her pretty face This devotion to
Louise may be puppylove after all and

Oh Uncle came a chorus of protest

What you rascals are you encouraging this desperate folderol

You are too severe Uncle John said Patsy smiling The trouble with
you is that youve never been in love yourself

Never been in love He beamed upon the three girls with devotion
written all over his round jolly face

Then youre jealous said Kenneth Give the poor kids a fair show
Uncle John

All right I will Arthur my lad join our happy family as one of my
kidlets and love us allbut no one in particular Eh Until we get
home again you know Weve started out to have the time of our lives
and were getting it in chunkseh girls

We certainly are Uncle John Another chorus

Well what do you say Arthur Weldon

Perhaps you are right sir answered the young man And anyway I am
deeply grateful for your kindness I fear I must return home in a couple
of weeks to look after business matters but while I remain with you I
shall try to conduct myself as you wish

That sounds proper Is it satisfactory to you Louise

Yes Uncle

Then weve settled Cupidfor a time anyway And now my dears I
think we have all had enough of Taormina Where shall we go next




CHAPTER XXVII

TATO IS ADOPTED


They canvassed the subject of their future travels with considerable
earnestness Uncle John was bent upon getting to Rome and Venice and
from there to Paris and the nieces were willing to go anywhere he
preferred as they were sure to enjoy every day of their trip in the old
world But Mr Watson urged them strongly to visit Syracuse since they
were not likely to return to Sicily again and the most famous of all the
ancient historic capitals was only a few hours journey from Taormina
So it was finally decided to pass a week in Syracuse before returning to
the continent and preparations were at once begun for their departure

Kenneth pleaded for one more day in which to finish his picture of Etna
and this was allowed him Uncle John nevertheless confessed to being
uneasy as long as they remained on the scene of his recent exciting
experiences Mr Watson advised them all not to stray far from the
hotel as there was no certainty that Il Duca would not make another
attempt to entrap them or at least to be revenged for their escape from
his clutches

On the afternoon of the next day however they were startled by a call
from the Duke in person He was dressed in his usual faded velvet
costume and came to them leading by the hand a beautiful little girl

The nieces gazed at the child in astonishment

Tato wore a gray cloth gown illfitting and of coarse material but no
costume could destroy the fairylike perfection of her form or the
daintiness of her exquisite features With downcast eyes and a troubled
expression she stood modestly before them until Patsy caught her
rapturously in her arms and covered her face with kisses

You lovely lovely thing she cried Im so glad to see you again
Tato darling

The Dukes stern features softened He sighed heavily and accepted
Uncle Johns polite invitation to be seated

The little party of Americans was fairly astounded by this unexpected
visit Kenneth regretted that he had left his revolver upstairs but the
others remembered that the brigand would not dare to molest them in the
security of the hotel grounds and were more curious than afraid

Il Ducas hand was wrapped in a bandage but the damaged finger did not
seem to affect him seriously Beth could not take her eyes off this
dreadful evidence of her late conflict and stared at it as if the
bandage fascinated her

Signore said the Duke addressing Uncle John especially I owe to
you my apologies and my excuses for the annoyance I have caused to you
and your friends I have the explanation if you will so kindly permit
me

Fire away Duke was the response

Signore I unfortunately come of a race of brigands For centuries my
family has been lawless and it was natural that by education I too
should become a brigand In my youth my father was killed in an affray
and my mother took his place seizing many prisoners and exacting from
them ransom My mother you have seen and you know of her sudden madness
and of her death She was always mad I think and by nature a fiend
She urged my elder brother to wicked crimes and when he rebelled she
herself cast him in a fit of anger into the pit I became duke in his
place and did my mothers bidding because I feared to oppose her But
for years I have longed to abandon the life and have done with crime

With me our race ends for I have no sons But my one child whom you
know as Tato I love dearly My greatest wish is to see her happy The
last few days have changed the fortunes of us both The Duchessa is
gone and at last I am the master of my own fate As for Tato she has
been charmed by the young American signorini and longs to be like them
So we come to ask that you forgive the wrong we did you and that you
will now allow us to be your friends

Uncle John was amazed

You have decided to reform Duke he asked

Yes signore Not alone for Tatos sake but because I loathe the life
of brigandage See here is my thought At once I will disband my men
and send them away My household effects I will sell and then abandon
the valley forever Tato and I have some money enough to live in quiet
in some other land where we shall be unknown

A very good idea Duke

But from my respect for you Signer Merreek and from my daughters
love for your niecesthe brave and beautiful signoriniI shall dare to
ask from you a favor But already I am aware that we do not deserve it

What is it sir

That you take my Tato to keep for a few weeks until I can send away my
men and arrange my affairs here It would be unpleasant for the child
here and with you she will be so happy I would like the sweet
signorini to buy nice dresses like those they themselves wear for my
little girl and to teach her the good manners she could not gain as
the brigands daughter Tato has the money to pay for everything but the
kindness if you will let her stay in your society until I can claim
her I am aware that I ask too much but the Signorina Patsy has said to
my child that they would always be friends whatever might happen and
as I know you to be generous I have dared to come to you with this
request I only ask your friendship for my Tato who is innocent For
myself after I have become a good man then perhaps you will forgive
me too

Uncle John looked thoughtful the old lawyer was grave and listened
silently Patsy her arms still around the shrinking form of the child
looked pleadingly at her uncle Beths eyes were moist and Louise smiled
encouragingly

Well my dears The Duke is certainly not entitled to our friendship
as he truly says but I have nothing against little Tato What do you
advise

Let us keep her and dress her like the beautiful doll she is and love
her cried Patsy

She shall be our adopted cousin said Louise

Tato is good stuff declared Kenneth

Well Beth

It seems to me Uncle said the girl seriously that if the Duke
really wishes to reform we should give him a helping hand The little
girl has led a bad life only because her father forced her to lure his
victims and then procure the money for their ransoms but I am sure her
nature is sweet and pure and she is so young that she will soon forget
the evil things she has learned So I vote with my cousins Let us adopt
Tato and care for her until her father can introduce her into a new and
more proper life

Well argued Beth said Uncle John approvingly I couldnt have put
the case better myself What do you say Silas Watson

That you are all quite right answered the old lawyer And the best
part of the whole thing to me is the fact that this nest of brigands
will be wiped out of existence and Taormina be hereafter as safe for
tourists as old Elmhurst itself I wish I could say as much for the rest
of Sicily

Uncle John extended his hand to the Duke who took it gratefully
although with a shamefaced expression that was perhaps natural under the
circumstances

Look up dear said Patsy to the girl softly look up and kiss me
Youve been adopted Tato Are you glad




CHAPTER XXVIII

DREAMS AND DRESSMAKING


Tato was now one of the family They left Taormina the next day and
Frascatti drove all the girls in his victoria to the station

You must come again signorini said he looking regretful at their
departure Next year the fountain of the ice cream soda will be in
operation like those you have in Chicago which is America Our culture
increases with our civilization It is even hinted that Il Duca is to
abandon our island forever He has been interesting to us but not
popular and you will not miss him when you come again to find he is not
here If this time he has caused you an inconvenience I am sorry It is
regrettable but

But it is so said Patsy laughing

Tato was again transformed Patricia who was the smallest of the three
nieces though not especially slim had quickly altered one of her own
pretty white gowns to fit the child and as she was deft with her needle
and the others had enthusiastically assisted her Tato now looked more
like a fairy than ever

It was really wonderful what a suitable dress could do for the tiny
Sicilian maid She had lost her free and boyish manner and become shy
and retiring with strangers although when in the society of the three
nieces she was as sweet and frank as ever She wore her new gown
gracefully too as if well accustomed to feminine attire all her life
The only thing now needed as Patsy said was time in which to grow her
hair which had always been cut short in boyish fashion

They were a merry party when they boarded the train for Syracuse and
Uncle John arranged with the guard to secure two adjoining compartments
all to themselves that they might have plenty of room

Where did you put the money Uncle John Beth whispered when at last
they were whirling along and skirting the base of Mt Etna toward the
Catania side

Ive hidden it in my trunk he replied in the same confidential tone
There is no bank in this neighborhood to receive it so I decided to
carry it with us

But will it be safe in the trunk she enquired

Of course my dear Who would think of looking there for fifty thousand
dollars And no one knows we happen to have so much money with us

What did the CountI mean Mr Weldondo with his ransom

Carries it in his satchel so he can keep it with him and have an eye
on it Its a great mistake Beth to do such a thing as that Itll
make him uneasy every minute and he wont dare to let a facchino
handle his grip But in my case on the other hand I know its
somewhere in the baggage car so I dont have to worry

The journey was a delightful one The road skirted the coast through the
oldest and most picturesque part of Sicily and it amazed them to
observe that however far they travelled Etna was always apparently next
door and within reaching distance

At Aci Castello they were pointed out the seven Isles of the Cyclops
which the blind Polyphemus once hurled after the crafty Ulysses Then
they came to Catania which is the second largest city in Sicily but
has little of historic interest Here they were really at the nearest
point to the mighty volcano but did not realize it because it always
seemed to be near them Eighteen miles farther they passed Leontinoi
which in ancient days dared to rival Siracusa itself and an hour later
the train skirted the bay and Capo Santa Panagia and slowly came to a
halt in that city which for centuries dominated all the known world and
was more powerful and magnificent in its prime than Athens
itselfSyracuse

The day had become cloudy and gray and the wind whistled around them
with a chill sweep as they left their coach at the station and waited
for Kenneth to find carriages Afterward they had a mile to drive to
their hotel for instead of stopping in the modern town Uncle John had
telegraphed for rooms at the Villa Politi which is located in the
ancient Achradina at the edge of the Latomia de Cappuccini By the time
they arrived there they were blue with cold and were glad to seek the
warm rooms prepared for them and pass the remainder of the afternoon
unpacking and getting settled

Im afraid said Patsy dolefully that we shall miss the bright
sunshine and warmth of Taormina Tato

Oh it is not always warm there nor is it always cold here replied
the child Indeed signorina I have heard that the climate of Siracusa
is very delightful

It doesnt look it returned Patsy but it may improve

The interior of the hotel was comfortable though however bleak the
weather might be outside A good dinner put them all in a better humor
and they passed the evening watching the strangers assembled in the
parlors and wondering where they had come from and who they were

That money whispered Uncle John to Beth as he kissed her good
night is still as safe as can be Ive lost the key to my trunk and
now I cant even get at it myself

Lost it she exclaimed

Yes but that wont matter Its the big trunk that holds the things I
dont often use and if I cant unlock it no one else can thats
certain So I shall rest easy until I need something out of it and then
Ill get a locksmith to pick the lock

But I wish you hadnt lost the key said the girl thoughtfully

Strikes me its good luck Pleasant dreams my dear I can fancy Arthur
Weldon lying awake all night with his dreadful thirty thousand tucked
under his pillow Its a great mistake to carry so much money with you
Beth for youre sure to worry about it

The next morning when they came down to breakfast they were all amazed
at the gorgeous sunshine and the genial temperature that had followed
the dreary afternoon of their arrival Syracuse was transformed and
from every window of the hotel the brilliant glow of countless flowers
invited one to wander in the gardens which are surpassed by few if any
in the known world

The Villa Politi stood so near the edge of a monstrous quarry that it
seemed as if it might topple into the abyss at any moment Our friends
were on historic ground indeed for these quarriesor latomia as they
are calledsupplied all the stone of which the five cities of ancient
Syracuse were builtcities which in our age have nearly if not quite
passed out of existence The walls of the quarry are a hundred feet in
depth and at the bottom are now acres upon acres of the most delightful
gardens whose luxuriance is attributable to the fact that they are
shielded from the winds while the sun reaches them nearly all the day
There are gardens on the level above and beautiful ones too but these
in the deep latomia are the most fascinating

The girls could scarcely wait to finish breakfast before rushing out to
descend the flights of iron steps that lead to the bottom of the vast
excavation And presently they were standing on the ground below and
looking up at the vine covered cliffs that shut out all of the upper
world

It was peaceful here and soothing to tired nerves Through blooming
shrubbery and along quiet paths they might wander for hours and at
every step find something new to marvel at and to delight the senses

Here were ancient tombs cut from the solid rockone of them that of an
American midshipman who died in Syracuse and selected this impressive
and lovely vault for his burial place And there stood the famous statue
of Archimedes who used in life to wander in this very latomia

Once said Mr Watson musingly there were seven thousand Athenian
prisoners confined in this very place and allowed to perish through
starvation and disease The citizens of Syracuseeven the fine ladies
and the little childrenused to stand on the heights above and mock at
the victims of their kings cruelty

Couldnt they climb out asked Patsy shuddering at the thought that
some of the poor prisoners might have died on the very spot her feet
now trod

No dear And it is said the guards constantly patrolled the edge to
slay any who might venture to make the attempt

Wasnt it dreadful she exclaimed But Im glad they have made a
flower garden of it now Somehow it reminds me of a cemetery

But there were other interesting sights to be seen at Syracuse and they
laid out a systematic programme of the places they would visit each
morning while they remained there The afternoons were supposed to be
reserved for rest but the girls were so eager to supply Tato with a
fitting wardrobe that they at once began to devote the afternoons to
shopping and dressmaking

The child had placed in Uncle Johns keeping a liberally supplied purse
which the Duke wished to be applied to the purchase of whatever his
daughter might need or desire

He wants me to dress as you do said Tato simply and because you
will know what is fitting my station and will be required in my future
life he has burdened you with my society It was selfish in my father
was it not But butI wanted so much to be with youbecause you are
good to me

And were mighty glad to have you with us answered Patsy Its no
end of fun getting a girl a whole new outfit from top to toe and
aside from that we already love you as if you were our little sister

Beth and Louise equally endorsed this statement and indeed the child
was so sweet and pretty and so grateful for the least kindness bestowed
upon her that it was a pleasure to assist and counsel her

Tato looked even smaller in girls clothing than in boys and she
improved so rapidly in her manners by constantly watching the nieces
that it was hard to imagine she had until now been all unused to polite
society Already they began to dread the day when her father would come
to claim her and the girls and Uncle John had conceived a clever plan
to induce the Duke to let his daughter travel with them on the continent
and then go for a brief visit to them in America

By that time declared Louise Tatos education will be
accomplished and she will be as refined and ladylike as any girl of her
age we know Blood will tell they say and the monk who taught her must
have been an intelligent and careful man

She knows more of history and languages than all the rest of us put
together added Beth

And having adopted her we mustnt do the thing by halves concluded
Patsy so our darling little brigandess must tease her papa to let her
stay with us as long as possible

Tato smiled and blushed with pleasure It was very delightful to know
she had such enthusiastic friends But she was afraid the Duke would not
like to spare her for so long a time as a visit to America would
require

You leave him to me said Uncle John Ill argue the case clearly and
logically and after that he will have to cave in gracefully

Meantime the dainty gowns and pretty costumes were one by one finished
and sent to the hotel and the girls ransacked the rather inadequate
shops of Syracuse for the smartest things in lingerie that could be
procured As they were determined to try everything on and see how
their protg looked in her finery Tato was now obliged to dress for
dinner and on every other possible occasion and she not only astonished
her friends by her loveliness but drew the eye of every stranger as
surely as the magnet attracts the needle

Even in Sicily where the Greek type of beauty today exists more
perfectly than in Helene there were few to compare with Tato and it
was only natural that the Americans should be very proud of her

Kenneth was sketching a bit of the quarry and the old monastery beyond
it with the blue sea glimmering in the distance Sometimes he would
join the others in their morning trips to the catacombs the cathedrals
or the museum but the afternoons he devoted to his picture and the
others came to the gardens with him and sat themselves down to sew or
read beside his easel

Arthur Weldon was behaving very well indeed and although a good deal of
the credit belonged to Louise who managed him with rare diplomatic
ability Uncle John grew to like the young man better each day and had
no fault whatever to find with him

He was still rather silent and reserved but that seemed a part of his
nature inherited doubtless from his father and when he chose to talk
his conversation was interesting and agreeable

Kenneth claimed that Arthur had a bad habit of making googoo eyes at
Louise but the young mans manner was always courteous and judicious
when addressing her and he managed to conceal his love with admirable
discretionat least when others were present

Uncle Johns private opinion confided in secret to his friend Mr
Watson was that Louise really might do worse that is if they were
both of the same mind when they grew up

And so the days passed pleasantly away and the time for their departure
from Syracuse drew near

On the last morning all of themwith the exception of Tato who pleaded
a headachedrove to the Latomia del Paradiso to see the celebrated Ear
of Dionysiusthat vast cavern through which the tyrant is said to
have overheard every whisper uttered by the prisoners who were confined
in that quarry There is a little room at the top of the cliff also
built from the rock where it is claimed Dionysius sat and played
eavesdropper and it is true that one in that place can hear the
slightest sound uttered in the chamber below

Afterward the amphitheatre and the ancient street of the tombs were paid
a final visit with a stop at San Giovanni where St Paul once
preached And at noon the tourists returned to the hotel hungry but
enthusiastic in time for the tabledhote luncheon




CHAPTER XXIX

TATO WINS


This is funny cried Patsy appearing before Uncle John with a white
and startled face I cant find Tato anywhere

And her new trunk is gone from her room as well as her gowns and
everything she owns continued Beths clear voice over her cousins
shoulder

Uncle John stared at them bewildered Then an expression of anxiety
crept over his kindly face

Are you sure he asked

There cant be a mistake Uncle Shes just gone

None of you has offended or annoyed the child I suppose

Oh no Uncle She kissed us all very sweetly when we left her this
morning

I cant understand it

Nor can we

Could her father have come for her do you think suggested Mr
Merrick after a moments thought

I cant imagine her so ungrateful as to leave us without a word said
Patsy I know Tato well Uncle and the dear child would not hurt our
feelings for the world She loves us dearly

But shes a queer thing added Louise and I dont trust her
altogether Sometimes Ive surprised a look in her eyes that wasnt as
innocent and demure as she would have us imagine her

Oh Louise

And theres another reason

What is it

She reformed too suddenly

Uncle John slapped his forehead a mighty blow as a suspicious and
dreadful thought flashed across his mind But next instant he drew a
long breath and smiled again

It was lucky I lost that key to the trunk he observed still a little
ashamed of his temporary lack of confidence in Tato Its been locked
ever since we left Taormina so the child couldnt be tempted by that

She wouldnt touch your money for the world said Patsy indignantly
Tato is no thief

She comes of a race of thieves though Beth reminded her

I wonder if Arthurs money is still safe remarked Louise following
the line of thought suggested

As if with one accord they moved down the hall to the door of the young
mans room

Are you in Arthur asked Uncle John knocking briskly

Yes sir

He opened his door at once and saw with surprise the little group of
anxious faces outside

Is your money safe asked Uncle John

Weldon gave them a startled glance and then ran to his dresser and
pulled open a drawer After a moments fumbling he turned with a smile

All safe sir

Uncle John and his nieces were visibly relieved

You see continued Arthur Ive invented a clever hidingplace
because the satchel could not be left alone and I didnt wish to lug it
with me every step I took So I placed the packages of bills inside the
leg of a pair of trousers and put them in a drawer with some other
clothing at top and bottom A dozen people might rummage in that drawer
without suspecting the fact that money is hidden there Ive come to
believe the place is as good as a bank but you startled me for a
minute with your question Whats wrong

Tatos gone

Gone

Departed bag and baggage

But your fifty thousand sir Is it safe

It has to be answered Uncle John It is in a steelbound
doublelocked trunk to which Ive lost the key No bank can beat that
my boy

Then why did the child run away

They could not answer that

Its a mystery said Patsy almost ready to weep But Ill bet its
that cruel wicked father of hers Perhaps he came while we were out and
wouldnt wait a minute

What does the hall porter say asked Kenneth who had joined the group
in time to overhear the last speech and guess what had happened

Stupid cried Uncle John We never thought of the hallporter Come
back to our sitting room and well have him up in a jiffy

The portiere answered his bell with alacrity The Americans were liberal
guests

The young lady Ah she had driven away soon after they had themselves
gone A thinfaced darkeyed man had called for her and taken her away
placing her baggage on the box of the carriage Yes she had paid her
bill and tipped the servants liberally

Just as I suspected cried Patsy That horrid duke has forced her to
leave us Perhaps he was jealous and feared we would want to keep her
always Was she weeping and miserable porter

No signorina She laughed and was very merry Andbut I had
forgotten There is a letter which she left for the Signorina DOyle

Where

In the office I will bring it at once

He ran away and quickly returned placing a rather bulky parcel in the
girls hands

You read it Uncle John she said There cant be anything private in
Tatos letter and perhaps she has explained everything

He put on his glasses and then took the missive and deliberately opened
it Tato wrote a fine delicate hand and although the English words
were badly spelled she expressed herself quite well in the foreign
tongue With the spelling and lack of punctuation corrected her letter
was as follows

Dear innocent foolish Patsy How astonished you will be to find I
have vanished from your life forever and what angry and indignant words
you will hurl after poor Tato But they will not reach me because you
will not know in which direction to send them and I will not care
whether you are angry or not

You have been good to me Patsy and I really love youfully as much
as I have fear of that shrewd and pretty cousin of yours whose cold
eyes have made me tremble more than once But tell Beth I forgive her
because she is the only clever one of the lot of you Louise thinks she
is clever but her actions remind me of the juggler who explained his
tricks before he did them so that the audience would know how skillful
he was

But oh Patsy what simpletons you all are And because you have been
too stupid to guess the truth I must bother to write it all down For it
would spoil much of my satisfaction and enjoyment if you did not know
how completely I have fooled you

You tricked us that day in the mountain glen and for the first time an
Alcanta brigand lost his prisoners and his ransom money through being
outwitted But did you think that was the end If so you failed to
appreciate us

Look you my dear we could have done without the money for our family
has been robbing and accumulating for ages with little need to expend
much from year to year It is all in the Bank of Italy too and drawing
the interest for my father is a wise man of business That four hundred
thousand lira was to have been our last ransom and after we had fairly
earned it you tricked us and did not pay

So my father and I determined to get even with you as much through
revenge as cupidity We were obliged to desert the valley at once
because we were getting so rich that the government officials became
uneasy and warned us to go or be arrested So we consulted together and
decided upon our little plot which was so simple that it has worked
perfectly We came to you with our sad story and you thought we had
reformed and kindly adopted me as one of your party It was so easy
that I almost laughed in your foolish faces But I didnt for I can
act I played the child very nicely I think and you quite forgot I was
a brigands daughter with the wild free blood of many brave outlaws
coursing in my veins Ah I am more proud of that than of my acting

Innocent as I seemed I watched you all carefully and knew from
almost the first hour where the money had been put I stole the key to
Uncle Johns trunk on the train while we were going from Taormina to
Syracuse but I did not take the money from it because I had no better
place to keep it and the only danger was that he would force the lock
some day But Ferraltis moneyI call him Ferralti because it is a
prettier name than Weldonbothered me for a long time At the first he
would not let that little satchel out of his sight and when he finally
did he had removed the money to some other place I searched his room
many times but could not find his hiding place until last night While
he was at dinner I discovered the bills in one of the drawers of his
dresser

But for this difficulty I should have left your charming society
before as my father has been secretly waiting for me for three days
Having located Ferraltis money I waited until this morning and when you
had all left me I signalled to my father from my window and prepared to
disappear It took but a few minutes to get the money from Uncle Johns
trunk and Arthurs trouserleg Much obliged for it Im sure Then I
packed up all my pretty dresses in my new trunkfor part of our plot
was to use your good taste in fitting me out properlyand now I am
writing this loving epistle before I leave

We shall go to Paris or Vienna or Cairo or Londonguess which We
shall have other namesvery beautiful onesand be rich and dignified
and respected When I grow older I think I shall marry a prince and
become a princess but that will not interest you much for you will not
know that the great princess is your own little Tato

Tell Uncle John I have left the key to his trunk on the mantel behind
the picture of the madonna I stuffed papers into Arthurs trouser leg
to deceive him if he came back before I had a chance to escape But I
hoped you would discover nothing until you read this letter for I
wanted to surprise you Have I Then I am content You tricked me once
but I have tricked you at the last and the final triumph is mine

In spite of all Patsy dear I love you for you are sweet and good
and although I would not be like you for the world I can appreciate your
excellent qualities Remember this when your anger is gone I wont be
able to visit you in America but I shall always think of you in a more
kindly way than I fear you will think of the Sicilian tomboy TATO




CHAPTER XXX

A WAY TO FORGET


The faces of the group as Uncle John finished reading were worth
studying Arthur Weldon was white with anger and his eyes blazed Silas
Watson stared blankly at his old friend wondering if it was because he
was growing old that he had been so easily hoodwinked by this saucy
child Beth was biting her lip to keep back the tears of humiliation
that longed to trickle down her cheeks Louise frowned because she
remembered the hard things Tato had said of her Patsy was softly crying
at the loss of her friend

Then Kenneth laughed and the sound sent a nervous shiver through the
group

Tatos a brick announced the boy audaciously Cant you see you
stupids that the thing is a good joke on us all Or are you too thin
skinned to laugh at your own expense

Oh we can laugh responded Uncle John gravely But if Tatos a
brick its because she is hard and insensible The loss of the money
doesnt hurt me but to think the wicked little lass made me love her
when she didnt deserve it is the hardest blow I have ever received

That made Patsy sob outright while Louise ejaculated with scorn The
little wretch

It serves us right for having confidence in a child reared to crime and
murder from the cradle said Arthur rather savagely I dont know how
much money I am worth but Id gladly spend another thirty thousand to
bring this wretched creature to justice

Money wont do it declared the lawyer shaking his head regretfully
The rascals are too clever to be caught in Europe It would be
different at home

Well the best thing to do is to grin and bear it and forget the
unpleasant incident as soon as possible said Uncle John I feel as if
Id had my pocket picked by my best friend but it isnt nearly as
disgraceful as being obliged to assist the thief by paying ransom
money The loss amounts to nothing to either of us and such treachery
thank goodness is rare in the world We cant afford to let the thing
make us unhappy my friends so cheer up all of you and dont dwell
upon it any more than you can help

They left Syracuse a rather solemn group in spite of this wise advice
and journeyed back to Naples and thence to Rome There was much to see
here and they saw it so energetically that when they boarded the train
for Florence they were all fagged out and could remember nothing clearly
except the Coliseum and the Baths of Carracalla

Florence was just now a bower of roses and very beautiful But Kenneth
lugged them to the galleries day after day until Uncle John declared he
hated to look an old master in the face

After all theyre only daubs he declared Any tenyearold boy in
America can paint better pictures

Dont let anyone hear you say that dear cautioned Patsy Theyd
think you dont know good art

But I do he protested If any of those pictures by old masters was
used in a streetcar ad at home it would be money wasted for no one
would look at them The people wouldnt stand for it a minute

They are wonderful for the age in which they were painted said
Kenneth soberly You must remember that we have had centuries in which
to improve our art since then

Oh Ive a proper respect for old age I hope replied Uncle John
but to fall down and worship a thing because its grayhaired and
outofdate isnt just my style All of these Ohs and Ahs over
the old masters are rank humbug and Im ashamed of the people that
dont know better

And now Arthur Weldon was obliged to bid goodbye to Louise and her
friends and take a train directly to Paris to catch the steamer for
home His attorney advised him that business demanded his immediate
presence and he was obliged to return however reluctantly

Kenneth and Mr Watson also left the party at Florence as the boy
artist wished to remain there for a time to study the pictures that
Uncle John so bitterly denounced The others went on to Venice which
naturally proved to the nieces one of the most delightful places they
had yet seen Mr Merrick loved it because he could ride in a gondola
and rest his stubby legs which had become weary with tramping through
galleries and cathedrals These last monuments by the way had grown to
become a sort of nightmare to the little gentleman The girls were
enthusiastic over cathedrals and allowed none to escape a visit For a
time Uncle John had borne up bravely but the day of rebellion was soon
coming

No cathedrals in Venice I hope he had said on their arrival

Oh yes dear the loveliest one in the world St Marks is here you
know

But no St Pauls or St Peters

No Uncle Theres the Saluta and the

Never mind Well do that first one and then quit What they build so
many churches for I cant imagine Nobody goes to em but tourists that
I can see

He developed a streak of extravagance in Venice and purchased Venetian
lace and Venetian glassware to such an extent that the nieces had to
assure him they were all supplied with enough to last them and their
friends for all time to come Major Doyle had asked for a meerschaum
pipe and a Florentine leather pocket book so Uncle John made a
collection of thirtyseven pipes of all shapes and sizes and bought so
many pocketbooks that Patsy declared her father could use a different
one every day in the month

But theyre handy things to have said her uncle and we may not get
to Europe again in a hurry

This was his excuse for purchasing many things and it was only by
reminding him of the duty he would have to pay in New York that the
girls could induce him to desist

This customs tax worried the old gentleman at times Before this trip he
had always believed in a protective tariff but now he referred to the
United States customs as a species of brigandage worse than that of Il
Duca himself

They stopped at Milan to visit the great cathedral and then raced
through Switzerland and made a dash from Luzerne to Paris

Thank heaven said Uncle John there are no cathedrals in gay Paree
at any rate

Oh yes there are they assured him We must see Notre Dame anyway
and there are a dozen other famous cathedrals

Here is where Uncle John balked

See here my dears he announced Not a cathedral will I visit from
this time on You can take a guide and go by yourselves if you feel you
cant let any get away from you Go and find another of Mike Angelos
last work every church has got one For my part Ive always been
religiously inclined but Ive been to church enough lately to last me
the rest of my natural life and Ive fully determined not to darken the
doors of another cathedral again Theyre like circuses anyhow when
youve seen one youve seen em all

No argument would induce him to abandon this position so the girls
accepted his proposal and visited their beloved cathedrals in charge of
a guide whose well of information was practically inexhaustible if not
remarkable for its clarity

The opera suited Uncle John better and he freely revelled in the shops
purchasing the most useless and preposterous things in spite of that
growing bugbear of the customs duties

But finally this joyous holiday came to an end as all good things will
and they sailed from Cherbourg for New York

Uncle John had six extra trunks Patsy carried a French poodle that was
as much trouble as an infant in arms and Louise engineered several
hatboxes that could not be packed at the last minute But the girls
embarked gay and rosycheeked and animated and in spite of all the
excitement and pleasure that had attended their trip not one of the
party was really sorry when the return voyage began




CHAPTER XXXI

SAFE HOME


To me said Uncle John as he stood on the deck and pointed proudly to
the statue of Liberty in New York harbor that is the prettiest sight
Ive seen since I left home

Prettier than the old masters Uncle asked Patsy mischievously

Yes or the cathedrals he retorted

When they reached the dock there was the Major waiting to receive Patsy
in a new checked suit with a big flower in his buttonhole and a broad
smile on his jolly face

And there was Mrs Merrick too with Arthur Weldon beside her which
proved to Louise that he had succeeded in making his peace with her
mother Also there were the sternfeatured customhouse officials in
their uniforms and the sight of them sent the cold chills flying down
Uncle Johns spine

There was no one present to receive Beth but her uncle tucked her arm
underneath his own with a proud gesture and kept her close beside him
For the girl had quite won his loving old heart on this trip and she
seemed to him more mature and far sweeter than when they had left home

But the greetings and the brigandage were soon over and in good time
they were all assembled in the Doyle flat where the joyous Major had
prepared an elaborate dinner to celebrate the return of the wanderers

Weve a million pipes and pocketbooks for you daddy whispered
Patsy hugging him for the twentieth time and Ive got a thousand
things to tell you about our adventures in strange lands

Save em till were alone said the Major theyre too good to waste
on a crowd

Mr Merrick was placed at the head of the table to make a speech It was
brief and to the point

I promised these young ladies to give them time of their lives he
said Did I do it girls

And in a lively chorus they answered

You did Uncle John
